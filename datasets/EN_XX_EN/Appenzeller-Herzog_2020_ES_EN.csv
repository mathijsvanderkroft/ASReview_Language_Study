1,"Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b methanobactin binding selectivity for copper(I), silver(I), zinc(II), nickel(II), cobalt(II), manganese(II), lead(II), and iron(II)","Methanobactin (Mb) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a member of a class of metal-binding peptides identified in methanotrophic bacteria. Mb will selectively bind and reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), and is believed to mediate the acquisition of the copper cofactor for the enzyme methane monooxygenase. These copper-chelating properties of Mb make it potentially useful as a chelating agent for the treatment of diseases in which copper plays a role, including Wilson's disease, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Using traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS), the competition for the copper binding site Mb from Ag(I), Pb(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Mn(II) , Ni(II), and Zn(II) have been determined by a series of metal ion titrations, pH titrations, and metal ion displacement titrations. TWIMS analyzes allowed the explicit identification and quantification of all individual Mb species present during the titrations and measured their collision cross-sections and collision-induced dissociation patterns. The results showed that Ag(I) and Ni(II) could irreversibly bind to Mb and not be effectively displaced by Cu(I), while Ag(I) could also partially displace Cu(I) from the Mb complex. = 6.5, the Mb binding selectivity follows the order Ag(I)=Cu(I)>Ni(II)=Zn(II)>Co(II)>>Mn(II)=Pb(II)> Fe(II), and at pH 7.5 to 10.4 the order is Ag(I)>Cu(I)>Ni(II)>Co(II)>Zn(II)>Mn(II)=Pb(II )>Fe(II) ). The decomposition curves of the disulfide-reduced Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes showed that there was a correlation between their relative stability and their close folded structure indicated by their CCS. Fluorescence spectroscopy, which allowed determination of the binding constant, compared well with TWIMS analyses, with the exception of the Ni(II) complex. Graphically Abstract .",,"McCabe, J.

2,Characteristics and prevalence of Wilson's disease: a 2013 observational population-based study in France,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Few epidemiological studies of the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) have been conducted to date, and results vary widely depending on reports. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, outpatient care, and treatments of WD patients in France. METHODS: Among the 58 million beneficiaries of the general health regime (86% of the French population), people managed by ET in 2013 were identified by diagnosis of hospitalization in 2011-2013 or specific long-term disease status with a reimbursement 100% for specific healthcare in 2013. Data derived from Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). Prevalence was calculated by age and sex. RESULTS: In 2013, 906 prevalent cases were identified, yielding a gross prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 in men and 1.44 per 100,000 in women. This prevalence is comparable to that reported in other population-based studies in European countries and to a study that used a similar method. Almost 40% of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc acetate. Trientine, compassionate release, was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients underwent liver transplantation and 4% had already undergone liver transplantation in previous years. Fifteen percent of patients received antidepressants, a higher rate than in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population based on administrative data and constitutes an important step in understanding the impact of WD and studying quality of care.",,"Poujois, A.;Woimant, F.;Samson, S.;Chaine, P.;Girardot-Tinant, N.;Tuppin, P.",2017,2022-06-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2017.05.011,0,1,
3,Treatment Modality and Potential Outcome of Wilson's Disease in Taiwan: A Population-Based Longitudinal Study,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, medication preference, and potential outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Our goal was to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson's disease based on the data generated from this study. METHODS: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records for nearly 99% of Taiwan residents. The database used is a random sample of two million of Taiwan's 23 million NHIRD beneficiaries in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected between 2000 and 2011. Subjects with Wilson's disease were identified such as those with international disease. Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and specific prescription drugs (including d-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in inpatient or outpatient records. RESULTS: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male:female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was established mainly at 20-24 and 10-14 years, followed by 25-29 years. Fifty-four of all subjects (81.8%) started treatment with d-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation for liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: D-penicillamine remains the most popular prescription for Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a potential favorable outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study. Copyright Â© 2017. Published by Elsevier BV",,"Tai, C. S.;Wu, J.

4,"The early history of manganese and the recognition of its neurotoxicity, 1837-1936","The history of biomedical recognition of manganese neurotoxicity reflects changing technologies as well as the ontology of parkinsonism. The initial 1837 report of manganese-induced neurological injury was by John Couper, a Scottish university physician. He clarified that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach factory near Glasgow. The relatively new technology of chlorine generation using manganese accounted for the new exposure involved. At the time, this factory was the largest producer of hypochlorite bleaching powder in the world. As the 19th century progressed, technological change in steelmaking requiring higher manganese content greatly increased the demand for the metal. However, more than six decades elapsed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity emerged. Two unrelated outbreaks (both in continental Europe) were reported within weeks of each other in 1901, one by von Jaksch and the other by Embden. All cabinets were heavily exposed to dust containing manganese. On the eve of World War I, a total of 9 patients with neurological diseases caused by manganese had been reported in five separate publications from continental Europe. Meanwhile, new technology led to another source of exposure. Magnetic separation techniques allowed the extraction of zinc from mixed ores that also contained iron and manganese, leading to the exploitation of a unique source of high-manganese ores found in New Jersey. Not long after the introduction of that technology, in 1912 Casamajor reported the first cases of manganism in the US, detailing classic findings. Additional cases from the same cohort were reported a few years later, with continued exposure fueled by World War I-driven demand for manganese for use in weaponry. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity remained in flux, with considerable emphasis on shared attributes with Wilson's disease, a newly described syndrome at the time. A landmark study of primates in 1924 by Mella showed manganese-induced basal ganglia damage; Human autopsy study data in subsequent years further supported the view that manganese toxicity represented a Parkinsonian syndrome. As the 1937 centennial of Couper's first report approached, newer technologies (electric arc welding and battery manufacturing) were being linked to illnesses caused by manganese, even as mineral extraction was expanding as a global source. of exposition.

5,Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Few studies of zinc monotherapy for presymptomatic Wilson's disease have focused on young children. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for these children and established benchmarks for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively and prospectively examined children younger than 10 years with presymptomatic Wilson's disease who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met the entry criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly from 1 month after the start of treatment and generally remained below 50 U/L from 1 to 8 years of treatment. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and generally remained below 75 microg/day and between 1 and 3 microg/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc and none became symptomatic. In patients under 6 years of age who received 50 mg/day of zinc as the initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly one month after starting treatment, as did gamma-glutamyltransferase and 24-hour urine copper. the 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease. Such monotherapy proved to be highly effective and safe. Maintaining normal transaminase values (or less than 50 U/L when normalization is difficult) and a 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 microg/kg/day and below 75 microg/day is a reasonable goal. An initial dose of 50 mg/day is suitable for patients under 6 years of age. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

6,[Elastosis perforans serpiginosa and Wilson's disease: a rare but predictable consequence of long-term therapy with D-penicillamine],"Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is a rare perforating dermatosis found mainly in adolescents and young adults, characterized by transepidermal shedding of abnormal elastic fibers. The only known drug capable of inducing elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is D-penicillamine. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman with keratotic papules arranged in an annular pattern with central clearing and centrifugal growth, located in the anterior cervical region. The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Biopsy of the lesion showed transepidermal removal of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-shaped elastic fibers. The clinicopathological findings were compatible with elastosis perfurans serpiginosa secondary to D-penicillamine. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is estimated to occur in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. By directly or indirectly blocking desmosine cross-links between elastin molecules, D-penicillamine leads to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa may be the first manifestation of a multisystemic degenerative process of the elastic connective tissue.",,"Castro Pinho, A.;Cardoso, J.

7,Combination therapy with chelating agent and zinc for Wilson's disease,"There is no clear international consensus on the optimal pharmacological treatment for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). This study systematically reviews the effectiveness of several commonly used drug therapies, focusing specifically on preliminary findings related to the combination of a chelating agent and zinc. A systematic search of PubMed was performed to locate original studies on the effectiveness of commonly used medications for WD published between January 1989 and August 2014. The results were used to conduct a systematic review of studies on combination therapies. A total of 17 combination therapy studies involving 1056 patients were reviewed. These were analyzed in terms of data on effectiveness, adverse effects and mortality. The results of a pooled analysis indicate that combination therapies for liver patients were significantly less effective than the same therapies for neurological manifestations (47.1% vs 78.6%; pooled relative risk (RR): 0.63, CI 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.94, p = 0.02). Data from a subgroup analysis show that penicillamine plus zinc sulfate combination therapy resulted in a significantly higher mortality rate compared to all other types of combination therapy (16.3% vs 4.7%; RR: 3 .51, 95% CI: 1.54-8.00, p < 0.001). The use of combination therapies involving zinc and a chelator should be carefully monitored with close clinical observations and frequent biochemical testing, especially for patients with WD with hepatic manifestations.",,"Chen, J.

8,Long-term effects of a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc salts in the treatment of Wilson's disease in children.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a combination of high-dose zinc sulfate and low-dose D-penicillamine in the treatment of pediatric Wilson's disease (WD). A retrospective chart review of 65 WD patients was performed. These patients received D-penicillamine (8-10 mg/kg/day) and zinc sulfate as primary treatment. The pediatric dose of elemental zinc is 68-85 mg/day up to 6 years, 85-136 mg/day up to 8 years, 136-170 mg/day up to 10 years, and then 170 mg/day, in 3 doses. divided 1 h before meals. After clinical and biochemical improvement or stabilization, zinc sulfate was administered alone as maintenance therapy. Under treatment, most patients (89.2%) had a favorable evolution and 3 patients died due to poor compliance with therapy. No penicillamine-induced neurological impairment was observed, and side effects were observed in <11% of patients throughout the follow-up period. Beneficial results for liver and neurological symptoms have been reported after extremely long-term treatment with a combination of low-dose D-penicillamine and high-dose zinc sulfate. Therefore, this regimen is an effective and safe treatment for children with WD.",,"Chang, H.;Xu, A.;Chen, Z.;Zhang, Y.;Tian, F.;Li, T.",2013,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2013.971,0,0,
9,Brain delivery of zinc ions as a potential treatment for neurological diseases: Mini review,"Homeostasis of metal ions such as Zn(2+) is essential for proper brain function. In addition, the list of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders involving dysregulation of brain levels of Zn(2+) is long and constantly growing, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, as well as schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, and hyperactivity, depression, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down syndrome. syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Wilson's disease and Pick's disease. In addition, alterations in Zn(2+) levels are seen in transient forebrain ischemia, seizures, traumatic brain injury, and alcoholism. Therefore, the possibility of altering Zn(2+) levels within the brain is emerging as a new target for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Although the role of Zn(2+) in the brain has been extensively studied during the last decades, methods for the controlled regulation and manipulation of Zn(2+) concentrations within the brain are still in their infancy. Since the use of Zn(2+) supplementation and dietary restrictions has significant limitations, new methods and alternative approaches are currently being investigated, such as the use of intracranial infusion of Zn(2+) chelators or nanoparticle technologies to elevate or decrease intracellular Zn. (2+) levels. Therefore, this review briefly summarizes the role of Zn(2+) in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the key findings and impediments of manipulating the level of Zn(2+) in the brain. In addition, some methods and compounds are evaluated, such as metal ion chelation, redistribution and supplementation that are used to control brain levels of Zn(2+) to treat brain disorders.",,"Grabrucker, A.

10,Copper dyshomeostasis in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as shown by serum and urine copper indicators,"Abnormal handling of copper is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare disorder characterized by elevated levels of plasma copper not bound to ceruloplasmin (nCp-Cu, also known as ""free"" copper). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analyses show that copper is decreased in brain but increased in serum, due to an increase in the nCp Cu component. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been carried out. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu, and Cu:Cp in 385 CE and 336 previously investigated healthy controls who were compared with 9 newly diagnosed WD patients. We then evaluated 24-hour urinary copper excretion in 24 WD patients treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) and in 35 healthy controls, and compared the results with those of AD patients who participated in a clinical trial of phase II with D-pen previously published. After adjusting for sex and age, serum Cu-nCp and Cu:Cp were higher in AD and WD than in healthy controls (both p<0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p<0.016). The 24-h urine copper excretion in patients with AD (12.05 Âµg/day) was higher than in healthy controls (4.82 Âµg/day; p<0.001). 77.8% of AD patients treated with D-pen had a 24-hour urinary excretion greater than 200 ug/day, suggesting failure of copper control. This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of copper homeostasis in AD, showing a failure to control copper and the Cu:Cp ratio as an eligible marker.",,"Squitti, R.;Ghidoni, R.;Simonelli, I.;Ivanova, I.

11,Information about the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism, in which the causative gene, ATP7B, results in absent or reduced function of the ATP7B transporter important for biliary copper excretion and copper incorporation in ceruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excess copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. A disease primarily of children, adolescents, and young adults; clinical features range from the asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical tests, liver copper content analysis, and ATP7B gene mutation analysis; To date, there are more than 500 ATP7B mutations in patients with Wilson's disease. Early recognition and treatment can result in an excellent prognosis, while untreated disease is almost always fatal. Pharmacological therapies include chelating agents, such as penicillamine or trientine, and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is curative by correcting the underlying pathophysiology and is traditionally indicated in acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease refractory to medical therapy.

13,"Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate in patients with Wilson's disease: an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study.","BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues. Therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple daily doses. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (WTX101) is a first-in-class oral copper protein-binding molecule that targets hepatic intracellular copper and reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increasing biliary excretion of copper. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in the initial or early treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We did this open-label phase 2 study at 11 hospitals in the US and Europe. We included patients (>=18 years) with Wilson's disease who were untreated or who had not received more than 24 months of chelation or zinc therapy, had a Leipzig score of 4 or more, and had NCC concentrations above the cutoff. lower than normal. reference range (>=0.8 mumol/L). Eligible patients received WTX101 monotherapy at a starting dose of 15-60 mg/day based on baseline NCC concentrations for the first 4-8 weeks, with response-guided individualized dosing for the remaining weeks through week 24. Researchers, other hospital staff, and patients knew the identity of the treatment. The primary endpoint was change in baseline concentrations of NCC corrected for copper in tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes (NCC<sub>corrected</sub>) at 24 weeks, and treatment success was defined as such as achieving or maintaining normalized<sub>corrected< /sub> NCC (<=2.3 mumol/L [upper limit of normal]) or achieving at least a 25% reduction in NCC<sub> corrected</sub> from baseline to 24 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02273596. FINDINGS: Between November 24, 2014 and April 27, 2016, 28 patients were enrolled and received WTX101; 22 (79%) patients completed the study through week 24. At 24 weeks, 20 (71%, 95% CI 51.3-86.8; p<0.0001) of 28 patients met study success criteria. treatment: 16 (57%) treated with WTX101 achieved or maintained normalized NCC<sub>corrected</sub> concentrations and 4 (14%) had at least a 25% reduction from baseline in NCC<sub> corrected</sub>. Mean <sub>corrected</sub> NCC was reduced by 72% from baseline to week 24 (least squares mean difference -2.4 mumol/L [SE 0.4], 95% CI : -3.2 to -1.6, p<0.0001). No cases of drug-related paradoxical neurological worsening were recorded. Liver function was stable in all patients, although reversible increases in asymptomatic levels of alanine or aspartate aminotransferase, or gamma-glutamyltransferase, without increases in bilirubin, occurred in 11 (39%) of 28 patients who received at least 30 mg/day. There were 11 serious adverse events reported in seven (25%) patients and included psychiatric disorders (six events in four patients), gait disturbance (one event), elevated liver aminotransferases (two events in two patients, one with agranulocytosis), and decreased of neurological functioning (an event, probably due to the natural progression of the disease, although causality could not be ruled out). The seven serious adverse events classified as psychiatric disorders and gait disturbances were assessed as unlikely to be related to study drug, while the remaining four events were possibly or probably related. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that WTX101 could be a promising new therapeutic approach for Wilson's disease, with a unique mode of action. In view of its once-daily dosing and favorable safety profile, WTX101 could improve the treatment of patients with this debilitating condition. FUNDING: Wilson Therapeutics AB.",,"Weiss, K.

15,Bioavailable trace metals in neurological diseases,"OPINION STATEMENT: Medical treatment for Wilson's disease includes chelating agents (D-penicillamine and trientine) or zinc salts that must be maintained for life. This pharmacological treatment is categorized into two phases; the first being a decoppering phase and the second a maintenance phase. The best therapeutic approach remains controversial as only a few uncontrolled trials have compared these treatments. During the initial phase, the progressive increase in the doses of binders adjusted to exchangeable copper and urinary copper could help prevent neurological deterioration. Liver transplantation is indicated in fulminant acute liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis; in cases of neurological deterioration, it should be discussed individually. During the maintenance phase, the most important challenge is to achieve good adherence to lifelong medical treatment. Neurodegenerative diseases that lead to poor iron localization can be caused by the culmination of localized overload (pro-oxidant siderosis) and localized deficiency (metabolic malaise). A new iron-sparing chelation therapeutic concept rescues iron-overloaded neurons by removing labile iron and, by delivering this chelated metal to endogenous apotransferrin, allows iron redistribution to prevent systemic iron loss.",,"Poujois, A.;Devedjian, J.

16,Early onset of Wilson's disease: diagnostic challenges,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of patients aged <=5 years with early-onset Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: Data from 143 pediatric WD patients treated at our center between January 1996 and November 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A review of 143 pediatric WD patients identified 21 (10 girls, 11 boys) with early symptoms or abnormal liver function test results at age <= 5 years. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed in 8 patients under 5 years of age. At baseline, mean serum alanine aminotransferase level was 222 U/L and mean serum aspartate aminotransferase level was 130 U/L. The mean serum concentration of ceruloplasmin in 16 patients evaluated was <20 mg/dL. Of the 15 patients who underwent urinary copper excretion tests, 8 had levels between 40 and 100 ug/day, and only 4 had levels > 100 ug/day. Liver copper quantification was >250 Âµg/g dry weight in 16 patients. The most frequent mutation was p.H1069Q, with compound heterozygosity in 5 patients and homozygosity in 9. Sixteen patients were treated with zinc salts and 5 with D-penicillamine. Both treatments were effective and no serious side effects were seen after 3 to 24 months.

17,Wilson's disease: prospective developments towards new therapies,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. A clear demand for new treatment strategies for WD has emerged. Although therapies using zinc salts and copper chelators can effectively cure WD, these medications show limitations in a substantial group of WD patients who develop intolerance and/or serious side effects. Several lines of research have indicated intriguing potential for new strategies and targets for the development of new therapies. Here, we review these new approaches, which comprise the correction of ATP7B mutants and the discovery of novel compounds that bypass ATP7B deficiency, as well as cell and gene therapies. We also discuss if and when these new therapeutic strategies will translate to clinical use, based on key requirements for clinical trials that remain to be met. Finally, we discuss the hope that the current rapidly developing research on the molecular mechanisms underlying WD pathogenesis and related potential therapeutic targets will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of WD therapies that may lead to an effective cure. , tolerable and safe.",,"Ranucci, G.;Polishchuck, R.;Iorio, R.",2017,2014-08-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i30.5451,0,0,
18,Dietary supplement implicated in fulminant liver failure in a patient with well-controlled Wilson's disease,"We found a patient with previously well-controlled Wilson's disease who experienced fulminant liver failure with hemolytic anemia, possibly caused by the dietary supplement Health Proportion () (Jubilant Co., Ltd., Ehime, Japan). A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with marked liver dysfunction and severe hemolytic anemia. Free serum copper level rose to 101 ug/dl and urinary copper excretion increased considerably (25,600 ug/day). Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were performed to remove serum copper and treat hemolytic anemia. However, liver function did not improve and he underwent liver transplantation on day 28 after admission. The copper and iron content in the resected liver was high, 851.9 Âµg and 551.7 Âµg/liver dry weight (g), respectively, despite the fact that the patient had taken D-penicillamine regularly since diagnosis and had a well-controlled copper level 1 year prior to admission. Two months before admission, the patient had taken a soy-based dietary supplement for 1 month. This supplement was labeled as containing large amounts of copper and iron, and we assume that this caused fulminant hepatic failure with hemolytic crisis in this patient. It is important to consider the micronutrient content of dietary supplements, especially for patients with metabolic disorders.",,"Kawai, K.;Atarashi, Y.;Takahara, T.;Kudo, H.;Tajiri, K.;Tokimitsu, Y.;Nakayama, Y.;Hirano, K.;Yata, Y.;Minemura, M.;Yasumura, S.;Onishi, Y.;Tsukada, K.;Tsuneyama, K.;Takano, Y.;Sugiyama, T.",2009,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12328-008-0056-6,0,0,
19,Chemosensitivity of U251 cells to D-penicillamine and copper co-treatment: possible implications in patients with Wilson's disease,"D-penicillamine (PA), a copper chelator and one of the recommended drugs for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD), has been reported to worsen symptoms in patients with neurological presentations. However, the cause of this paradoxical response has not been fully elucidated and requires further investigation. Consequently, we have studied the in vitro effect of copper (Cu) and/or PA treatment on U251 human glioblastoma cells as an in vitro model of Cu cytotoxicity. Treatment of U251 cells with Cu or PA had no significant effect on their morphology, viability, or ROS level. In contrast, co-treatment with Cu-PA caused decreased viability, altered expression of glutathione and ceruloplasmin along with a marked increase in ROS; depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential; and an increase in the Sub G0 phase; along with alpha-fodrin proteolysis. These findings, together with the absence of LDH release in these assays, suggest that combined Cu-PA exposure induced apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, the previous or joint treatment with antioxidants showed a protective effect, with catalase being more effective than N-acetylcysteine or trolox to restore viability and reduce the levels of ROS generated. In comparison, a similar analysis with other cell lines showed that rat PC12 cells were resistant to treatment with Cu and/or PA, while the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was sensitive to either compound alone, which resulted in a lower viability and a higher level of ROS. Taken together, this study shows that U251 glioblastoma cells provide a model for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated Cu-PA cytotoxicity. We postulate that oxidation of PA in the presence of Cu produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which in turn permeates the plasma membrane and induces apoptosis. However, other cell lines exhibited different responses to these treatments, which could provide a model for cell-type-specific cytotoxic responses in the nervous system. Therefore, the sensitivity of different neural and glial cell types to Cu-PA treatment may underlie the neurological worsening that occurs in some WD patients treated with PA. Our results also raise the possibility that side effects of PA treatment may be reduced or prevented by administration of antioxidants.",,"Katerji, M.;Barada, K.;Jomaa, M.;Kobeissy, F.;Makkawi, A.

20,Is a high serum copper concentration a risk factor for implantation failure?,"BACKGROUND: Copper-containing contraceptive devices can deposit copper ions in the endometrium, resulting in implantation failure. Deposition of copper ions in many organs has been reported in patients with untreated Wilson's disease. Since these patients sometimes present with subfertility and/or premature pregnancy loss, copper ions were also considered to accumulate in the uterine endometrium. Wilson's disease patients treated with zinc delivered successfully because zinc interfered with copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings led to the hypothesis that infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations may have implantation failure due to excessive accumulation of copper ions. The relationship between implantation (pregnancy) rates and serum copper concentrations has not yet been examined. The Japanese government recently stated that the actual intake of copper among the Japanese was higher than necessary. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum copper concentrations are related to implantation (pregnancy) rates of human embryos in vivo. METHODS: We included 269 patients (age < 40 years) who underwent single embryo transfer with vitrification and warming with a cycle of hormone replacement using good blastocysts (3BB or greater by Gardner's classification). Serum concentrations of hCG, copper, and zinc were measured 16 days after the first date of progesterone replacement. We compared 96 women who were pregnant without miscarriage at 10 weeks' gestation (P group) and 173 women who were not pregnant (NP group). RESULTS: No significant differences in age or BMI were observed between the groups. Copper concentrations were significantly higher in the NP group (mean 193.2 Âµg/dL) than in the P group (mean 178.1 Âµg/dL). Based on the area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting clinical pregnancy rates, the Cu/Zn ratio (AUC 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.71 ) was a better predictor than copper or zinc. When we set the cutoff point at 1.59/1.60 for the Cu/Zn ratio, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.98, 0.29, 0.71, and 0. .88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-center retrospective study suggests that high serum copper concentrations (high Cu/Zn ratio) are a risk factor for implantation failure.",,"Matsubayashi, H.;Kitaya, K.;Yamaguchi, K.;Nishiyama, R.;Takaya, Y.;Ishikawa, T.",2017,2010-08-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-017-2708-4,0,0,

22,Inherited disorders of transition metal metabolism: an update,"Elements with a biological role include six trace transition metals: manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, and molybdenum. Transition metals participate in group transfer reactions such as glycosylation and phosphorylation and those that can transfer an electron by alternating between two redox states such as iron (3+/2+) and copper (2+/1+) they are also very important in biology. Redox reactions including molecular oxygen reduction and oxygen transport. However, these trace metals are also potentially toxic and generate reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry. Recently, the role of trace metals in host defense (""nutritional immunity"") has been recognized. The host can deprive the pathogen of a trace metal or poison it with a toxic concentration. Disorders that lead to low concentrations of a trace metal can often be treated by supplementing that metal; disorders that lead to excessively high concentrations can often be treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine and edetate calcium disodium. This update will address: i) manganese/zinc transporters (because two new treatable disorders were described in 2016: SLC39A8 deficiency and SLC39A14 deficiency); ii) copper transporter disorders because we need to improve the treatment of patients with neurological symptoms due to Wilson's disease; and iii) iron homeostasis because recent advances in iron metabolism and regulation research help us better understand several inborn errors that affect these pathways.",,"Clayton, P.

23,Childhood Wilson's disease: perspective from Bangladesh,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects copper metabolism and causes copper-induced damage to various organs. In children, the liver is often affected. The central nervous system, eyes, red blood cells, kidneys, brain, and bones may also be affected. The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical and laboratory profile of Wilson's disease in children. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2011 to December 2013. One hundred consecutive WD children between 3 and 18 years of age. were evaluated for clinical and biochemical profile. The mean age of the children studied was 8.5+/-1.5 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Ninety-one percent of the patients were Muslim and nine percent Hindu. The consanguinity of the marriage was found in 30% of the cases. Seven parents were first cousins. Family history of chronic liver disease was present in 15% of patients. The majority (53%) of the cases of hepatic WD occurred between 5 and 10 years of age, and the majority of neurological WD occurred in the 10- to 15-year age group. Among 100 WD patients, 69 children had only hepatic manifestations, 6 had only neurological manifestations, 14 had both hepatic and neurological manifestations, 10 children were asymptomatic, and 1 patient had psychiatric features. WD presented as chronic liver disease (CLD) in 42%, CLD with portal hypertension in 34%, acute hepatitis in 20%, and fulminant liver failure in 4% of cases. Stigmata of chronic liver disease were found in 18% of patients. The most frequent stigmata were thenar and hypothenar atrophy (n=8). The Keizer-Fleischser ring (KF ring) was found in 76% of all patients. The KF ring was present in 84% (58 of 69) of liver-only Wilsonian patients and 90% (18 of 20) of all Wilsonian neurological patients. Asymptomatic and psychiatric patient without KF ring. About 26% of WD patients had PBF-negative Coombs hemolytic anemia. Most of the patients with WD had impaired liver function. Elevated serum transaminases were found in 85% of all cases, prolonged prothrombin time in 59% cases, and low serum albumin in 53% cases. Seventy-three percent of patients had low serum ceruloplasmin, baseline urinary copper of >100 Âµg/day was found in 81% of cases, and urinary copper after penicillamine challenge of >1200 Âµg/day was found in 92% of cases. In 28 cases with hepatic presentation, esophageal varices were identified by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. WD patients with hepatic presentations were given zinc sulfate together with penicillamine. All patients with neurological manifestations, as well as asymptomatic cases, were maintained with zinc treatment. WD is a treatable metabolic cause of liver disease. Most of the children with WD studied presented hepatic manifestations, of which 76% presented CLD.

24,"Sip-1 mutations cause alterations in NMDA and AMPA activity, but not in kainate receptors on neurons in the cerebral cortex.","Smad-interacting protein 1 (Sip1) [zinc finger homeobox (Zfhx1b), Zeb2] is a transcription factor implicated in the genesis of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) in humans. MWS is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by a mutation in the Sip1 gene (also known as Zeb2 or Zfhx1b) assigned to the 2q22.3 locus. MWS affects 1 in 50-100 newborns worldwide. It is characterized by mental retardation, short stature, typical facial anomalies, as well as alterations in the development of the cardiovascular and renal systems, as well as some other organs. Sip1 mutations cause abnormal neurogenesis in the brain during development, as well as susceptibility to epileptic seizures. In the current study, we investigated the role of the Sip1 gene in the activity of NMDA, AMPA and KA receptors. We show that a particular Sip1 mutation in the mouse causes changes in NMDA and AMPA receptor activity in neocortical neurons in vitro. We show that neocortical neurons that have only one copy of Sip1 (heterozygous, Sip1<sup>fI/wt</sup>), are more sensitive to NMDA and AMPA receptor agonists compared to wild-type neurons (Sip1 <sup>weight/weight</sup>). This is reflected in higher amplitudes of agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, as well as a lower mean maximum effective concentration (IEC50). In contrast, neurons from Sip1 homozygous mice (Sip1<sup>fI/fI</sup>), demonstrate greater resistance to these respective receptor agonists. This is reflected in lower amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and therefore a higher concentration of receptor activators is required for activation.

25,New perspectives on the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder that causes liver and neurological symptoms. Commonly used medical therapy shows satisfactory results regarding liver disease, but only limited effects in neurologically affected patients. Several new therapeutic options have been developed in recent years, showing promising results that could improve the treatment of Wilson's disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens based on biochemical response pattern appears to be worthwhile, especially in the copper removal phase of therapy. Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) chelator is a promising therapeutic option, currently under clinical investigation. TTM is a very potent, fast-acting chelator and appears to be associated with early neurological deterioration after initiation of therapy to a lesser extent than currently used drugs. Treatment with non-chelating drugs characterized by alternative modes of action is being investigated, but to date is limited to animal or in vitro studies. This includes basic research studies that demonstrate proof of principle for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson's disease to restore sufficient biliary excretion of copper, even before disease onset.

26,Symptomatic treatment of neurological symptoms in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a potentially treatable neurodegenerative disorder. In most cases, treatment with drugs that induce negative copper balance (usually chelators or zinc salts) leads to improvements in liver function and neurological signs. However, some patients show severe neurological symptoms at the time of diagnosis, such as tremors, dystonia, parkinsonism, and chorea. In this group of patients, some neurological deficits may persist despite adequate treatment and further neurological deterioration may be observed after initiation of treatment. Such patients may require additional treatment to relieve neurological symptoms. Other than general recommendations for anticopper treatment of WD, there are currently no guidelines for the management of neurological symptoms in WD. The objective of this chapter is to summarize the possible treatments of neurological symptoms in WD based on the currently available medical literature.

27,Wilson's disease: currently used anti-copper therapy,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that can be successfully treated with pharmacological treatment. Two groups of drugs are currently in use: chelators (eg, d-penicillamine and trientine), which increase urinary copper excretion, and zinc salts, which inhibit copper absorption from the GI tract. The mechanisms of action lead to a negative balance of copper, stopping the pathological accumulation of copper in the tissues and eliminating the copper overload of the affected organs. Due to the lack of prospective clinical trials, the use of drugs depends mainly on the experience of the center and the accessibility in different countries or regions. This chapter presents the different reports and recommendations on the treatment of WD. In addition to the different expert opinions on pharmacological agents, there are some axioms regarding the treatment of WD: treatment should begin immediately after diagnosis, even in clinically presymptomatic cases; the patient must receive treatment for life, therefore compliance is a key factor for the success of the treatment; and treatment should be regularly monitored through hepatic and hematological examinations, neurological examination, and copper metabolism, modifying treatment accordingly. Other drugs proposed for the treatment of WD (eg, tetrathiomolybdate) are in clinical trials and lack current recommendations. Therefore, only currently available options for the pharmacological treatment of WD are reviewed.

28,Wilson's disease in children,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder primarily of hepatocellular copper disposal, due to dysfunction of Wilson's ATPase, a P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPase encoded by the ATP7B gene. In children, as in older age groups, the clinical disease is very diverse. Although liver disease is the common presentation in children/adolescents, clinical neurologic, psychiatric, and hematologic presentations occur. Very young children may have clinically evident liver disease due to WD. Early diagnosis, preferably when the child/adolescent is asymptomatic, is more likely to result in near-normal longevity in good general health, provided the patient tolerates effective medication, adheres to the lifelong treatment regimen, and has constant access to medication. . In addition to a vivid index of clinical suspicion by clinicians, biochemical tests including liver tests, serum ceruloplasmin, and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion and genotyping are key to diagnosis. Oral chelation therapy remains essential for medical management, although zinc appears to be an attractive option for the presymptomatic child. Pediatric patients with fulminant Wilsonian liver failure should be differentiated from those with decompensated cirrhosis, as the latter may respond to intensive medical interventions and not require liver transplantation.

Wilson. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the magnetic nanoparticles have been functionalized with TETA during the synthesis process, and the concentration of TETA is crucial for the formation of monodisperse mesoporous nanoparticles. The obtained monocrystalline magnetic nanoparticles have a high magnetization, which improves their response to the external magnetic field and, therefore, should greatly facilitate the handling of the particles in practical uses. The reaction parameters affecting the formation of the mesoporous structure were explored, and a possible formation mechanism involving templated aggregation and recrystallization processes was proposed. The ability of the synthesized amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles to remove Cu(II) from aqueous solution was investigated. The Cu(II) adsorption rate on amine functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles followed a pseudo second order kinetic model. The results of this study demonstrated that amine-functionalized mesoporous superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles could be used as an efficient adsorbent in water treatment and would also find potential application for Cu(II) removal in vivo.

33,Fast and reliable diagnosis of Wilson's disease using X-ray fluorescence,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the gene that encodes the copper transporter ATP7B. Diagnosis is hampered by the variability of symptoms induced by copper accumulation, the inconstancy of pathognomonic signs, and the absence of a reliable diagnostic test. We investigated the diagnostic potential of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) which enables quantitative analysis of multiple elements. Studies were performed in animal models using Wistar rats (n=10) and Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats (n=11), and in human samples including normal livers (n=10), alcoholic cirrhosis (n=8) , hemochromatosis (n=10), cholestasis (n=6) and WE (n=22). XRF experiments were first performed using synchrotron radiation to address elemental composition at the cellular level. High-resolution mapping of tissue sections allowed measurement of the intensity and distribution of copper, iron, and zinc while preserving morphology. Further investigations were carried out using a laboratory X-ray source to irradiate entire pieces of tissue. The sensitivity of XRF was highlighted by discrimination of LEC wild-type rats even under a regimen using copper-deficient feeds. XRF on whole formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded needle biopsies allowed elements to be profiled within a few minutes. The intensity of copper relative to iron and zinc significantly discriminated WD from other chronic or genetic liver diseases with a specificity of 97.6% and a sensitivity of 100%. This study established a definitive diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on XRF. This fast and versatile method can be easily implemented in a clinical setting.",,"Kascakova, S.;Kewish, C.

The diagnosis of Wilson's disease and its ongoing follow-up is challenging when associated with underlying kidney disease, such as Alport syndrome. Proteinuria can lead to low levels of ceruloplasmin, as it is among the serum proteins that are inappropriately filtered by the damaged glomerulus, and can also lead to increased urinary loss of heavy metals such as zinc and copper. Elevated transaminases can be attributed to drug-induced dyslipidemia or hepatotoxicity. Accurate diagnosis of Wilson's disease is essential for targeted therapy and a better prognosis.

35,Metallo-pathways to Alzheimer's disease: lessons from genetic copper trafficking disorders,"Copper is an essential metal ion that provides catalytic function to numerous enzymes and also regulates neurotransmission and intracellular signalling. Conversely, a deficiency or excess of copper can cause chronic diseases in humans. Menkes and Wilson diseases are two rare inherited disorders of copper transport characterized by copper deficiency and copper overload, respectively. Changes in copper status are also a common feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the case of AD, which is characterized by copper depletion in the brain, changes in copper distribution have been linked to various aspects of the disease process; protein aggregation, defective protein degradation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although AD is a multifactorial disease that is likely due to failure of multiple cellular pathways, copper and other metal ions, such as iron and zinc, play a central role in many of these cellular processes. Pioneering work by investigators studying relatively rare copper transport diseases has shed light on potential metal ion-related disease mechanisms in other forms of neurodegeneration such as AD.",,"Greenough, M.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 38 patients with WD who were treated with sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) and zinc (group 1) or zinc alone (group 2). All patients had a history of neurological deterioration during their previous treatment with D-penicillamine (DPA). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated with intravenous DMPS for 4 weeks, followed by zinc gluconate for 6 months, and the treatment protocol was repeated twice. Relative to baseline, repeated DMPS therapy and zinc maintenance therapy decreased neurological scores continuously (p < 0.01). Sixteen patients (76.2%) demonstrated neurological improvement after 1 year of therapy and four patients (19.0%) exhibited neurological deterioration at the follow-up session. Additionally, 17 patients were treated with zinc monotherapy for 12 months. Two patients (11.8%) demonstrated neurological improvements and five patients (29.4%) exhibited neurological deterioration. Compared with group 2 patients, a higher rate of improvement (p < 0.01) and a lower rate of deterioration (p < 0.01) were observed in group 1 patients after 1 year of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the safety and efficacy of combined DMPS and zinc therapy is superior to zinc monotherapy in patients with neurological WD with a history of DPA treatment failure.",,"Chen, D.;Zhou, X.;Hou, H.;Feng, L.;Liu, J.;Liang, Y.;Lin, X.;Zhang, J.;Wu, C.;Liang, X.;Pei, Z.;Li, X.",2016,Jul,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1756285616641598,0,0,
37,Pregnancy outcome after chelation therapy in Wilson's disease. Evaluation of the German Embryotox database,"Continued treatment is recommended for pregnant women with Wilson's disease.

In this case series, we report the outcome of 20 pregnancies with maternal exposure to the chelator during at least the first trimester. Of these 20 pregnancies documented by the German Embryotox Project, 14 were determined prospectively and 6 were retrospective. No major birth defects were noted. Three of the 14 possible cases resulted in miscarriage and one pregnancy was electively terminated. Our results do not support the hypothesis of teratogenicity based on previous case reports of congenital anomalies. Therefore, our study may help reassure women who need chelation therapy during pregnancy.

38,Patient with primary biliary cirrhosis accompanied by Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: Both primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and Wilson's disease (WD) can cause copper retention in the liver, which is an important factor for liver cell damage. Copper chelation can preserve liver cell function. It is difficult to distinguish WD from copper accumulation in patients with PBC. There have been few case reports of co-occurrence of PBC with WD. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of PBC with WD in a 55-year-old Chinese man. In addition to the typical pathological features of PBC and a large number of copper deposits in the liver, the patient had mutations in the WD ATP7B gene.

40,Controversies and variation in the diagnosis and treatment of children with Wilson's disease: results of an international survey.,"OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings where evidence-based approaches are limited. The objectives of the present study were to describe the consensus and variability in the approaches adopted by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson's disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International Internet-based case-focused survey of pediatric hepatologists. The survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and aimed to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 physicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used the guidelines published in their respective regions. Although there was consensus on first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants disagreed on how much hepatic copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 Âµg/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, while 25% considered >50 Âµg/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of clinicians perform genetic testing on all suspected cases and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; Forty-seven percent opted to be listed for transplant, followed by follow-up using a disease severity score, and then transplanted only when the score reached a critical cutoff. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of physicians chose zinc. Most reported using chelation to treat patients with liver dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as their primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in caring for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may cause variations. However, unwarranted variation can also contribute to differences in outcomes and should be targeted to improve quality of care.",,"Sturm, E.;Piersma, F. E.;Tanner, M. S.;Socha, P.;Roberts, E.

42,Wilson's disease: a review of what we have learned,"Wilson's disease (WD), resulting from the defective ATP7B protein product, is characterized by impaired copper metabolism and its clinical consequences range from an asymptomatic state to fulminant liver failure, chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, neurological and psychiatric manifestations . A high degree of suspicion is warranted so as not to miss cases of WD, especially less florid cases with mild transaminase elevations or isolated neuropsychiatric involvement. Screening in first and second relatives of index cases is mandatory, and treatment should begin once the diagnosis is established. Treatment strategies include chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine, while zinc salts act as metallothionein inducers, which favor a negative copper balance and a reduction in free plasma copper. Being an orphan disease, there is a lack of research in this field, especially regarding therapeutic strategies that are associated with better patient compliance and that could eventually also reverse the established lesion.",,"Rodriguez-Castro, K.

45,"Zebrafish in the sea of mineral metabolism (iron, zinc and copper)","Iron, copper, zinc, and eight other minerals are classified as essential trace elements because they occur in minute amounts in vivo and are essential for life. Because excessive or insufficient levels of trace elements can be detrimental to life (causing human diseases such as iron deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, Menkes syndrome, and Wilson's disease), endogenous trace element levels must be strictly regulated. Many studies have shown the existence of systems that maintain trace element homeostasis, and these systems are highly conserved across multiple species ranging from yeast to mice. As a model for studying trace mineral metabolism, the zebrafish is indispensable to researchers. Several large-scale mutagenesis screens have been performed in zebrafish, and these screens led to the identification of a number of metal transporters and the generation of several mutagenesis lines, providing in-depth functional analysis at the system level. Additionally, due to its developmental advantages, zebrafish have also been used in toxicology studies and chemical screens related to mineral metabolism. Here, we systematically review the main findings of trace element homeostasis studies using the zebrafish model, with a focus on iron, zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and iodine. We also provide a homology analysis of trace mineral transporters in fish, mice, and humans. Finally, we discuss the evidence that zebrafish is an ideal experimental tool to discover new mechanisms of trace mineral metabolism and to improve approaches to treat diseases related to mineral imbalance.",,"Zhao, L.;Xia, Z.;Wang, F.",2014,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2014.00033,0,0,
46,A review and current perspective on Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism and may be more common where consanguinity prevails. Much has been known about the disease after Kinnier Wilson first described it as ""progressive lenticular degeneration"" in 1912. More than 500 mutations of the ATP7B gene have been identified with no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype. Loss of ATP7B function leads to various degrees of reduced biliary excretion of copper and reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin; the accumulation and toxicity of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues results in liver toxicity and myriad other disease manifestations. Clinical features can range from an asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hemolytic anemia. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical features, histologic findings, and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene. There are subtle geographic differences with a disproportionate proportion of children presenting with acute liver failure. A high index of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis. Biochemical indices ratios for early diagnosis need validation in all geographic regions and may not be particularly applicable in children. Better biomarkers or the need for tests for the early detection of ALF persists. Medications used in the treatment of Wilson's disease include copper chelating agents such as d-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc salt. Untreated Wilson's disease uniformly leads to death from liver disease or severe neurological disability. Early recognition and treatment has an excellent prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute liver failure and end-stage liver disease. Family screening is warranted to detect the disorder in first-degree relatives. This review provides an overview of the different aspects of Wilson's disease, including geographic differences in presentations and clinical management, and limitations of currently available evidence.",,"Patil, M.;Sheth, K.

47,Biometals in rare neurodegenerative disorders of childhood,"Copper, iron and zinc are just three of the main biometals critical for the proper functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). They have diverse roles in many functional processes, including but not limited to enzyme catalysis, protein stabilization, and energy production. The range of metal concentrations within the body is tightly regulated and when the balance is disturbed, debilitating effects occur. Brain biometal homeostasis is primarily controlled by various metal transporters and metal-sequestering proteins. The biological functions of biometals are extensively reviewed in the literature with a large focus on the connection to neurological conditions associated with aging. Biometals are also implicated in a variety of debilitating inherited childhood disorders, some of which emerge shortly after birth or as the child progresses into early adulthood. This review acts to highlight what we know about biometals in childhood neurological disorders such as Wilson's disease (WD), Menkes disease (MD), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), and iron-accumulating neurodegeneration in the brain ( NBIA). Some of the animal models available to determine the pathological mechanisms in these childhood disorders are also analyzed, which we hope will help to understand the role of biometals in the disease and to arrive at possible treatments in the future.",,"Parker, S.

Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, has varied presentations. We present a case of refractory rickets due to Fanconi syndrome attributable to Wilson's disease. An adolescent girl presented with pain in her hip and knee joints and a knee deformity since she was six years old. He had received multiple doses of cholecalciferol with little improvement. There was no family history of seizures, polyuria, jaundice, medication intake, or the like. Examination revealed severe short stature with widening of the wrist joint and genu valgum. The central nervous system (CNS) examination was normal. Skeletal radiographs showed features suggestive of rickets in the hip and knee joints. Routine biochemistry was normal, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was adequate (57.1 ng/dl), normal corrected calcium (9.24 mg/dl), low phosphate (2.76 mg /dl), elevated bone-specific alkaline levels. phosphatase and normal renal functions. Twenty-four-hour urine revealed phosphaturia, kaliuresis, and glycosuria with normal blood sugar levels and aminoaciduria. Blood gas analysis revealed normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a urinary pH of 7. Ammonium chloride (NH4CL) challenge revealed proximal tubular acidosis. A search for causes revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed by low serum ceruloplasmin levels (6.5 mg/dL; normal: 18-35 mg/dL) with high 24-hour urine copper levels (433 mcg; normal: 20-50). mcg).

52,Penicillamine neurotoxicity: a hypothesis,"Penicillamine, dimethylcysteine, and thiovaline remain the drugs of choice for treating patients with Wilson's disease. It is also of value in the treatment of cysteinuria and rheumatoid arthritis. It has also been suggested to be of value in the treatment of other rare diseases. It also has multiple toxicities. Most of these can be explained as chemical toxicity, for example its weak antipyridoxine action and its ability to interfere with lysyloxide, leading to skin lesions. More important is its ability to induce immune reactions such as SLE, immune complex nephritis, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, and Goodpasture syndrome. However, the sudden increase in neurological signs that can occur in a small number of patients remains unexplained. It is theorized that this is due to lethal synthesis. In susceptible patients, the SH moiety is released from penicillamine and will inhibit SH-dependent enzymes in the Krebs cycle, leading to neuron death. Other toxic metabolites such as methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan may also be produced, either of which could produce a similar metabolic block.",,"Walshe, J.

Evidence-Based Medicine: After synthesizing the best available clinical evidence, I conclude that oral zinc therapy is a conscious choice for the treatment of free copper toxicosis in individual patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hypothesis 1: Age-related free copper toxicosis is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There are 2 neurodegenerative diseases with abnormalities in copper metabolism: (a) the juvenile form with degeneration in the basal ganglia (Wilson's disease) and (b) the age-related form with cortical neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease). Initially, the hypothesis has been that neurodegeneration was caused by accumulation of copper in the brain, but subsequent experiences with the treatment of Wilson's disease led to the conviction that free plasma copper is the toxic form of copper: it catalyzes the formation of amyloid, thus generating oxidative stress, free radicals. and degeneration of cortical neurons. Hypothesis 2: Oral zinc therapy is an effective and safe treatment of free copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease. Proposed dose: 50 mg elemental zinc/day. Warning: Chelation therapy is unreasonable and dangerous in the treatment of copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease.",,"Hoogenraad, T. U.",2011,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4061/2011/492686,0,0,

When presenting with psychiatric symptoms alone, or with extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to neuroleptic exposure, the diagnosis of underlying Wilson's disease may be missed. METHODS: An 18-year-old boy presented to the psychiatric clinic with a manic syndrome and a high propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms to neuroleptics. Initial examination revealed splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Subsequent detection of the Kayser-Fleischer ring and typical biochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. RESULTS: Although psychiatric symptoms were controlled with lithium carbonate, extrapyramidal symptoms continue to persist even after discontinuation of the neuroleptic. Pancytopenia believed to be due to hypersplenism persists, and the patient has developed features of liver cirrhosis. Treatment with zinc and folic acid has been started and is being evaluated for treatment with penicillamine. CONCLUSION: The psychiatrist must recognize that Wilson's disease may rarely present with isolated psychiatric symptoms, including mania.

RECENT FINDINGS: For Wilson's disease, there are new insights into the structure and function of the responsible protein, ATP7B, and the importance of its proper cellular localization in hepatocytes. Other new information on the additional use of zinc for the initial treatment of this disease for asymptomatic patients, and the initial use of tetrathiomolybdate for neurologically affected patients will change our future approach to the treatment of patients with this disorder. New guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have also been established. New data have also improved our understanding of hemochromatosis and iron overload disorders. This year's highlights include the discovery of a new gene involved in iron metabolism, hemojuvelin, and new data on the role of HFE mutations in the development of iron overload. Other data suggest that altered regulation of the peptide hepcidin may play a critical role in the development of the iron overload phenotype in patients with hemochromatosis. For alpha-one antitrypsin, new information is being collected on the incidence of the disease in African populations and the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of the disease continues to be explored.

METHODS: WD patients with different types and conditions (n = 20), non-WD patients with chronic liver damage (n = 22), and healthy volunteers (n = 10; used as controls) were studied. Bile duct samples were taken through duodenal drainage. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to analyze the copper and zinc content of each sample. RESULTS: In WD, the copper content and copper/zinc ratio of bile juice were evidently lower than those of non-WD patients with chronic liver damage and healthy controls (F = 14.76, 25.4; 14.92, 26.2 respectively; P < 0.01), while biliary zinc level was not significantly different from the two control groups without WD (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in biliary copper excretion between patients with different types and conditions (F = 3.75, P < 0.05; F = 6.20, P < 0.01).

62,Zinc salts block hepatitis E virus replication by inhibiting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes self-limited acute hepatitis in healthy individuals and leads to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women has a more severe outcome, with a mortality rate as high as 30%. Although the virus generally causes sporadic infections, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-poor countries. There is no specific antiviral against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by some viruses. Here, we investigate the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a cell culture model of human hepatoma (Huh7), zinc salts inhibited replication of HEV genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 replicons and infectious HEV g-1 genomic RNA in a manner dose dependent. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility that zinc salts act in replication-independent processes. An infection model based on the g-1 HEV cell line ORF4-Huh7 further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on g-1 HEV entry into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies reveal the ability of zinc salts to inhibit HEV replication, suggesting their potential therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hepatitis E virus (HEV ) is a public health problem in countries with few resources due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health problem in developed countries due to its ability to cause acute and chronic infections in organ transplants and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat cases of HEV, side effects and limitations of such therapy are known. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit viral RdRp activity is important because these findings pave the way for testing the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in infected patients. with HEV. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy people and since high doses of zinc are used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, health problems associated with HEV can be managed by following a treatment regimen.

Our results showed that mycorrhizal colonization (MC), hyphal length density (HLD), GRSP, soil organic matter (SOM), and soil organic carbon (SOC) were significantly inhibited by Pb compared to Zn. at 0-20 cm soil depth, indicating that HM had significant inhibitory effects on AMF growth and soil properties, and that Pb exhibited greater toxicity than Zn in the topsoil. Both the proportion of large soil macroaggregates (>2000 mm) and the mean diameter weight (MWD) were positively correlated with GRSP, SOM and SOC at a soil depth of 0-20 cm (P < 0.05), which which demonstrates the important contributions of GRSP, SOM and SOC in binding soil particles into large macroaggregates and improving aggregate stability. Furthermore, MC and HLD were significantly positively correlated with GRSP, SOM, and SOC, suggesting that AMF played an essential role in the accumulation of GRSP, SOM, and SOC and subsequently influenced aggregate formation and size distribution. of particles in soils contaminated with HM.

65,Wilson's disease: epigenetic effects of choline supplementation on phenotype and clinical course in a mouse model,"Wilson's disease (WD), a genetic disorder that affects copper transport, is characterized by hepatic and neurological manifestations with a variable and often unpredictable presentation. Global DNA methylation in liver was previously modified by dietary choline in tx-j mice, a spontaneous mutant model of WD. Therefore, we hypothesized that the WD phenotype and liver gene expression of tx-j offspring might be modified by maternal methyl supplementation during pregnancy. In an initial experiment, female tx-j mice or wild-type mice received choline-supplemented or control diets 2 weeks before mating until embryonic day 17. Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) in embryonic livers revealed tx-specific differences. -j in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the neurological disorders of Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Maternal choline supplementation restored transcript levels of a subset of genes to wild-type levels. In a separate experiment, a group of tx-j pups continued to receive choline-supplemented or control diets, with or without the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA), for 12 weeks up to 24 weeks of age. Combined choline supplementation and PCA treatment of 24-week-old tx-j mice was associated with increased hepatic transcript levels of methionine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes. Sex differences in gene expression were also observed within each treatment group. These results demonstrate that transcriptional changes in oxidative phosphorylation and methionine metabolism genes in WD that originate during fetal life are, in part, prevented by prenatal maternal choline supplementation, a finding with potential relevance to preventive treatments of WD.",,"Medici, V.;Kieffer, D.

66,Copper induces hepatocyte damage due to endoplasmic reticulum stress in cultured cells and patients with Wilson's disease,"Copper is an essential trace element, however, excess copper is detrimental to human health. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson's disease, and oxidative stress induces the accumulation of abnormal proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is known to play an important role in proper protein folding, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins disrupts ER homeostasis, leading to ER stress. However, copper-induced alteration of ER homeostasis has not been fully elucidated. We treated the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and the immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, we examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper induced not only oxidative stress but also ER stress. Furthermore, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity induced by excess copper through ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of the ER ultrastructure of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson's disease. These findings show that ER stress plays a critical role in Wilson's disease and suggest that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson's disease.

67,Triethylenetetramine modulates energy and polyamine metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation,"Polyamine metabolism is an attractive target for anticancer drugs, since polyamines are absolutely necessary for cell proliferation, and elevated levels of polyamines and their biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) are associated with cancer. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a charge-deficient isosteric analog of the polyamine spermidine (Spd) and a Cu(II) chelating compound used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, and has been implicated as a potential cancer therapeutic. . In the present study, we studied the effects of TETA compared to two other Cu(II) chelators, D-penicillamine (PA) and tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), on polyamine metabolism in DU145 prostate carcinoma, MCF breast carcinoma -7 and JEG. -3 choriocarcinoma cells. TETA induced the antizyme, downregulated ODC, and inhibited [(14)C]Spd uptake. Furthermore, it completely prevented the alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced increase in [(14)C]Spd uptake, and inhibited [(14)C]putrescine (Put) uptake and ODC activity in vivo. seven days of DU145 cells with TETA caused growth cessation by reducing intracellular polyamine levels and suppressing the formation of hypusinated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). TETA or its N-acetylated metabolites also inhibited spermine (Spm), diamine, and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases and decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, TETA inhibited the utilization of Put as an energy source through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as indicated by the decreased production of (14)CO2 from [(14)C]Put. These results indicate that TETA attacks multiple proven anticancer drug targets that are not attributed to copper chelation, warranting further study to reveal its potential in cancer chemoprevention and cure.

68,Stability and solubility in the solid state of triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride,"Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride API used as an alternative treatment for Wilson's disease is water sensitive and polymorphic. As this can become a problem for drug formulation, physical stability has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry, high-pressure thermal analysis, dynamic vapor sorption, and X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature. In addition, high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry have been used to study the purity and chemical stability of the API. A pressure-temperature phase diagram of the pure compound has been constructed and it can be concluded that form II is monotropic relative to form I, which is the only stable solid. The solubilities of the different solid forms have been determined with the help of a temperature-composition phase diagram. API is very soluble, at 20Â°C approximately 10% of the saturated solution with respect to the dihydrate consists of API and the solubility of pure form I is double. Furthermore, it has been shown that at 20Â°C, a relative humidity greater than 40% induces the formation of the dihydrate and at 70% a saturated solution appears. At higher temperatures, the formation of the dihydrate appears at lower relative humidity values. A clear link has been established between the chemical stability of the API, its physical stability and the relative humidity of the air. Moisture levels above 40% are detrimental to API quality.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of BMSC treatment on liver fibrosis induced hepatolenticular degeneration and the influence on serological indicators. Sixty patients with hepatolenticular degeneration-induced liver fibrosis were randomly divided into two groups, a penicillamine group and a BMSC plus penicillamine group, with 30 patients in each. Therapeutic effects on liver fibrosis, liver function, and serological indicators were recorded before and after treatment, and data were compared. After treatment, serum levels of HA, PCIII, LN, CIV, TIMP-1, and MMP-1 were reduced in both groups (P < 0.05). However, cytokine levels in the BMSC plus penicillamine group were significantly lower than those in the penicillamine group (P < 0.05).

72,The predictive value of low plasma copper and high plasma zinc in the detection of zinc-induced copper deficiency,"BACKGROUND: Zinc-induced copper deficiency is a condition whose diagnosis is often delayed and allows severe and usually irreversible neurological symptoms to develop. Plasma copper concentrations are usually low and plasma zinc concentrations are usually high. The objective of this study was to measure the predictive value of this combination of results as a means of facilitating early diagnosis. METHODS: Low plasma copper (<= 6 micromol/L) and high plasma zinc (>18 micromol/L) results were retrieved from the laboratory database from 2000 to 2014. Medical records were accessed and the laboratory notes of the 20 corresponding patients found to determine which were likely to have zinc-induced copper deficiency. RESULTS: Fifteen (75%) patients were diagnosed with zinc-induced copper deficiency, which was symptomatic in 13. Of the remaining five patients, two were treated with zinc due to Wilson's disease, which was the cause of hypocupremia, two were treated parenterally with zinc. , and not enough information was available on the final patient. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low plasma copper and high plasma zinc is strongly predictive for the diagnosis of zinc-induced copper deficiency. There is therefore an opportunity for the reporting biochemist to facilitate earlier diagnosis, allowing treatment to be implemented before the condition deteriorates.

However, WD is often prone to neglect and misdiagnosis at an early stage. We reported a pedigree of rare WD, and the clinical features, laboratory tests, and genetic mutations were analyzed in detail. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 136 cm tall, 17 year old girl who presented with limb weakness, combined with multi-organ disorders including blind eye, epilepsy, and hypopituitarism. DIAGNOSIS: Clinical examinations showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. She carried compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). His younger brother, as an asymptomatic patient, manifested with elevated transaminases but without neurological and liver symptoms. They were eventually diagnosed as WD. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with sodium dimercaptosulfonate, supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, as well as dietary copper restriction. RESULTS: Urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase level gradually decreased. Abnormal signals in the brainstem and basal ganglia were also markedly reduced after 4 years of copper treatment. LESSONS: For patients with complicated clinical manifestations, extrapyramidal symptom and basal ganglia signals should be of concern.

74,"Candidate molybdenum metallopharmaceuticals: the ""renaissance"" of molybdenum metallopharmaceuticals?","Metal-based drugs, also called ""metallopharmaceuticals"" or ""metallopharmaceuticals"", are examples of sophisticated compounds that have been used in medicinal inorganic chemistry as therapeutic agents for a long time. Few of them have shown substantially promising results and many of them have been used in different phases of clinical trials. Mo-based metallopharmaceuticals have been successfully applied in the past to treat conditions such as anemia or Wilson's disease. Furthermore, Mo complexes are hypothesized to exert their effect via DNA/RNA intercalation/cleavage, cell cycle arrest, and alteration of cell membrane functions. However, in the current literature, there are no reliable and in-depth reviews on the hypothetical therapeutic applications of all molybdenum complexes known as metallopharmaceuticals/metallopharmaceuticals. The main emphasis was on the in-depth review of the potential applications of Mo-based complexes in medicinal chemistry as metallopharmaceuticals in the treatment of diseases such as cancer and tumors, Wilson's disease, diabetes mellitus, Huntington's disease, atherosclerosis and anemia. It should be emphasized that today the development of new and innovative Mo-based metallopharmaceuticals is not rapid and therefore the aim of this paper was also to inspire colleagues working in the field of Mo compounds who are trying to find ""signs"" to investigate. The authors hope that this article will increase interest and initiate the renaissance of Mo compounds among medicinal inorganic chemists.

76,Long-term metabolic correction of Wilson's disease in a murine model by gene therapy,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited copper storage disorder due to mutations in the ATP7B gene that causes hepatic and neurological symptoms. Current treatments rely on lifelong copper chelating drugs and zinc salts, which can cause side effects and fail to restore normal copper metabolism. In this work we evaluate the efficacy of gene therapy to treat this pathology. METHODS: We transduced the liver of the Atp7b(-/-) WD mouse model with a serotype 8 adeno-associated vector (AAV8) encoding human ATP7B cDNA placed under the control of the liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter (AAV8-AAT-ATP7B). ). After vector administration, we perform periodic assessment of parameters associated with copper metabolism and disease progression. Animals were sacrificed 6 months after treatment to analyze copper storage and liver histology. RESULTS: We observed a dose-dependent therapeutic effect of AAV8-AAT-ATP7B manifested by reduction of serum transaminases and urinary copper excretion, normalization of serum holoceruloplasmin, and restoration of physiologic biliary copper excretion in response to copper overload. The liver of the treated animals showed normalization of the copper content and absence of histological alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that AAV8-AAT-ATP7B-mediated gene therapy provides long-term correction of copper metabolism in a clinically relevant animal model of WD providing support for future translation studies.

77,Subclinical neurological involvement does not develop if Wilson's disease is treated early.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that causes dysfunction of several organs, mainly the liver and brain. If left untreated, WD is fatal, but early treatment results in a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the neurological status of early treated WD patients without overt nervous system impairment using neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging procedures at least 10 years after treatment initiation. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with WD (18 women, age 24.47 +/- 7.50 years), who received an early diagnosis (in stages of presymptomatic or mild/moderate liver disease without neurological involvement) and timely treatment, were clinically assessed with the Global Assessment Scale. Presentation was hepatic in 36 subjects (95%), while 2 patients (5%) were presymptomatic. A neurophysiological study was carried out to explore the central motor conduction time of the upper and lower limbs, and the excitability of the motor cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation of single and pair pulses. Neuroimaging was obtained with brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive abilities and psychiatric and behavioral disorders were assessed with neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The patients were receiving treatment with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good adherence. They did not present any neurological signs in the clinical evaluation or in the specific deterioration scale, the mean score of the Global Assessment Scale was 0.3 +/- 0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric evaluation ruled out subclinical involvement.

80,New Zeb2 gene variation in Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS),"BACKGROUND: Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare association of Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Phenotypic features can develop over time, causing initial difficulties in diagnosis. MWS results from haploinsufficiency of the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene, and molecular diagnosis of the ZEB2 mutation is required to confirm the diagnosis. We report the first confirmed cases of MWS in three children with typical facial features, mental retardation, absent corpus callosum, epilepsy, and HSCR and new Zeb2 variations on DNA analysis. METHODOLOGY: Clinical characteristics were monitored. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was subjected to bidirectional sequencing analysis after DNA amplification by PCR. Results from the ZEB2 gene were compared to the ZEB2 reference sequence (ENS00000169554) for variation. Bioinformatics investigation of new genetic variants was performed through the ""Blastx"" program feature available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.bioinfo.org/NPInter/blast/blast_link.cgi). RESULTS: Clinical follow-up showed that the phenotypic features were not all present at birth but developed over time in 2 surviving patients. Several Zeb2 variations were detected in the promoter region of the ZEB2 gene, of which 2 were novel (-56A/T 1174 11A/12A). Furthermore, a new heterozygous single nucleotide insertion into exon 2 of ZEB2 in one patient results in a frameshift causing deletion of the first 8 amino acids of the ZEB2 protein and an alteration of amino acids 9 (G9A), 11 (R11G) and 12 (C12A). In the third patient, a single nucleotide redeletion of exon 8 (1784delC Het) results in a frameshift at amino acid 595 of the translated protein. This shortens the protein from 1214 to 594 amino acids and affects the functionality of the critical ZEB2 protein. CONCLUSIONS: MWS is an important link to recognize clinically. The functionality of the Zeb2 gene stands out in certain Hirschsprung syndromic diseases. These variations likely contribute to the clinical features of the Mowat Wilson phenotype in Hirschsprung's disease but need to be confirmed in future research. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

81,D-penicillamine-induced ANA (+) ANCA (+) vasculitis in pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with systemic vasculitis. The pathophysiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) has not been clearly demonstrated, and drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis has been reported. Wilson's disease is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the copper transporter gene ATP7B, and traditional treatment is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine. There have been rare reports that prolonged D-penicillamine therapy could cause renal adverse events, such as membranous nephropathy and minimal change disease, but it is questionable whether D-penicillamine induces ANCA-associated vasculitis. We describe 2 patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine who presented ANCA (+) vasculitis and kidney involvement. The 2 patients also showed positive results for antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Renal biopsy findings were consistent with semilunar/necrotizing glomerulonephritis, pauciimmune type. After diagnosis of AAV, D-penicillamine was discontinued. The patients were then treated with plasmapheresis and immunosuppressants, including methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous cyclophosphamide. One patient progressed to end-stage kidney disease and the other showed persistent proteinuria. These cases suggest that D-penicillamine can induce ANA (+) ANCA (+) vasculitis with severe renal compromise in pediatric patients, and plasmapheresis combined with immunosuppressants should be considered.",,"Lee, Y.;Lee, S.

83,Concomitant immune-related events in Wilson's disease: implications for monitoring of chelation therapy.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first-line therapy of symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease. The development of chelator-induced immunological adverse events is a concern, especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study evaluated the prevalence of coexisting or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in patients with Wilson's disease and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in monitoring therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 patients with Wilson's disease. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and courses of antinuclear antibodies. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of whom 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease during treatment, all of them under prolonged treatment with d-penicillamine. Data related to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n=91), trientine (n=58), and zinc salts (n=58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers was found in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12, one %). CONCLUSION: Under long-term therapy with d-penicillamine, a minority of patients developed an immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were frequently found, but no obvious correlations were observed between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimens. Therefore, the value of antinuclear antibodies in monitoring adverse events under chelation therapy appears to be limited.",,"Seessle, J.;Gotthardt, D.

The objective of this study was to establish the usefulness of this method as an evaluation of compliance in these patients. We examined consecutive patients treated with d-penicillamine (DPA) undergoing routine follow-up studies at our center. We performed a 24-hour urinary copper excretion analysis 48 hours after discontinuation of chelation therapy. Thirty-two patients were recruited. After cessation of APD, normalization of copper excretion was observed in 91% of the patients who complied with the reports.

Trientine was discontinued, and a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis consistent with drug-induced mucosal injury. Colitis improved immediately after trientine discontinuation and recurred when medication was restarted due to worsening of WD symptoms. After the second mandatory trientine stop, he continued zinc therapy for his WD, and his colitis resolved over time. CONCLUSION: Drug-induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and fewer side effects are reported with this drug than with penicillamine, colitis may occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for the treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects of chelation therapy.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.

88,"Formation constants of copper(I) complexes with cysteine, penicillamine and glutathione: implications for copper speciation in the human eye","The protonation constants of the biologically important thioamino acids cysteine (CSH), penicillamine (PSH), and glutathione (GSH), and the formation constants of their complexes with Cu(I), have been measured at 25 Â°C and an ionic strength of 1.00 mol. dm(-3) (Na)Cl using glass electrode potentiometry. The first successful characterization of the binary Cu(I)-CSH and Cu(I)-GSH species over the entire pH range was achieved in this study by the addition of a second thioamino acid, which prevented the precipitation that normally occurs. Appropriate combinations of binary and ternary (mixed ligand) titration data were used to optimize speciation models and formation constants for the binary species. The results obtained differ significantly from the literature data regarding the detection and quantification of protonated and polynuclear complexes. The current results are believed to be more reliable due to the exceptionally wide pH and concentration ranges used, the excellent reproducibility of the data, the close agreement between the calculated and observed formation functions, and the low standard deviations and lack of numerical correlation. in the constants The present formation constants were incorporated into a large model of Cu speciation that was used to predict, for the first time, metal-ligand equilibria in the biofluids of the human eye.

89,Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in an eight-month-old child,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that can cause fatal neurologic and liver disease if left undiagnosed and untreated. The youngest child with normal liver function reported to date is an 8-month-old Japanese child with low ceruloplasmin levels, and the youngest child with elevated aminotransferase ever reported to date is a 9-month-old Korean child with confirmed genetic testing. Here we report on an 8-month-old Chinese boy who presented with elevated liver enzymes and a low serum ceruloplasmin level. Genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene detected two heterozygous disease-causing mutations (c.2621C>T/p.A874V and c.3809A>G/p.N1270S), and parental origins were determined. The persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase in this infant normalized after zinc therapy. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with elevated liver enzymes ever reported worldwide. We hope this will increase awareness among pediatricians, leading to earlier diagnosis, timely treatment, and better clinical outcome.",,"Abuduxikuer, K.;Li, L. T.;Qiu, Y. L.;Wang, N. L.;Wang, J.

90,Elevated copper impairs hepatic nuclear receptor function in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes accumulation of copper in the liver as a result of mutations in the gene encoding the copper transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B). WD is a chronic liver disorder, and people with the disease develop a variety of complications, including steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Like WD patients, Atp7b-/- mice have markedly elevated liver copper levels and liver pathology. Previous studies have shown that zinc replacement in the estrogen receptor (ER) DNA-binding domain with copper disrupts specific binding to DNA response elements. Here, we found decreased binding of nuclear receptors FXR, RXR, HNF4alpha, and LRH-1 to promoter response elements and decreased mRNA expression of nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b-/- mice, as well as in adult and pediatric patients with WD. Excess hepatic copper has been described in progressive familial cholestasis (PFIC) and we found that, similar to people with WD, patients with PFIC2 or PFIC3 who have clinically elevated hepatic copper levels exhibit altered nuclear receptor activity. Together, these data demonstrate that copper-mediated nuclear receptor dysfunction disrupts liver function in WD and potentially in other disorders associated with elevated liver copper levels.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

91,Zinc therapy for Wilson's disease in children in French pediatric centers,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Zinc therapy is considered a good option in Wilson's disease (WD), as first-line treatment in presymptomatic children and as maintenance therapy after initial chelation therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the practical use of zinc treatment in French pediatric centers. METHODS: A national survey was carried out in the 6 French centers that use zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological parameters, dose and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 26 children were reported to be treated with zinc acetate, alone or in association with chelators. Of the 9 children (35%) who received zinc alone as first-line therapy, 2 switched to D-penicillamine due to inefficacy and 7 continued zinc alone, but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19%) were initially treated with zinc in association with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or Trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Among the 12 children (46%) who received zinc as maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, there was no relapse of hepatic cytolysis during a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but 2 of them switched to Trientine due to to adverse reactions related to zinc. Effects Epigastric pain was observed in 4 children and gastric perforation occurred in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a poor efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy to control liver disease in half of presymptomatic children and a high incidence of related gastrointestinal adverse effects in children with WD.",,"Santiago, R.;Gottrand, F.;Debray, D.;Bridoux, L.;Lachaux, A.;Morali, A.;Lapeyre, D.;Lamireau, T.",2015,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000000926,0,1,
92,Role of oxidative stress in the worsening of neurological Wilson's disease after chelation therapy,"Patients with neurological Wilson's disease (NWD) may worsen with treatment, but there are no studies evaluating the role of oxidative stress. We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in worsening NWD after treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naÃ¯ve NWD patients underwent a detailed clinical evaluation. NWD severity was noted and dystonia was measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. His hematological, serum biochemical, abdominal ultrasound and cranial magnetic resonance changes were observed. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu), and 24-hour urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. Patients were considered to have worsened if there was one or more degrees of deterioration on the severity scale, >10% deterioration in the BFM score, or the appearance of new neurological signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were women. After treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had a stationary course. The group that worsened at 3 months had lower GSH (1.99 +/- 0.17 vs 2.30 +/- 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.82 +/- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/l); P = 0.001) and higher levels of MDA (5.24 +/- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +/- 0.46 nmol/mL; P < 0.001) compared to the enhanced group. These changes were associated with increased serum free Cu (41.81 +/- 3.31 vs. 35.62 +/- 6.40 microg/dL; P = 0.02) and 24-h urinary Cu (206.42 +/- 41.61 vs. 121.99 +/- 23.72 micro g/24 h; P < 0.001) in the group that worsened vs. that improved. All patients who presented worsening received penicillamine. The worsening after chelation treatment in NWD may be due to oxidative stress induced by the increase in serum free Cu. These results may have future therapeutic implications and need further study.",,"Kalita, J.;Kumar, V.;Ranjan, A.;Misra, U. K.",2015,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12017-015-8364-8,0,0,
93,Zeb2: a multifunctional regulator of the development of the nervous system,"Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (Zeb) 2 is a transcription factor, identified due to its ability to bind Smad proteins, and consists of multiple functional domains that interact with a variety of transcriptional co-effectors. The complex nature of Zeb2, both at the genetic and protein levels, underlies its multifunctional properties, with Zeb2 capable of acting individually or as part of a transcriptional complex to repress and occasionally activate target gene expression. This review presents Zeb2 as an essential regulator of nervous system development. Zeb2 is expressed in the nervous system throughout its development, indicating its importance in neurogenic and gliogenic processes. Indeed, the Zeb2 mutation has dramatic neurological consequences in both animal and human models of Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which results from heterozygous mutations in ZEB2. The mechanisms by which Zeb2 regulates neuroectoderm (CNS primordium) and neural crest (PNS primordium) induction are reviewed here. We then describe how Zeb2 acts to direct neural crest cell formation, delamination, migration, and specification. Zeb2's regulation of the development of a number of brain regions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, is described below. The various molecular mechanisms that mediate Zeb2-directed development of various neuronal and glial populations are reviewed. The role of Zeb2 in spinal cord and enteric nervous system development is described, while its essential role in CNS myelination is also described. Finally, this review examines how the neurodevelopmental defects of Zeb2 mutant mice delineate the developmental dysfunctions that underlie the multiple neurological defects observed in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

Alterations in copper metabolism have been associated with changes in coagulation factors. The objective of the present study was the analysis of coagulation factors in patients with WD. METHODS: One hundred patients attending a tertiary WD outpatient clinic were analyzed in a prospective cross-sectional cohort study. Coagulation factors were evaluated from peripheral venous blood samples, including: complete blood count, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand factor/- antigen, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, activated protein C (APC) resistance. Subgroup analyzes of blood tests for gender, initial clinical presentation, WD treatment, and liver function were performed. RESULTS: Subgroup analysis by liver function showed reduced levels of factors II, V, VII, and X. Subgroup analysis by gender or clinical course of disease revealed no significant changes in coagulation. Significantly reduced levels of factors II, VII and antithrombin III and increased levels of von Willebrand factor/antigen were detected in patients treated with trientine. Factor VIII levels were significantly reduced in patients receiving zinc. CONCLUSION: Although significant differences were found in some coagulation parameters in the subgroup analysis, clinically relevant alterations of the coagulation system could not be detected in patients with WD.",,"Schaefer, M.;Weber, L.;Gotthardt, D.;Seessle, J.;Stremmel, W.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Weiss, K.

95,Early neurological worsening in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Early neurological worsening during initiation of treatment for Wilson's disease (WD) is an unsolved problem. Our aim was to establish the frequency and outcome of early neurological worsening in WD patients. METHODS: We analyzed 143 symptomatic patients diagnosed with WD between 2005 and 2009. Early neurological deterioration was based on worsening on the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale, scored from baseline to 6 months, or onset of new neurological symptoms. The reversibility of worsening was followed up to 24 months. RESULTS: Early neurological worsening was observed in 11.1% (16/143) and involved only patients with neurological signs at diagnosis. The mean time to worsening from the start of treatment was 2.3 +/- 1.9 months. Neurological deterioration was fully reversible in 53% (8/15) and partially in 13% (2/15) of patients over 9.2 +/- 5.2 months. Patients who experienced early deterioration had significantly more severe baseline neurologic deficits, a higher prevalence of thalamic (66% vs. 29%) and brainstem (73% vs. 33%) lesions seen on baseline MRI, and more frequently used concomitant dopamine receptor antagonists (46% vs. 5%). The duration of the disease, the type of treatment (d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), the type of neurological manifestations, the results of the initial metabolism of copper and the liver function parameters did not differ between the groups evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological worsening at the start of anti-copper therapy may occur in more than 10% of patients with WD. Particular attention should be paid to those with severe initial neurological manifestations, advanced brain damage, and those using dopamine receptor antagonists. The type of anti-copper therapy did not show a clear association with early neurological worsening.

We report radiological changes in four patients with WDN that worsened after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinic, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urinary copper. Hematological, biochemical and cranial MRIs were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration after chelation treatment. RESULTS: Four patients with WDN had neurological deterioration within 4 to 8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in the white matter, thalamus, pons, and midbrain, and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. Neurological deterioration was associated with increased serum free copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized after a few weeks of suspension of penicillamine. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI that revealed diffusion restriction. The increase in oxidative stress induced by free copper may be responsible for these changes. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Ranjan, A.;Kalita, J.;Kumar, V.;Misra, U.

101,Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Inductively Coupled Plasma Laser Ablation of Metals in Experimental and Clinical Wilson's Disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the liver does not properly release copper into the bile, leading to a significant accumulation of copper in various tissues. Affected patients suffer from liver disorders and severe neurological defects. Experimental studies in mutant mice in which the copper transporter ATPase gene (Atp7b) is disrupted revealed a dramatic and time-dependent accumulation of hepatic copper that is accompanied by the formation of regenerative nodules resembling cirrhosis. Therefore, these mice represent an excellent exploratory model for Wilson's disease. However, the precise time course in hepatic copper accumulation and its impact on other trace metals within the liver is still poorly understood. Recently, we have established new laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry protocols that enable quantitative imaging of metals in human and murine liver tissue with high sensitivity, spatial resolution, specificity, and quantification capability. Using these techniques, our goal here was to comparatively analyze liver metal content in Atp7b-deficient and wild-type mice during aging. We show that age-dependent hepatic copper accumulation is strictly associated with a simultaneous increase in iron and zinc, while the intrahepatic concentration and distribution of other metals or metalloids is not affected. The same findings were obtained in well-defined human liver samples that were obtained from patients suffering from Wilson's disease. We conclude that liver copper imbalances during aging are closely related to changes in intrahepatic iron and zinc content in Wilson's disease. Copyright Â© 2015 The authors.

102,Bone demineralization in a large cohort of patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: We compared the bone mineral density (BMD) of adult patients with Wilson's disease (WD) (n = 148), with an age- and gender-matched healthy control population (n = 148). Within the WD cohort, correlations of BMD with WD disease parameters, laboratory results, type of treatment, and known osteoporosis risk factors were analyzed. METHODS: Hip and lumbar spine absolute BMD and T-score were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as a T-score <=-2.5 and between -1 and -2.5, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more subjects with abnormal T-scores in the WD population (58.8%) than in the control population (45.3%) (chi(2)=6.65, df=2, p=0.036), since there were 50.0% of patients with osteopenic WD and 8.8% osteoporotic, compared to 41.2% and 4.1%, respectively, in the controls. Especially L2-L4 spine BMD measurements (BMD and T-scores) differed significantly between the WD population and matched controls. L2-L4 spine BMD for WD patients was on average 0.054 g/cm(2) (5.1%) lower than matched normal controls (0.995+/-0.156 vs. 1.050+/-0.135; p=0.002). We found no significant correlation between BMD values and any of the WD disease parameters (eg, severity of liver disease), laboratory results, type of treatment, or risk factors for osteoporosis acquaintances. Duration of D-penicillamine treatment was negatively correlated with femoral BMD value, but clinically irrelevant, compared with age and gender. Importantly, BMD remained significantly lower in WD patients (n = 89) versus controls after excluding WD patients with cirrhosis (p = 0.009).

The predetermined ion exchange reaction instead of chelation between ZnPB NPs and copper ions leads to a high selectivity of these NPs for copper in the presence of other endogenous metal ions. Furthermore, ZnPB NPs are highly water-dispersible and non-cytotoxic, and can be easily internalized by cells to target intracellular copper ions for selective copper detoxification, suggesting their potential application as a new-generation treatment for WD. .",,"Kandanapitiye, M.

Anetoderma is a rare benign condition with focal damage to the dermal elastic tissue. Previous reports described this skin disorder in association with prolonged D-penicillamine therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old man was referred for evaluation for asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase levels. Investigations showed negative markers for autoimmune and chronic viral hepatitis, low ceruloplasmin level, and increased urinary excretion of copper. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderate activity and severe bridging fibrosis. Mutation analysis found a compound heterozygous genotype and supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Skin lesions consisting of numerous white to pale papules less than 7-8 mm in diameter with central protrusion located on the upper body were also noted at the time of primary physical examination. Primary anetoderma was established based on presentation and skin biopsy findings. D-Penicillamine therapy was started at a daily dose of 1500 mg and, during a 12-month follow-up, the aminotransferase decreased to normal and the skin lesions remained unchanged.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate trientine once daily as a therapy for Wilson's disease. Methods: STUDY GROUP: eight patients (seven men) aged 22 to 71 years with stable Wilson's disease treated from 4 to 50 years. The patients were followed for 3 months and then for 12 months with a single daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). RESULTS: All patients remained clinically well. ALT and AST fluctuated in some, but none required treatment interruptions or side effects. The synthetic function of the liver did not change. Mean 24-hour urine copper and zinc excretions at the end of treatment were 313.4 +/- 191.7 and 2,214 +/- 1,346 cups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Trientine once daily should be further explored as a potential maintenance therapy for WD. The single daily dose can improve adherence to treatment.

108,Detection of D-penicillamine in skin lesions in a case of dermal elastosis after prolonged prior treatment for Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous adverse events associated with D-penicillamine (DPA) are common and multifaceted, although the presence of DPA or its metabolites in the skin has never been documented, due to the inherent difficulties in determining their tissue levels. Therefore, the association between APD and APD-related dermatoses has only been hypothesized on the basis of careful history, clinical observation, and typical histopathologic findings. OBJECTIVE: To detect DPA in biopsy specimens in a single 25-year-old case of late-onset perforating elastosis serpiginosa and pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum associated with a long-term history of high-dose DPA, by applying a recently described analytical method for assess the presence of DPA in the skin. METHODS: We used a reliable analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with amperometric detection to search for the presence of DPA in skin biopsy samples. RESULTS: A chromatographic peak corresponding to DPA was evidenced in some affected skin samples collected from the patient. CONCLUSION: We document the effective presence and persistence after 25 years of DPA in the skin of a woman affected by elastotic skin change due to long-term DPA therapy. This report provides further evidence for the relationship between DPA deposition in affected skin and clinical manifestation.

109,A case of Wilson's disease with characteristic laparoscopic findings,"44-year-old man was indicated by medical review with impaired liver function. Blood test and CT scan showed liver cirrhosis. He was then referred to our hospital for further examination. After the blood test, viral markers revealed a previous infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). We estimated the etiology of his liver disease as previous HBV infection. On laparoscopic examination, the surface of his liver was nodular with mixed yellowish nodules and ash-gray to copper-colored nodules with a diameter of 3-10 mm. There were large regenerative nodules in segments 3 and 4. The large regenerative nodules and patchy steatosis were inconsistent with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, so we assumed Wilson's disease. The amount of copper excreted in the urine was 326.6 Âµg (>100 Âµg/24 h). Following administration of D-penicillamine, urinary copper excretion increased to 2151.5 Âµg/24 h. Although liver copper concentration was 174.5 ug/g wet tissue (>200 ug/g wet tissue), his laboratory data met the Leipzig diagnostic criteria proposed by the EASL. Laparoscopic examination with liver biopsy has advantages for studying many disease-specific findings on the surface of the liver and for obtaining an adequate liver sample. Laparoscopic examination is one of the effective procedures for diagnosing relatively rare liver diseases such as Wilson's disease.",,"Muro, S.;Yasunaka, T.;Wada, N.;Morimoto, Y.;Ikeda, F.;Shiraha, H.;Takaki, A.;Noso, K.;Iwasaki, H.;Yamamoto, K.",2014,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12328-014-0465-7,0,0,
110,"Atypical case of Wilson's disease with psychotic onset, low copper in 24-hour urine, and absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings","INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease typically manifests itself in two clinical forms, neurological and hepatic, and in rare cases it begins with exclusively psychiatric symptoms. We present a rare atypical case of Wilson's disease with psychotic onset. CASE REPORT: A 22-year-old male patient presented initially with predominant signs and symptoms of a psychiatric disorder and later with the development of neurological signs and symptoms. Neuroimaging detected metal deposits in the central nervous system (CNS) but not in peripheral organs, while serum analysis excluded pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration and aceruloplasminemia. In favor of the diagnosis of Wilson's disease there were reduced concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin and metallic deposits in the CNS, but other pathognomonic signs and symptoms were absent: increased copper in urine, Kayser-Fleischer rings in Descemet's corneal membrane and deposits of copper in liver The introduction of penicillamine treatment resulted in an improvement in the mental and general health of the patient. Molecular genetic analysis definitively confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease can go unnoticed for a long period of time if it is masked by dominant or exclusive psychiatric symptoms. If clear clinical signs and symptoms and unequivocal laboratory findings are not present, molecular genetic analysis is necessary to confirm the definitive diagnosis.",,"Krstic, D.;Antonijevic, J.;Spiric, Z.",2014,Dec,,0,0,

112,Impact of the discovery of human zinc deficiency on health,"The essentiality of zinc in humans was established in 1963. During the last 50 years, tremendous advances have been observed in the clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans. growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment are important clinical effects in humans. We currently know >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells is involved in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity, but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Zinc supplementation in the elderly results in a lower incidence of infections, lower oxidative stress, and lower generation of inflammatory cytokines. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

114,The promise of tetrathiomolybdate copper-reducing therapy in curing cancer and treating inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a unique anti-copper drug developed for the treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease, for which it is excellent. Since copper was known to be required for angiogenesis, TM was tested in mouse cancer models to see if it would inhibit tumor growth based on an antiangiogenic effect. TM was extremely effective in these models, but all the tumors in the models started out small in size - micrometastatic size. TM was later tested in numerous human cancer trials, where it showed only modest effects. However, the lesson of the mouse about efficacy against microdiseases was forgotten: all the trials were against advanced and bulky cancer. Now, the mouse evidence is coming back to life. Three groups are curing, or have increased TM efficacy, against advanced, heretofore virtually incurable human cancers, particularly if the cancer has been reduced to a no-evidence-of-disease (NED) state by conventional therapy. In that situation, where the remaining disease is micrometastatic, MT therapy appears to be curative. We have designed and initiated a study of TM in canine osteosarcoma in the micrometastatic phase to help put these findings on a firm scientific footing. TM also has important anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting copper-dependent cytokines involved in inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect may be involved in the anticancer effect of MT because cancers, as they progress, attract inflammatory cells that provide a plethora of additional proangiogenic agents.

115,Penicillamine challenge test in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases found in children. Early diagnosis of the disease is essential because specific treatment can be offered that will prevent further hepatocellular injury and neurological complications. There is no single diagnostic test that can exclude or confirm the disease with certainty. Penicillamine challenge has been shown to be a useful diagnostic test in the detection of WD. The main objective of this study was to observe the reliability of the penicillamine challenge test in the diagnosis of WD. The cross-sectional study was conducted in a case-control design at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, BSMMU, Dhaka. The study was carried out in 60 patients with CLD. Along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations, 24-hour urinary copper excretions were calculated before and after the penicillamine challenge. The results of the study were analyzed statistically. Thirty CLD patients who met the WD inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered cases (Group I) and the remaining 30 CLD patients were considered non-Wilsonian CLD and labeled control (Group II). Among the control group, 12 CLD patients were found to be HBsAg positive, 1 had hepatitis C virus infection, 1 had autoimmune hepatitis, and the remaining 16 CLD patients were cryptogenic. The age (mean +/- SD) of the WD patients was 9.90 +/- 28 years; the male to female ratio was 1.5:1. The most common presentation was ascites (70%). The KF ring was found in 86.7% of the cases. Serum ceruloplasmin level was found to be significantly lower in WD patients (mean +/- SD, 0.1197 +/- 23 g/L, p < 0.001). Baseline urinary copper excretion of WD patients differed significantly from controls (median 219.0 ug/24 hours, range 35 to 2018 ug/24 hours, vs. median 44 ug/24 hours, range 20 to 238ug/24 hours, p<0.001). Basal urinary copper excretion greater than 100 Âµg/24 hours was observed in 80% of WD patients, compared to 10% in controls. post-penicillamine urinary copper excretion was significantly higher in WD patients than in controls (median 2635 ug/24 hours, range 648 to 6222 ug/24 hours, vs. median 423 ug/24 hours). , range from 91 to 1250 ug/24 hours, p<0.001). Post-penicillamine urinary copper above 1600 Âµg/24 hours was observed in 70% of WD patients, while no patients reached the value in the control group. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper estimation after penicillamine challenge was found to be a valuable test in the diagnosis of WD.",,"Mazumder, M. W.;Karim, M. B.;Rukunuzzaman, M.",2014,Jul,,0,0,
116,Metalloproteomics: focus on metabolic issues related to metals,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: By determining metalloproteomes through a high-throughput methodology, metalloproteomics provides a research strategy to investigate nutritional and metabolic problems related to metals. In this review, we review recent developments in metalloproteomics since its inception approximately 12 years ago, when we used metalloproteomics to investigate copper disposition in hepatocytes in relation to Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A metalloproteome is the set of proteins that have the capacity to bind metals because they are metalloproteins or show metal binding sites. Like all proteomes, a metalloproteome is determined within the context of a well-defined system. It can be determined for a single metal or multiple metals in that system. In addition to significant technological advances in analytical techniques, recent work has examined metalloproteomes for metals other than copper, particularly nickel, zinc, and manganese. Given the importance of microbiomes for metabolism, microbial metalloproteomics is a promising and rapidly expanding new field. SUMMARY: Metals play a key role in metabolic processes. In the last decade there has been enough technological progress to make metalloproteomics an exciting and innovative type of research in nutrition and metabolism. Clarifies how metals contribute to metabolic physiology in all phyla, including microbes. For humans, it can elucidate mechanisms as well as identify informative diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.",,"Roberts, E.

117,Symptomatic copper deficiency in three patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by excess copper leading to copper accumulation primarily in the liver and brain and necessitates lifelong copper removal therapy. However, excessive treatment with anti-copper agents can lead to copper deficiency which can cause neurological and hematological symptoms. Copper is an important cofactor for many enzymes. This report describes three WD patients with copper deficiency diagnosed during treatment with zinc sulfate (ZS). After 5 to 16 years of therapy, all patients developed leukopenia. Spinal cord injury manifested itself in two of the patients. One of them also had myopathy. In conclusion, copper deficiency can occur at different times after the start of treatment, so regular monitoring of copper metabolism and hematology is necessary.

119,Bone mineralization in children with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine bone mineralization in children with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (16 men) and two age- and sex-matched healthy boys for each patient were enrolled in the study. Bone mineral content (BMC, grams) and density (BMD, g/cm(2)) in lumbar vertebrae 1-4 were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Urinary calcium excretion was calculated in 19 patients. The effect of cirrhosis and hypercalciuria on BMC and BMD was also evaluated in WD patients. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between patients and healthy controls with respect to mean BMC (33.0+/-13.9 vs. 35.8+/-13.8 g) (p=0.940) and mean BMD values (0.66+/-0.16 vs. 0.71+/-0.18 g/cm(2)) (p=0.269), respectively. Nine (47.4%) patients had hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuric patients had statistically lower BMC and BMD values than those without hypercalciuria. A significant difference was still present after adjusting for age, weight, height, and pubertal stage, but disappeared after adjusting for weight, height, length of follow-up, and pubertal stage. The presence of cirrhosis did not significantly affect BMC and BMD in WD patients. CONCLUSIONS: BMC and BMD in children with WD were normal.

Liver transplantation is indicated for ~5% of WD patients with acute liver failure as the first presentation of the disease, most often in the second decade of life, or those with end-stage liver disease and severe liver failure, with more frequent in the third and fourth decades.

122,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper transport disorder resulting from defective function of a copper transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B. The incidence of WD is approximately 1/50-10,000 live births worldwide. The clinical manifestations of WD can be of any type, but generally the presenting symptoms are hepatic or neuropsychiatric, with a wide range of alterations for both groups of symptoms. In children, however, clinical symptoms may be absent, making diagnosis of the disease more difficult than in adults. Hepatic manifestations can range from asymptomatic minor biochemical abnormalities to acute but mostly chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fulminant severe hepatic failure. The spectrum of neurological manifestations is wide, including tremor, hypersalivation, dysarthria, coordination defects, dystonia, ataxia. The spectrum of psychiatric manifestations is considerable and can include different alterations such as impaired work performance, anxiety, depression and antisocial behavior. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are present in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms and slightly more than half of those without neurological symptoms. In children with liver disease, the KF rings are often absent. To obtain a more reliable diagnosis of WD, an international consensus of experts proposed the Leipzig scoring system. The copper overload of Wilson's disease is treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate. Zinc is primarily used for maintenance therapy or treatment of asymptomatic WD patients.",,"Loudianos, G.;Lepori, M. B.;Mameli, E.;Dessi, V.;Zappu, A.",2014,,,0,0,
123,Tripodal derivatives of D-penicillamine as efficient chelators of copper (I),"Novel tripodal metal chelating agents derived from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and extended by three unnatural amino acids D-penicillamine (D-Pen) are presented. D-Pen is actually the most widely used drug to treat copper (Cu) overload in Wilson's disease and as such is a very attractive building block for the design of chelating agents. D-Pen is also a bulkier analog of cysteine, with the beta-methylene hydrogen atoms replaced by larger methyl groups. It is shown that the hindrance of the gem-dimethyl group close to the thiol functions influences the speciation and stability of metal complexes. Ligands L(4) (ester) and L(5) (amide) were obtained from NTA and commercial D-Pen synthesizers in four and five steps with total yields of 14 and 24%, respectively. Its ability to bind Cu(I), thanks to its three thiolate functions, has been investigated by spectroscopic and analytical methods. UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry show the formation of two complexes of Cu(I) with L(5): the mononuclear complex CuL(5) and a group (Cu2L(5))2. In contrast, the bulkier ethyl ester derivative L(4) cannot accommodate the mononuclear complex in solution and thus exclusively forms the (Cu2L(4))2 group. K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Cu (XAS and EXAFS) confirms that Cu(I) binds in sulfur-only trigonal-planar environments in all these complexes with Cu-S distances ranging from 2.22 to 2.23 A Tal CuS3 nuclei with C3 symmetry are frequently adopted coordination modes in Cu(I) proteins such as metallothioneins. These two ligands bind Cu(I) strongly and selectively, making them promising chelators for intracellular copper detoxification in vivo.",,"Jullien, A.

124,Clinical considerations for effective medical therapy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited copper overload disorder that leads to hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. More than a century after Wilson's disease was first described, the available medical treatment options have not been standardized. The efficacy of commonly used drugs is satisfactory for liver disease, but disappointing in neurological patients, including the risk of neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy. One approach to overcome this problem is careful and systematic evaluation of biochemical response patterns and quantitative control of symptoms using validated rating scales. Standardized dosing strategies that address changes in copper stores could improve adherence and reduce side effects. Such an approach may reduce long-term morbidity. In this article, we discuss considerations for effective medical treatment and requirements for future studies in Wilson's disease. Copyright Â© 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Weiss, K.

125,AP1S1 defect causing MEDNIK syndrome: a new adaptinopathy associated with defective copper metabolism,"MEDNIK syndrome (mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma) has recently been described as a new disorder of copper metabolism. This multisystem disease combines clinical and biochemical signs of Menkes and Wilson diseases, in which liver copper overload can be treated with zinc acetate therapy. MEDNIK syndrome is caused by mutation of the AP1S1 gene, which encodes the sigma1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 and directs intracellular trafficking of the ATP7A and ATP7B copper pumps. Adapter protein complexes regulate clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, protein cargo sorting, and inter-organelle vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells. An increasing number of diseases have been associated with mutations in genes encoding subunits of adapter protein complexes and we propose the term adaptinopathies for them, as a new organic category of intracellular trafficking disorders, which offers the opportunity to dissect the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between the Golgi apparatus and the other organelles.

Early detection of Wilson's disease is critical because there are effective medical treatments, such as chelating agents and zinc salts, that can prevent lifelong neurological disabilities and/or cirrhosis. It is unfortunate that most patients come to our attention after they have developed serious complications, such as brain damage or cirrhosis, despite the availability of effective treatments. Diagnosis is usually made through measurement of copper in liver tissue, followed by confirmation with genetic testing of the ATP7B gene. Currently, there are no effective biomarkers or adequate methods for the detection of Wilson's disease in newborns. Ceruloplasmin has been tested for pediatric and neonatal screening with limited results. Recently, liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) has emerged as a robust technology that can allow multiplex quantification of characteristic proteotypic peptides with low abundance. Application of this technology may help facilitate Wilson's disease research for protein expression, biomarker study, diagnosis, and hopefully detection.

130,Zinc monotherapy is effective in Wilson's disease patients with mild liver disease diagnosed in childhood: a retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) progresses rapidly and is fatal if left untreated. Treatment of WD patients with mild liver disease is not clearly defined. To address this issue, we evaluated the long-term outcomes of three treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, zinc, or both) in patients diagnosed in childhood. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated efficacy, compliance, and reasons for treatment discontinuation in 42 WD patients (median age at diagnosis: 6 years; median follow-up: 12 years) with mild liver disease. Duration of treatment was analyzed for each treatment block until a medication change or completion of follow-up. Treatment switch events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Total discontinuations due to treatment failure or adverse events were more frequent in patients receiving D-penicillamine (45%) or combination therapy (36%) than in patients receiving zinc (12%) (P = .001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Treatment failure was more common with D-penicillamine (28%) and combination therapy (36%) than with zinc (12%); the difference was statistically significant only between zinc and combination therapy (p = 0.03). First-line zinc monotherapy controlled WD-related liver disease in 13/15 patients (87%); the two subjects who failed zinc had poor adherence. Zinc was effective in 3/5 (60%) of the patients who failed the D-penicillamine and combination regimens. The 15 D-penicillamine responders who switched to zinc had good liver disease control at a median follow-up of 13.1 years. Among the 6 non-responders to D-penicillamine who switched to zinc, 4 (67%) responded. At the end of follow-up, only 5/42 (12%) patients failed. Discontinuation induced by adverse events was significantly more frequent in patients receiving D-penicillamine than in patients receiving zinc (p = 0.03).

Drugs such as penicillamine, trientine and zinc salts are the basis of treatment, with good results; but non-responders or noncompliance with drug treatment can lead to disease progression and acute liver failure (ALF). Current treatment for WD with ALF is emergency liver transplantation and lifelong immunosuppression. Human hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is increasingly used as a treatment for liver-based metabolic defects. HTx may benefit WD patients with ALF, either as temporary support until chelation treatment shows its effect or as a definitive cure through repopulation of the liver with healthy donor cells, as shown in animal models of ew. Although clinical trials of HTx have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in different etiologies of IHA, similar evidence remains to be demonstrated in cases of WD.

134,D-penicillamine versus zinc sulfate as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease (WD) receiving D-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as first-line therapy. METHODS: In total, 143 consecutive patients diagnosed with symptomatic WD from January 2005 to December 2009, followed up to December 2010, were included. The decision on first-line treatment was made individually after discussion with the patient. Physicians did not have a clear preference for one drug over the other. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neurological (DPA, 35; ZS, 21) and hepatic (DPA, 36; ZS, 51) presentation. RESULTS: Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with neurologic WD scheduled for APD were similarly likely to discontinue first-line therapy as patients receiving ZS (20% vs. 24% at final follow-up), with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2-3.5). In patients with hepatic WD, this probability was significantly higher for APD (31% vs. 12%; adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9-9.9), especially in the first 6 months. Early worsening occurred only in patients with neurological WD, with no differences between the two treatment groups (35% vs. 19%; OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.7-10.8). Neurological improvement and lowering of liver enzymes were achieved with similar frequency. APD compliance was better in hepatic patients (97% vs. 80%) but not in neurological patients (91% vs. 81%). Adverse drug effects were more common with DPA (15% vs. 3%). CONCLUSIONS: DPA and ZS are effective in most patients with WD. Neither treatment appears to be clearly superior.

Aberrations in copper homeostasis can create favorable conditions for the superoxide-producing redox cycle and oxidative tissue damage. Medications used in the treatment of WD aim to remove accumulated copper and normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood. In the present study, the effect of copper stripping treatment on copper metabolism and systemic antioxidant capacity parameters was analyzed. Patients with previously untreated WD (TNWD) (n = 33), those treated with anti-copper drugs (TWD) (n = 99), and healthy controls (n = 99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients were characterized by decreased copper metabolism parameters as well as decreased total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) level, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase, compared to controls. TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolic parameters, higher total AOP, and higher GSH levels than TWD individuals; however, no difference was observed between these two groups of patients with respect to the rest of the antioxidant capacity parameters. Patients who had received treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate did not differ in terms of parameters of copper metabolism or antioxidant capacity, except for GPx, which was lower in individuals treated with D-penicillamine. These data suggest that anti-copper treatment affects copper metabolism and enhances, but does not normalize, natural antioxidant capacity in WD patients. We propose to carry out studies aimed at evaluating the usefulness of antioxidants and selenium as complementary therapy in WD.",,"Gromadzka, G.;Karpinska, A.;Przybylkowski, A.;Litwin, T.;Wierzchowska-Ciok, A.;Dziezyc, K.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2014,Feb,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10534-013-9694-3,0,1,
136,Worsening of Wilson's disease after penicillamine therapy,"BACKGROUND: Penicillamine is standard therapy for Wilson's disease (WD), but some patients have paradoxical worsening. Predictors of such deterioration have not been evaluated. This study documents the frequency and predictors of deterioration after treatment in WD. METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients with neurological WD and 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Clinical, laboratory, abdominal ultrasound and cranial magnetic resonance findings with and without worsening were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months or earlier if necessary. Impairment was defined as a >10% worsening in baseline Burke-Fahn-Marsden score or the appearance of a new neurologic sign. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 13 years and 13 were women. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened after treatment; 10 in 1 month, 7 in 1-3 months and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Impairment was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and evidence of chronic liver disease. None of the asymptomatic patients after zinc therapy deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: In the deteriorating group, discontinuation of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 improved on trientine therapy, and 4 continued to deteriorate up to 3 months. 30.2% of WD patients deteriorated after penicillamine, especially those with chronic liver disease, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

137,Treatment compatible with anti-copper agents prevents clinically manifest Wilson's disease in presymptomatic patients,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that leads to dysfunction of affected tissues, primarily in the liver and brain. Anti-copper treatment should prevent clinically manifest WD in presymptomatic patients, but this has not been supported by strong evidence. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of treatment in clinically presymptomatic patients, with special emphasis on patient compliance with treatment. METHODS: Data from 87 consecutive patients without clinical symptoms of WD who were identified between 1957 and 2009 by family screening were analyzed. Since diagnosis, all of them were treated with zinc sulfate (Zn) (66.7%) or D-penicillamine (DPA) (33.3%). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 years (range 3-52), 55 (63%) patients remained without clinical symptoms, 13 (15%) developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 21 (24%) developed liver dysfunction, including five deaths. of liver failure. Noncompliance was observed for at least three consecutive months in 39 patients, and in 29 cases it lasted for more than 12 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the odds of developing symptomatic WD were independently increased by noncompliance (odds ratio 24.0, 95% confidence interval 6.0-99.0). Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients who were compliant with treatment were significantly more likely to remain symptom-free, and their overall survival was similar to the survival rate seen in the general population. CONCLUSION: The use of anti-copper agents in clinically presymptomatic patients diagnosed with WD allows effective prevention of clinically manifest disease. However, adherence to therapy is extremely important.

138,Mowat-Wilson syndrome: deafness in the first Egyptian case conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic disease caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions of the homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene that binds to the zinc finger E-box. The syndrome is characterized by typical facial features, moderate to severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and variable congenital malformations, including Hirschsprung's disease, genital anomalies, congenital heart disease, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and ocular defects. The prevalence of Mowat-Wilson syndrome is currently unknown, but it appears that Mowat-Wilson syndrome is underdiagnosed, particularly in patients without Hirschsprung disease. We present here the first Egyptian case of Mowat-Wilson syndrome that was conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The patient manifested a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, a novel feature that had not previously been reported in cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome. This report describes the first Egyptian patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome who was conceived after intracytoplasmic sperm injection and provides new evidence for the inclusion of deafness among the congenital defects of the syndrome.

These metals are involved in multiple redox reactions and their abnormal accumulation can cause significant damage to the liver and other organs. Over the last several decades, clinicians have developed a better understanding of these metals and their mechanism of action. In addition, sophisticated molecular genetic testing techniques are now available that make diagnostic testing less invasive.

140,Evaluation of trace elements in the human brain using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"Recent brain research reveals an important role for trace elements in various diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Wilson's disease. Most of the published tissue concentrations date back decades and were assessed by various methods. Little is known about hemispheric differences, trace element correlation, or age-dependent changes in the human brain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine trace element concentrations in different human brain regions after whole-brain formalin fixation. 549 samples from 13 brain regions were investigated in 11 deceased subjects with no known history of brain pathology. Regional wet-to-dry mass ratios and concentrations of iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, calcium, and zinc were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cortical gray matter revealed higher water content (wet-to-dry mass ratio 5.84-6.40) than white matter regions (wet-to-dry mass ratio 2.95-3.05). Element concentrations showed specific regional differences. A good linear correlation of concentrations between elements was found for iron/copper as well as for manganese/magnesium (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). Significant interhemispheric differences were found for copper in the occipital white matter, for magnesium and calcium in the putamen, and for iron and copper in the temporal white matter. An age-dependent increase in cortical gray matter was observed for calcium, for magnesium in all regions except cortical gray matter, for copper in the substantia nigra, and for zinc in the occipital cortex. The trace element concentrations presented can serve as a fundamental basis for future brain research. The wet-to-dry mass ratios allow comparison with reference data from other studies.

141,Potent and long-lasting inhibition of human P2X2 receptors by copper,"P2X receptors are ion channels activated by ATP. In rodents these channels are modulated by zinc and copper. Zinc is released along with the neurotransmitter at some synapses and can modulate neuronal activity, but the role of copper in the brain is unclear. Rat P2X2 receptors show potentiation by 2-100 mM zinc or copper in the presence of a submaximal concentration of ATP, but are inhibited by zinc or copper at concentrations greater than 100 mM. In contrast, human P2X2 (hP2X2) receptors do not show potentiation and are strongly inhibited by zinc in the range of 2-100 ÂµM. The effect of copper on hP2X2 is of interest because there are human brain disorders in which copper concentration is altered. We found that hP2X2 receptors are strongly inhibited by copper (IC50 = 40 nM). ATP responsiveness recovered extremely slowly after copper washing, with full recovery requiring more than 1 hour. ATP binding facilitated copper binding but not disbinding of this inhibitory site. A mutant receptor in which the first six extracellular cysteines, C(1-6)S, were deleted showed normal inhibition of copper; however, reducing agents dramatically accelerated recovery from copper inhibition in wild-type hP2X2 and the C(1-6)S mutant, indicating that the final two disulfide bonds are required to maintain the copper binding site. high affinity. The three histidine residues required for normal zinc inhibition were also required for normal copper inhibition. Humans with untreated Wilson's disease have excessive amounts of copper in the brain. The high copper sensitivity of hP2X2 receptors suggests that they are not functional in these patients. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Punthambaker, S.;Hume, R.

Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, drooling, oromandibular dystonia (occasional grimacing), and mild dysarthria. The patient's symptoms decreased after treatment with d-penicillamine was started. No further deterioration was observed after copper chelation therapy was started. The authors diagnosed clomipramine-induced acute focal dystonia. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation were started; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed.

Thirty-five WD patients were enrolled. Intravenous DMPS was given in cross combination with oral PCA alternately which was practiced repeatedly, all with Zinc in the interim. During treatment, clinical observations and 24-hour urinary copper excretion, as well as adverse drug effects, were recorded and analyzed. Although the incidence of adverse effects was not significantly different after treatment with intravenous DMPS or oral PCA, 24-hour urine copper levels tended to be higher after short-term intravenous DMPS than oral PCA. Adverse effects in the course of intravenous DMPS were mainly neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reaction, and bleeding tendency. Compared with oral PCA alone or intravenous DMPS alone, such repeated crossover combination therapy could avoid as far as possible continuous adverse drug effects or poor curative effect and was less likely to discontinue treatment in WD patients. Improved or recovered liver function could be observed in 71% of patients, relief of neurological symptoms in 50% of patients, and disappearance of hematuria in 70% of patients during the follow-up period of 6 months to 5 years after said combined chelation. regime. Repeated chelation therapy with oral penicillamine in cross-combination with intravenous DMPS could alternatively be more beneficial for WD patients to relieve symptoms, avoid ongoing adverse drug effects, and maintain lifelong therapy.",,"Xu, S.

147,"Wilson's disease, 100 years later","Texts published in 1912, 100 years ago, by Sir K. Wilson on his homonymous disease in Brain, The Lancet and La Revue Neurologique highlight the relevance of his descriptions in the light of current knowledge. Wilson's invocation of an ""unknown toxin"" appears today as a prophetic insight since the presence of excess copper in the liver was first mentioned a year later, while the role of copper in this disease was not described until 1929. Progress has been made to better understand the physiology of Wilson's disease (WD). The ATP7B gene involved in WD is located on chromosome 13 and to date more than 500 mutations and 100 polymorphisms have been identified. Phenotypic expression is highly variable, even within the same family. This can be explained in part by environmental factors such as nutrition. Modulatory genes are also involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Most of the symptoms seen in WD were already described in detail by Wilson in 1912, but further advances were made over the next 100 years, helping physicians to diagnose WD. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the most frequent expressions of the disease. Other extrahepatic features include renal manifestations, osteoarticular disorders, myocardial abnormalities, endocrine disorders, accounting for a multisystem disease. The diagnosis of the disease is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, biological, radiological and genetic data and new tools (magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, relative interchangeable copper...) that allow the delay in diagnosis to be reduced. The therapeutic findings have also changed the prognosis of the disease. Treatment is based on the use of copper chelators to promote excretion of copper from the body (D-penicillamine and Triethylenetetramine) and zinc salts to reduce copper absorption. Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be a promising treatment. Although significant progress has been made during this century, many physiological aspects of this disease remain unknown and require more research to find answers in the next 100 years.

TMS was performed using a figure-eight coil connected to the Magstim 200 stimulator. Resting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the right first dorsal interosseous were recorded. Resting motor threshold (RMT) was determined using standard techniques and central motor conduction time (CMCT) using the 'F' wave method. The comparison was made with control data from our laboratory. Dysarthria was the presenting symptom in 5 patients (38.5%) and chorea, tremors, dystonia, and abnormal gait in 2 patients each (15.4%). RMT was recorded in 10 patients and not recorded in 3. Compared with controls, patients in whom RMT could be recorded had a significantly higher mean RMT (80.9 +/- 14.8 vs. 41, 1 +/- 7, p<0.0001) and CMCT (6.7 +/- 0.5 ms vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 ms, p<0.0001). In 2 of the 3 patients with unrecordable RMT, MEP with active contraction could be obtained. The FCTC in these 2 patients was also prolonged.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 53 pediatric patients with Wilson's disease treated at the Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland between 1996 and 2011 with zinc sulfate. Patients were diagnosed with Wilson's disease according to the Ferenci scoring system, with 49 cases confirmed by mutation analysis. Data on the zinc sulfate dosage schedule, side effects, and treatment efficacy and toxicity were collected and recorded in the patient's medical record at each hospital visit. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis for the entire cohort was 10 years (range, 2.5-17 years). The duration of zinc sulfate treatment was 83.3 weeks (range, 8-344 weeks). Side effects, all of gastrointestinal origin, were observed in 21 patients (40%, 9 men and 12 women), regardless of duration of therapy. Thirteen of the 21 patients were older than 10 years. The most common ATP7B mutation was p.H1069Q. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, performed in 7 patients (33.3%) suffering from severe and persistent abdominal pain, revealed gastrointestinal ulcerations or erosions with negative Helicobacter pylori tests in all investigated subjects. The 7 patients mentioned above were treated with proton pump inhibitors.

155,"Treatment of Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism","Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper deposition in the brain, liver; cornea and other organs. Copper overload inevitably leads to progressive liver and neurological dysfunction. Copper overload in patients with Wilson's disease is caused by impaired biliary pathway for excretion of dietary copper. A combination of neurological, psychiatric, and liver symptoms can make the diagnosis of Wilson's disease challenging. Most symptoms appear in the second and third decades of life. The disease affects between one in 30,000 and one in 100,000 individuals and is fatal if left untreated. There are currently five drugs available to treat Wilson's disease: British Anti-Lewisite; D-penicillamine; Trientine; zinc sulfate or acetate; and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Each drug can reduce copper levels and/or transform copper into a metabolically inert form that is unavailable to the patient.

Between 2000 and 2009, eight patients with WD who had been referred to our institution for LT were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the patients was 15.9 years (range, 7-37 years). Four patients could not receive HT because there were no available donors. All four patients were treated with chelating agent medication. Three of them (two of two patients with fulminant WD and one of two with cirrhotic WD) who did not undergo LT are still alive and doing well with stable liver function tests. Only one of the patients with cirrhotic WD who did not undergo LT died of liver failure. Even among the four patients who underwent LT, one with fulminant WD recovered from hepatic encephalopathy with apheresis and chelating agent therapy. Subsequently, he required LT due to severe neutropenia due to d-penicillamine. The other three patients who underwent LT recovered and have been doing well. Some of the patients with WD can recover and avoid PT with medical treatment.

159,Update on zinc deficiency and excess in pediatric clinical practice,"The critical importance of adequate zinc status for human health, including normal growth and development, is indisputable. The high prevalence of zinc deficiency globally and its importance to public health have been well documented through large-scale randomized controlled trials of zinc supplementation. However, similar evidence in the clinical setting is much less available due to the non-specific features of zinc deficiency and the lack of sensitive biomarkers to detect zinc deficiency, especially mild severity. Current understanding of zinc homeostasis indicates that the main determinants of zinc absorption are the amount of zinc ingested and dietary phytate, the latter having a major effect on zinc bioavailability. Under normal as well as many pathological conditions, the gastrointestinal tract is the main site of zinc loss resulting from endogenous zinc secretion in the lumen and subsequent excretion in the feces. The amount excreted depends on the state of the host, the amount reabsorbed, and sometimes the presence of pathophysiologic conditions such as diarrhea and steatorrhea. Evaluation in the clinical setting dictates that the clinician obtain a careful medical and dietary history, recognize clinical presentations in which zinc adequacy may be compromised, and link this risk to nonspecific but plausible manifestations of deficiency. Examples discussed in this article include primary zinc deficiency due to inadequate diet (breastfed older infants or young children without zinc-rich complementary foods); genetically based deficiency (acrodermatitis enteropathica, acquired lactogenic zinc deficiency), and secondary acquired deficiency in low birth weight and prematurity, gastrointestinal and liver disease, and cystic fibrosis. The evidence for the efficacy of pharmacologically dosed zinc therapy for two conditions, Wilson's disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections, is also discussed. Copyright Â© 2013 S.

160,Inborn errors of copper metabolism,"Two copper transporting ATPases are essential for copper homeostasis in mammals: ATP7A, which mediates copper uptake in the gastrointestinal tract and copper delivery to the brain, and ATP7B, which mediates copper excretion by the liver into the brain. bile. Mutations in ATP7A can cause three distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a recently identified allelic variant restricted to motor neurons called chromosome-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. X. These three disorders show variable neurologic findings and ages of onset. Menkes disease presents in the first months of life with growth retardation, developmental delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities beginning in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy presents even later, often not until adolescence or early adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2. These disorders can be treated by copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause only one known phenotype, Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric problems may present symptoms between the ages of 10 and 40. There are excellent treatment options for Wilson's disease, based on copper chelation. In the last 2 years (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive conditions of copper metabolism have been recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter necessary for the acetylation of one or more proteins of copper, 2) CCS deficiency caused by mutations in the copper chaperone of SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which revealed that mutations in the sigma1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 (AP-1) have deleterious effects on the ATP7A and ATP7B trafficking.

From a dermatological point of view, penicillamine was found to be useful in the treatment of systemic sclerosis. Successful therapeutic uses of penicillamine have been hampered by its numerous adverse effects, both cutaneous and extracutaneous. It is unique in that it causes a variety of dermatologic manifestations including (1) acute hypersensitivity reactions, (2) dermatopathies characterized by abnormalities of elastic fibers including elastosis perforans serpiginosa and pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum, (3) autoimmune disorders such as pemphigus and penicillamine-induced lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, and (4) miscellaneous dermatoses resulting from undefined mechanisms. These cutaneous adverse effects may correlate with the dose and duration of penicillamine therapy, as well as the disease being treated.",,"Ishak, R.;Abbas, O.",2013,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40257-013-0022-z,0,0,

Liver histology revealed macrovesicular steatosis with fibrosis, but no cirrhosis. The disease was treated with D-penicillamine for 3 years until acute discomfort in the right hypochondrium allowed the detection of a multifocal hepatocarcinoma, which was successfully resected. Histological examination confirmed the malignancy of the 4 lesions, which were classified according to Edmondson and Steiner as poorly differentiated grade 3 hepatocarcinoma. The non-tumorous parenchyma showed 80% steatosis with balloon cells, lobular inflammation, septal fibrosis but no cirrhosis.

163,Brain accumulation of metals in Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: Brain accumulation of metals is suggested in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative disorders. In Wilson's disease (WD), only copper has been examined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concentrations of copper, iron, manganese, and zinc in autopsy tissue samples from the brains of WD patients. METHODS: The study material consisted of 17 brains (12 WD patients, 5 controls) obtained at autopsy. Four different regions of each brain were sampled: frontal cortex, putamen, pons, and dentate nucleus. The content of copper, manganese and zinc was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and iron was evaluated by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results were analyzed according to selected clinical variables. RESULTS: Copper content increased homogeneously in all structures investigated in WD brains compared to controls (41.0 +/- 18.6 Âµg/g vs. 5.4 +/- 1.8 Âµg/g). g, P<0.01). Mean concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc were similar in WD and controls, but iron level in the dentate nucleus was higher in WD compared to controls (56.8 +/- 14.1 mug/g vs. 32 .6 +/- 6.0 Âµg/g). g; P<0.05). Gender, age, and type and duration of WD treatment did not affect brain metal storage, but some correlations were observed between disease duration and copper and iron accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: During the course of WD, copper accumulates equally in different parts of the brain. Zinc and manganese do not appear to be involved in WD pathology, but elevated levels of iron were found in the dentate nucleus. Therefore, further studies on brain iron accumulation in WD are needed.

165,Trientine reduces BACE1 activity and mitigates amyloidosis via the AGE/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that the transition metal copper may play an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine), a selective CuII chelator, is a commonly used treatment for Wilson's disease to decrease accumulated copper and thus reduce oxidative stress. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 3-month course of trientine (Trien) treatment on amyloidosis in 7-month-old double-transgenic amyloid-beta precursor protein (Abeta) and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1). (Tg) AD model mice. RESULTS: We found that Trien reduced the level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and decreased Abeta deposition and synapse loss in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, we found that Trien blocked the AGE receptor (RAGE), downregulated the beta site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), inhibited amyloidogenic APP cleavage, and subsequently reduced Abeta levels. In vitro, in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant APP, Trien-mediated downregulation of BACE1 occurred through inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. INNOVATION: In this study, we show for the first time that Trien inhibits the amyloidogenic pathway, including downregulation of RAGE and NF-kappaB. CONCLUSION: Trien could mitigate amyloidosis in AD by inhibiting the RAGE/NF-kappaB/BACE1 pathway. Our study demonstrates that Trien may be a viable therapeutic strategy for the intervention and treatment of AD and other AD-like pathologies.",,"Wang, C. Y.;Xie, J. W.;Xu, Y.;Wang, T.;Cai, J.

166,Discovery of human zinc deficiency: its impact on human health and disease,"The essentiality of zinc in humans was established in 1963. During the last 50 years, tremendous advances have been observed in the clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans. The main contributing factor to zinc deficiency is the high protein consumption of phytate-containing cereals in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion people may be zinc deficient. Conditional zinc deficiency has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease and other chronic diseases. The main clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs did not live past the age of 25 and died from intercurrent infections. In 1963, we knew of only 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know of >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells is involved in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration and is highly effective to decrease the incidence. of infection in the elderly. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity, but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",,"Prasad, A. S.",2013,2001-03-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.112.003210,0,0,

168,ZEB2 zinc finger nonsense mutations lead to hypomorphic alleles and a mild Mowat-Wilson syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomalies syndrome with distinctive facial Gestalt intellectual disability (ID), commonly associated with microcephaly, epilepsy, agenesis of the corpus callosum, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital malformations, and Hirschsprung's disease. (HSCR). MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. Most mutations lead to haploinsufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. So far, only three missense mutations have been reported; none of which reside in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three new missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro, and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. The phenotype of the patients included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but not microcephaly, heart defects, or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all three mutations prevented binding to and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Leveraging zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using mutant and wild-type (WT) human ZEB2 mRNAs. A variable mutation-dependent embryo rescue was observed, in correlation with the severity of the patients' phenotype. Our data provide evidence that these nonsense mutations cause partial loss of ZEB2 function, suggesting that its function is not limited to E-cadherin repression. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Ultimately, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS should be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.",,"Ghoumid, J.;Drevillon, L.;Alavi-Naini, S.

169,The effect of zinc and the role of p53 in copper-induced cellular stress responses,"Metals can directly or indirectly cause an increase in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, and this can lead to programmed cell death. Several previous studies have shown that zinc (Zn) modulates mitogenic activity through several signaling pathways, such as AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), AP-1, and p53 . The exact role that Zn plays in the regulation of apoptosis remains ambiguous. Intracellular free Zn modulates p53 activity and stability, and excess Zn alters p53 protein structure and downregulates p53 DNA binding. The accumulation of copper (Cu) causes apoptosis that appears to be mediated by DNA damage and the subsequent activation of p53. Cu can also displace Zn from its normal binding site on p53, resulting in abnormal protein folding and disruption of p53 function. Despite induction of the tumor suppressor p53, Cu accumulation in the liver significantly increases the risk of cancerous neoplasms in both humans and rats, suggesting that p53 function may be impaired in these cells. It is generally understood that imbalances in Cu and Zn levels can lead to a higher prevalence of p53 mutations. An increased number of p53 mutations have been found in liver samples from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). High levels of the p53 mutation most likely contribute to cancer pathogenesis in people with WD, but the cause and effect are unclear. The p53 protein also plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of metallothionein, indicating a new regulatory role for p53. This review discusses the central role of p53 and the redox-inert metal Zn in cellular stress responses induced by the redox-active biometal Cu.

We describe a patient diagnosed with WD who became neurologically disabled after treatment with trientine. In a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, brain MRI showed increased areas of high signal intensity compared to baseline brain MRI.

171,Complex formation equilibria of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with triethylenetetramine and its mono- and diacetyl metabolites,"Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TETA), or trientine, is a therapeutic molecule that has long been used as a copper chelating agent for the second-line treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. More recently, it has also been used as an experimental therapeutic molecule in diabetes where it improves heart structure in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy. TETA is metabolized by acetylation, leading to the formation of two major metabolites in humans and other mammals, monoacetyl-TETA (MAT) and diacetyl-TETA (DAT). These metabolites have been identified in the plasma and urine of healthy and diabetic subjects treated with TETA, and could play a role in TETA-mediated copper chelation and restoration of physiological copper regulation in diabetes. In this sense, a potentiometric and spectrophotometric study of the formation equilibria of Cu(II) complexes of TETA, MAT and DAT is presented here, to provide a complete evaluation of the stoichiometries of the complexes formed and their relative stability constants. . A potentiometric study of the corresponding Zn(II) complexes has also been performed, to assess any possible interference with TETA-mediated Cu(II) binding by this second physiological transition metal ion, which is present in similar concentrations in human plasma and also binds to TETA. An ESI-MS study of these systems has confirmed the mechanisms of complex formation established from the potentiometric and spectrophotometric results and, in addition, has provided direct information on the stoichiometry of the complexes formed in solution. Taken together, these data show that the 1:1 complexes formed with Cu(II) and Zn(II) have different degrees of protonation. The stability of the complexes of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with the three ligands, evaluated by the parameters pCu and pZn, decreases with the introduction of the acetyl groups. However, the stability of Cu(II) complexes with MAT is high enough to allow their participation in the patient's copper uptake. A speciation study of the behavior of TETA and MAT with Cu(II) in the presence of Zn(II) at periphysiological plasma concentrations is also presented. Although Zn(II) did not prevent copper binding, the possibility was raised that prolonged treatment with TETA might alter the homeostatic regulation of this essential metal ion. The lack of reliable stability constants in the literature on the interaction of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with major transport proteins in plasma is also briefly considered.",,"Nurchi, V.

172,A new HPLC electrochemical detection approach for the determination of D-penicillamine in skin samples,"D-penicillamine is a thiol drug used primarily for Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystinuria. Adverse effects during normal use of the drug are common and may include skin lesions. To evaluate its toxic effects in clinical cases, an original method has been developed based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled with amperometric detection in a specific biological matrix such as the skin. Chromatographic analysis of D-penicillamine was performed on a C18 column using a mixture of acidic phosphate buffer and methanol as mobile phase. Good sensitivity was obtained by oxidizing the molecule at +0.95 V relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Chemical reduction of D-penicillamine-protein disulfide bonds using dithioerythritol combined with microwave was necessary to determine the total amount of D-penicillamine in skin samples. Another solid phase extraction procedure was implemented on C18 cartridges for sample cleanup. The entire analytical procedure was validated: high extraction yield values (>91.0%) and satisfactory precision (RSD<6.8%) were obtained. It was successfully applied to skin samples from a patient who had previously been under long-term treatment with high doses of the drug and had severe D-penicillamine-related dermatoses. Therefore, the method seems suitable for the analysis of D-penicillamine in skin tissues. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Saracino, M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 60 patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, and 40 patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. The patients were divided into two groups: progressors (patients who presented worsening of at least one unit of fibrosis) and non-progressors (patients who presented stable or improved fibrosis scores). RESULTS: A total of 33/40 (83%) patients (non-progressors) showed stable or improved liver histology. Seven of 40 (17%) patients (progressors) showed worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between histologic findings and clinical parameters or initial presentation.

175,Do we need authorized orphan drugs when compound drugs are available?,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND PURPOSE: Orphan drugs are used to diagnose, prevent or treat a rare disease. This commentary aims to present a series of case studies that question the need to designate compound medicines with a long history of effective use, which is well supported by published clinical evidence. COMMENT: Before the market introduction of orphan drugs, our hospital pharmacy compounded drugs for various rare diseases. Examples include amifampridine for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (Firdapse()), ibuprofen for the treatment of neonatal patent ductus arteriosus (Pedea()), and zinc acetate for the treatment of Wilson's disease (Wilzin() ). Several 'non-orphan' pharmaceuticals, used off-label for the treatment of rare diseases, that became orphan drugs include Hydrea() for the treatment of sickle cell syndrome (Siklos()) and Viagra() for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Revatio()). WHAT'S NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our view, as our examples indicate, a better balance needs to be struck between orphan drug development along newly established regulatory pathways and pragmatic use of compounded pharmaceuticals and off-label products. evidence-based label. use of commercial products already available. The best way to meet the needs of society would be to focus orphan drug development on rare diseases for which there is a high unmet medical need.

177,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism, resulting in a pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. Characteristics of the disease are the presence of liver disease, neurologic symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings. The main neurological symptoms in WD are dysatria, dyspraxia, ataxia, and parkinsonian-like extrapyramidal signs. Changes in the basal ganglia on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are characteristic features of the disease. In the presence of liver cirrhosis, some features may resemble hepatic encephalopathy. Symptoms and MRI abnormalities may be completely reversible with treatment with zinc or copper chelators. Enhancement can be monitored by serial recording of brainstem-evoked responses. The basic defect is impaired copper trafficking in hepatocytes. ATP7B is the gene product of the WD gene located on chromosome 13 and resides in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, transporting copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and excretion in bile. While around 40% of patients present with neurological symptoms, little is known about the role of copper and ATP7B in the central nervous system. In some areas of the brain, such as the pineal gland, ATP7B is expressed and functionally active. Mounting evidence supports an important role for metals in neurobiology. Two proteins associated with neurodegeneration are copper-binding proteins (1) amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, and (2) Prion protein, associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . A major source of free radical production in the brain is derived from copper. To prevent metal-mediated oxidative stress, cells have developed complex metal transport systems. APP is an important regulator of neuronal copper homeostasis and has a copper-binding domain (CuBD). The surface location of this site, the structural homology of CuBD to copper chaperones, and the role of APP in neuronal copper homeostasis are consistent with CuBD acting as a neuronal metallotransporter. There are several copper-containing enzymes in the brain, such as dopamine beta hydroxylase or Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Its function can be altered by copper overload. WD appears to be associated with a dopaminergic deficit. Mutations in the SOD1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The survival of transgenic mice with a mutant SOD1 that fails to incorporate Cu((2+)) into its active site was enhanced by copper depletion. Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in which copper pathologically accumulates primarily in the liver and later in the neurological system and many other organs and tissues. The presence of liver disease, neurological symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings are hallmarks of the disease.

178,Pathophysiology and clinical features of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. ATP7B is the gene product of the Wilson's disease gene located on chromosome 13 and resides in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, transporting copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and excretion in bile. Mutations of the gene result in impaired copper trafficking into and through hepatocytes. More than 200 mutations of the Wilson's disease gene have been found, the most common being H1069Q (in Europe) and R778L (in Asia). Wilson's disease can present under a variety of clinical conditions, most commonly liver and/or neuropsychiatric disease. The pathogenesis of hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease is a direct consequence of copper accumulation. The presence of copper causes oxidative stress that results in cell destruction. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease requires a combination of a variety of clinical symptoms, biochemical tests and detection of genetic mutations, which are the basis of a score proposed by a group of international experts. Initial treatment for symptomatic patients should include a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine). Treatment of presymptomatic patients or maintenance therapy can also be achieved with zinc.

179,Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) prevents copper-mediated free radical formation in vitro,"Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) is an iron chelator with antioxidant activity, low toxicity, and is useful in the experimental treatment of iron overload diseases. Previous X-ray diffraction studies have revealed that PIH also forms a complex with Cu(II). Since the main drug of choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease, d-penicillamine, causes a number of side effects, there is an urgent need to develop alternative copper chelating agents for clinical use. These chelators must also have antioxidant activity because oxidative stress is associated with copper overload in the brain and liver. In this work we tested the ability of PIH to prevent free radical formation in vitro mediated by Cu(II), ascorbate and dissolved O2. The degradation of 2-deoxyribose mediated by 10 microM Cu(II) and 3 mM ascorbate was completely inhibited by 10 microM PIH (I50 = 6 microM) or 20 microM d-penicillamine (I50 = 10 microM). The antioxidant efficacy of PIH was unchanged with increasing concentrations (from 1 to 15 mM) of the hydroxyl radical scavenging molecule, 2-deoxyribose, indicating that PIH does not act as a hydroxyl scavenger. On the other hand, the efficiency of PIH (against copper-mediated 2-deoxyribose degradation and ascorbate oxidation) was inversely proportional to Cu(II) concentration, suggesting competition between PIH and ascorbate for complexation with Coolie). An almost complete inhibitory effect by PIH was observed when the PIH:copper ratio was 1:1. A similar result was obtained with the measurement of O2 absorption mediated by copper plus ascorbate. Furthermore, spectral studies of the interaction of copper and PIH showed a peak at 455 nm and also indicated the formation of a stable complex of Cu(II) with PIH in a 1:1 ratio. These data demonstrated that PIH prevents the formation of hydroxyl radicals and oxidative damage of 2-deoxyribose by forming a complex with Cu(II) that does not react with ascorbate (first step of the reactions leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals). from Cu(II), ascorbate and O2) and does not participate in Haber-Weiss reactions.",,"Hermes-Lima, M.;Goncalves, M.

180,Structural and functional insights into the copper transporting ATPase of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The gene for this disorder has been cloned and identified to encode a copper transporting ATPase (ATP7B), a member of a large family of cation transporters, the P-type ATPases. In addition to the core elements common to all P-type ATPases P, Wilson's copper-transporting ATPase has a large cytoplasmic N-terminus composed of six heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains, each of which contains the GMT/HCXXC copper-binding sequence motif. Extensive studies addressing the functional, regulatory, and structural aspects of heavy metal transport by heavy metal transporters in general have provided great insights into copper transport by the Wilson copper-transporting ATPase. The findings of these studies have been used in conjunction with the homology model of the copper-transporting ATPases of Wilson's disease based on the X-ray structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-ATPase, to present a hypothetical model of the Copper transport mechanism by copper transporting ATPases.

181,"Serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine copper assessments in celiac patients","The objective of the study is to evaluate the serum levels of copper, ceruloplasmin and copper in 24-h urine in celiac patients. Serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine determinations were evaluated in celiac (n = 32), Crohn's (n = 25), Wilson (n = 11), and a healthy group (n = 35) patients. Serum and 24-hour urine zinc levels, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, sedimentation, and CRP were also measured. Results were statistically evaluated and significance was accepted as significant if P < 0.05. In celiacs, urine copper levels were high (52 +/- 29 microg/day, P < 0.000) but serum copper was the same as in controls (105 +/- 16 microg/dl, P < 0.000). 0.158). High urinary copper in celiac patients occurred in women (56 +/- 30 microg/day) and in men (33 +/- 17 microg/day, P < 0.115). Most of the celiac patients were women (P < 0.001). Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels in all groups were higher in women than in men, and this was significant for serum copper in the control group (P < 0.045) and for ceruloplasmin in the Crohn's groups (P < 0.045). < 0.055) and control (P < 0.031). Serum (70 +/- 14 microg/dl, P < 0.000) and urine (25 +/- 15 microg/dl, P < 0.039) zinc levels in celiac patients were low. Ceruloplasmin levels were higher in celiac patients (337 +/- 64 U/l) and patients with Crohn's disease (366 +/- 47 U/l, P < 0.000). Correlations observed in the celiac (P < 0.029) and Crohn's (P < 0.024), celiac and Wilson (P < 0.001) and Crohn and Wilson (P < 0.001) groups between ceruloplasmin and copper parameters in 24-h urine. AST and ALT levels were higher in celiac and Wilson patients than in Crohn's patients and controls. Mean CRP levels were significantly higher in Crohn's than in others. Lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in celiacs. Statistically, while the mean iron, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels of the celiac and Crohn's groups were significantly lower than the normal and Wilson groups, they were similar in the Wilson and control groups. Serum copper (85 +/- 26 microg/dl, P < 0.158) and ceruloplasmin (219 +/- 83 U/l, P < 0.001) levels were low, and 24-hour urine copper levels were high ( 415 +/- 346 microg/day) in the Wilson group. Increased urinary loss may be another cause of copper deficiency in celiac women in addition to malabsorption, and this topic needs further investigation. Elevated urine copper levels in celiac women should not always be considered diagnostic of Wilson's disease.",,"Ince, A. T.;Kayadibi, H.;Soylu, A.;Ovunc, O.;Gultepe, M.;Toros, A.

An 11-year-old Japanese boy presented with ascites associated with biochemical liver damage. Laboratory tests ruled out participation of the hepatitis virus. Because urinary copper excretion was increased, Wilson's disease was highly suspicious, but the serum ceruloplasmin level was normal and Kayser-Fleischer rings were not detected by slit-lamp examination. Brain imaging was within normal limits. ATP7B analysis was negative for mutations. The liver sample showed cirrhosis associated with chronic active hepatitis. Almost all hepatocytes were positive for orcein-stained granules. Mallory bodies were found in some hepatocytes. Fat change was minimal and there were no glycogenated nuclei in the parenchyma. Combination regimens of trientine and zinc for 6 months improved the decompensated state of liver function. After 2.5 years of treatment, a second liver biopsy was performed. Post-treatment liver showed a complete disappearance of portal inflammation and a marked decrease in cuprothionein granules. Mallory's bodies disappeared from the parenchyma. An abundance of hepatocellular Mallory bodies and a large copper load confined to the liver may be specific for idiopathic copper toxicosis.",,"Hayashi, H.;Shinohara, T.;Goto, K.;Fujita, Y.;Murakami, Y.;Hattori, A.;Tatsumi, Y.;Shimizu, A.;Ichiki, T.",2012,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00795-011-0556-1,0,0,

187,Wilson's disease: two treatment modalities. Correlations with Pretreatment and Posttreatment Brain MRI,"INTRODUCTION: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in Wilson's disease (WD) show a lack of correlations between neurological and neuroimaging characteristics. Reports of long-term follow-up with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different treatment modalities are scarce. METHODS: Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent brain MRI before and after treatment to assess the range of abnormalities and the evolution over these different time periods. All patients underwent at least two MRIs at different intervals, up to 11 years after the start of treatment. MRI findings correlated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and treatment with two different drugs. Patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: D:-penicillamine (DP), zinc (Zn), and Zn after the appearance of severe intolerance to DP. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging before treatment showed, in all patients, lesions of hypersignal intensity on T2-weighted images and proton density bilaterally and symmetrically in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and the white matter of the brain. The most frequent neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disorders, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea and athetosis. CONCLUSIONS: From the neurological point of view, there was no difference in the evolution between the group treated exclusively with PD and the one treated with Zn. Analysis of MRIs with longer intervals after the start of treatment showed a trend of worsening neuroimaging, without neurological correspondence, among Zn-treated patients. The pattern of evolution of the neuroimaging was more favorable for the group that received exclusively PD.",,"da Costa Mdo, D.;Spitz, M.;Bacheschi, L. A.;Leite, C. C.;Lucato, L. T.;Barbosa, E.

189,Copper transport and Alzheimer's disease,"This brief review discusses copper transport in humans, with an emphasis on knowledge learned from one of the simplest model organisms, yeast. There is an increased focus on copper transport in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Copper homeostasis is essential for the well-being of all organisms, from bacteria to yeast to humans: survival depends on maintaining the copper supply needed by many enzymes, which depend on copper for their activity, at the same time which ensures that there is no excess free copper. that would cause toxicity. A virtual orchestra of proteins is required to achieve copper homeostasis. For copper uptake, Cu(II) is first reduced to Cu(I) via a membrane-bound reductase. The reduced copper can then be internalized by a copper transporter where it is transferred to copper chaperones for specific transport and delivery to various organelles. Internal copper transporters, ATP7A and ATP7B, are important, notable for their role in the disorders of copper deficiency and toxicity, Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively. Metallothioneins and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase can protect against excess copper in cells. It is also clear that age, environment and lifestyle increasingly affect brain copper. Studies in AD suggest an important role for copper in the brain, and some AD therapies focus on copper mobilization in AD brains. Copper transport to the brain is complex and involves numerous players, including amyloid precursor protein, A beta peptide, and cholesterol. [References: 58]",,"Macreadie, I.

190,Clinical Correlation of Brain MRI Abnormalities and MRS in Wilson's Disease Patients,"BACKGROUND: The progression of Wilson's disease (WD), a disorder of copper metabolism, can be stopped by chelation therapy. However, neurological deficits may persist despite adequate treatment. MRI is used to evaluate WD patients, but previous attempts to correlate clinical progression with research findings have often been unsuccessful. OBJECTIVE: To identify markers visible on MRI that could help stratify disease severity and clarify the mechanism of persistent neurological deficit after treatment. METHODS: MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were performed in 17 patients with WD. Magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated semiquantitatively and used to locate volumes of interest (voxels) in the striatum for 1H-MRS. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormalities predominantly confined to those patients with neurological features of WD. 1H spectra showed a reduction of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (2.05 mM; p < 0.01) in those patients with neurological characteristics but not in patients without clinical neurological involvement (0.42 mM; p > 0 ,1) compared to patients of the same age. normal control subjects. Choline was also reduced in both groups of patients (0.08 mM, p < 0.01) compared to age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a biochemical correlate of tissue-specific dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease who develop neurologic features. These changes seem to be present despite previous clinical improvement and may imply the need for additional treatment.",,"Page, R. A.;Davie, C. A.;MacManus, D.;Miszkiel, K. A.;Walshe, J.

The appearance in 64.3% of a delayed wave III and/or prolongation of IPL III-V in patients with the neurological form makes pathological FAEP the most common form of the disorder, followed by disorders in MSEP, TSEP, MEP and T-VEP. Patients with the non-neurological form usually have normal values, although in isolated cases prolonged latency occurs.

203,Practical recommendations and new therapies for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation. The basic defect is a failure of the liver to excrete excess copper into the bile through loss in the feces. The accumulation of copper causes damage mainly to the liver and the brain. Patients typically present in the second to fourth decade of life with liver disease, movement disorder-type neurological disease, or a wide range of behavioral disorders. Because the manifestations of Wilson's disease are so varied, and the disease is so well disguised as something else, recognition of the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major problem, leading to serious underdiagnosis of the disease. illness. There are excellent therapies for both prophylaxis and treatment of Wilson's disease. The longer recognition and diagnosis are delayed, the greater the risk of permanent liver and/or brain damage. The availability of effective therapy and the risks of delayed therapy make diagnosis as early as possible critical. Once the disease is considered, a number of diagnostic steps can be undertaken that almost always establish or rule out the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. These include urine copper, blood ceruloplasmin, slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and liver biopsy with quantitative copper analysis. Currently, there are 4 drugs that are used as anti-copper agents in Wilson's disease. These are zinc, which blocks intestinal absorption of copper, penicillamine and trientine, which are chelators that increase urinary copper excretion, and tetrathiomolybdate, which forms a tripartite complex with copper and protein, and can block copper absorption. copper in the intestine, or convert copper into non-toxic blood. Zinc is clearly the treatment of choice, in our opinion, for maintenance therapy, for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient from the start, and for the treatment of the pregnant patient, due to its complete efficacy and absence of toxicity. For the initial treatment of the patient with mild hepatic insufficiency, we empirically use a combination of trientine and zinc. Trientine provides a strong, rapid negative copper balance, and zinc induces hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters hepatic copper. For the initial treatment of patients with neurological disease, we use an experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, which provides rapid and safe control of copper. These latter patients are at great risk of severe permanent neurologic worsening with penicillamine, and zinc is too slow-acting, in our judgment, to be optimal. [References: 46]",,"Brewer, G. J.",1995,Aug,,0,1,
204,Current therapy of chronic liver disease,"The study of chronic liver disease has been hampered by insufficient information regarding the pathogenesis of the many forms of hepatitis. Consequently, well-designed treatment strategies are often lacking. Wilson's disease is characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. Although d-penicillamine is clearly effective, its many side effects may not be tolerated by many patients. Trientine, oral zinc, and unithiol have shown promise as therapeutic alternatives. Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis responds well to prednisone and azathioprine. Cyclosporine has also produced clinical improvement in several case reports, but a comparison with current standard therapy has not yet been made. Recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) has demonstrated the ability to inhibit hepatitis B viral replication, and the combination of oral corticosteroids followed by IFN alpha is more effective than either agent alone in suppressing viral replication in patients with chronic active hepatitis B. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) currently has no standard medical treatment, but corticosteroids and methotrexate may have a future role in its treatment. Pharmacological treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been disappointing, and early reports of success with d-penicillamine were not confirmed in large, well-controlled trials. Although some reports of improvement with various agents have been described, larger studies are still needed. Alcoholic liver disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and several different medical avenues of treatment have been investigated by numerous investigators. The reported success with androgens and the antithyroid agent propylthiouracil in alcoholic liver disease will need confirmation from further research before these agents can be recommended for routine use. Finally, colchicine may be effective in reducing the rate of fibrosis in cirrhosis, but this has not yet been conclusively demonstrated. [References: 89]",,"Stavinoha, M. W.;Soloway, R.

214,Ion efflux systems involved in bacterial resistance to metals,"The study of the resistance of metal ions gives us important information about environmental processes and provides an understanding of the basic processes of life. This review concentrates on bacterial efflux systems for inorganic metal cations and anions, which have generally been found as resistance systems of bacteria isolated from metal-contaminated environments. The protein products of the genes involved are sometimes prototypes of new families of proteins or important new branches of known families. Sometimes a group of related proteins (and presumably the underlying physiological function) have yet to be defined. For example, efflux of the inorganic metal anion arsenite is mediated by a membrane protein that functions alone in Gram-positive bacteria but requires an additional ATPase subunit in some Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance to Cd2+ and Zn2+ in Gram-positive bacteria is the result of an efflux P-type ATPase that is related to bacterial and human copper transport P-type ATPases (defective in the human inherited diseases Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease). In contrast, resistance to Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ in Gram-negative bacteria is based on the action of proton-cation antiporters, members of a recently recognized family of proteins that have been implicated in various functions, such as resistance to metals/legume nodulation/cell division (hence the family is called RND). Another new family of proteins, named CDF for ""cation diffusion facilitator"", has as its prototype the CzcD protein, which is a regulatory component of a cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance determinant in the Gram-negative bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus. A family for the ChrA chromate resistance system in Gram-negative bacteria has not yet been defined. [References: 102]",,"Nies, D. H.;Silver, S.",1995,Feb,,0,0,

Plasma exchanges and blood transfusion were performed and the administration of D-penicillamine was started again. He gradually recovered and apparently had a good clinical course. However, on day 30, the second hemolytic crisis occurred and subsequent liver failure led to her death on day 50. At autopsy, her liver was cirrhotic and showed massive necrosis. Therefore, prophylactic oral administration of D-penicillamine and careful observation are recommended to prevent hemolytic crises during the perinatal period.",,"Shimono, N.;Ishibashi, H.;Ikematsu, H.;Kudo, J.;Shirahama, M.;Inaba, S.;Maeda, K.;Yamasaki, K.;Niho, Y.",1991,Feb,,0,0,

218,Copper and liver disease,"There has been limited progress in understanding the basic defect in Wilson's disease and the gene in question has been localized to chromosomal region 13q14. Zinc therapy has emerged as a definitive alternative to penicillamine administration, and some shortcomings and/or dangers of both forms of therapy have emerged as their mechanisms of action have been more closely studied. Tetrathymolybdate may have a place in treatment, especially when rapid formation of copper complexes is important. Hepatic copper accumulation occurs in a number of cholestatic diseases and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and can sometimes lead to neurological toxicity. Copper overload in the neonatal period, when biliary copper excretion is inefficient, can set up a vicious cycle of copper accumulation and liver damage in Indian childhood cirrhosis and less frequently in infants in other countries.

219,Prognosis of Wilson's disease in childhood,"Wilson's disease in childhood has several features that are different from those in adults. Disease progression tends to be rapid, hepatic manifestations are common, cerebral symptoms related to dystonia are predominant, and tremor is rare. Forty-nine children with Wilson's disease younger than 15 years were treated with D-penicillamine for 2 to 15 years. None of the presymptomatic patients subsequently developed any symptoms of the disease. The results of treatment in patients who had presented only liver symptoms were also excellent. However, neurologic manifestations associated with a history of jaundice or ascites responded less well to chelation. These observations clearly indicate that early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to ensure a normal life for children with Wilson's disease.",,"Arima, M.;Takeshita, K.;Yoshino, K.;Kitahara, T.;Suzuki, Y.",1977,2012-10-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
220,Effects of long-term treatment in Wilson's disease with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate.,"The results of treatment with D-penicillamine (DP) or zinc sulfate (Zn) have been compared in 67 cases of newly diagnosed Wilson's disease. All patients (7 with hepatic forms, 1 with psychiatric forms, and 59 with neurological or preclinical forms) were fully compliant. During 12 years of observation, 34 patients received dP and 33 Zn as primary treatment. Fifteen patients (44%) discontinued PD, in 10 cases due to side effects. Four (12%) patients discontinued Zn, in 2 cases due to side effects. One patient who received Zn deteriorated during the first few months after initiation of therapy. The efficacy of long-term treatment with DP and Zn was similar in those patients who were able to continue with the initial therapy. Zn was better tolerated than DP; we suggest, therefore, that it may be recommended as initial therapy for patients in the preclinical stage of Wilson's disease or with a neurological presentation of the disease. More observation is needed for patients with the hepatic and psychiatric forms of the disease.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Gajda, J.;Rodo, M.",1996,Mar,,1,1,

CSF copper concentration measurements were made from the start of therapy onwards in three patients and from 16 months after initial treatment onwards in the fourth. CSF copper levels decreased slowly over the years in parallel with clinical improvements and increased in one patient who discontinued treatment for 2 years. These findings confirm our hypothesis that CSF copper concentration is a valuable quantitative parameter reflecting the normalization of copper in the brain. Copper measurements during phases of initial neurological deterioration in two patients who received D-penicillamine, and in one patient who received D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate, revealed reduced levels of free copper in serum and copper in CSF.",,"Hartard, C.;Weisner, B.;Dieu, C.;Kunze, K.",1993,Dec,,0,0,

There was a severe reduction in striatal and extrastriatal rCMRGlc, as well as in the rate of accumulation of striatal [18F]MSP. After 1 year of D-penicillamine treatment, striatal and extrastriatal rCMRGlc and striatal [18F]MSP accumulation rate reached near-normal levels. It is hypothesized that recovery of motor functions due to copper capture therapy was associated with an increase in basal ganglia activity and a reexpression or upregulation of dopamine D2 receptors.",,"Schlaug, G.;Hefter, H.;Nebeling, B.;Engelbrecht, V.;Weiss, P.;Stocklin, G.;Seitz, R.

The patients were scanned using spin echo (SE) sequences; the neurologist looked for typical symptoms: dysarthria, tremor, ataxia, rigidity/bradykinesia, and chorea/dystonia. Pathologic MR findings thought to be secondary to this rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism were found in twenty-two subjects. Focal abnormalities were seen in the lentiform, thalamic, and caudate nuclei, as well as in the brainstem and white matter; these lesions were best demonstrated on T2-weighted sequences as hyperintense areas. In eight patients we found diffuse cerebral atrophy with consecutive widening of the ventricular system. Five subjects showed mild and nineteen severe neurological deficits. In general, there was no correlation between MRI findings and clinical neurological symptoms; the deterioration of the cellular metabolism that causes functional alterations of the brain precedes the morphological changes. During treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine, there appeared to be a gradual course of the disease. No shortening of T1 relaxation was observed due to the paramagnetic influence of copper; a possible explanation could be intracellular deposition; therefore, a proton-electron-dipolar-dipolar interaction would be impossible.",,"Prayer, L.;Wimberger, D.;Kramer, J.;Grimm, G.;Oder, W.;Imhof, H.",1990,,,0,0,

Serial examinations for 10 months after the start of D-penicillamine treatment revealed normalization of EMG responses. Pathophysiologically, the initially abnormal EMG responses were likely due to reversible impairment of impulse propagation along cortico-motor-neuronal pathways and/or reduced excitability of cortical cells due to altered function. of the basal ganglia.",,"Meyer, B.

In WD patients, cerebellar, striatal, and to a lesser extent cortical and thalamic rCMRGlc were significantly reduced compared to controls. Striatal rCMRGlc was significantly reduced in those 4 patients who had recently started decoppering therapy compared to striatal rCMRGlc measured in those 10 patients with a longer duration of medication. Caudate rCMRGlc was significantly correlated with various signs of extrapyramidal dysfunction. Cerebellar, thalamic, and cortical rCMRGlc were significantly correlated with the severity of pyramidal signs.

The few studies carried out with evoked potentials with the aim of identifying subclinical dysfunction in the three main sensory pathways have never shown alterations in patients without neurological manifestations. To verify this observation, we studied 12 patients suffering from Wilson's disease at a preneurological stage using patterns of visual evoked potentials (VEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) for median nerve stimulation, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). . Four of these patients had not yet been treated with penicillamine or trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride), while the remaining 8 patients had been on treatment for at least 1 year.

Previously untreated patients showed an exaggerated humoral immune response, i.e., increased levels of IgG and IgM, higher titers of antibodies to Kunin antigen, and suppressed cell-mediated immunity, i.e., a decreased response to DNCB, a decreased lymphocyte transformation after stimulation with Con A, PPD, Candida and streptokinase and a reduced response to streptokinase in the MIF test. After treatment, the humoral response returned to normal, and in the case of IgA and antibodies against the S. typhi O antigen, it even fell below normal values. The cell-mediated immune response returned to normal with the exception of lymphocyte transformation by PHA and Candida albicans. In in vitro studies it was found that D-penicillamine had no influence on lymphocyte transformation when PHA and Con A were used as mitogens. With PPD as antigen, lymphocyte stimulation and migration inhibition were inhibited by penicillamine concentrations ranging from 6 to 1000 micrograms/ml.",,"Czlonkowska, A.",1977,2002-12-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

We present a case of Wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; In addition, in our patient, who also presented high levels of state anxiety without depression, the 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in the frontal lobes, more marked in the left frontal lobe. During the follow-up of our patient, penicillamine was discontinued after the appearance of lichenoid dermatitis, and zinc acetate allowed the patient to continue treatment successfully and without side effects. In our case, zinc acetate therapy represented an effective treatment for a patient with Wilson's disease in whom side effects related to penicillamine appeared. The safety of zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Since most patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine do not seem to develop this skin lesion, it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in the response to the drug.

WD presents with liver disease, neurological or psychiatric disorders, or other less common clinical features. Diagnosis of WD is often difficult and can be made through clinical, biochemical, imaging, histochemical, and genetic evaluations. The pharmacological approach in WD consists of copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, trientine, dimercaprol, and tetrathiomolybdate. In 1997, the US FDA approved zinc for maintenance therapy of WD. Orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated in fulminant liver failure, progressive liver failure despite treatment, cirrhosis with complications of portal hypertension.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (December 1966 to December 1996) of the English-language literature was performed using the terms zinc and Wilson's disease to identify relevant clinical trials, review articles, and case reports. Additional articles were selected from bibliographies of the literature reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Due to the rarity of the disease, all articles were considered for possible inclusion in this review. Individual case reports are referenced but not selected for evaluation. DATA SYNTHESIS: Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is fatal if left untreated. The chelating drugs penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of therapy; however, adverse reactions to chelators often interfere with successful treatment. Zinc acetate was recently approved in the US for maintenance therapy in patients initially treated with a chelating agent. Although studies evaluating large populations lack zinc therapy, it has shown exceptional safety and efficacy over a 40-year period. Zinc acetate can be used during pregnancy and for the treatment of presymptomatic patients, although data do not support its use as monotherapy in patients with acute liver or neurological disease. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc acetate is an effective maintenance therapy for patients with Wilson's disease. Negligible toxicity, compared to previously approved treatments, is a big plus.

241,Recognition and treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Since Wilson's disease is both preventable and treatable, the diagnosis should not be missed. Despite this, it is often misdiagnosed. Misdiagnosis and delay in treatment are clinically relevant because, if left untreated, Wilson's disease progresses to liver failure or severe neurological disability and death. Those treated properly have a normal life expectancy. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Mutations in ATP7B result in abnormal copper metabolism and subsequent toxic accumulation of copper. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's neurological disease include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, ataxia, and choreoathetosis. Once the possibility of Wilson's disease is considered, the diagnosis is straightforward.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study spanning more than two decades of WD patients in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were retrieved from their charts, referral notes, and our electronic hospital records and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation was 16.8 (10.7) years and 56.5% were male. The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%) and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) were cases. asymptomatic detected by family screening. Family history of WD was positive in 41 (57.7%) patients and parental consanguinity was found in 26 (36.6%) patients. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 92.2 (72.9) (range, 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, while 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%) continued or were lost to follow-up, respectively. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 Â± 12 (range, 4-62) years. Hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7.0%) patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study, in which the clinical, laboratory and imaging data of a series of 20 patients with WD with a median follow-up of 14 years are reviewed. The type of presentation, the treatment used, the biochemical parameters and copper homeostasis were obtained. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (n = 10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). The initial treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at diagnosis was d-penicillamine in 90% and Zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Patients who were maintained with d-penicillamine throughout the period had complete biochemical normalization (baseline ALT: 220 IU/l; last follow-up 38 IU/l). In contrast, the patients in whom d-penicillamine was changed to Zn, regardless of the cause, did not show a complete biochemical remission (baseline ALT: 100 IU/l vs. 66 IU/l in the last control). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment turned out to be effective in most cases, regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in those treated with d-penicillamine agents and required switching to zinc. Zinc therapy was well tolerated and appeared to have good efficacy.

246,A novel long-range enhancer regulates postnatal Zeb2 expression: implications for Mowat-Wilson syndrome phenotypes,"The zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox-2 (Zeb2) gene encodes a SMAD-interacting transcription factor that has diverse roles in development and disease. Mutations at the hZeb2 locus cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a genetic disorder that is associated with mental retardation and other clinical features that depend on the case and sex. Recent studies have detailed microRNA-mediated control of Zeb2, but little is known about the genomic context of this gene or the enhancer sequences that may direct its various functions. Here, we describe a new transgenic rodent model in which the Zeb2 regulatory sequence has been disrupted, resulting in a postnatal developmental phenotype that is autosomal dominant. The phenotype shows a genotype-by-sex interaction and is manifested primarily as an acute attenuation of postnatal renal development in males. Other aspects of embryonic and neonatal development, including neuronal development, are not affected. The transgene insertion site is associated with a 12 kb deletion, 1.2 Mb upstream of Zeb2, within a 4.1 Mb gene desert. A conserved sequence, derived from the deleted region, enhanced the activity of the transgene. Zeb2 promoter in transcription assays. Tissue and temporal restriction of this enhancer activity may involve postnatal changes in the proteins that bind to this sequence. A control mouse/human VISTA enhancer (62 kb upstream of Zeb2) also upregulated the Zeb2 promoter, providing evidence for a chain of conserved distal enhancers. The phenotype arising from deletion of one copy of the extreme long-range enhancer indicates a critical role for this enhancer at a developmental stage. Zeb2 haploinsufficiency in this developmental context reflects the inheritance of MWS and may underlie some non-neuronal sex-dependent features of this human inherited disorder.",,"El-Kasti, M.

247,Copper Imbalances in Ruminants and Humans: Unexpected Common Ground,"Ruminants are more vulnerable to copper deficiency than humans because sulfide generation in the rumen reduces copper availability from forage, increasing the risk of conditions such as swayback in lambs. Grasses rich in molybdenum promote the synthesis of thiomolybdate (TM) and the formation of non-absorbable Cu-TM complexes, turning the risk into a clinical reality (hypocuprosis). Selection pressures created ruminant species with tolerance to deficiency but vulnerability to copper toxicity in foreign environments, as specific pathogen-free units. In contrast, cases of copper imbalance in humans seemed to be confined to rare genetic aberrations of copper metabolism. Recent descriptions of the human swayback and the exploratory use of TM for the treatment of Wilson's disease, tumor growth, inflammatory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease have created unexpected common ground. The incidence of prehemolytic copper poisoning in specific-pathogen-free lambs was reduced by Mycobacterium avium infection that left them more responsive to TM treatment but vulnerable to long-term copper depletion. Copper requirements in ruminants and humans may necessitate additional allowance for the ""copper cost"" of immunity to infection. Residual inhibition of cuproenzyme in TM-treated lambs and abnormalities in plasma copper composition that appeared to be dependent on liver copper status raise the question: ""Can chelation capacity be exploited without inducing a copper deficiency? in ruminants or humans? A balance model between exogenous (TM) and endogenous chelators (eg, albumin, metallothionein) is used to predict the risk of exposure and hypocuprosis; although the risk of natural exposure in humans is remote, the vulnerability to TM-induced copper deficiency may be high. Biomarkers of MT impact are needed, and copper chaperones for inhibited cuproenzymes are prime candidates.",,"Suttle, N. F.",2012,2001-09-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.112.002220,0,0,

249,Kayser-Fleischer ring in Wilson's disease: a cohort study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the characteristics of Wilson's disease (WD) in Sardinian patients with Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring and to assess the correlations between changes in KF and anti-copper therapy and the systemic evolution of WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with WD (35 m/32 f; mean age 41 years) were studied retrospectively. At diagnosis and during follow-up, complete ophthalmologic and neurologic examinations, brain MRI and ECD SPECT, detailed objective laboratory studies, and liver histologic examination were performed on all patients for analysis. All patients received anti-copper therapy with d-penicillamine alone or in combination with zinc salts. RESULTS: At diagnosis, KF was observed in 27% of patients with equal distribution across all age groups. Significant correlations were found between KF at diagnosis, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and pathologic features on brain MRI and brain SPECT ECD at diagnosis. During follow-up, a decrease or regression of KF was observed in 14% of patients. Anti-copper therapy leads to regression of KF and prevents the appearance of KF. No significant correlations were observed between KF regression and neurological or neuroimaging clinical improvement or between KF modifications and clinical hepatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the peculiar characteristics of WD patients from Sardinia: low representation of KF, its equitable distribution in all age groups, significant correlation between KF at diagnosis and clinical neurological manifestations, pathological brain MRI and ECD -SPECT brain are highlighted by our study. Anti-copper therapy induces KF regression and prevents its appearance. Therefore, the KF ring does seem to be a predictive factor in the neurological and hepatic evolution of WD.

250,D-penicillamine targets metastatic melanoma cells with induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) and Noxa-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis (PMAIP1),"D-penicillamine (3,3-dimethyl-D-cysteine; DP) is an FDA-approved redox active D-cysteine derivative with antioxidant, disulfide-reducing, and metal-chelating properties that is used therapeutically for disease control. related to copper. in Wilson's disease and reducing cystine solubilization in cystinuria. Based on the established sensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress, we tested the feasibility of using DP for chemotherapeutic intervention targeting A375 human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DP treatment induced caspase-dependent cell death in cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361) without compromising the viability of primary epidermal melanocytes, an effect not seen with the thiol antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine. (NAC) and dithiothreitol. Focused gene expression array analysis followed by immunoblot detection revealed that DP rapidly activates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; involving phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2alpha, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with p53 upregulation and modulation of Bcl-2 family members (involving Noxa, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2). DP (but not NAC) induced oxidative stress with early impairment of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. siRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked the DP-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic effector BH3 alone Noxa and prevented the downregulation of the Noxa antagonist Mcl-1, rescuing melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis. Intraperitoneal administration of DP showed significant antimelanoma activity in an A375 murine xenograft model. It remains to be seen whether the induction of UPR and melanoma cell-directed apoptosis using DP or improved derivatives of DP can be exploited for future chemotherapeutic interventions.",,"Qiao, S.;Cabello, C.

Genetic testing revealed the presence of the heterozygous H1069Q mutation. The patient was treated with zinc acetate monotherapy, with good response, maintained at 22 months. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing the atypical clinical presentation of Wilson's disease, which should always be considered in patients with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. The good clinical response to treatment with zinc acetate monotherapy in our case could lead us to consider the use of zinc monotherapy as initial therapy also in symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease under close clinical observation.

254,Discovery of zinc deficiency in humans: 50 years later,"The essentiality of zinc for humans and its deficiency was recognized in 1963. Over the past 50 years, it has become apparent that zinc deficiency in humans is common. Nutritional zinc deficiency may affect nearly 2 billion people in the developing world. The consumption of cereal proteins with a high phytate content decreases the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditional zinc deficiency is also very common. Growth retardation, hypogonadism in men, rough skin, impaired immunity, sensorineural disorder, and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. More than 300 enzymes require zinc for activation, and nearly 2,000 transcription factors require zinc for gene expression. Zinc is essential for cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is also an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In therapeutic doses, zinc has been used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in infants and children, the common cold, Wilson's disease, sickle cell disease, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with macular degeneration related to macular degeneration. age.

256,Wilson's disease: an analysis of 28 Brazilian children,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical-laboratory and evolutionary analysis of twenty-eight patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Twenty-eight children (twelve females and sixteen males) with Wilson's disease were retrospectively evaluated between 1987 and 2009, with a follow-up of 72 months (1 - 240 months). Clinical, laboratory, and histological characteristics at the time of diagnosis were recorded at the end of the study. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (2 - 18 years). Twelve patients were asymptomatic, seven had symptoms of hepatitis, five had elevated aminotransferase levels, three had hepatomegaly associated with neurological disorders, one had fulminant hepatitis with hemolytic anemia, and six patients had a Kayser-Fleischer ring. Histological analysis revealed that six children had chronic hepatitis, seven cirrhosis, two steatosis, one portal fibrosis, and one massive necrosis. The treatment consisted of D-penicillamine associated with pyridoxine for 26 patients. Adverse effects were observed in the other two patients: one presented uncontrollable vomiting and the other demonstrated elastosis perforans serpiginosa. At the end of the study, all 26 treated patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-four of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and pyridoxine, and two were treated with trientine and zinc sulfate. A liver transplant was performed on a patient with fulminant hepatitis, but the last patient died 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Family screening associated with early treatment is important in preventing symptoms of Wilson's disease and potentially fatal disease progression. The study suggests that Wilson's disease should be ruled out in children over two years of age who present with abnormal liver enzyme levels due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the encouraging results of treatment obtained so far.",,"Kleine, R.

257,Metals and the liver,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inherited liver diseases resulting in copper and iron overload can cause significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated early. The objective of this review is to highlight the key publications on the genetics, diagnosis, and treatment of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease during the last 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent advances have been made in the genetic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. From the sequencing of the HFE gene, rare HFE mutations have been identified that lead to phenotypic hemochromatosis among C282Y heterozygotes. Serum ferritin less than 1000 Âµg/l in C282Y homozygotes was found to be associated with milder symptoms of hemochromatosis. Deferasirox has been shown to reduce iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis and may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy. Evidence of correlation of genotype and phenotype was found in Wilson's disease, which can be diagnosed by genetic sequencing. A modified diagnostic guideline for children with Wilson's disease with mild liver disease has been developed that increases the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. Furthermore, treatment with copper chelating agents has fewer liver treatment failures compared to zinc monotherapy. SUMMARY: Advances in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment with a consequent decrease in morbidity and mortality.",,"Maxwell, K.

258,Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine and lupus erythematosus: related or distinct entities?,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been reported to be associated with Wilson's disease, as a complication of penicillamine treatment. Although drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) has some features in common with SLE, they are distinct entities. We present the case of a girl who was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of five and started treatment with penicillamine. Eight years after the start of therapy, he developed proteinuria, which was considered to be related to penicillamine. Two years later, he developed arthritis, malar rash, and laboratory findings suggestive of lupus erythematosus. His symptoms, due to the known association between penicillamine and DILE, were initially thought to be related to this treatment. In this hypothesis, she was referred to the Rheumatology Center; zinc acetate was replaced by penicillamine and naproxen was started for the treatment of arthritis. In any case, the subsequent clinical evolution and the laboratory findings led us to the diagnosis of idiopathic SLE. A renal biopsy detected massive mesangiocapillary proliferation with subendothelial deposits (wire loops) and duplication of the glomerular basement membrane (active diffuse global proliferative lupus nephritis, class IV GA). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between Wilson's disease and SLE.",,"Dell'era, L.;Boati, E.;Nebbia, G.;Corona, F.",2012,Feb,,0,0,
259,Chelation therapy in Wilson's disease: from D-penicillamine to the design of selective bioinspired intracellular Cu(I) chelators,"Wilson's disease is an orphan disease due to dysfunction of copper homeostasis. Mutations of the ATP7B gene induce a malfunction of a Cu-ATPase, impaired Cu detoxification in the liver, and copper overload in the body. In fact, although copper is an essential element, used as a cofactor by many enzymes that perform vital functions, it becomes toxic when in excess, as it promotes cytotoxic reactions that lead to oxidative stress. In this perspective, human copper homeostasis is first described to explain the mechanisms that promote copper overload in Wilson's disease. We will see that the liver is the main organ of distribution and detoxification of copper in the body. Today this disease is treated for life through systemic chelation therapy, which in many cases is not satisfactory. Therefore, the design of more selective and efficient drugs is of great interest. A strategy for designing more specific chelators to treat localized copper accumulation in the liver will then be presented. In particular, we will show how bioinorganic chemistry can help in the design of new chelators by taking inspiration from biological copper cell transporters.",,"Delangle, P.;Mintz, E.",2012,2007-06-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2dt12188c,0,0,
260,[Diagnosis and care of Wilson's disease with neurological revelation],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease that causes an accumulation of copper in many organs, initially in the liver, progressing to liver cirrhosis, and in the brain, with different neurological symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. Different treatments based on chelating agents can help reduce the spontaneous morbidity and mortality of the disease. We describe three patients who presented Wilson's disease before the age of 18, with initial neurological symptoms between 1998 and 2010. After comparing them with reports in the literature, their clinical symptoms, evolution and care allowed us to propose a treatment algorithm. Neurological symptoms are present in 35% of patients with Wilson's disease, including dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, and psychiatric symptoms. The time to diagnosis is still too long and may explain the greater severity of the disease found and the problems in treating these patients. The first treatment option should be triethylenetetramine, which causes fewer side effects of initial worsening of symptoms compared to D-penicillamine. Zinc therapy is the first treatment for asymptomatic patients or in maintenance treatment. Finally, liver transplantation is a potential treatment even if the patient has severe neurological disability because it can improve clinical symptoms. However, further research on this matter is warranted. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",,"Wagner, S.;Brunet, A.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a direct relationship between these two parameters. METHOD: The case notes of 320 patients with Wilson's disease, seen between 1960 and 1987, have been reviewed. Eighty of these patients were treatment-naÃ¯ve prior to referral and the results of ""free"" serum copper and serum copper were analyzed. urine at admission and after one year of treatment. RESULTS: Except for patients with acute hemolysis, the ratio of 'free' serum copper to urinary copper before treatment, on average, is about 7:1, after treatment it falls to about 5:1. But the results show a wide scatter and there is no direct linear relationship. CONCLUSION: The term 'free' copper is misleading and should be replaced by the more cumbersome but accurate term 'ceruloplasmin-unbound copper'. Most of the 'free' copper complexes with albumin and is only available for excretion if there is significant protein loss from the kidneys.",,"Walshe, J.

D-penicillamine, a potent metal chelator, is an important therapy for Wilson's disease. To investigate the changes of metallic elements under D-penicillamine treatment, we determined the levels of Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Se, Mn, Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Tl and Al by ICP-MS in urine. of 115 patients with Wilson's disease who had received treatment with D:-penicillamine for 1 month to 22 years in maintenance doses, as well as 115 age-matched healthy controls. The levels of Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd and Mn in the 24-h urine of the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls (P<0.05), and the increases observed in the the levels of Mg, Ca and Zn were directly correlated with the duration of treatment with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 (Ca) and 0.313 (Zn), respectively (P<0.05) . On the other hand, the levels of Al and As in the 24-h urine were lower than those of the controls (P<0.05) and were negatively correlated with the time of treatment with R of -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As ), respectively, (P<0.05).

263,"Hereditary disorders of copper transport: biochemical mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment","Copper is an essential trace element required by all living organisms. However, excessive amounts of copper cause cell damage. Disturbances of normal copper homeostasis are characteristic of three genetic disorders: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and Wilson disease. Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are characterized by copper deficiency. The typical features of Menkes disease are the result of low copper-dependent enzyme activity. Standard treatment consists of parenteral administration of copper-histidine. If treatment is started before 2 months of age, neurodegeneration can be prevented, while late treatment is totally ineffective. Therefore, neonatal mass screening should be implemented. Meanwhile, connective tissue disorders may not improve with copper histidine treatment. Combination therapy with copper-histidine injections and oral administration of disulfiram is under investigation. Occipital horn syndrome characterized by connective tissue abnormalities is the mildest form of Menkes disease. No treatment has been performed for this syndrome. Wilson's disease is characterized by copper toxicity that typically severely affects the liver and nervous systems. Various other symptoms are also seen, but its early diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Chelating agents and zinc are effective treatments but are ineffective in most patients with fulminant hepatic failure. In addition, some patients with neurologic Wilson's disease worsen or show a poor response to chelating agents. Since early treatment is critical, screening for Wilson's disease in infants should be implemented. Patients with Wilson's disease may be at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the link between Wilson's disease and hepatocellular carcinoma will be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of the disease.",,"Kodama, H.;Fujisawa, C.;Bhadhprasit, W.",2012,Mar,,0,0,
264,Manifestations and course of Wilson's disease in pediatric patients carrying the ATP7B L708P mutation,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to characterize a group of 11 pediatric patients, aged 3 to 13 years, affected by Wilson's disease (WD) on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genetic, biochemical and pathological characteristics have been analyzed in this group of patients, as well as their response to treatment and clinical evolution. RESULTS: Genetically, the group was fairly homogeneous, with an extremely high prevalence of the L708P mutation (4 homozygotes and 5 heterozygotes). Despite being initially screened for asymptomatic hypertransaminemia, all patients had some degree of liver damage that was never accompanied by neurological manifestations. Liver damage was more severe in a compound heterozygote with a novel mutation, G1266W, affecting a motif in the ATP7B polypeptide that is highly conserved in similar proteins among metazoans. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, along with determination of hepatic copper content, were found to be of great diagnostic value, whereas urine copper measurements were found to be much less conclusive. All patients responded well to D-penicillamine treatment with no documented adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The patients of Gran Canaria constitute, globally, one of the largest groups of patients with WD with a high incidence of a single mutation, which allows us to define the early symptoms and the evolution of the disease in patients who carry the mutant ATP7B L708P allele. and the study of WD in a genetically homogeneous background.",,"Pena-Quintana, L.;Garcia-Luzardo, M.

266,Wilson's neurological disease in children: a three-year experience from Multan,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the neurological manifestations, results of investigations and response to treatment in Wilson's disease in children from Multan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Neurology Department of the Multan Children's Hospital and Children's Health Institute between June 2005 and May 2008. Fifty children were included in this study. Age at onset of symptoms, sex, duration of symptoms, presenting symptoms, consanguinity between parents, family history, and response to treatment were noted. The chi square test was used to measure the relationship between the variables and the response to treatment. A p value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: Of the 50 cases studied, 48 were index cases and two were diagnosed at screening. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 9.06 +/- 2.65 years. Dystonia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment were observed in 92%, drooling in 68%, tremors in 52%, chorea in 24%, and seizures in 12% of children. Kayser Fleischer rings and elevated urinary copper for 24 hours after penicillamine challenge, 1567 +/- 167.35 microg/day were present in all 50 children. Twenty-two (44%) children showed early response, 24 (48%) late response, and 4 (8%) children had no response after one year of treatment. Late, more than 10 years of age at symptom onset, less than 6 months of symptom duration, and urinary copper excretion of less than 1000 microg/day were statistically significant factors for early response to treatment. CONCLUSION: In the study population, dystonia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment were the most common presentations. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper was useful for diagnosis.

Copper in urine: 1.0 micromol/24 h (>9.44). As first seen, the proband had tremor, dysarthria, dystonia, and a KF ring in the cornea. After 10 months of penicillamine treatment, his transaminases normalized, tremor, dysarthria, and dystonia initially worsened and then improved. Coagulation times are improved but not yet normalized. Mutational analysis has shown that the proband is homozygous for c.3207 C->A, p.H1069Q while his parents are heterozygous. Her sister is a healthy non-carrier.

An MRI of the brain showed hyperintensity in the right frontoparietal region, basal ganglia, particularly in the caudate nucleus, midbrain, and pons on T2-weighted sequences, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were 4 mg/dL (range, 20-45 mg/dL), and 24-hour urinary copper excretion increased to 223 microg (10-40 microg/24 hours). Slit-lamp examination revealed the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring, and treatment with penicillamine was started. Four months later, he developed episodes of paroxysmal dystonic posturing of the left arm, which increased in frequency to 2-3 attacks per hour. They were provoked by voluntary movements and forced him to adopt an abnormal flexion of the left forearm on the left biceps and were preceded by a sensation of tension in the muscles of the left forearm.

269,A clinical study of Wilson's disease: the experience of a single Pediatric Hepatology Unit in Egypt,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Most pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) have hepatic manifestations, but some may have neurological or psychiatric features. Our aim was to define the clinical, biochemical, and therapy outcome characteristics of a group of Egyptian children diagnosed with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out at the Pediatric Hepatology Unit of Cairo University Children's Hospital, Egypt; 54 patients were diagnosed with WD between 1996 and 2009. Diagnosis was based on low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge, and/or the presence of Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. ). RESULTS: The clinical presentation was as follows: hepatic presentation in 33 patients (61%), hepato-neurological 3 (5.5%), neurological 5 (9.3%) and presymptomatic 13 (24%). Twelve couples had more than one affected sibling. Increased urine copper concentrations were found before or after D-penicillamine challenge in all patients, low serum ceruloplasmin in 97%, and KF rings in 31.5%. All patients were treated with penicillamine and zinc sulfate except for one presymptomatic case who was treated with zinc sulfate alone. Three patients underwent liver transplantation and eight patients died after a median duration of treatment of 6 months (1-36). Liver symptoms improved with treatment but neurological symptoms remained stationary. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and biochemical assays remain the gold standard for diagnosing WD. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat WD with liver symptoms. Liver transplant continues to save lives for those with fulminant and end-stage WD. Screening for presymptomatic siblings is of paramount importance. Copyright AÂ© 2011 Arab Journal of Gastroenterology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

271,case of isolated elevated copper levels during pregnancy,"INTRODUCTION: Outside of Wilson's disease, abnormal copper metabolism is a rare condition. In pregnancy, excessive copper levels may be associated with intrauterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and neurological disease. CASE REPORT: Gravida 4 para 2012, a 32-year-old woman with an obstetric history complicated by elevated copper levels presented for routine antenatal care. Her children had elevated copper levels at birth, and her firstborn was diagnosed with autism and suffered three heart attacks and was treated for elevated copper levels. During her previous pregnancies, she refused treatment for her elevated copper levels. During this pregnancy, she declined chelation therapy and instead chose zinc therapy. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy with normal copper levels. CONCLUSION: Alterations in copper metabolism are rare, the consequences in pregnancy can be devastating. Although isolated copper elevations in pregnancy are extremely rare, they are treated in the same manner as Wilson's disease. The goal is to prevent fetal growth restriction and neurological sequelae in the newborn and preeclampsia in the mother. Counselling, along with treatment options and timely delivery, can greatly improve neonatal and maternal outcomes.",,"Walker, L.

His first manifestations were neurological. He was treated with trientine for more than 10 years and suffered from anemia and liver dysfunction. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body. Excess copper is toxic, but copper is an essential trace element.

274,Phenotypic and genetic characterization of a cohort of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: In Egypt, Wilson's disease appears to be underdiagnosed and clinical data in large cohorts are limited. The aim of this study is to highlight the clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of this disease in our pediatric population, as well as to report our experience with treatment options and outcome. METHODS: The study included 77 patients from 50 unrelated families (62 were followed for a mean period of 58.9 +/- 6.4 months and 27 were asymptomatic siblings). Data were collected retrospectively through record analysis and patient interviews. The diagnosis was confirmed by sequencing the ATP7B gene in 64 patients. RESULTS: Our patients had unique characteristics compared to other populations. They presented a younger age of onset (median: 10 years), a higher prevalence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (97.6% in symptomatic patients), low ceruloplasmin (93.5%), a high rate of parental consanguinity (78.9% ) as well as a more severe course. 71.42% of those receiving long-term D-penicillamine improved or remained stable during follow-up with serious side effects occurring in only 11.5%. Preventive treatment with zinc monotherapy was an effective and non-toxic alternative to D-penicillamine. Homozygous mutations were found in 85.7%, but limited by the large number of mutations detected, it was difficult to find genotype-phenotype correlations. Missense mutations were the most common, while protein truncation mutations resulted in a more severe course with a higher incidence of acute liver failure and neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Egyptian children with Wilson's disease have early Kayser-Fleischer rings and early onset liver and neurological disease. The identified mutational spectrum differs from that observed in other countries. The high rate of homozygous mutations (reflecting the high rate of inbreeding) may potentially offer more insight into the genotype-phenotype correlation.",,"Abdel Ghaffar, T. Y.;Elsayed, S.

275,Prognostic significance of neurological examination findings in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Wilson's disease present with any of several neurological phenotypes, and treatment outcomes vary widely. Our objective was to determine whether the clinical features of neurological Wilson's disease (WD) predict longer-term neurological outcomes in patients receiving anti-copper treatment. METHODS: Patients enrolled in four WD treatment trials received a standardized neurological examination at trial enrollment and then at prespecified intervals after anti-copper therapy, initially with tetrathiomolybdate or trientine and then with zinc. The examination graded the patients' motor signs, including tremor, rigidity, dystonia, dysarthria, and gait. The total score was obtained by adding these sub-scores. Eighty-six patients were included in our analysis, with a mean follow-up of 34.7 months. Retrospectively, the analysis compared scaled and unscaled sign subscores at enrollment and follow-up with changes in the total score, using a generalized estimating equations approach. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, improvement in total score was best predicted by tremor sign subscores (beta -0.7, p = 0.006), gait abnormalities (beta -3.7, p < 0.001 ) and speech (beta = -1.3, p = 0.05). Dystonia (beta = 1.8, p < 0.001) and facial expression (beta = 1.9, p = 0.03) were associated with a worsening of the total score. Of the individually followed motor signs, dystonia was found to be the most resistant to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale prospectively acquired study evaluating the prognostic significance of specific neurological signs in WD. Our data support historical observations that tremor is a favorable prognostic sign, whereas dystonia is relatively refractory to treatment in WD. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

276,The pattern of urinary copper excretion and its response to treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that patients with Wilson's disease excrete excess copper in the urine. However, no study has been done, in a large series of patients, on whether there are differences in the rate of excretion at different stages of the disease or what changes can be expected after treatment. DESIGN: The present study is derived from an analysis of the urinary copper excretion results of 192 patients with Wilson's disease seen between 1955 and 2000. These patients were divided into three groups, presymptomatic, hepatic, and neurological Wilson's disease. Patients were studied for baseline pretreatment, 24-h and 6-h urinary copper excretion after a 500-mg test dose of penicillamine. The tests were repeated after approximately 1 and 2 years of chelation therapy with penicillamine or, in a small minority of cases, trientine. RESULTS: Baseline copper excretion prior to treatment was lowest in presymptomatic patients (207.93 microg/24h) and highest in hepatic patients (465.75 microg/24h). Those with neurological Wilson's disease gave an intermediate figure (305.58 micro g/24 h). The response to penicillamine was higher in neurological patients and lower in the presymptomatic group. After 1 and 2 years of treatment, all groups showed significant drops in both baseline copper excretion rate and after penicillamine. The small subgroup treated with trientine, instead of penicillamine, showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease shows wide variation from patient to patient, but in general patients with presymptomatic disease excrete less copper than those with symptomatic disease. All groups show a large increase when exposed to penicillamine. After 1 and 2 years of treatment, there is a significant decrease in copper excretion both at baseline exposure and after penicillamine challenge. This presumably indicates a reduction in the body burden of copper.",,"Walshe, J. M.",2011,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcr073,0,0,

278,Alterations of lipid metabolism in Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of human copper metabolism, characterized by copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain, leading to severe liver and neurological disease. Interesting findings in animal models of WD (Atp7b-/- and LEC rats) showed altered lipid metabolism with a decrease in the amount of triglycerides and cholesterol in serum. However, the serum lipid profile has not been investigated in large cohorts of human WD patients to date. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study involved 251 patients examined at the university hospitals in Heidelberg and Dresden (Germany). Patients were analyzed at routine follow-up examinations for serum lipid profiles, including triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Data on these parameters at the time of diagnosis were retrieved by chart review when available. For statistical tests, patients were subgrouped by sex, manifestation (hepatic, neurological, mixed, and asymptomatic), and treatment (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or combination). RESULTS: A significant difference in total serum cholesterol was found in patients with liver symptoms, which decreased with treatment. No alterations were observed for HDL, LDL and triglycerides. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous reports using WD animal models (Atp7b-/- and LEC rats), the most obvious alteration in our cohort was lower serum cholesterol level in patients with liver involvement, which could be related to liver injury. Our data suggested intact cholesterol metabolism in Wilson's disease under treatment, regardless of the medical treatment applied.",,"Seessle, J.;Gohdes, A.;Gotthardt, D.

279,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data on clinical follow-up and treatment effectiveness of Wilson's disease are limited due to the low frequency of the disease. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of patients with Wilson's disease from southern Brazil during a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with Wilson's disease, diagnosed between 1971 and 2010, were retrospectively evaluated for clinical presentation, epidemiologic and social characteristics, response to therapy, and outcome. RESULTS: Examination of the continental origins of the patients showed that 74.5% had a European ancestor. The mean age of presentation of the initial symptoms was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months until the definitive diagnosis. At presentation, hepatic symptoms predominated (38.9%), followed by mixed (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) symptoms (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were identified in 55.6% of the patients, more frequently among those patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%). Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was detected in 68% of patients with liver symptoms. 94.2% of all patients were treated with D-penicillamine for a mean time of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combination therapy, and liver transplantation. After starting therapy, 78.8% of patients had a stable or improved outcome, and the overall survival rate was 90.1%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a population of patients with Wilson's disease of mainly European continental origin living in southern Brazil.

280,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa D-penicillamine: description of two cases and review of the literature,"Long-term therapy with D-penicillamine (DPA) to treat Wilson's disease can induce elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS), a very rare degenerative skin disease characterized by transepidermal shedding of aggregates of elastic fibers. Iatrogenic disease depends on the ability of DPA to chelate copper and cause its depletion. Lysyl oxidase is a copper-dependent enzyme crucial for dermal elastic fiber cross-linking, which is strongly affected by DPA copper depletion. Direct drug binding to collagen precursors also affects the assembly and maturation of elastic fibers. The abnormal elastin accumulates in the mid dermis and produces a characteristic bramble brush or ""bumpy"" appearance. In this way it acts as a foreign body and is progressively extruded through the epidermis. Clinically, the disease presents with multiple firm keratotic papules and nodules arranged in annular plaques on the neck, axillae, antecubital fossa, and forearms. The rarity of the disease frequently leads to misdiagnosis and the process continues unabated, raising concerns about systemic elastopathy.",,"Atzori, L.;Pinna, A.

284,Risks and benefits of copper in light of new insights into copper homeostasis,"Copper is an essential micronutrient involved in a variety of biological processes essential to sustain life. At the same time, it can be toxic when present in excess, the most notorious chronic effect being liver damage. Powerful and efficient regulatory mechanisms control copper absorption in the digestive tract and biliary excretion of copper; absorption ranges from 12 to 60% in humans, depending on Cu intake, the presence of other factors in the diet that may promote or inhibit its absorption, and the copper status of the individual. Current evidence suggests that copper deficiency may be more prevalent than previously thought, while copper toxicity is rare under the usual conditions of daily life. Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease are genetic conditions associated with severe copper deficiency and severe copper toxicity, respectively. The effects of milder degrees of copper deficiency and excessive copper exposure are not well described, mainly due to the lack of sensitive and specific indicators; Serum copper concentration and ceruloplasmin are the most commonly used indicators, but they detect only fairly large changes in copper status. Of the many proteins evaluated as potential markers of copper status, the Zn-Cu superoxide dismutase chaperone (CCS1) has shown promising results; Data on its performance under different conditions are needed to confirm its use as an indicator of early copper deficiency. Defining copper requirements and safe upper intake limits (ULs) is a complex process, as there are adverse health consequences of both copper deficiency and excess (U-shaped curve). The regulatory framework for risk assessment of essential trace elements introduced by the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) has proposed a homeostatic model to determine the appropriate range of oral intake (AROI) of essential trace elements; the nadir of the resulting U-shaped curve serves to define the AROI. In this intake range, physiological mechanisms allow normal homeostasis and basically no detectable adverse effects. Currently, the Recommended Dietary Intakes (DRIs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs) are used to recommend copper intakes at different ages and life situations. The evidence from humans and non-human primates presented here suggests that the current copper UL should be re-evaluated. Developing the scientific basis for a copper UL and assessing the relevance of copper deficiency globally are key future challenges for copper researchers. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome who also developed cholestasis and histopathologic features consistent with biliary atresia, suggesting that mutations involving zfhz1b may lead to abnormalities of biliary development or injury to the biliary tract. We used the zebrafish model system to determine whether zfhx1b has a role in vertebrate biliary development. RESULTS: Using zebrafish, we determined that zfhx1b was expressed in the developing liver during biliary growth and remodeling, and that morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-mediated deletion of zfhx1b led to defects in biliary development. These findings were associated with decreased expression of vhnf1, a transcription factor known to be important in biliary development in zebrafish and mammals.

287,Hepatocyte targeting and intracellular copper chelation by a thiol-containing glycocyclopeptide,"Metal overload plays an important role in various diseases or intoxications, such as Wilson's disease, a major genetic disorder of copper metabolism in humans. To efficiently and selectively lower copper concentration in the severely damaged liver, chelators must target hepatocytes. In the present work, we synthesized a molecule capable of both reducing intracellular copper, specifically Cu(I), and acting on hepatocytes, combining a chelating unit and a carbohydrate recognition element within the same structure. A cyclodecapeptide scaffold exhibiting a controlled conformation with two independent faces was chosen to introduce both units. One side shows a cluster of carbohydrates to ensure efficient recognition of asialoglycoprotein receptors, expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. The second face is dedicated to the formation of metal ion complexes thanks to the thiolate functions of two cysteine side chains. To obtain a chelator that is active only once inside cells, the two thiol functions were oxidized in a disulfide bridge to produce the glycopeptide P(3). Two simple cyclodecapeptides that model the reduced and complexing form of P(3) in cells demonstrated a high affinity for Cu(I) and a high selectivity for Zn(II). As expected, P(3) becomes an efficient Cu(I) chelator in the presence of glutathione that mimics the intracellular reducing environment. Finally, cellular uptake and the ability to reduce intracellular copper were demonstrated in hepatic cell lines, in particular in WIF-B9, making P(3) a good candidate to combat copper overload in the liver.",,"Pujol, A.

The proportions of methylose and bicarbonate were varied, and the effects of the different proportions on the properties of the resulting powders and tablets were determined. Initially, the water absorption of different powder mixtures was evaluated. These tests indicated the interaction of the active agent and the effervescent agent, this phenomenon leading to an unexpected increase in the amount of liquid absorbed. This interaction was evaluated for degradation of the hydrophilic matrix system. The disintegration of tablets with different compositions revealed that this interaction increases the time required for the disintegration of these systems. The study demonstrated that the interaction of the components induced significant changes in the parameters of this new sensitive delivery system. In the last steps, the buoyancy and dissolution properties of tablets that seemed appropriate for the formulation of a controlled drug delivery system were investigated.

290,"Long-term follow-up of Wilson's disease: natural history, treatment, mutation analysis, and phenotypic correlation.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. When treated, the outcome can be excellent, although long-term survival has not yet been well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of WD patients and to assess the factors that affect the phenotypic manifestation of WD. METHODS: The presence of mutations in the ATP7B gene, clinical manifestations, treatments, and long-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed in 117 patients with WD (59 men and 58 women, age at evaluation 38.5 +/ - 11, range 16-63). years). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with neurological presentation, 51 patients with hepatic presentation, and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed up for a mean of 15.1 +/- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most frequent genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with hepatic or neurological presentation (P = 0.099). D-penicillamine or zinc salts (81% and 17%, respectively) were used for treatment, and three patients underwent liver transplantation. Most of the symptomatic patients became asymptomatic or improved during follow-up (82% patients with hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). Long-term survival of WD patients did not differ from that of the general Czech population (P = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory response in the vast majority of adequately treated WD patients and survival is consistent with that of the general population.

291,Extraordinary stability of copper(I)-tetrathiomolybdate complexes: possible implications for aquatic ecosystems,"An extraordinary affinity of MoS42- for Cu explains Mo-induced Cu deficiency in ruminants (molybdenosis) and offers an approach to treat Wilson's disease in humans. Evidence for thiomolybdates in sulphurous natural waters, and possibly even as metastable traces in oxic natural waters, raises the question of how Cu-Mo affinity might affect Cu availability or toxicity in aquatic ecosystems. The stabilities of Cu-MoS42- inorganic complexes are characterized and quantified here for the first time. Two remarkably stable dissolved Cu(I) complexes (T=23Â°C +/- 2Â°C) are identified: Cu2(HS)2MoS42- and Cu2S2MoS44-. In addition, the solubility constant of a precipitate (NH4CuMoS4) was measured. Under extremely reducing conditions in rumen fluids, these complexes will largely suppress Cu(+) activity, supporting previous conclusions on the mechanism of molybdenosis. In natural sulphurous waters, they help prevent the total depletion of Cu, as might otherwise occur by precipitation of sulphide minerals. On the other hand, the complexes discovered here are HS-dependent and might not be important in oxic natural waters (with HS- concentrations < 10-9 M) even if the metastable and biogenic MoS42 were present as previously conjectured.

293,"Effects of long-term zinc treatment in Japanese patients with Wilson's disease: efficacy, stability, and copper metabolism","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with copper metabolism. In Japan, the standard treatment is the administration of copper chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine and trientine. In this study, the authors used zinc acetate to treat Japanese patients with Wilson's disease and investigated its efficacy. All 37 patients in this study were found to have Wilson's disease by clinical and biochemical tests and were given zinc acetate for 48 weeks. The authors followed the patients' clinical symptoms and laboratory findings by evaluating their complete blood counts, biochemical findings, as well as the results of urinalysis and special laboratory tests for copper and zinc metabolism. We also examine the side effects of treatment. Zinc acetate did not aggravate liver or neurological symptoms in any of the patients. Biochemical blood analysis also did not reveal elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Zinc treatment did not aggravate the clinical signs and/or laboratory findings of the patients. However, it did improve some clinical symptoms of patients with Wilson's disease. Although this agent had some side effects, none of them were serious. The authors measured the point urinary excretion of copper, which gave an indication of the efficacy of the treatment and of the sufficient dose of zinc. We recommend maintaining a punctual urinary copper excretion of less than 0.075 Âµg/mg creatinine. The authors conclude that zinc acetate is an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients with Wilson's disease. Copyright Â© 2010 Mosby, Inc.

295,Reassessment of diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease in children with mild liver disease,"UNLABELED: Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) is challenging, especially in children. Early detection is desirable to avoid dramatic progression of the disease. The objective of our study was to reassess in children with WD with mild liver disease the conventional diagnostic criteria and the WD scoring system proposed by an international consensus in 2001. Forty children with WD (26 boys and 14 girls, age range = 1 .1-20.9 years) and 58 age- and sex-matched patients with liver disease other than WD were evaluated. Both groups were symptom-free and had elevated aminotransferases as the predominant signs of liver disease. In all patients with WD, the diagnosis was supported by molecular analysis, liver copper content, or both. A receptor operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of ceruloplasmin at the 20 mg/dL cutoff showed a sensitivity of 95% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 83%-99.4%] and a specificity of 84.5% (95% CI = 72.6%-92.6%). The optimal baseline urinary copper diagnostic cutoff value was found to be 40 Âµg/24 hours (sensitivity = 78.9%, 95% CI = 62.7%-90.4%; specificity = 87.9% , 95% CI = 76.7%-95%). Urinary copper values after penicillamine challenge did not differ significantly between WD patients and control subjects, and ROC analysis showed a sensitivity of only 12%. The WD scoring system was shown to have positive and negative predictive values of 93% and 91.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Urinary copper excretion greater than 40 ug/24 hours suggests WE in asymptomatic children, while the penicillamine challenge test does not have a diagnostic role in this subgroup of patients. The WD scoring system provides good diagnostic accuracy.

296,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper balance that causes liver damage and neurological abnormalities of varying degrees. The defective gene, ATP7B, encodes a hepatic copper transporter protein, which plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Our understanding of the genetic basis of Wilson's disease has increased dramatically; however, the understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation and the multiple effects of copper toxicity as a basis for targeted and individualized therapy strategies is still insufficient. Clinical manifestations are related to copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain and include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders. Mixed presentations occur frequently. Early recognition by clinical, biochemical, or genetic examination and initiation of therapy with copper chelators, zinc salts, or even liver transplantation in cases of acute and chronic liver failure are essential for a favorable outcome.

300,Pharmacology of triethylenetetramine and its clinical applications,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a selective Cu(II) chelator, is commonly used for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Recently, it has been shown that TETA can be used in cancer treatment because it possesses telomerase inhibitory and anti-angiogenesis properties. Although TETA has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease for decades, there is no comprehensive review of the pharmacology of TETA. TETA is poorly absorbed with a bioavailability of 8 to 30%. It is widely distributed in tissues with relatively high concentrations measured in liver, heart and kidney. It is metabolized primarily through acetylation, and there are two major acetylated metabolites in human serum and urine. It is excreted primarily in the urine as unchanged parent drug and two acetylated metabolites. It has a relatively short half-life (2 to 4 hours) in humans. The most recent discoveries in the pharmacology of TETA show that the main pharmacokinetic parameters are not associated with the acetylation phenotype of N-acetyltransferase 2, the traditionally considered drug acetylation enzyme, and the metabolizing enzyme of TETA is actually spermidine/ spermine acetyltransferase. This review also covers the current preclinical and clinical application of TETA. A much-needed overview and up-to-date information on the pharmacology of TETA is provided for clinicians or cancer researchers who intend to embark on cancer clinical trials using TETA or its close structural analogs.",,"Lu, J.",2010,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0523,0,0,
301,Persistence with treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson's disease is a genetically induced failure of copper metabolism. If left untreated, it can lead to death within several years of the onset of symptoms. Therefore, the use of medications should continue throughout the life of the patient after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson's disease frequently discontinue treatment. The aim of our study was to assess how drug compliance (defined as persistence in drug use) translates into the overall well-being of patients with Wilson's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease and observed in our outpatient clinics were asked to complete the self-completed questionnaire. Questions related to demographics, disease characteristics, treatment methods and treatment persistence, subjective assessment of health status, and treatment efficacy. The EQ-5D questionnaire with a visual analog scale of well-being was also used. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires could be processed. Our analysis revealed no differences in persistence with the use of d-penicillamine and zinc sulfate or the efficacy of the prescribed medication. We found, however, that regardless of the medication used, persistence with treatment resulted in significantly better self-assessed outcomes (total improvement in 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the non-persistent group, p = 0.003; improvement partial in 53.8% vs 30.8%, respectively, p = 0.045 and deterioration: none in the persistent group vs 42.3% in the non-persistent group, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of persistence in the use of prescribed medication is quite common among patients with Wilson's disease. Lack of compliance decreases the chances of improvement and may be the cause of clinical deterioration.",,"Maselbas, W.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2010,May-Jun,,0,0,

306,Effect of glutathione depletion on copper removal from LEC rat livers by tetrathiomolybdate,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent and selective copper (Cu) chelator used as a therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease. TTM is the only agent that can remove metallothionein (MT)-bound Cu in the liver of tan-coated Long-Evans rats (LEC rats). However, excess TTM administration causes deposition of Cu and molybdenum (Mo) in the liver. In the present study, the effect of hepatic glutathione (GSH) depletion on Cu removal from the livers of LEC rats was evaluated to establish an effective TTM therapy. Pretreatment with l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH depleter in vivo, reduced the amounts of Cu and Mo excreted in both bile and bloodstream, and increased the amounts of Cu and Mo deposited in rat livers. LEC in the form of an insoluble complex 4 h after TTM injection. The results suggest that GSH depletion creates an oxidative environment in LEC rat livers, and the oxidative environment facilitates Cu and Mo insolubilization in LEC rat livers after TTM injection. Therefore, the effect of TTM on Cu removal from the liver was reduced in the oxidized condition. Wilson's disease patients and LEC rats develop liver damage caused by oxidative damage. From a clinical point of view, increasing the concentration of GSH is expected to enhance the effect of TTM. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

308,Clinical characteristics and therapeutic response in Taiwanese children with Wilson's disease: 12 years of experience in a single center.,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive defect of cellular copper export. Early diagnosis in children is difficult due to its obscure clinical presentations. The efficacy of zinc salts is well documented, although there are limited data on the use of zinc in pediatric patients with WD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical features, laboratory results, and responses to treatment in children with WD diagnosed at Taichung Veterans General Hospital between 1996 and 2008. Diagnosis was established by low serum ceruloplasmin, urinary excretion of high copper in 24 hours, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and mutation analysis. RESULTS: Eleven children were included in this study. The main initial presentations were abnormal liver function tests (6/11) and hemolytic anemia (2/11). Genetic studies in seven children showed six different mutations (G934D, R778Q, C490X, 304insC, IVS4-1 G > C, P992I) and one possible new mutation (L1181P). All patients had improved liver function tests and hemoglobin levels after treatment with D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc supplementation. During a mean period of 3.4 +/- 2.1 years on zinc therapy, six patients had serum zinc levels above the normal range and seven patients had serum copper levels below the normal range. CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper tests could be used to rule out WD in children with chronic hepatitis and hemolytic anemia. Gene analysis is useful for rapid diagnosis of asymptomatic siblings and patients with atypical features. Zinc treatment is generally safe in pediatric patients with WD.

309,Oral complications associated with treatment with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease: clinicopathological report,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disease that inhibits the release of copper from the liver. Multiorgan manifestations involve the liver, nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart, and skin. Elastic fiber damage is a complication of the most commonly used drug in the treatment of WD D-penicillamine (D-PCA). These changes have been very rarely described in the oral cavity. The article describes the oral complications associated with WD and its treatment by D-PCA. METHODS: Clinical, radiographic and microscopic evaluation was performed in two patients with WD (28 and 53 years old), treated with D-PCA, with clinical and pathological evidence of complications related to oral medications. RESULTS: Lesions included multiple small red papules on the lips, gingival enlargement, early-onset periodontitis, and repeated oral candidiasis. Biopsies of the oral mucosa (gingiva, buccal) showed granulomatous inflammation in one case and, in both cases, thick irregular agglomerations of anomalous, tortuous, red-stained elastic fibers. The red labial papules resemble elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS). Similar skin lesions have been described, but never before in association with oral or perioral tissue. In addition to oral lesions, one of the patients developed a general intolerance to the drug and was switched to trientine hydrochloride. CONCLUSIONS: WD patients and others treated with D-PCA may develop oral and perioral complications, in some cases exhibiting characteristics of damaged elastic fibers in the mucosa and periodontal apparatus. It is possible that this damage is one of the factors responsible for poor periodontal health in patients with WD. Recognition of injuries may lead to replacement of the affected therapeutic agent.",,"Tovaru, S.;Parlatescu, I.;Dumitriu, A.

310,Preparation of specific polyamine functionalized copper adsorbents for the selective adsorption of copper,"The serum free copper level is greatly elevated in Wilson's disease. For patients with acute Wilson's disease, liver transplantation is the only life-saving treatment. Plasma exchange or albumin dialysis is often used as a bridge to liver transplantation to maintain a stable clinical status for patients. Hemoperfusion is another effective therapy to remove toxins from plasma. However, hemoperfusion has not been reported to remove copper due to the lack of copper-specific adsorbent. In this work, the copper chelating agents, triethylenetetramine and tetraethylenepentamine, were covalently immobilized on macroporous poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) microspheres to prepare copper-specific adsorbents. The resulting adsorbents showed good adsorption capacities of 63.44 and 58.48 mg/g, respectively, for the Cu2+ ion. Furthermore, with the interference of other metal ions such as Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+, the prepared copper adsorbents still showed good specificity towards the Cu2+ ion. These results indicate that adsorbents are promising adsorbents in hemoperfusion therapy for selective removal of copper in patients with severe Wilson's disease.

311,Wilson's disease: histopathologic correlations with treatment in follow-up liver biopsies,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the progression of liver histopathology in serial liver biopsies from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: We present a group of 12 patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine who underwent multiple follow-up liver biopsies. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, and all patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. RESULTS: The time to repeat the biopsy ranged from 2 to 12 years. Six patients (non-progressors) showed stable or improved liver histology. In one case, we observed improvement of fibrosis from stage 2 to 0. Six patients (progressors) had worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between histologic findings and serum aminotransferases or copper metabolism parameters. Liver copper concentration reached normal levels in only two patients: one from the non-progressors group and one from the progressors group. The estimated rate of liver fibrosis progression in the entire group was 0 units per year between the first and second liver biopsies (4 years), and 0.25 between the second and third (3 years). years). In the progressor group, the rate of liver fibrosis progression was estimated at 0.11 fibrosis units per year between the first and second biopsies and 0.6 fibrosis units between the second and third biopsies. CONCLUSION: The inability of clinical tools to detect fibrosis progression in WD suggests that a liver biopsy with liver copper quantification should be considered every 3 years.",,"Cope-Yokoyama, S.;Finegold, M.

312,Copper deficiency myelopathy,"Acquired copper deficiency has been recognized as a rare cause of anemia and neutropenia for more than half a century. Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) has only been described in the last decade and represents a treatable cause of noncompressive myelopathy that closely resembles subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Here, 55 case reports from the literature are reviewed with respect to their demographics, etiology, hematologic and biochemical parameters, spinal imaging, treatment, and outcome. The pathophysiology of copper metabolism disorders is discussed. CDM occurred more frequently in the fifth and sixth decades and was more frequent in women (F:M = 3.6:1). Risk factors included previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, zinc overload, and malabsorption syndromes, all of which affect copper absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The etiology was not established in 20% of the cases. Elevated zinc levels were detected in some cases not considered to have primary zinc overload, and in this situation the contribution of zinc to the copper deficiency state remained unclear. Cytopenias were found in 78%, particularly anemia, and a myelodysplastic syndrome may have been misdiagnosed in the past. Spinal MRI was abnormal in 47% and generally showed a high T2 signal in the thoracic and posterior cervical cord. In a clinically compatible case, MDL may be suggested by the presence of one or more risk factors and/or cytopenias. Low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels confirmed the diagnosis and, unlike Wilson's disease, urine copper levels were typically low. Treatment comprised copper supplementation and modification of any risk factors, and led to hematologic normalization and neurologic improvement or stabilization. Since any neurological recovery was partial and the number of CDM cases will continue to increase with the increasing use of bariatric gastrointestinal surgery, clinical vigilance will remain the key to minimizing neurological sequelae. Recommendations are made for treatment and prevention. [References: 91]",,"Jaiser, S. R.;Winston, G. P.",2010,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5511-x,0,0,
313,Evaluation of Cupramine and Syprine for the disincorporation of (60)Co and (210)Po,"The recognized risk of deliberate release of radionuclides into local settings by terrorist activities has fueled a drive to improve new materials and methods to remove internally deposited radionuclides. These decorporation treatments will also benefit workers in the nuclear industry, should an exposure occur. Cupramine and Syprine are oral treatments based on the active ingredients D-penicillamine and N,N'-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine dihydrochloride, respectively. These therapeutic drugs have been used for several decades to treat Wilson's disease, a genetic defect that causes copper overload, by chelating and accelerating excretion of internally deposited copper. Studies were conducted to evaluate these FDA-approved drugs for the in vivo decomposition of radioactive cobalt (Co) and polonium (Po) using male Wistar-Han rats. In these studies, animals were administered Co or Po by IV injection, followed by oral doses of Cuprimine or Syprine. Control animals received the radionuclide alone. For the Co studies, animals received a single dose of Cupramine or Syprine, while for the Po studies, animals received repeated doses at 24-h intervals for a total of 5 doses. Results show that Syprine significantly increased urinary excretion and skeletal Co concentrations compared to controls. Although cuprimine had little effect on total Co excretion, skeletal, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach tissues had significantly lower radioactivity compared to control animals. The low overall excretion of Po made it difficult to reliably measure urinary or fecal radioactivity and to draw a definitive conclusion about the effect of cuprimine or siprine treatment on excretion. However, cuprimine treatment was effective in reducing Po levels in the spleen compared to controls. Similarly, Syprine treatment produced statistically significant reductions in Po in spleen and skeletal tissues compared to control animals. Based on these promising findings, further studies are warranted to assess the dose-response pharmacokinetic profiles for decorporation.",,"Levitskaia, T. G.;Creim, J. A.;Curry, T.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of the morning urinary copper/creatinine or copper/zinc ratio as a surrogate parameter for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Five random urine samples collected over 24 hours from two hospitalized patients were used to estimate the consistency of urinary copper/creatinine and copper/zinc ratios. Correlation of ratios with 24-hour urine copper excretion was studied in 15 patients with liver disease. The diagnostic value of the morning urine copper/zinc ratio was further studied in 9 children with Wilson's disease and 22 children with other liver diseases. RESULTS: The coefficients of variation of the urinary copper/creatinine and copper/zinc ratios during 24 hours were 12.5% and 9.3%, respectively. Morning urinary copper/creatinine ratio, copper/zinc ratio, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were well correlated. The area under the receptor operating characteristic curve was comparable between morning urinary copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (0.983 vs. 0.977).

315,Wilson's disease: long-term follow-up of a cohort of 24 patients treated with D-penicillamine,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Detailed data on the long-term effectiveness of various drug therapies in Wilson's disease (WD) are lacking. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed our cohort of patients treated with D-penicillamine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study reports on the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and disease course in 24 ED patients treated long-term (15+/-12 years, between 1969 and 2009) with D-penicillamine. RESULTS: Overall survival in our cohort was 91.6%. Twenty-two of 24 patients had liver disease at presentation, 17 of 24 patients (71%) had cirrhosis, 11 of whom had complications of cirrhosis. Six of 11 of these patients showed liver improvement (five of six) or stabilization (one of six), three of 11 were transplanted, one of 11 died, one of 11 discontinued follow-up. In all six of 17 uncomplicated cirrhotic patients, improvement (four of six) or stabilization (two of six) occurred. Of all other patients (seven of 24), five of seven showed improvement (three of five) or stabilization (two of five), hepatological deterioration occurred in only one patient due to poor adherence to therapy, and one of seven discontinued treatment. follow-up. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 13 of 24 at presentation and resolved in one of 13, decreased in seven of 13, stabilized in four of 13, and worsened in one of 13 patients (due to poor compliance). In general, we observed a favorable hepatological and neurological evolution with D-penicillamine. CONCLUSION: Despite the presence of liver disease or neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline in all but one of the patients, we report beneficial results on liver and neurological disease after very long-term treatment with D-penicillamine, adding to its reputation as 'first-line therapy in WD.",,"Lowette, K.

316,Tetrathiomolybdate inhibits copper trafficking proteins through metal cluster formation,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is an orally active agent for the treatment of disorders of copper metabolism. Here we describe how TM inhibits proteins that regulate copper physiology. Crystallographic results reveal that the surprising stability of the drug complex with the metallochaperone Atx1 arises from the formation of a sulfur-bridged copper-molybdenum group reminiscent of those found in iron-sulfur molybdenum proteins. Spectroscopic studies indicate that this pool is stable in solution and corresponds to physiological pools isolated from animal models of Wilson's disease treated with TM. Finally, mechanistic studies show that the drug-metallochaperone inhibits metal transfer functions between copper trafficking proteins. The results are consistent with a model in which TM can directly and reversibly downregulate copper delivery to secreted metalloenzymes and suggest that proteins involved in metal regulation could be fruitful drug targets.",,"Alvarez, H.

317,"Copper and zinc in serum, urine and hair of patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine and zinc","The purpose of this study was to determine the different levels of copper and zinc in the serum, urine, and scalp hair of patients with Wilson's disease who received different currently accepted treatment methods for reducing copper load (penicillamine-group 1, n = 8; zinc-group 2, n = 8; penicillamine+zinc-group 3, n = 8). Blood, urine, and hair samples were collected from the patients. All three treatments resulted in a significant decrease in serum copper levels. Significantly elevated serum zinc levels were detected in patients in groups 2 and 3 (19.1 and 18.8 micromol/l, respectively; p < 0.05). Urinary copper excretion increased significantly during its administration to groups 1 and 3 (11.5 and 7.94 micromol/24 h, respectively; p < 0.001) due to the effect of penicillamine. The administration of zinc in monotherapy (group 2) or in combination with penicillamine (group 3) caused an increase in its excretion (25.3 and 22.4 micromol/24 h, respectively; p < 0.01). Only negligible increase in hair copper content was found in all three groups of patients.

318,Zinc and tetrathiomolybdate for the treatment of Wilson's disease and the potential efficacy of anti-copper therapy in a wide variety of diseases,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disease of copper accumulation and copper toxicity primarily in the liver and brain, has been the driving force behind anti-copper drug development. Here we first briefly review Wilson's disease, then review the four anti-copper drugs used to treat Wilson's disease. We then discuss the results of anti-copper drug therapy in Wilson's disease, with particular emphasis on the newer and better drugs, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate. We then discuss new areas of anti-copper therapy, reducing copper availability with tetrathiomolybdate as therapy in fibrotic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Many of the cytokines that promote these disorders are copper-dependent, and decreased copper availability decreases the activity of these cytokines, favorably influencing a variety of disease processes. Copper in the blood can be considered as two puddles. One group is covalently linked to ceruloplasmin, a six-copper-containing protein synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. Ceruloplasmin copper accounts for almost 85 to 90% of blood copper in normal people. This copper is tightly bound and not readily available for cellular uptake and copper toxicity. The other 10-15% of copper binds more loosely to albumin and other small molecules in the blood, and is readily and freely available to cells and available to cause copper toxicity, if this copper pool increases. We call this last group of copper ""free"" copper due to its greater availability. However, it must be understood that it is not completely free, being always bound to albumin and other molecules. It is this pool of free copper that is greatly expanded in untreated Wilson's patients who experience copper toxicity.",,"Brewer, G. J.",2009,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b901614g,0,0,
319,Impact of the discovery of human zinc deficiency on health,"The essentiality of zinc was recognized 46 years ago. Zinc deficiency resulting in growth retardation, hypogonadism, immune dysfunction, and cognitive impairment affects nearly 2 billion people in the developing world. The high phytate content of cereal proteins consumed in the developing world results in less availability of zinc for absorption. Zinc therapy has been a very successful and life-saving measure in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and Wilson's disease. Beneficial therapeutic responses to zinc supplementation have been observed in acute diarrhea in children, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, and the common cold. Zinc supplementation was effective in decreasing the incidence of infections in the elderly and patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc supplementation was effective in preventing blindness in 25% of the elderly with dry-type age-related macular degeneration. Zinc supplementation in the elderly decreased oxidative stress and decreased the generation of inflammatory cytokines. Zinc is an intracellular signaling molecule in monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and plays an important role in cell-mediated immune functions and oxidative stress. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory agent. These unique properties of zinc may have significant therapeutic benefits in various diseases in humans. In many diseases, concomitant zinc deficiency can complicate the clinical features, negatively affect the immune status, increase oxidative stress, and increase the generation of inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causal roles in many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, various malignancies, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is important that zinc status be assessed and zinc deficiency corrected in these chronic diseases. A controlled clinical trial of zinc supplementation in these disorders is warranted to document the preventive and therapeutic effects of zinc. [References: 43]",,"Prasad, A. S.",2009,Jun,,0,0,112.0
320,Zinc: an essential micronutrient,"Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism that catalyzes more than 100 enzymes, facilitates protein folding, and helps regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes are at increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific and include growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective for the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea, and as adjunctive treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc in combination with antioxidants may be modestly effective in slowing the progression of middle and late age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson's disease. Current data do not support the efficacy of zinc supplementation for upper respiratory infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated in recommended doses. Adverse effects of prolonged high-dose zinc use include suppressed immunity, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible genitourinary complications.

322,Reduced expression of ATP7B affected by mutations causing Wilson's disease is rescued by pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin,"UNLABELED: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes ATP7B, a protein located in the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic excretion of copper. Current treatment involves reduction of circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients have neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that defects resulting from some WD mutations are ameliorated by pharmacological treatment aimed at improving protein folding and restoring protein function. This required a systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of distinct ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V, and p.S1363F) resulted in reduced protein expression. ATP7B, while the messenger RNA abundance was not affected. Retention of mutant ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression and normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30 degrees C, and homology modeling suggested that these proteins were misfolded. Four distinct mutations exhibited residual copper export capability, while other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression in most ATP7B mutants. CONCLUSION: These findings could enable new treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity. 1795.).",,"van den Berghe, P.

323,Enfermedad de Wilson: una perspectiva india,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease involving a defect in copper transport by hepatic lysosomes. Leads to excessive deposition of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and skeletal system, most often affecting children or young adults and having an invariably fatal course if not adequately treated with copper removal therapy . The last century has witnessed several changes, among which stand out: increased awareness, better diagnostic facilities leading to earlier recognition even in the presymptomatic phase, clear distinction from its imitators, aggressive therapeutic approaches due to the availability of effective treatment and an overall reduction in morbidity and mortality. It is widely recognized that the disease is not as rare as once believed. Sir SAK Wilson published his landmark article in 1912, but it was only in 1968 that the first WD patient was reported in our country. Indian publications on WD have focused on phenotypic characterization, documentation of less recognized aspects of the disease, eg, seizures, behavioral abnormalities, speech and cognitive impairment, subclinical visual pathway involvement, cardiac function and autonomic and presymptomatic detection. Attempts have been made to understand the clinical heterogeneity of the disease through the identification of biochemical and immunological markers, magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological study, and genetic analysis for new and/or known mutations. The assessment of impairment and severity and the effect of various therapeutic interventions, namely zinc sulfate, on long-term outcome and quality of life have also been studied. However, physicians often face difficulties in the long-term care of these patients. Diagnostic errors leading to delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment are common, even in patients with a positive family history. There is no consensus regarding therapeutic protocols as experts have debated the use of penicillamine, once the ""gold standard"" for treatment.

Molecular diagnosis has improved and complements current biochemical and clinical methods for the detection of Wilson's disease. Screening for Wilson's disease in newborns is feasible and has been tested in limited populations, but is not yet widely performed. Identification of patients with Wilson's disease as a cause of acute liver failure is possible by standard biochemical tests. Treatments for Wilson's disease include chelating agents and zinc salts, and liver transplantation. Future therapies may include hepatocyte transplantation and gene therapy, both of which have been tested and shown to work in animal models of Wilson's disease.

328,Treatment of Wilson's disease with tetrathiomolybdate: V. Control of free copper by tetrathiomolybdate and comparison with trientine,"It has become clear that ""free"" serum copper (copper that does not bind to ceruloplasmin in the blood) is the copper that causes copper toxicity in Wilson's disease. But until now, free copper has not been closely followed during the initiation of anti-copper therapy in patients with a neurological presentation. During this period of initial therapy, the future fate of these patients hangs in the balance: if they worsen neurologically, as they often do with penicillamine or trientine therapy, many never recover. We hypothesize that free copper levels are a biological marker of clinical outcome in these patients. In this article, we evaluate free copper control in 3 studies of initial anti-copper treatment in patients with neurologically present Wilson's disease. The first (Study 1) is a 55-patient open-label trial of tetrathiomolybdate, the second (Study 2) is a 48-patient double-blind trial comparing tetrathiomolybdate and trientine, and the third (Study 3) is a 40-patient comparison trial. double blind of 2 tetrathiomolybdate disease regimens. Free copper levels were determined by subtracting copper bound to ceruloplasmin and tetrathiomolybdate from total serum copper. Tetrathiomolybdate showed very strong control of free copper levels during the 8 weeks of treatment in the open-label study of 55 patients (Study 1), reducing it to a mean value of approximately one fourth or less of the initial value. In the double-blind study with tetrathiomolybdate/trientine (Study 2), tetrathiomolybdate again showed good control of free copper levels during 8 weeks of treatment, which is significantly better than trientine. In the trientine arm of Study 2, mean free copper levels actually increased during trientine therapy. The 5 patients who worsened neurologically on trientine therapy during 8 weeks of treatment showed significant spikes in serum free copper levels associated with neurological worsening. Patients who did not worsen neurologically generally did not show significant spikes in free copper. Tetrathiomolybdate controlled copper less well in the dose regimen study (Study 3) than in the previous 2 studies of tetrathiomolybdate treatment, probably due to a change in the way tetrathiomolybdate was administered ""outside of food"".",,"Brewer, G.

We present a patient with WD who developed nonconvulsive status epilepticus (SE) during tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) therapy and review the last 20 years of the relevant literature. CLINICAL CASE: A 55-year-old male, right-handed, with WD, with parkinsonian features and liver cirrhosis, who was admitted due to seizures. Seizures began at week 4 of treatment with TTM (Phase III Study of Tetrathiomolybdate Dose Regimen in Wilson's Neurological Disease). Seizures were characterized by forced clonic eye, right head deviation, and right arm posturing followed by unresponsiveness, bilateral blinking, and right hand automatisms. EEG confirmed frequent left frontal seizures. He developed nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) with electrographic seizures every 5-10 minutes, each lasting 1-2 minutes. Seizures were controlled within 24 hours with fosphenytoin, midazolam, and levetiracetam. Brain MRI showed diffuse atrophy, mineralization of the basal ganglia, and increased FLAIR signal in patches in the left frontal lobe. LITERATURE REVIEW: We found reports of 6 WD patients with SE, two at disease presentation and before copper removal treatment, and four after months or years of D-penicillamine treatment. CONCLUSION: SE occurs rarely in WD, and our case is the only one reported to develop SE during treatment with TTM. As the literature documented two patients with WD who developed SE before treatment with copper deposits, we hypothesize that seizures in WD may be the result of disease progression or a combination of factors, but not necessarily due to their treatment. only.",,"Pestana Knight, E.

We hypothesize that in existing cirrhosis, there may be a fine balance between fibrosis formation and fibrosis dissolution, which may be pushed in the direction of dissolution by anti-copper drugs. So, in this study, we produced liver fibrosis in mice by carbon tetrachloride treatment, then we gave half of the fibrotic mice tetrathiomolybdate for 3 months, while the other half of the fibrotic mice received nothing for 3 months. months and served as a control. Tetrathiomolybdate caused a dramatic and significant reduction in fibrosis as measured by levels of hydroxyproline (the main amino acid constituent of collagen), almost back to baseline levels, compared to controls, who had only a slight and non-significant reduction. It is clear from this animal study that the dissolution of preexisting fibrosis can be strongly catalyzed by lowering copper levels with tetrathiomolybdate.

Evaluation included a detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory tests, genetic analysis, and liver biopsy. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.27 +/- 3.62 years (range 4 months-18 years). Twenty patients were symptomatic, 19 were referred for abnormal liver function test results and/or hepatomegaly, and 18 received their diagnosis after family screening.

339,The use of tetrathiomolybdate copper-reducing therapy in medicine.,"BACKGROUND: Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), an anti-copper drug, has been developed for the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease. In animal models, lowering copper levels with TM produces antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, antiautoimmune, and anticancer effects, which are thought to be due to inhibition of many cytokines that depend on available copper for their activity. Clinical trials have been performed relatively extensively in Wilson's disease and advanced cancers, but are still in their infancy in other diseases. OBJECTIVES: To review the current preclinical and clinical studies performed with TM, and our current understanding of the efficacy and toxicity of TM. METHODS: We have reviewed the last 10 years of literature on MT therapy. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: TM has excellent efficacy and acceptable toxicity for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease with neurological presentation. TM has excellent efficacy in animal models of fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases, as well as in models of Alzheimer's disease. [References: 72]",,"Brewer, G.

340,Reactivity and kinetic studies of (NH4)2(MoS4) in acidic aqueous solution: possible relevance for the angiostatic function of the MoS4(2-) ligand,"Although the addition of mineral acids to WS(4)(2-) in water is known to lead to aggregation and formation of various polynuclear thiotungstate anions, acid hydrolysis of the MoS(4)(2-) anion is reported to produce mainly MoS(3) or MoS(2) as hydrolysis products. Knowledge of the products resulting from such reactions has implications for the use of tetrathiomolybdate (MoS(4)(2-)) as a possible antitumor drug and for the treatment of Wilson's disease. In this investigation, the reaction of HCl with MoS(4)(2-) in water was monitored as a function of time. Reaction mixtures of 1:1 and 2:1 molar ratios of acid to MoS(4)(2-) as well as reactions of MoS(4)(2-) were examined in simulated human stomach fluids at a pH of approximately 2 and 3. Monitoring by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy has clearly revealed the formation of complex mixtures of polynuclear thiomolybdates (Mo(2)-Mo(18) ). Generally, a consecutive two-step reaction sequence occurs. A faster stage (k=7.0-7.9 x 10(-2)min(-1)), which appears to extend to trinuclear thiomolybdate species, followed by a slower second stage (k=5.4 -15.2 x 10(-4)min (-1)) to higher polynuclear thiomolybdates. Under acidic conditions (eg, pH about 3) that might also mimic some human stomach fluids, and in an anaerobic atmosphere in which generated hydrogen sulfide is prevented from escaping from the reaction vessel, Mo(3)S (9)(2-) prevails over a prolonged reaction period. In similar reactions under aerobic conditions and where hydrogen sulfide is irretrievably lost from the reaction mixture, the binuclear (Mo(2)O(a)S(10-a)(2-);a=0-3) and trinuclear (Mo Anions (3)O(b)S(9-b)(2-) predominate;b=1-3).",,"Quagraine, E.

342,High frequency of the mutation c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) in the ATP7B gene of Lithuanian patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of ATP7B gene mutation in patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease (WD) in Lithuania. METHODS: Eleven unrelated Lithuanian families, including 13 WD patients, were evaluated. Clinically, the diagnosis of WD was established according to the Leipzig scoring system. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole venous blood by a salt precipitation method. First, the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect the mutation c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q). Patients who were not homozygous for the c.3207C>A mutation (p.H1069Q) were further analyzed. The 21 exons of the WD gene were amplified in a thermocycler (Biometra T3 Thermocycler, Gottingen, Germany). Direct sequencing of the amplified PCR products was performed by cycle sequencing using fluorescent dye terminators on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). RESULTS: A total of 13 patients with WD (mean age 26.4 years; range 17-40; men/women 3/10) with liver disorders and 16 first-degree relatives (including 12 siblings) were studied. Some of the patients with WD, in addition to liver symptoms, have had extrahepatic disorders (hemolytic anemia 3; Fanconi syndrome 1; neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorder 2). Liver biopsy samples were available in all 13 WD patients (8 had cirrhosis; 1 chronic hepatitis; 3 acute liver failure, 1 hepatic steatosis). Twelve of 13 (92.3%) patients with WD had the mutation c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q), 6 of them on both chromosomes, 6 presented as compound heterozygotes with c.3472-82delGGTTTAACCAT, c.3402delC, c. 3121C>T (p.R1041W) or unknown mutations. For a patient with liver cirrhosis and psychiatric disorder (Leipzig score 6), no mutations were found. Of the 16 first-degree relatives with WD, 11 (68.7%) were heterozygous for the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation. Two patients with fulminant WD died of acute liver failure and 11 are in complete remission under treatment with penicillamine or zinc acetate. Three women with WD successfully delivered healthy babies. CONCLUSION: The nonsense mutation c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) is the most characteristic mutation in Lithuanian patients with WD. Even 92.3% of WD patients with hepatic presentation of the disease are homozygous or compound heterozygous for the p.H1069Q mutation.",,"Kucinskas, L.;Jeroch, J.;Vitkauskiene, A.;Sakalauskas, R.;Petrenkiene, V.;Kucinskas, V.;Naginiene, R.;Schmidt, H.;Kupcinskas, L.",2008,2014-10-01 00:00:00,,0,1,
343,The risks of free copper in the body and the development of useful anti-copper drugs,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the toxicity and risks of free copper in Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, and cognitive loss in the general population. We will also review anti-copper drugs and how reducing free copper levels with an anti-copper drug inhibits fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Some interesting recent work indicates that free copper levels are increased in Alzheimer's disease, and copper may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, opening the way to potential anti-copper drug therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Copper may also be involved in other neurodegenerative diseases. A very exciting recent study blames high copper intake, primarily from copper supplements, along with a high-fat diet on faster cognitive decline in the general population. Other data indicates that even low levels of copper in drinking water, perhaps similar to copper supplements, bypass the liver, enter the circulation, increase penetration of copper into the blood and brain, and can cause damage . ABSTRACT: Some of the implications are that Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and fibrotic, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases can be treated by reducing the availability of free copper. People in the general population may wish to take steps to lower their free copper levels, and in particular refrain from taking copper supplements and from ingesting significant amounts of copper in drinking water.

During these two periods, d-penicillamine was introduced to Taiwan through NAMRU-2, primarily as a study drug; and (3) The third period was the 1980s and beyond. Tu and Leu reported on the clinical manifestations, tissue copper concentrations, and therapeutic effects of d-penicillamine, including cupryuresis, reduction of tissue copper content, and prognosis.

346,"Tetrathiomolybdate, a copper chelator for the treatment of Wilson's disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and other indications","Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a copper chelator that has also shown antiangiogenic, antifibrogenic, and anti-inflammatory actions in preclinical studies. The drug, from the University of Michigan, was licensed by Pipex Pharmaceuticals Inc for development in various indications; Development of the cancer drug was later licensed to Attenuon LLC. In a phase III clinical trial, TTM stabilized neurological function in patients with Wilson's disease, resulting in significant recovery in 81% of patients within 3 years of starting therapy; a second phase III trial was ongoing at the time of publication. A phase I/II clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of TTM in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and led the FDA to grant orphan drug status to TTM for this disease. Several phase II clinical trials in patients with various cancer types have also been completed and revealed mixed efficacy. TTM was also evaluated in a phase I clinical trial for age-related macular degeneration, but reported trial results were negative; There has been no further development for this indication. TTM was evaluated for the treatment of psoriasis in a phase II clinical trial, but no data were reported. At the time of publication, phase II and phase III clinical trials were underway in patients with Alzheimer's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. The most common clinical side effects observed for TTM across the range of indications have been anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and transaminase elevations. These side effects generally resolved with dose adjustment or temporary discontinuation of the dosing regimen. It is anticipated that TTM will likely find a niche in the therapy of Wilson's disease, for which current treatment options are limited. [References: 83]",,"Medici, V.;Sturniolo, G.

347,Analysis of kidney failure in children with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Since the various manifestations of renal failure appear at different periods of Wilson's disease, misdiagnosis or misdiagnosis is not uncommon. This study was conducted to find the clinical features of kidney failure in children with Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). METHODS: A retrospective study of 85 children with LD treated in our service between January 1991 and June 2006. Clinical data of 25 patients with renal failure were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 85 patients with HLD, 34 had renal failure. Nine of the 34 patients on D-penicillamine treatment were excluded. Of the remaining 25 patients, 7 had symptoms of renal failure, 5 of them with edema, 1 with macroscopic hematuria, and 1 with acute hemolysis and acute renal failure. Twelve of the 25 patients had proteinuria, 14 had hematuria, and 5 had both proteinuria and hematuria. Urine glucose was positive in 4 patients, urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) increased in 5, and urine beta2-microglobulin increased in 6. Urine red blood cell (RBC) phase was detected in 7 patients, including hematuria in 5 patients and non-glomerular hematuria in 2. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine increased in 1 patient. Ultrasound B revealed bilaterally enlarged kidneys in 3 patients. Renal biopsy showed diffuse mesangial proliferation and IgA deposition in the mesangial region in 1 patient. All 25 patients had KF ring in the cornea and the ceruloplasmin level decreased. Six patients had a family history of HLD. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of renal failure with LD are varied. HLD should be excluded in patients with unexplained kidney failure, while those with HLD should have kidney tests to identify kidney failure.

349,Diagnosis of Wilson's disease: a comprehensive review,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The culprit gene is ATP7B. The worldwide prevalence is about 1 in 30,000, which can vary by population. Higher prevalence rates were reported using more sensitive screening techniques and pilot population screening. Typical presentations include neuropsychiatric and liver dysfunction, while atypical presentations are varied. Diagnosis is based on high clinical suspicion, typical neurological symptoms, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and low serum ceruloplasmin concentration. The conventional value of <0.20 g/l is not a universal diagnostic value. The age of the subjects and analytical variations must be taken into account when interpreting these levels. Patients with inconclusive findings require further investigations, including 24-h urinary free copper excretion, penicillamine challenge, measurement of liver copper, and screening for genetic mutations. Direct molecular diagnosis remains the most decisive tool. Other tests, such as copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, are not reliable. The potential dangers and limitations of these diagnostic markers are critically reviewed in this paper. The mainstays of therapy are trientine, penicillamine and/or zinc. Liver transplant saves the lives of people with advanced disease. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and serum free copper concentration should be monitored in patients receiving long-term copper removal therapy to prevent iatrogenic copper deficiency.

During this observation period, 6 neurological and 9 liver patients improved, while 2 neurological patients deteriorated. Pre-treatment (1)H-MRS analysis showed a statistically significant lower level of mI/Cr, NAA/Cr, and higher Lip/Cr in all improved WD patients compared to controls. In patients with hepatic signs, a statistically significant increase in mI/Cr and Glx/Cr was observed in the second (1 year after treatment) (1) H-MRS. In patients with neurological improvement after treatment at follow-up (1)H-MRS, a statistically significant increase in NAA/Cr was observed. During neurological deterioration, a decrease in Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr was observed, in contrast to another patient with neurological deterioration with exacerbation of liver failure, where a decrease in mI/Cr and an increase in Glx/Cr were observed. Alternations of the NAA/Cr ratio in patients with neurological impairment and mI/Cr and Glx/Cr in patients with liver failure could be a sensitive marker of clinical recovery and impairment in those WD patients.

352,Usefulness of penicillamine-stimulated urinary copper excretion in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in adults,"OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) depends on liver biopsy (LB) and measurement of liver copper. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of penicillamine-stimulated urinary copper excretion (PS-UCE), a non-invasive diagnostic test, for the diagnosis of WD in adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study of patients with suspected WD, total serum levels of copper, ceruloplasmin, 24-hour baseline CSU, and PS-CSU were measured. LB with copper determination was performed in those patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia and low ceruloplasmin or baseline CSU >40 microg/24 h. The diagnosis was established if the ceruloplasmin level was <20 mg/dl and liver copper was >250 microg/g. Results. A total of 115 patients were studied; LB was performed in 43 and WE was diagnosed in 6 (13.9%). Significant differences were found between patients with WD and without WD for baseline CSU (WD: median 134.3 microg/24 h versus without WD: median 19.0 microg/24 h (p < 0.05)) and PS-CSU ( WD: median 1284.0 microg/24h versus non-WD: median 776.0 microg/24h, p < 0.01). In the ROC (receiver-operated curve) analysis, PS-UCE was the best discriminator between WD and non-WD (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.911, best cut-off point 1057 microg/24 h, 100% sensitivity, 82 .3% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: PS-UCE is probably a useful non-invasive test in the diagnosis of WD, improving the selection of patients for diagnostic liver biopsy.

To date, no data on bone mineral density (BMD) in children with Wilson's disease (WD) have been published. In this study, our aim was to investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis in childhood WD and to observe the likely positive effects of penicillamine and zinc therapy on osteoporosis. METHODS: 31 children with newly diagnosed WD and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy children were included. The mean age was 9.0+/-3.2 years (2 to 16 years). Bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were measured at admission and in 13 cases were reassessed after 1 year of treatment with penicillamine and zinc. RESULTS: Mean BMD, BMC, and Z scores of patients were significantly lower than those of healthy children: 0.52+/-0.09 vs. 0.72+/-0.09 (P=0.001) , 19.27+/-13.01 vs. 29.67+/-14.23 (P=0.009) and -2.33+/-1.28 vs. -0.12+/-0.31 ( P=0.001), respectively. The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in children with WD was 22.6% and 67.7%, respectively. BMD and BMC levels were higher in children with neurological involvement. The severity of the disease had no effect on the mentioned parameters. One year of treatment with penicillamine and zinc did not significantly alter the mentioned parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study investigating the prevalence of osteoporosis in children with WD, we found an extremely high prevalence.

360,Dominant psychiatric manifestations in Wilson's disease: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge!,"INTRODUCTION: The recognition of the psychiatric manifestations of Wilson's disease (WD) has diagnostic and therapeutic implications. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and psychopathological characteristics of patients with WD who presented with initial or predominant psychiatric manifestations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 15 patients with WD (M:F: 11:4), from a large cohort of 350 patients, with predominant psychiatric manifestations at baseline, were reviewed. Their initial diagnosis, demographic profile, family history, premorbid personality, clinical manifestations, treatment and evolution were recorded. RESULTS: Their mean age at diagnosis was 19.8+/-5.8 years. Six patients were born to consanguineous parents and two patients had a family history of WD and a history of psychiatric illness. The diagnosis of WD was suspected by the detection of KF rings (all), observing sensitivity to neuroleptics (n=2), a history of jaundice (n=2) and a family history suggestive of WD (n=9). The psychiatric manifestations could be classified into a spectrum of affective disorder (n=11) and schizophreniform illness (n=3). Although psychiatric symptoms improved in five patients with copper removal therapy, seven patients also required symptomatic treatment. Three of the four patients who responded to copper removal therapy were sensitive to neuroleptics. Long-term follow-up of 10 patients revealed variable recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The young patient with psychiatric manifestations with signs such as a history of jaundice, a family history of neuropsychiatric manifestations and sensitivity to neuroleptics should be evaluated for WD to avoid delay in diagnosis and associated morbidity.

361,"Withdrawal of penicillamine from penicillamine-zinc sulfate maintenance therapy in Wilson's disease: promising, safe and cheap","BACKGROUND: Penicillamine, once considered the cornerstone of treatment for Wilson's disease (WD), is quite expensive and toxic, often leading to neurological worsening. Zinc sulfate, intended for the treatment of free copper toxicosis, has become an effective, safe and economical alternative. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of penicillamine withdrawal from maintenance treatment with penicillamine and zinc sulfate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients with WD (M:F: 28:17; age at diagnosis: 13.5+/-63 years), with both penicillamine (P) and zinc sulfate (Zn), could not continue with penicillamine due to economic problems. Restrictions Clinical data, disability and impairment scores (Schwab and England (S&E) score, Neurological Symptom Score (NSS), and Chu staging) and follow-up data from patients maintained on zinc sulfate alone were recorded. RESULTS: Most of the patients (84.4%) presented neuropsychiatric manifestations. The mean duration of treatment with penicillamine (P) and zinc sulfate (P+Zn), before stopping penicillamine, was 107.4+/-67.3 months. 40 patients improved variably, while the rest did not. They received zinc sulfate alone for 27.2+/-8.5 months (range: 12 to 34), and 44 patients (97.7%) remained at status quo or marginally improved. Only one patient reported worsening of dysarthria. Their disability and impairment scores during the combination (penicillamine and zinc sulfate) and Zn alone were: Chu (1.3+/-0.5 vs. 1.5+/-1.9; p=0.4) , NSS (1.8+/-3.1 vs. 1.5+/-2.3; p=0.03) and S&E (96.4+/-5.6 vs. 98.6+/- 3.5, p=0.03). There were no adverse effects.

362,Effect of penicillamine and zinc on iron metabolism in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown, and there is a paucity of data on the actual presence and progression of iron accumulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate parameters of iron metabolism, including liver iron concentration, in liver biopsies and follow-up serum, and urinary pro-hepcidin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with Wilson's disease on long-term treatment were included in the study. RESULTS: Liver iron content was significantly increased in patients treated with penicillamine compared with patients treated with zinc. Serum and urinary concentrations of prohepcidin were significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than in healthy volunteers, despite a normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with penicillamine seems to be responsible for a more marked accumulation of iron in the liver. This observation may warrant a review of long-term treatment modalities for Wilson's disease with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary prohepcidin are significantly increased in Wilson's disease patients compared to healthy volunteers suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, but this needs to be confirmed by a hepatic expression study. of hepcidin in these patients.",,"Medici, V.;Di Leo, V.;Lamboglia, F.;Bowlus, C.

363,MowatâWilson syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype (high forehead, frontal bossing, large eyebrows, medial flaring and sparse midparts, hypertelorism, deep-set but large eyes, large ear and raised lobes, with central depression, saddle nose with prominent rounded nasal tip, prominent columella, open mouth, with M-shaped upper lip, frequent smile and prominent but narrow pointed triangular chin), moderate to severe intellectual deficiency , epilepsy, and variable congenital malformations, including Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), genitourinary anomalies (particularly hypospadias in men), congenital heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and ocular anomalies. The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It seems likely that MWS is underdiagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, formerly called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, more than 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncated mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Genotype-phenotype analysis studies show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor development are consistent clinical features, while frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark that justifies ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. Most of the reported cases of MWS so far have been sporadic, so the risk of recurrence is low. However, rare cases of recurrence between siblings have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require early clinical investigation involving various specialists (including neonatologists and paediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, so rehabilitation (physiotherapy, psychomotricity and speech therapy) must be started as soon as possible.

364,ANCA-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis induced by D-penicillamine in Wilson's disease,"Several drugs, such as hydralazine and propylthiouracil, can induce antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. D-penicillamine has been implicated in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis, but in patients with both diseases, ANCA-associated vasculitides have been reported in the absence of the drug. Therefore, the role of d-penicillamine treatment could not be established. We present the first case of vasculitis associated with antimyeloperoxidase antibodies in a patient treated with d-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Since Wilson's disease has never been associated with ANCA-related nephritis, this case strongly supports that d-penicillamine can induce ANCA vasculitis. The presentation and rapidly progressive and potentially severe outcome of this complication contrasts dramatically with that of membranous and minimal change glomerulopathy, also induced by the sulfhydryl compound.",,"Bienaime, F.;Clerbaux, G.;Plaisier, E.;Mougenot, B.;Ronco, P.;Rougier, J.

The aim was to study the MRI characteristics of CPM-like changes in WD and serial changes. METHODS: Among the 121 WD patients, twenty (M:F:9:11, age at onset: 14.2 +/- 4.6 years) had CPM-like features. All had a progressive neuropsychiatric form of WD. All but five were undergoing copper removal treatment. None had acute deterioration or liver failure. Ten patients underwent repeated studies. RESULTS: Twenty patients with CPM-like changes manifested with a characteristic WD phenotype. Three distinct patterns of CPM-like changes were observed: (a) characteristic round shape -7, (b) ""bisected"" -9, and (c) ""trisected"" -4. Only one had signal changes suggestive of extrapontine myelinolysis. All patients had contiguous midbrain involvement. Serial MRI evaluation in 10 patients, over a mean interval period of 17.4 +/- 13.2 months, revealed complete reversal in one, partial improvement in five, and no change in three.

366,Importance of copper determination in the late onset of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from dysfunction of a copper transporter P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. When hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, excess copper manifests in a toxic action. This article reports the case of sudden and unexpected death of a 22-year-old woman, as a consequence of a subclinical course of Wilson's disease. METHODS/RESULTS: A woman with no medical history of underlying liver disease was hospitalized for nine days before dying due to severe hemolytic anemia of unknown origin. Poisoning by compounds of lead, mercury, cadmium, thallium, zinc, chromium, manganese and arsenic was excluded. Elevated copper levels were found in blood and urine (AAS method) (blood: 3.90 microg/ml, urine: 8.10 microg/ml, 12,140 microg/24h; normal - blood: 0.88 microg/ml, urine: 0.051 microg/ml, < 51 microg/24 h). Symptomatic treatment was immediately applied, aimed at multi-organ failure. Despite intensive care, the patient died. Post-mortem findings indicated the presence of anasacral and ascites, hydropericardium, cerebral edema, orange coloration of internal organs, and cirrhotic liver. Histopathologic examination of liver sections revealed complete micro- and medionodular cirrhotic changes, focal central necrosis of hepatocytes, and cholestasis. The copper content in the liver was 89.8 ug/g (normal: 3.58 +/- 1.71 microg/g). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of the copper content in the tissues is essential for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in life or after death (in life it can be useful for an adequate diagnosis, and after death it allows to determine the cause of a disease). sudden death). The level of copper in the liver in Wilson's disease is about 25 times higher than in the healthy liver.",,"Lech, T.;Hydzik, P.;Kosowski, B.",2007,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15563650701502535,0,0,
367,Cause of death in Wilson's disease,"Before 1948, all patients with Wilson's disease died shortly after diagnosis. In 1948, BAL (dimercaprol) was introduced as a possible effective treatment, followed by penicillamine (1955), zinc salts (1961), trientine (1969), liver transplant (1982), and tetrathiomolybdate (1984). Despite this wide range of therapeutic options, patients still die. This article examines the cause of death in 67 patients (33 men, 34 women) from a series of 300 treated between 1948 and 2000. The patients were classified according to their presentation as neurological, 32 patients, hepatic 11, mixed hepatic/neurological 10, hemolytic, 6, and ""sibling biopsy"" 8. Diagnostic failure was the main cause of death, but there were many other causes of which the main one was poor compliance and the development of malignant disease after 10 years of follow-up.

However, there is a paucity of studies involving sequential changes on MRI in this disease with or without therapy. This study looked at serial MRI changes and their clinical correlation in WD patients. based on altered signal intensity of focal lesions and atrophy. Details of clinical manifestations, Schwab and England activities of daily living score (MSEADL), neurological symptom score (NSS), and Chu staging were recorded. Clinical severity and disability scores were correlated with MRI scores using SPSS v10. The mean age of disease onset and diagnosis was 12.8+/-5.6 years and 14.4+/-6.0 years, respectively. At the time of the first MRI, the patients had been treated for 49.0+/-77.3 months. At a follow-up of 24.2+/-12.2 months, clinically 36 patients had improved, 9 remained the same and 5 worsened. Serial imaging revealed improvement in MRI parameters in 35 patients, no significant change in 10, worsening in 4, and a mixture of resolution and evolving changes in 1. Overall MRI score improved from 8.2+/- 5.7 to 5.9+/-6.6. There was an improvement in measures of disability and impairment in all: Chu stage, 11.5+/-0.7 to 1.3+/-0.6; MSEADL score (%), 79.7+/-27.6 to 88.0+/-25.4; NSS, 10.6+/-11.2 to 8.0+/-11.6, with good clinical-radiological correlation.

369,Validated Quantitative Purity Test and Indicated Stability for Triethylene Tetramine Tetrahydrochloride by Automated Multiple Development,"There is a monograph for Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (Trientine) in the United States Pharmacopeia. But neither the base nor the di- or tetra-hydrochloride salts are in the European Pharmacopoeia. Triethylenetetramine tetrahydrochloride, now used by AGEPS as mature, is more soluble than triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride. It is given to patients with Wilson's disease, which results from a congenital lack of copper metabolism. A quantitative purity test for this drug is developed and validated by automated multiplex high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Validation parameters tested are specifically characterized by retention factor, linearity, multi-nanogram detection and quantitation limits, reliability, and precision. To determine impurities, the triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride monograph in the American Pharmacopoeia is tested. This classic development tank method requires two mobile phases and is not quantitative. High performance liquid chromatography tests with different columns and mobile phase did not give good results for the separation of impurities. Therefore, it is not possible to carry out a comparative validation of the separation of the impurities. Only the triethylenetetramine assay with potentiometer detection has been validated.",,"Dauphin, C.;Poirier, D.;Pradeau, D.",2007,Jul,,0,0,

371,"Hereditary deposit of iron and copper: diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapeutics","Hereditary iron (primary hemochromatosis) or copper (Wilson's disease) deposition is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease characterized by progressive liver pathology and subsequent involvement of several other organs. The prevalence of primary hemochromatosis is approximately 0.5%, about 200 times higher than the prevalence of Wilson's disease. The two diseases are characterized by homozygous occurrences of mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6 (primary hemochromatosis) and the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13 (Wilson disease). Unlike most other inherited conditions, these diseases can be successfully treated, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Serum ferritin values, transferrin saturation, and genetic analysis are used to diagnose hemochromatosis. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the use of urine copper values, serum ceruloplasmin, and liver biopsy. If left untreated, these two genetic diseases result in rapidly progressing multi-organ damage and premature death. The key treatment for hemochromatosis is phlebotomy, for Wilson's disease chelation, or Zn therapy. Although current treatments considerably improve the prognosis of patients, they may be inadequate in patients diagnosed so late that extensive metal deposits have developed in the body. The main research needs in this field are to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of disease progression and to develop new chelators that are more effective and less toxic than those currently available.

372,Wilson's disease in children: serum aminotransferases and urinary copper in treatment with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine),"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and compliance of treatment with trientine or zinc in children with Wilson's disease (WD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all children with WD in our institution's liver/pediatric liver transplant program between 1998 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 22 children with WD were evaluated and treated. Seven with fulminant disease required liver transplantation and 15 were treated with trientine and/or zinc. Ten of those 15 had a follow-up of 12 to 60 months and 6 of the last 10 had a follow-up of 12 to 18 months. All 10 patients were started on a trientine treatment regimen. Mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased from 183 +/- 103 IU at presentation (n = 10) to 80 +/- 46 IU at 12 months (n = 10) and 66 +/- 40 IU at 18 months (n = 7). Mean 24-hour urine copper levels increased from 156 micrograms at presentation to 494 micrograms at 1 to 2 months, then decreased to 71 micrograms after 21 to 24 months of treatment. Three of 10 patients had normalized ALT levels and 1 patient with cirrhosis continued to have normal ALT levels from presentation. Four of 10 patients were documented as noncompliant, as manifested by elevated ALT levels (99 +/- 31 IU); 1 patient had previously normalized ALT levels. In 3 of 10 patients, the ALT level decreased but remained abnormal (93 +/- 53 IU). CONCLUSIONS: Trientine and/or zinc therapy is effective for children with WD.

We have re-evaluated this test. Ninety-eight subjects were studied at presentation. METHODS: Thirty-eight (19 girls, 19 boys; median age 10.3 years; range 5-16 years) had a final diagnosis of WD. Sixty (24 girls, 36 boys; median age 10.1, range 2.3-15 years) had other liver disorders. Urinary Cu was estimated for 24 hours before (baseline Cu) and for 24 hours while penicillamine 500 mg was administered orally 12 hours x 2 (post-penicillamine Cu). RESULTS: Both baseline Cu and post-penicillamine Cu differed significantly between WD patients and controls (baseline Cu: median 6.5 micromol/24 h, range 0.9-109 micromol/24 h, versus median: 0.8 micromol/24 h, range 0.1-19.5, p<0.0001, post-penicillamine Cu: median 36.9 micromol/24 h, range 1.98-219 micromol/24 h, versus median 12, 35 micromol/24 h, range 0.5-49.8 micromol/24 h, p<0.0001).

The aim of the study was to document the clinical and laboratory parameters of the hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease in children. The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in a developing country. Common clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded in 32 children with Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation. Diagnosis was based on positive family history, Kayser-Fleischer ring, low serum ceruloplasmin level, elevated baseline urinary copper excretion, and favorable response to D-penicillamine therapy.

CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old Chinese patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease for which penicillamine 250 mg po once daily was prescribed. However, the patient developed intolerance and penicillamine was discontinued with no alternative treatment. Five months later, he developed decompensated liver cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Ultimately, the patient died due to complications of sepsis and decompensated liver failure. DISCUSSION: The chelating agent is the mainstay of treatment in Wilson's disease, which is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism. Therapy should be instituted and continued for life once the diagnosis is confirmed. Interruption of therapy can be fatal or cause irreversible relapse. Orally administered penicillamine is the chelating agent of first choice. However, its unfavorable side effect profile leads to treatment discontinuation in 20-30% of patients. In most case reports, discontinuation of penicillamine without replacement therapy results in rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis, which is fatal unless liver transplantation is performed. CONCLUSION: Herein, we highlight a case of penicillamine discontinuation in a patient with Wilson's disease without substitution with alternative regimen. This was caused by the unavailability of alternative agents such as trientine in our country. Consequently, the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy and ultimately died within 5 months. A recent study supports a combination of trientine and zinc in the treatment of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. This combination is capable of reversing liver failure and avoids the need for a liver transplant. Both trientine and zinc are not registered in Malaysia. Therefore, liver transplantation was probably the only treatment option for this patient. Therefore, the unavailability of orphan drugs in clinical practice is undoubtedly a matter of great concern.

Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low frequency of the disease. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 163 patients with Wilson's disease, examined at Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany, to determine clinical presentation, diagnostic course, and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria for serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-h urine copper excretion, liver copper content, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and histologic signs of chronic liver damage were met in 86 patients. .6%, 88.2%, 87.1%, 92.7%, 66.3% and 73% of the patients, respectively.

Mutations were not detected in 15% of patients with Wilson's disease. No significant differences in clinical parameters or initial presentation were found between patients grouped according to their mutations. Patients with neurological symptoms were significantly older at symptom onset than patients with liver symptoms (20.2 vs. 15.5 years, p<0.05), and neurological symptoms were associated with a significantly longer time from baseline to diagnosis than liver symptoms (44.4 v 14.4 months, p<0.05). After starting treatment, 76.1% of patients had a stable or improved course of the disease. Disease progression under treatment was more likely for neuropsychiatric than hepatic symptoms.

383,Optimization of seizure therapy in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction,"Patients with epilepsy may have kidney or liver disease that interferes with their treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Also, such diseases can themselves cause seizures. Reduced renal function and hypoalbuminemia lead to the accumulation of AEDs excreted via the kidneys, such as gabapentin, rutabatrin, topiramate, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproate, lamotrigine, and benzodiazepines are less affected. Low protein-bound AEDs are extensively removed by hemodialysis and supplemental doses are required for dialysis patients. Uremia and related conditions, including intracranial hemorrhage, glucose and electrolyte imbalances, and concomitant drug use, can cause seizures, as can dialysis encephalopathy, primary brain lymphoma, fungal infections, and immunosuppressant toxicity in kidney transplant recipients. Liver dysfunction reduces the enzymatic metabolism of AEDs and causes hypoalbuminemia. In these conditions, gabapentin, topiramate, and levetiracetam are preferred, while valproate and felbamate are potentially hepatotoxic and should be avoided. Seizures related to hepatic encephalopathy are controlled with oral lactulose or neomycin. Patients with porphyria may benefit from gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may result from d-penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency. Effective treatment of seizures in kidney and liver disease requires attention to changes in AED pharmacokinetics and appropriate care of underlying diseases. Monitoring of free drug concentrations is a valuable aid to therapy. [References: 41]",,"Lacerda, G.;Krummel, T.;Sabourdy, C.;Ryvlin, P.;Hirsch, E.",2006,2026-12-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

385,Diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease: results from a single center experience.,"OBJECTIVES: To report the diagnostic characteristics, treatment and clinical outcome after different treatments of patients with Wilson's disease followed up for a mean period of 15 years. PATIENTS: Thirty-five patients with Wilson's disease referred to the Department of Gastroenterology at the University of Padua for diagnosis or treatment were followed for a mean of 15 years. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urine and liver copper concentrations), and uptake of the radiostable isotope Cu in plasma protein pools. Liver Cu content was measured by regular follow-up biopsies. Neurological outcome after therapy was assessed using a newly developed scoring system. RESULTS: Twenty-three (65.7%) patients presented liver disease; 12 (34.3%) had mixed neurological and liver involvement. All patients had been initially treated with penicillamine (23) or zinc sulfate (12). Neurological symptoms worsened or remained stationary in 75% of those treated with penicillamine, while zinc treatment improved these symptoms in 90% of treated cases. Both treatments were effective in improving liver symptoms. No differences in liver Cu content emerged between follow-up biopsies in either treatment group. Six patients (26%) had to discontinue penicillamine treatment due to side effects. In total, 4 patients underwent liver transplantation, with success in 3, with a mean survival after transplantation of 4.6 years; the fourth, who had severe neurological impairment, died of central pontine myelinolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillamine and zinc can effectively treat Wilson's disease, although side effects of penicillamine may be severe enough to cause discontinuation.

390,Wilson's disease: an update,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that transports copper. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain. Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters, and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, making identification of genetic defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic relatives of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase chain reaction-based marker analysis. Traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but the use of this drug has been questioned due to reported side effects. The use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate have been recommended, although the results of long-term trials are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic liver transplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both liver and neurological symptoms. Studies of the underlying defects in ATP7B and its putative modifiers ATOX1 and COMMD1 are expected to reveal the genotype-phenotype correlation of the disease and should lead to the design of improved drugs to alleviate patient suffering.

391,Resolution of decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease with zinc monotherapy: a possible therapeutic option?,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic copper storage disorder that often presents with neurological or hepatic symptoms. In cases of hepatic presentation, treatment is usually started with potentially toxic copper binders, such as D-penicillamine or trientine. Although multiple studies have introduced zinc as a low-toxicity, low-cost treatment for Wilson's disease, its use has been limited to single-agent or adjuvant maintenance options. In this report, we describe the use of zinc monotherapy in a patient with a severe hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Zinc has not been evaluated as a single-agent treatment option for active hepatic Wilson's disease. Zinc monotherapy was started in a single patient with fulminant hepatic failure due to Wilson's disease while awaiting liver transplantation. RESULTS: During a 1-year period of zinc monotherapy, this patient experienced normalization of hepatic synthetic function and resolution of hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. Clinical stabilization of variceal bleeding, ascites, and lower extremity edema was also observed. The patient is no longer a transplant candidate as a result of clinical recovery and improvement in the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the potential use of zinc as a low-toxicity, low-cost, single-agent treatment in severely decompensated hepatic Wilson's disease. Despite the promising results in this case, further clinical evaluation will be necessary to fully assess the clinical efficacy of zinc monotherapy.",,"Lee, V. D.;Northup, P. G.;Berg, C.

392,Brain MRI in Childhood Wilson's Disease: Pre- and Post-Treatment Findings with Clinical Correlation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although brain MRI findings in adult Wilson's disease have been described in considerable detail, there is currently a dearth of information regarding brain MRI findings in pediatric Wilson's disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze brain MRI findings in early childhood Wilson's disease and during follow-up after treatment and to correlate these observations with clinical response. METHODS: Fifty patients with pediatric Wilson's disease were evaluated. Fifty baseline and 20 follow-up MR images from 15 patients after penicillamine treatment were retrospectively analyzed and the data correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS: Patients were classified into 3 groups based on initial MRI findings. Group I (n = 23) showed normal MR imaging findings. Group II (n = 15) was characterized by T1-weighted images with increased signal intensity in the globus pallidus (n = 15, 100%), followed by the putamen, midbrain, and caudate nucleus. Group III (n = 12) showed T2-weighted images with higher signal intensity in the putamen (n = 10, 83%), followed by the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, and pons. There was a significant difference in mean age, presence of neurological symptoms, and Child-Pugh classification between the 3 groups (p < 0.001). After copper chelation therapy, changes in follow-up MR images correlated strongly with clinical response to treatment (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MR images of the brain in children with Wilson's disease can be classified into different groups and have shown a significant correlation with clinical findings. Interval changes on follow-up MR images also correlated closely with clinical findings and were useful in assessing clinical response.",,"Kim, T. J.;Kim, I. O.;Kim, W. S.;Cheon, J. E.;Moon, S.

393,"A novel hepatocyte isoform of PLZF lacking the BTB domain interacts with ATP7B, the Wilson disease protein, and upregulates ERK signal transduction","The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) has been described as a transcriptional repressor of the BTB-domain/zinc-finger family, and has been shown to regulate the expression of Hox genes during embryogenesis and the expression of cyclin A in cell cycle progression. Here, a 45-kDa PLZF isoform without a BTB domain was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal region of ATP7B as bait in our determination of the biological functions of the Wilson disease protein. outside of its copper-binding domain. . Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the hepatocyte isoform of PLZF could specifically interact with the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Immunostaining of HepG2 cells revealed that ATP7B and PLZF proteins were apparently co-located in trans-Golgi complexes. Disruption of PLZF expression in HepG2 cells was also found to affect attenuation of ERK activity in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatocyte ERK kinase activities were found to be enhanced as a result of expression of PLZF or ATP7B, but this enhancement was abrogated by deletion of the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Furthermore, a transgenic strain of Drosophila ectopically expressing hepatocyte deltaBTB-PLZF showed phenotypic changes in eye and wing development, and these alterations were fully recovered as a result of ATP7B expression, indicating the obvious interaction in I live between the two proteins. Those PLZF-induced abnormalities were attributed to enhancement of ERK signaling, as demonstrated by phenotypic reversals with loss-of-function mutations in ERK signal transduction in Drosophila. These data suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates ERK signaling through the C-terminus of ATP7B and the hepatocyte PLZF that interacts with ATP7B.

To assess the role of non-ceruloplasmin copper-catalyzed free radical reactions, we investigated erythrocyte metabolism and oxidative stress as a mechanism for hemolysis in eight WD patients during episodes of acute hemolysis and compared them with eight follow-up cases. WD on d-penicillamine therapy and eight healthy children of the same age. Elevated copper levels without ceruloplasmin were found in all WD patients during an episode of hemolytic anemia. There was a marked inhibition in erythrocyte enzymes, namely hexokinase, total adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) from WD patients compared to penicillamine patients and healthy children, indicating impaired erythrocyte metabolism during a hemolytic crisis. Antioxidant status was also found to be compromised, as evidenced by decreased glutathione (GSH) levels, decreased antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) , increased lipid peroxidation and altered plasma antioxidants. Uric acid showed the greatest decrease followed by ascorbic acid. These findings suggest that free radical production by elevated copper without ceruloplasmin through transition metal-catalyzed reactions leads to oxidative injury resulting in impaired erythrocyte metabolism and severely compromised antioxidant status of WD patients. during hemolytic anemia.",,"Attri, S.;Sharma, N.;Jahagirdar, S.;Thapa, B.

397,Paradigm shift in the treatment of Wilson's disease: zinc therapy is now the treatment of choice,"Zinc therapy has replaced penicillamine as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease. The new guidelines reflect the paradigm shift in treatment that has occurred in recent years. In the old paradigm, Wilson's disease was viewed as a genetic disorder associated with accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs once the liver had become overloaded with copper. When left untreated, the disease was considered uniformly fatal. Old treatment guidelines recommended ""breaking down"" with penicillamine because this chelating agent was considered effective in restoring most patients to health. Before starting treatment, patients were warned that their symptoms might worsen during the first few weeks or months of therapy, to prevent them from abandoning penicillamine therapy in discouragement. In the new paradigm, Wilson's disease is considered an inherited disorder associated with copper poisoning. The essence of symptomatic Wilson's disease is poisoning by free copper in the blood, that is, by copper that does not bind to ceruloplasmin. This form of copper is toxic, whereas stored copper and copper bound to ceruloplasmin or metallothionein are not. Treatment of symptomatic Wilson's disease is no longer aimed at 'uncoppering', the removal of accumulated copper, but at normalizing the concentration of free copper in the blood, in order to reverse copper poisoning. This can be achieved safely and effectively with zinc therapy. Zinc induces metallothionein, a highly effective detoxification protein that binds to copper. Oral zinc therapy leads to storage of copper bound to metallothionein in the mucosa of the intestine and excretion of copper in the feces. New treatment guidelines advise against the use of chelating agents as initial treatment because they can aggravate copper poisoning and cause iatrogenic deterioration.",,"Hoogenraad, T.

This document systematically reviews the various types and stages of presentation of Wilson's disease and provides an opinion on the appropriate therapy for each. For patients with neurological disease, the use of tetrathiomolybdate is optimal; for patients with mild to moderate liver failure, a combination of trientine (Syprine, Merck) and zinc is recommended, while a liver transplant is necessary for those with severe liver failure; Zinc therapy alone or trientine alone is recommended as a second choice for patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis without liver failure, for maintenance therapy, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients, and for the treatment of pediatric and pregnant patients.

Other than scleral and skin jaundice, all physical findings were normal. INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS: Diagnostic ultrasound showed an enlarged and hyperdense liver. Laboratory tests revealed a marked increase in serum bilirubin, while aminotransferases were only slightly elevated and alkaline phosphatase was unexpectedly low. Prothrombin and antithrombin III levels were low. There was a negative Coombs hemolytic anemia. Ceruloplasmin was lower than normal. Based on these findings, acute Wilson's disease was suspected. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was immediately transferred to a liver center with transplant facilities. There, urinary copper excretion and copper concentration in liver tissue were found to be elevated. Liver histology showed fibrosis but not cirrhosis.

412,Phase 2 trial of copper depletion and penicillamine as antiangiogenesis therapy for glioblastoma,"Penicillamine is an oral agent used to treat intracerebral copper overload in Wilson's disease. Copper is a known regulator of angiogenesis; copper reduction inhibits the growth and invasiveness of the experimental glioma. This study examined the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of creating copper deficiency in human glioblastoma multiforme. Forty eligible patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme began radiation therapy (6000 cGy in 30 fractions) along with a low-copper diet and increasing doses of penicillamine. Serum copper was measured at baseline and monthly. The primary endpoint of this study was overall survival compared to historical controls within the NABTT CNS Consortium database. The 25 men and 15 women who were enrolled had a median age of 54 years and a median Karnofsky performance status of 90. Surgical resection was performed in 83% of these patients. Normal serum copper levels at baseline (median, 130 microg/dl; range, 50-227 microg/dl) fell to the target range of <50 microg/dl (median, 42 microg/dl; range, 12-118 microg/dl). dl) after two months. Penicillamine-induced hypocupremia was well tolerated for months. Drug-related myelosuppression, elevated liver function tests, and skin rash rapidly reversed with copper replacement. Median survival was 11.3 months and progression-free survival was 7.1 months. Achieving hypocupremia did not significantly increase survival. Although serum copper was effectively lowered by diet and penicillamine, this antiangiogenesis strategy did not improve survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.",,"Brem, S.;Grossman, S.

413,Inhibition kinetics of fungal tyrosinase by copper chelating ammonium tetrathiomolybdate,"Using a copper chelation strategy at the active site of tyrosinase to detect an effective inhibitor, several copper-specific chelators were applied in this study. Among them, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM), known as a drug to treat Wilson's disease, turned out to be an important tyrosinase inhibitor. ATTM treatment of fungal tyrosinase completely inactivated enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetics of the substrate progress reaction using the two-step kinetic pathway and ATTM dilution revealed that ATTM is a tight junction inhibitor and a high dose of ATTM irreversibly inactivates tyrosinase. The reaction kinetics of substrate progress and restoration of activity with a dilution of the ATTM indicated that the copper-chelating ATTM can slowly but reversibly bind to the active site without competing with the substrate, and the enzyme-ATTM complex subsequently undergoes a reversible conformational change, leading to complete inactivation of tyrosinase activity. Therefore, ATTM inhibition of tyrosinase could be classified as a type of complexing inhibition with slow and reversible binding. Detailed analysis of inhibition kinetics gave steady state IC50 and inhibitor binding constant (K(I)) for ATTM as 1.0+/-0.2 microM and 10.65 microM, respectively. Our results may provide useful information on effective tyrosinase inhibitors as whitening agents in the cosmetic industry.",,"Park, K. H.;Park, Y. D.;Lee, J. R.;Hahn, H. S.;Lee, S. J.;Bae, C.

414,Abnormal collagen deposition around hepatocytes in Wilson's disease is associated with hepatocyte-specific expression of lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase as protein-2,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lysyl oxidases catalyze the oxidation of lysine residues in collagen and elastin, thus promoting their polymerization. We have here studied the expression of four lysyl-oxidases in normal and diseased human liver. METHODS: The expression of the different lysyl oxidases in paraffin-embedded liver sections was studied by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Lysyl oxidase enzyme activity as protein-2 (Loxl2 or LOR-1) using a lysyl oxidase assay described above. RESULTS: We have found that the four lysyl oxidases we examined are not significantly expressed in normal liver. In contrast, patients with Wilson's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) express lysyl oxidase (Lox) and lysyl oxidase as protein-2 (Loxl2 or LOR-1) in hepatocytes, and expression is accompanied by deposition of collagen around hepatocytes. Lysyl oxidases are also expressed in additional fibrotic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, but in these diseases expression is limited to fibrotic lesions and collagen does not accumulate around hepatocytes. We have found that Loxl2 is capable of oxidizing collagen lysine residues and behaves similarly to Lox in this regard. The copper chelator D-penicillamine inhibits Loxl2-induced collagen oxidation, but the Lox inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile did not inhibit oxidation using a BAPN concentration at which Lox activity was completely inhibited. Loxl2 also catalyzed the oxidation of cell surface proteins in HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells and inhibited their proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of Lox and Loxl2 in hepatocytes from patients with Wilson's disease and PBC may contribute to liver damage by several mechanisms. The upregulation of Lox and Loxl2 in Wilson's disease could perhaps be used for diagnostic purposes, as their expression is upregulated in hepatocytes even before the onset of fibrosis.",,"Vadasz, Z.;Kessler, O.;Akiri, G.;Gengrinovitch, S.;Kagan, H.

415,Prognostic factors in patients with severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD), a metabolic disorder, is believed to be potentially reversible, even in its severe form. However, some patients do not respond to treatment. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prognostic factors in severe WD. DESIGN: Retrospective audit. METHODS: A total of 140 patients were followed up regularly from February 2002 to May 2004. Twenty-nine (18 men, 11 women) had severe disease, as defined by the modified Schwab score and activities of daily living for England ( MSEADL) of < or = 50% or Chu stage of 3. We analyzed their clinical, laboratory, and MRI features with respect to prognosis. RESULTS: For the severe form, the mean age at the onset of symptoms was 11.5 +/- 6.4 years and at diagnosis 13.3 +/- 7.0 years. The mean neurological symptom score (NSS), Chu stage, and MSEADL were 26.5 +/- 8.2, 2.7 +/- 0.5, and 24.8 +/- 17.4, respectively. Twenty-one patients underwent MRI; 14 had repeat MRI. After treatment, 14 (group A) had progressive worsening, including death in two, while 15 (group B) had sustained clinical improvement. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and MRI scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, diffuse white matter abnormalities were more extensive in group A. Initial full-dose penicillamine therapy might have contributed to the worsening in four patients. Drug compliance was poor in both groups, but treatment resumption did not benefit patients in group A. Serial MRI showed regression of lesions only among patients with clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: Severe WD remains a therapeutic challenge, with early diagnosis and treatment being essential. Specific MRI observations, a 'start small' regimen for penicillamine, and compliance may have prognostic significance. In the absence of clinical predictors, genetic attributes should be explored.",,"Prashanth, L. K.;Taly, A. B.;Sinha, S.;Ravishankar, S.;Arunodaya, G. R.;Vasudev, M. K.;Swamy, H.

417,Genitourinary anomalies in Mowat-Wilson syndrome with deletion/mutation in the zinc finger homeo box 1B (ZFHX1B) gene. Report of three Italian cases with hypospadias and review.,"Hypospadias, when the urethra opens on the ventral side of the penis, is a common malformation seen in about 3 out of 1,000 male births. It is a complex disorder associated with genetic and environmental factors and can be part of genetic syndromes. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial phenotype, Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly, and mental retardation. It is caused by mutations in the ZFHX1B (SIP1) gene of homeo box 1B zinc finger. To date, 68 positive cases for deletions/mutations have been reported. Genitourinary anomalies are common in MWS. Here we report that hypospadias is common in men with this syndrome. In 39 patients for whom this information was available, hypospadias was present in 46% of patients (18/39). In the 3 Italian male cases reported here, hypospadias was always present. Endocrinologists should consider MWS in patients with hypospadias associated with developmental delays/mental retardation, particularly in the presence of a distinctive facial phenotype.

418,Copper-reducing treatment with tetrathiomolybdate as an antiangiogenic strategy in cancer,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a new anticopper agent in development for use in Wilson's disease. It acts by forming a stable tripartite complex with serum albumin and copper, rendering the complexed copper unavailable for cellular uptake. TM is a very potent anti-copper agent and has an excellent safety profile. It has been shown that normal levels of copper are required for optimal angiogenesis. Based on this background, we decided to evaluate TM as an anticancer agent. TM treatment of Her/2neu mice, genetically programmed to develop breast cancer, completely prevented the development of visible mammary cancers, although there were microscopic avascular clusters of cancer cells in the mammary glands of the TM-treated animals. Controls developed macroscopically visible tumors. TM was able to strongly inhibit tumor growth in six other rodent models. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial of advanced and metastatic cancers, freedom from progression averaged 11 months, and some individual results were quite dramatic. Eight phase 2 cancer-specific studies have been launched. The hypothetical mechanism of action of TM is the inhibition of angiogenic cytokines. Unlike other current approaches to antiangiogenic therapy that target single agents, we hypothesize that TM inhibits multiple angiogenic cytokines. Part of this effect appears to stem from inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF(K)B), which in turn controls the transcription of many angiogenic and other cytokines. However, multiple mechanisms probably exist, as some angiogenic cytokines appear to have separate copper-dependent mechanisms. Inhibition of multiple angiogenic cytokines gives MT the potential to be a more global inhibitor of angiogenesis. [References: 67]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2005,May,,0,0,
419,Genes and metals: a deadly combination,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism, with an estimated prevalence of 1:30,000. The most common presentations of WD are liver disease and neurological abnormalities. For many years the diagnosis was based on the results of various clinical and biochemical tests, for which several limitations had been reported. In recent years, the development of new techniques in genetics and molecular biology have provided useful tools in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. However, the presence of several mutations and the fact that most patients are compound heterozygotes means that the problem is not completely resolved. Zinc chelators and salts have been widely used in the treatment of WD patients with favorable outcome, but the debate over first-choice agents continues. Liver transplantation is a cure for patients with decompensated liver disease, but its effect on neurological outcome remains unclear.

422,"Neurological presentation of Wilson's disease: epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment","Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease of copper accumulation and copper toxicity, due to mutations in the ATP7B gene, leading to failure of copper excretion into the bile. It presents clinically primarily as liver disease, psychiatric disease, neurological disease, or a combination of these. The neurological disease is a movement disorder, with speech abnormalities, tremors, incoordination, and dystonia as common features. Diagnosis of patients with a neurological presentation is usually straightforward, with Kayser-Fleischer rings and urine copper greater than 100 microg/day almost invariably present. In the treatment of patients with a neurological presentation, penicillamine should always be avoided, due to the high risk of further permanent, drug-induced neurological deterioration. A new drug that we have developed, tetrathiomolybdate, administered for 8 to 16 weeks, in combination with zinc, is our first choice to treat these patients. In the absence of tetrathiomolybdate availability, zinc or trientine are the next best options. [References: 31]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2005,,,0,0,
423,Wilson's disease in septuagenarian siblings: raising the bar for diagnosis,"Wilson's disease (WD) usually presents in the first decades of life, although some patients present later. We report the clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment outcome of two septuagenarian brothers evaluated as part of a research trial for the treatment of neurological WD. The index case was a 72-year-old woman who suffered progressive neurological disability and later developed subfulminant hepatic failure. Her brother was a 70-year-old man with minimal neurological symptoms and a mild depressive disorder. His liver biopsy revealed only minimal steatosis and fibrosis and an elevated liver copper content (671 Âµg/g liver dry weight). Molecular studies demonstrated compound heterozygosity for the disease-specific ATP7B E1064A and H1069Q mutations in both patients. Both individuals were treated with trientine and Zn followed by Zn maintenance therapy. In the last 5 years, the clinical course has stabilized and improved, although the index case recently died of bronchopneumonia. In conclusion, the advanced age and different clinical presentations of these two subjects with identical ATP7B mutations raise the question of the degree of penetrance of these and other ATP7B mutations. Environmental and extragenic factors are fundamental determinants of the disease phenotype.

425,Novel D-penicillamine carrier nanoparticles for metal chelation therapy in Alzheimer's disease and other CNS diseases,"Metal ions accumulate in the brain with aging and in various neurodegenerative diseases. Aside from the copper storage disease Wilson's disease, recent attention has focused on the accumulation of zinc, copper, and iron in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the accumulation of iron in Parkinson's disease. . In particular, parenchymal beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and its interaction with metal ions have been postulated to play a role in AD progression. Therefore, the strategy of reducing brain metal ions and targeting the interaction of Abeta peptide and metal ions through the administration of chelators has merit. Our recent finding that nanoparticle delivery systems can cross the blood-brain barrier has led us to investigate whether delivered chelators conjugated to nanoparticles could act to reverse metal ion-induced protein precipitation. In the current studies, the Cu(I) chelator D-penicillamine was covalently conjugated to nanoparticles via a disulfide bond or a thioether bond. The nanoparticle chelator conjugates were stable between pH 6 and 8 in aqueous suspension if stored at 4 degrees C, and did not aggregate when exposed to salts and serum. The release of D-penicillamine from the nanoparticles was achieved using reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (as a model for glutathione). Nanoparticles treated only under reducing conditions that released the conjugated D-penicillamine were able to effectively resolubilize copper-Abeta(1-42) aggregates. These results indicate that the nanoparticles have the potential to deliver D-penicillamine to the brain to prevent Abeta(1-42) accumulation, as well as to reduce metal ion accumulation in other CNS diseases.",,"Cui, Z.;Lockman, P.

426,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa associated with pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum during treatment of Wilson's disease with penicillamine,"BACKGROUND: Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a reactive perforating dermatosis characterized by removal of abnormal elastic fibers from the upper dermis through the epidermis. In some cases, it occurs as a side effect of D-penicillamine (DPA) treatment. The first case of EPS induced by DPA was described in 1972 in a patient treated for Wilson's disease. Subsequently, pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)-like skin changes were observed in patients treated with DPA and reported as pseudo-PXE. CLINICAL CASE: We present the clinical, pathological and ultrastructural study of 2 new cases of EPS and pseudo-PXE induced by DPA. These patients had been treated for Wilson's disease for 14 and 16 years, respectively. Characteristic abnormal elastic fibers were found on histopathological examination of EPS and pseudo-PXE skin and confirmed by ultrastructural study. There was no ABCC6 mutation. DISCUSSION: Penicillamine is capable of inducing generalized cutaneous and systemic damage to elastic fibers. Our patients present typical features of DPA-induced elastosis, presenting as EPS and pseudo-PXE. The ABCC6 mutation is associated with PXE and, as expected, was absent in our pseudo-PXE cases. This elastopathy has been related to morphological changes in the elastic fibers secondary to prolonged therapy in most cases. DPA can interfere with elastin crosslinking through inhibition of the enzyme lysyl oxidase or by complex formation with crosslinked precursors, impairing normal maturation of elastic fibers. However, no fatal complication of DPA-induced elastopathy has been reported so far. An improvement in skin lesions is expected after discontinuation of the drug.",,"Becuwe, C.;Dalle, S.;Ronger-Savle, S.;Skowron, F.;Balme, B.;Kanitakis, J.;Thomas, L.",2005,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000081487,0,0,

We compared the effects of three metal chelating agents, N-benzyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (BGD), d-penicillamine (D-PEN), and triethylenetetramine (TETA), on biliary and urinary excretions of Cu using LEC rats. Animals were treated ip with each chelating agent (1 mmol/kg body weight) and then bile and urine samples were collected over 3 h. Because single BGD treatment markedly stimulated biliary Cu excretion, the protective effect of repeated BGD injection on spontaneous hepatocellular damage was further examined. Separate groups received twice weekly BGD injections starting at 11 weeks of age and were compared with saline-injected controls. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and bilirubin level were significantly increased in control LEC rats at 19 weeks of age, and histopathological analysis demonstrated extensive liver damage in these rats. However, repeated injections of BGD prevented increases in serum ALT and bilirubin and blocked histopathologic changes in the liver. Furthermore, although Cu rapidly accumulated in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and serum of control LEC rats during the test period, repeated injection of BGD largely prevented these increases. These results indicate that BGD treatment is effective in blocking excessive Cu accumulation in LEC rats which, in turn, provides protection against spontaneous liver damage.",,"Shimada, H.;Takahashi, M.;Shimada, A.;Okawara, T.;Yasutake, A.;Imamura, Y.;Kiyozumi, M.",2005,2001-01-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2004.06.005,0,0,
428,Recent clinical characteristics of Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation,"BACKGROUND: We conducted this study to assess recent clinical features of Wilson's disease (WD) with hepatic presentation, especially in terms of age, degree of liver injury, and association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Sixteen patients with hepatic manifestations were diagnosed with WD in the period 1976-2003. We divide this period into two periods, ""past"" and ""recent"". Diagnosis was based on the presence of Kayser-Fleisher rings, low serum copper levels, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine challenge, and increased hepatic copper concentrations. This retrospective study was conducted at Ehime University Hospital. RESULTS: Four patients, including a sibling pair, had a family history of WD. Four patients had parental consanguinity. There were 6 patients over 40 years of age in the recent period, while no patients in the past period were over 40 years of age. Four patients had neurological manifestations. Ten patients had liver cirrhosis and 5 had chronic hepatitis. Two had fatty liver without obesity. All patients in the latter period had liver cirrhosis. Three patients with liver cirrhosis were found to have HCC during follow-up. All patients were treated with D-penicillamine or trientine chloride, or both. However, four patients had to discontinue these agents due to side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Recently, the number of patients diagnosed with WD has been increasing, not only in terms of classic-type WD, but also in patients who are elderly or have non-cirrhotic liver damage, such as fatty liver and chronic hepatitis.

429,Value of an enzyme assay for the determination of serum ceruloplasmin,"The serum concentration of the copper protein ceruloplasmin has been an important diagnostic indicator of Wilson's disease (WD). It is widely cited that 95% of people with WD have low serum ceruloplasmin concentrations. Current evidence suggests that a normal serum ceruloplasmin concentration is more common in WD patients, particularly those with liver disease, perhaps in part due to the routine use of an immunological assay. This assay could indicate a normal level of ceruloplasmin when enzyme activity is lower. Enzyme activity is the biologically relevant parameter. We compared the immunological measurement with the enzymatic evaluation of oxidase activity in patients with hepatic or neurological symptoms of unknown origin in whom WD was considered in the differential diagnosis. Although a strong correlation was observed between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity in controls, this was not the case in these patients. Twelve patients, presenting with various types of liver disease, demonstrated a weak correlation between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity. Ten percent of patients with neurological symptoms (n = 41) had low ceruloplasmin levels and oxidase activity, and another 8% had normal ceruloplasmin levels associated with low oxidase activity. Although the enzymatic method is preferred due to its biological relevance, ceruloplasmin analysis is not a reliable diagnostic parameter for the diagnosis of WD in patients with liver disease. An important use of the ceruloplasmin oxidase assay is in the follow-up of patients with WD. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was undetectable in sera from WD patients who underwent long-term chelation therapy, suggesting an early sign of copper depletion and the need for subsequent follow-up for symptoms of copper deficiency. copper.",,"Macintyre, G.;Gutfreund, K.

431,Copper inhibits the water and glycerol permeability of aquaporin-3,"Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is an aquaglyceroporin expressed in erythrocytes and various other tissues. Red blood cells are, along with the kidney and liver, the main targets of copper toxicity. Here we report that copper inhibits the water and glycerol permeability of human AQP3. Inhibition is rapid, dose dependent, and reversible. If copper is dissolved in carbonic acid bicarbonate buffer, our body's natural buffering system, doses in the range of those seen in Wilson's disease and copper poisoning caused significant inhibition. AQP7, another aquaglyceroporin, was insensitive to copper. Three extracellular amino acid residues, Trp128, Ser152, and His241, were identified as being responsible for the effect of copper on AQP3. We have previously shown that Ser152 is involved in the regulation of AQP3 by pH. The fact that Ser152 mediates the regulation of AQP3 by copper may explain the phenomenon of the exquisite sensitivity of human erythrocytes to copper at acidic pH. When AQP3 was coexpressed with another AQP, copper inhibited only glycerol, but not water permeability.

We included 24 patients with 3 or fewer primary Child class A or B hepatocellular carcinoma lesions with diameters of 3 cm or less who had undergone radical treatment with percutaneous ethanol injection or radiofrequency ablation. Trientine hydrochloride was administered orally as a single daily dose of 250 mg to 12 patients before a meal (fasted, group 1) or as a total daily dose of 750 mg, divided into 3 doses, to 12 patients ( group 2). This study was a 12-week randomized between-group comparison study. We use the particle-induced X-ray emission method to determine the mineral content of liver tissue. Serum mineral and urine copper levels were also measured, and transaminase levels were examined. Copper content in liver tissue decreased significantly, to 160.1 microg/g dry weight, after treatment compared to the pretreatment level of 306.8 microg/g dry weight (P < 0.05). ). We did not detect significant differences in iron or zinc content before and after treatment. Copper content was significantly reduced after treatment in both groups (P < 0.05). The level of copper in the urine increased significantly after 1 week of treatment, but then decreased. Serum copper levels were significantly reduced after treatment (P < .01). We did not detect significant differences in the level of transaminases before and after treatment.

436,Copper deficiency as an anticancer strategy,"Copper is a tightly regulated trace element. Alterations in copper homeostasis are rare and cause serious disorders such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease. Copper also plays an important role in promoting physiological and malignant angiogenesis. The formation of new blood vessels by a tumor allows for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. The copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TM), which rapidly and efficiently depletes copper stores, is under investigation as an antiangiogenic agent. Promising results in vitro, in preclinical animal models, and in an early clinical trial (phase I) have led to continued phase II evaluation of TM in patients with advanced cancers.

437,"In vitro evaluation of copper-induced toxicity in the human hepatoma line, Hep G2","Copper, although essential, is highly toxic when present in excess, as in Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder of hepatic copper metabolism. We hypothesize that mitochondria are a primary target of copper-induced cytotoxicity in Wilson's disease. We used the human hepatoma line Hep G2 to examine copper-mediated cytotoxicity and three different methods to assess organelle damage: MTT assay (mitochondria), neutral red (NR; lysosomes), and trypan blue exclusion assay (TB). ; plasma membrane). For all assays, cells at approximately 60% confluency in microtiter plates were incubated with CuCl(2) (concentration range: 50-100-150-200 microM) for 24 or 48 h. The results were expressed as a percentage of the untreated control. At 24 h, the cytotoxicity detected by the NR assay was significantly higher for all copper concentrations than for MTT or TB (p<0.005 for all concentrations). The cytotoxicity detected by MTT was greater than that detected by TB at all concentrations except 200 microM (p<0.05 for 50 microM, p<0.005 for 100 microM, p=0.001 for 150 microM). The results at 48 h were similar (NR versus others: p < 0.001 MTT versus BT: NS except at 150 microM where p < 0.01).

In addition to the diffusion of zinc sulfate through the pores of the wax matrices, the parallel diffusion of zinc sulfate from the matrix surface is dominant for samples with 83% and 90% drug loadings. w/w The combination of SEM and EDS analysis visualizes the morphology of the matrices and the related composition, which explains the differences in the release characteristics.",,"Nagy, J.;Vajna, M.;Devenyi, L.;Zelko, R.",2004,Apr,,0,0,
439,Molecular screening of the ZFHX1B gene in prenatally diagnosed isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum,"OBJECTIVE: Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is the most common malformation of the central nervous system and may be associated with mental retardation. ACC is found in 40% of cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a polytopic embryonic defect that includes a distinctive facial gestalt, severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and postnatal microcephaly as constant features. Other manifestations include Hirschsprung's disease, heart defects, kidney abnormalities, and hypospadias. Among this broad spectrum of malformations recently associated with haploinsufficiency of the zinc finger homeobox 1B gene (ZFHX1B), ACC may therefore be the only feature that is detected prenatally. Thus, we studied a group of 18 fetuses terminated by ACC and performed mutational analysis of the ZFHX1B gene in six selected cases. METHODS: The diagnosis of ACC agenesis was made by prenatal ultrasound study. Detection of ZFHX1B deletions was performed by poly (CA) microsatellite marker studies and semi-quantitative real-time PCR. Mutational analysis was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. RESULTS: Neither the deletion spanning the ZFHX1B locus nor the mutation could be detected in any of the six fetuses tested. CONCLUSION: ZFHX1B is not a major gene in isolated ACC. However, MWS analysis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ACC, especially when facial features raise the possibility of MWS.

Herein, we present an improvement to our method that enables a reference separation of total plasma D-Pen from physiological thiols. In addition, reduced, free, and protein-bound forms of the drug are measured by varying the order of disulfide reduction with tributylphosphine and protein precipitation with 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). After derivatization with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF), samples are separated and measured by laser-induced fluorescence capillary electrophoresis in an uncoated fused silica capillary (57 x 75 micron id) using a running buffer of phosphate/borate pH 11.4. Under these conditions, the migration time of D-Pen is about 7 min and the time required for each analysis is about 10 min. The proposed method has been used to measure the various forms of the drug in a patient with Wilson's disease administered with D-Pen.",,"Zinellu, A.;Carru, C.;Sotgia, S.;Deiana, L.",2004,2025-04-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.01.002,0,0,
441,"Zinc for prostate disease and other conditions: little evidence, much publicity, and a major potential problem","Dietary and supplemental zinc, especially in excess, has received much attention in numerous alternative medicine resources. There is a small amount of medical evidence that zinc may relieve some mostly rare medical conditions (such as Wilson's disease). However, in prostate conditions, such as BPH, large concentrations of zinc are found in the prostate gland. Excessive zinc intake, especially with individual supplements, has the potential to encourage the growth of prostate conditions from BPH to cancer. In fact, a large study found a significantly increased risk of advanced prostate cancer in men who consumed large amounts of these supplements. Large doses of zinc can inhibit the benefits of bisphosphonate drugs, increase testosterone levels, raise cholesterol, lower ""good cholesterol"" or HDL levels, and may promote immune dysfunction. More research is needed in this area, but in the meantime, it seems that the time has come to discourage or immediately stop taking higher concentrations of zinc for most people until adequate research resolves this controversial issue.

Psychiatric or behavioral symptoms may also be a presenting feature of Wilson's disease. We describe an atypical neurological presentation in a prepubertal boy with minimal liver involvement; in which transient hemiparesis and encephalopathy dominated his initial neurological presentation. Brain MRI revealed extensive cortical and subcortical signal change in addition to the classic basal ganglia signal abnormality seen in Wilson disease. He received treatment with oral tetrathiomolybdate anticopper, followed by zinc maintenance. His clinical status and brain imaging improved considerably one year after the start of treatment.

444,Review Article: Diagnosis and Current Treatment of Wilson's Disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that results in liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric disease. Diagnosis of neurological disease is straightforward if the following symptoms are present: Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms, and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. Diagnosis is more complex in patients with liver disease. None of the commonly used parameters alone allows a diagnosis with certainty. A combination of several laboratory parameters is necessary to firmly establish the diagnosis. In the future, limited mutation analysis may play an important role in diagnosis. Recently, a group of international experts has proposed a score based on a variety of tests and clinical symptoms. The validity of this score should be evaluated prospectively. Treatment requires lifelong administration of copper chelators (d-penicillamine, trientine). A frequently used alternative is zinc. None of these treatments have been tested in prospective randomized controlled studies. Liver transplantation is reserved for severe or refractory cases with advanced liver disease, while experience with refractory neuropsychiatric disease is limited.

The authors of this study discuss various aspects of fertility in 16 women with WD. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from a large WD cohort being followed up in a tertiary care center. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had conceived on 59 occasions with 30 successful pregnancies, 24 miscarriages, 2 medical terminations of pregnancy, and 3 stillbirths. The diagnosis of WD was established after conception in 10 presymptomatic patients, while six patients were already on treatment. Among these 16 patients, 9 had a history of spontaneous abortions and 12 had successful pregnancies. None of the clinical features of WD changed during pregnancy, with or without treatment. All 30 babies were born full term and were born healthy. CONCLUSION: Recurrent miscarriages are common, especially in women with untreated Wilson's disease. However, successful pregnancies and uneventful term deliveries can occur in mothers of WD on treatment and in undiagnosed and undetected presymptomatic patients. Pregnancy does not appear to have adverse effects on the clinical course of Wilson's disease.

446,The nucleotide-binding domain of the Escherichia coli Zn2+ transporter P-type ATPase carries a glycine motif that may be involved in ATP binding.,"In P-type ATPases, the nucleotide-binding (N) domain is located in the middle of the sequence that folds into the phosphorylation (P) domain. The N domain of ZntA, a Zn2+ translocating P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli, is approx. 13% identical to the N domain of the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. None of the Ca2+-ATPase residues involved in ATP binding are found in ZntA. However, the G503SGIEAQV sequence in the N domain of ZntA resembles the GxGxxG motif, which is part of the ATP binding site in protein kinases. This motif is also found in the Wilson disease protein, where several disease mutations cluster. In the present work, we have created a set of analogs of disease mutations, including the G503S (Gly503-->Ser), G505R and A508F mutants of ZntA. With low [ATP], these mutant ATPases are poorly phosphorylated. However, the phosphorylation defect of the G503S and G505R mutants can be partially (G503S) or completely (G505R) compensated using higher [ATP], suggesting that these mutations reduce the affinity for ATP. In all three mutant ATPases, phosphorylation by P(i) has become less sensitive to the presence of ATP, which is also consistent with the proposal that the Gly503 motif plays a role in ATP binding. To test this hypothesis, we have modeled the N domain of ZntA using the Ca2+-ATPase structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum as a template. In the model, the Gly503 motif, as well as the Glu470 and His475 residues, are located in close proximity to the ATP binding site. In conclusion, the mutagenesis data and molecular model are consistent with the idea that the two loops bearing residues Glu470, His475, Gly503 and Gly505 play a role in ATP binding and activation.",,"Okkeri, J.;Laakkonen, L.;Haltia, T.",2004,2001-01-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BJ20030740,0,0,
447,Results of treatment of Wilson's disease--own observations,"BACKGROUND: Causal treatment of genetically determined Wilson's disease (WD) has been impossible so far, although gene therapy may be real in the future. Today the principle of treatment is the elimination of easily mobilized excess copper, linked to chelating agents, the most important of which is d-penicillamine, through the kidneys. It is also possible to block the intestinal absorption of copper by administering zinc preparations, which also induce hepatic synthesis of metallothionein. The aim of our study was to present our own observations and results of the treatment of Wilson's disease. MATERIAL/METHODS: During the last 16 years, we have observed 33 patients aged 13 to 60 years (mean age 27 years) with various forms of WD. The study group was made up of 11 women and 21 men, admitted to the hospital or treated at the Specialized Hepatology Outpatient Service with various diagnoses. In addition to standard laboratory tests, ceruloplasmin, serum and urinary copper levels were determined, as well as the activity of some liver enzymes, proteins and markers of HBV/HCV infection. The patients were also examined by a neurologist and an ophthalmologist, with psychiatric consultation if necessary. Taking into account the general clinical presentation, the patients were divided into the following groups according to the form of the disease: fulminant, acute, hepatic, hepatic with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, neuropsychiatric, asymptomatic. RESULTS: All patients were initially treated with d-penicillamine. In most of them, no side effects were observed. The treatment was continued according to the levels of copper excreted with the urine (for a maximum of 10 years). After obtaining clinical improvement with less copper excreted in 24-h urine, we reduced the dose of d-penicillamine or even discontinued the drug, introducing zinc preparations. In asymptomatic carriers, zinc preparations were used throughout the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Early institution of chelation therapy is associated with a good prognosis in both hepatic and neurological forms of WD. Zinc preparations are effective and safe in neurological and oligosymptomatic forms of the disease.",,"Jablonska-Kaszewska, I.;Drobinska-Jurowiecka, A.;Dabrowska, E.;Trocha, H.",2003,Aug,,0,1,
448,Treatment of Wilson's disease,"Based on the review of the literature and our own experience, we present the treatment method for Wilson's disease. Causal treatment has been impossible until now, although gene therapy could be real in the future. Today, the principle of treatment is the elimination of easily mobilized excess copper by chelating agents or by blocking the intestinal absorption of copper. Chelation therapy, aimed at mobilizing copper from affected organs and promoting its excretion in urine or feces, is the most important. The main chelating agent is d-penicillamine, which is quite effective but has some side effects. Alternative chelating agents such as trientine and tetrathiomolybdate have also been used successfully. Zinc salts also have therapeutic value. They promote copper excretion by inducing metallothionein synthesis in the intestine, thus blocking copper absorption in the intestine. Zinc salts have almost no side effects. They cannot be used as initial treatment, but are very effective as maintenance therapy. Chelation therapy is ineffective in patients with acute liver failure with encephalopathy and hemolysis. In these cases, liver transplantation is the only hope for survival. Liver transplants in patients with dominant psychoneurological symptoms are open to discussion.",,"Jablonska-Kaszewska, I.;Dabrowska, E.;Drobinska Jurowiecka, A.;Falkiewicz, B.",2003,Aug,,0,0,
449,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVIII. Initial treatment of the presentation of hepatic decompensation with trientine and zinc,"We have treated 9 patients who developed hepatic decompensation as a result of Wilson's disease with a combination of trientine and zinc, usually for at least 4 months, followed by a transition to zinc maintenance therapy. All of these patients had hypoalbuminemia, all but 1 had hyperbilirubinemia, and 7 had ascites. All of these patients would have been candidates for liver transplantation based on their initial Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. The minimum inclusion criterion for transplant candidates is a score greater than 7. Eight of the 9 patients had demonstrated a CTP score of 10 or greater. The other scoring system that has been used in Wilson's disease to determine the need for a transplant is the Nazer Prognostic Index, in which a score greater than 6 indicates that the patient is unlikely to survive without a transplant if It is treated with penicillamine. Two of our patients had Nazer scores greater than 6. With our medical therapy, all 9 patients regained normal liver function, as reflected by normalization of their CTP scores to 5. Due to coexisting neurological disease, 1 of our 9 Patients started on a neurological protocol and randomly randomized to receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and zinc after 2 weeks of treatment with trientine/zinc. This patient's liver function recovered much more rapidly than that of the other 8 patients, all of whom were treated with trientine/zinc, suggesting that MT therapy offers an additional advantage. In summary, we were able to take 9 patients who presented with liver failure, 8 of whom had CTP scores indicating a possible need for liver transplantation and 2 of whom had Nazer prognostic scores indicating they were unlikely to survive if treated. only with penicillamine. - and treat them medically, with recovery in all 9. We believe that trientine/zinc combination therapy should be the standard for the initial treatment of liver failure in Wilson's disease because its efficacy is equal to or slightly superior to that of penicillamine and because it has a much lower incidence of side effects. Furthermore, TM warrants a study to determine if therapy for hepatic Wilson's disease can be further improved.",,"Askari, F. K.;Greenson, J.;Dick, R. D.;Johnson, V. D.;Brewer, G.

Eighteen patients were followed up and treated with D-penicillamine alone or in combination with zinc sulfate. Treatment improved most neurological symptoms. Dystonic postures, behavioral disturbances, and dysarthria were the most resistant neurological signs. 'Pseudosclerotic' neurological involvement predicted a good outcome, while hepatic onset and 'classic' neurological involvement were associated with a worse prognosis. Two of the 18 treated patients died of hepatic failure due to voluntary discontinuation of therapy. Both D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate were well tolerated. No teratogenic effect of D-penicillamine was observed through 5 pregnancies. Our results suggest that D-penicillamine or a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate is a safe and effective long-term treatment in patients with WD. Copyright 2003 S.

462,Zinc treatment prevents lipid peroxidation and increases glutathione availability in Wilson's disease,"Oxidative and reductive mechanisms are important in Wilson's disease. In this study, we sought to assess tissue levels of glutathione and cysteine, an important detoxification system, and of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, in patients with Wilson's disease receiving treatment with penicillamine or zinc, compared with patients with liver disease. Chronicle of different origin. Concentrations of cysteine, reduced/oxidized glutathione, malondialdehyde, zinc, and copper were determined (using high-pressure liquid chromatography, fluorimetry, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in liver biopsy samples from 24 patients with Wilson's disease (18 treated with zinc, 6 with penicillamine), 34 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and 10 patients with alcoholic liver disease. In patients with Wilson's disease, reduced glutathione concentration was lower than that of patients with viral hepatitis and as high as that of subjects with alcoholic liver damage. The cysteine level was significantly lower than in the control groups, and the percentage of oxidized glutathione/total glutathione was higher than in viral or alcoholic illness. Malondialdehyde levels were low, but when patients treated with zinc and penicillamine were considered separately, only the former had low malondialdehyde levels. Zinc-treated patients had higher concentrations of reduced glutathione and a lower percentage of oxidized glutathione. In summary, patients with Wilson's disease have a significant depression of glutathione, with low levels of reduced glutathione and cysteine and high concentrations of oxidized glutathione: this is prevented by the administration of zinc, which inhibits lipid peroxidation and increases the availability of zinc. glutathione.",,"Farinati, F.;Cardin, R.;D'Inca, R.;Naccarato, R.;Sturniolo, G.

463,Antiangiogenic therapy by copper chelation,"As new compounds are evaluated for use in clinical trials involving antiangiogenic therapies, two important factors must be considered. Regardless of clinical efficacy, the potential drug must be cost-effective and reasonably easy to produce. The compound endostatin (Entremed, Inc.) recently completed two Phase I trials with minimal toxicity to treated patients [1,2]. However, due to the difficulty and cost of producing large quantities of a recombinant protein, Entremed Inc. has experienced financial difficulties [3]. As the fate of this company indicates, a drug must not only be clinically effective, but must also possess reasonable production economics. Another interesting component of compound development is selectivity. Highly selective antiangiogenic compounds, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU-5416, are being replaced by less selective compounds, such as SU-6668, which acts on a broader spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases [4]. This move toward the use of less selective antiangiogenic compounds is based on preclinical models that demonstrate both better clinical efficacy when less specific molecules are used and lower response rates of more selective compounds. With the goal of further examining broad-acting antiangiogenic agents, the authors are currently evaluating new classes of agents that preferentially bind copper and inhibit angiogenesis. Copper has been known to be an important target for antiangiogenic therapy for several years [5]. Recently, using molecular techniques, target enzymes that use copper as a cofactor are being elucidated. This review will describe the historical use of anti-copper therapy for the treatment of Wilson's disease and will evaluate some of the new anti-copper compounds currently under consideration for use in anti-angiogenic therapy.

Due to its rapid action, potency, and safety, TM is proving to be a very effective drug for the initial treatment of patients with severely ill Wilson's disease. Beyond this, MT has antiangiogenic effects, because many proangiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper. This has led to the use of TM in cancer, where it is generally effective in animal tumor models, and has been shown to be effective in preliminary clinical studies. More recently, TM has been found to have antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines. [References: 82]",,"Brewer, G.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of presymptomatic DNA diagnosis and to assess the efficacy of zinc sulfate therapy in families with WD. METHODS: Seventy-eight clinically unaffected siblings were studied from 51 unrelated WD families that were determined by affected individuals. Diagnosis in presymptomatic patients was established by a combination of direct mutational analysis and haplotype analysis with 3 short tandem repeat markers. Presymptomatic patients were treated with elemental zinc sulfate 50 mg twice daily from the time of molecular diagnosis and followed for 3 to 5 years. RESULTS: Of the 78 siblings, 17 were diagnosed as presymptomatic patients. Kayser-Fleischer rings were absent in 7 and weak in 4 of 17 presymptomatic patients. Serum ceruloplasmin values gradually increased and 24-hour urine copper values gradually decreased during zinc therapy, indicating effective control of copper metabolism.

468,Wilson's disease: the importance of measuring serum ceruloplasmin in a non-immunological way,"Wilson's disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any child, adolescent, or young adult with unexplained liver damage, especially when hemolysis is present. However, it can also present in adolescents or young adults with neurological signs limited to the motor system. The first diagnostic screening test is estimation of serum ceruloplasmin and total serum copper concentrations, with calculation of serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin (""free""). Serum ceruloplasmin, which contains copper, is best determined by measuring its oxidase activity, since the immunonephelometric method measures both ceruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo form. Diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient should be screened and, when in doubt, screening for the Wilson gene on chromosome 13q14.3 can be used. Lifelong follow-up studies are best done at a specialized center. Compliance with chelation therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by determining ""free"" serum copper, which should be maintained at or near 1.6 micromol/L (10 microg/L). 100ml).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of neurological worsening and adverse effects of drugs with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. DESIGN: Open-label study of 55 untreated patients (22 of them new) with neurologic Wilson's disease treated with tetrathiomolybdate ranging from 120 to 410 mg/day for 8 weeks and then followed for 3 years. Neurological function was assessed with neurological and scored speech tests. SETTING: A reference environment of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All newly diagnosed patients with untreated neurologic Wilson's disease. INTERVENTION: Treatment with tetrathiomolybdate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by neurological and speech examinations. Adverse drug effects were assessed by complete blood cell counts and biochemical measures. RESULTS: Only 2 (4%) of 55 patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate showed neurological deterioration, compared with an estimated 50% of patients treated with penicillamine. Five of the 22 new patients exhibited bone marrow suppression and 3 had aminotransferase elevations. These numbers are higher than in the original 33 patients and appear to be primarily due to more rapid dose escalation.

472,"Transport systems and detoxification of transition metals, heavy metals and metalloids in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes","Transition metals, heavy metals, and metalloids are often toxic in excess, but several transition metals are essential trace elements. Mechanisms for metal ion homeostasis exist in all cells, frequently involving a balance between the uptake and efflux systems. This review will briefly describe ATP-coupled endurance pumps. ZntA and CadA are P-type bacterial ATPases that confer resistance to Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). Homologous copper pumps include Menkes and Wilson disease proteins and CopA, an Escherichia coli pump that confers resistance to Cu(I). For resistance to arsenicals and antimonials there are several different families of carriers. In E. coli, the ArsAB ATPase is a novel system that confers resistance to As(III) and Sb(III). Eukaryotic arsenic resistance transporters include Acr3p and Ycf1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These systems provide resistance to arsenite [As(III)]. Arsenate [As(V)] detoxification involves the reduction of As(V) to As(III), a process catalyzed by the enzymes arsenate reductase. There are three families of arsenate reductases, two found in bacterial systems and a third identified in S. cerevisiae. [References: 43]",,"Rosen, B. P.",2002,Nov,,0,0,
473,Molecular mechanism of copper transport in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a putative copper transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction results in toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the accompanying hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. to this disease. The cytosolic N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kDa) of this ATPase comprises six heavy metal-associated domains, each of which contains the conserved metal-binding motif GMTCXXC. The N-terminal domain (Wilson's disease copper binding domain [WCBD]) has been expressed, purified and characterized by various techniques. WCBD binds six copper atoms in the +1 oxidation state competitively and with a higher affinity than all other metals. The copper atom is coordinated by two cysteines in a distorted linear geometry. Copper binds to WCBD cooperatively and induces secondary and tertiary conformational changes. Zinc binding to WCBD has also been characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and shown to produce conformational changes that are completely different from those induced by copper. The phosphorylation/nucleotide binding domain of ATP7B has also been expressed and characterized and shown to be capable of binding ATP but to lack ATPase activity. A peptide corresponding to the sixth transmembrane domain of ATP7B has been constructed and shown to undergo secondary conformational changes upon binding to a single copper atom. Finally, a chimeric protein consisting of WCBD and truncated ZntA, a zinc transporter ATPase lacking the N-terminal domain, has been constructed and tested for metal ion selectivity. These results suggest that the core determines the metal ion specificity of P-type ATPases and that the N-terminal metal-binding domain may play a regulatory role.

474,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD), an inborn error of copper (Cu) metabolism, is now one of the leading liver diseases in Indian children. The clinical presentation can be extremely varied, including all forms of acute and chronic liver disease, minimal to severe neurological disease, psychiatric problems, bone deformities, hemolytic anemia, and endocrine manifestations. A high index of suspicion is necessary along with a judicious battery of investigations for diagnosis. Liver copper estimation is the most reliable test, but it is not readily available in India. Liver biopsy may not be possible due to bleeding problems and histological features are often not diagnostic of WD. In the absence of hepatic Cu, a low ceruloplasmin, high 24-hour urine copper, and the presence of KF rings help make the diagnosis. The mainstay of initial therapy is copper chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine to reduce body copper to subtoxic levels. Subsequent maintenance therapy is necessarily for life with D-Penicillamine, Trientine or Zinc. Children receiving therapy should be regularly monitored for response, side effects, compliance, and rehabilitation. Response to therapy can be unpredictable, but early and acute presentations, such as fulminant hepatic failure, have a poor outcome. All siblings should be screened for WD as early diagnosis and treatment results in a good outcome. The identification of the WD gene on chromosome 13 has led to the possible use of molecular genetics (haplotype and mutation analysis) in the diagnosis of WD.

Cu and is part of the Zn protection mechanism. Copper toxicity (100 microM) resulted in significant apoptotic neuronal death at 12 h. Addition of 100 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells increased neuronal death. However, addition of 700 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells resulted in neuronal viability that was not different from untreated controls over 24 h. The abundance of p53 mRNA, although increased by the addition of 100 microM Cu and Zn, was reduced to 50% of the control with the addition of 500 microM Zn in cells treated with Cu, and to 10% of the control with the addition of 700 microM Zn. . Consistent with its role as a transcription factor, both Western analysis and immunocytochemistry showed significant increases in p53 nuclear protein levels in Cu toxicity. The role of p53 in Cu-mediated apoptosis was further confirmed by suppression of apoptosis in Cu-treated cells that had been transfected with a dominant negative p53 construct to prevent p53 expression. Furthermore, the addition of 500-700 microM Zn prevented movement of p53 into the nucleus, suggesting that Zn not only protects neurons from Cu toxicity by regulating p53 mRNA abundance, but also by preventing p53 mRNA abundance. translocation of p53 to the nucleus.",,"VanLandingham, J.

The NH(2)-terminal domain (approximately 70 kDa), which contains six copies of the heavy metal-associated GMT/HCXXC repeat, can also bind zinc. We have used circular dichroism (CD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize the binding of zinc to the NH(2)-terminal metal-binding domain. These studies have revealed that zinc can bind to this domain with a 6:1 stoichiometry and, upon binding, induces conformational changes in the NH(2)-terminal domain. These conformational changes are completely different from those previously observed for copper binding to the domain and lead to an overall loss of secondary structure in the domain. XAS spectra indicate that zinc is primarily bound by nitrogen atoms and therefore has a low affinity for heavy metal-associated repeats where copper has been shown to bind.

All the patients were young women (17-23 years old), none of them had a history of liver disease. They were admitted with jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and symptoms of increasing hemolysis. The diagnosis of WD was given as an alteration of copper metabolism. After a short period of observation, ascites and anasarca, increased bleeding diathesis, and other symptoms of liver failure developed. Coagulation factor levels decreased rapidly. Despite treatment with D-penicillamine, plasmapheresis, and symptomatic drugs, three of the women died in irreversible hepatic coma, due to the unavailability of liver transplantation. The fourth woman was transferred to the Transplant Center due to worsening symptoms of liver failure, where the liver transplant was performed. Histopathologically, micronodular cirrhosis was demonstrated in all these cases. The fifth patient survived after undergoing the above treatment without liver transplantation. The main differences between the patient who survived and those who died or received a transplant were a relatively higher alkaline phosphatase activity (26 U/l vs. 10-20 U/l), slightly higher levels of coagulation factors, and prothrombin, which never fall below 68% of control (compared to 14-44% in other patients). Only in the surviving patient was the Kayser-Fleischer ring present.

489,Perturbed copper transport in humans. Part 2: ATP7B gene mutations lead to Wilson's disease (WD),"Mutations in the Wilson disease gene ATP7B, a P-type ATPase, are responsible for the accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs that leads to Wilson disease (WD, OMIM 277900). Clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease (WD) include chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, or neuropsychiatric disorders. Since there are powerful medical treatments to prevent disabling residual symptoms, early diagnosis is crucial. To demonstrate the clinical course and genetic findings, we report a male patient with a new mutation in the ATP7B gene, a 10 base pair insertion in exon 6 (1927ins 10) and a second missense mutation in exon 13 ( P992L). The patient presented signs of chronic liver disease at the age of 10 years. Clinical findings included hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. Combined treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine and zinc acetate was started with normalization of liver function and no neurological signs or Kayser-Fleischer ring after 7 years of follow-up. Truncated mutations of the ATP7B gene (insertions, deletions, nonsense mutations) that lead to a large loss of C-terminal parts of the protein, which probably completely destroys the function of the protein, can be correlated with a hepatic phenotype and a early onset as seen in the presented patient. .",,"Seidel, J.;Caca, K.;Schwab, S.

490,Wilson's disease in East India,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive (AR) inherited disorder of copper metabolism transmitted by a mutant gene on chromosome 13q14-21 and results in an abnormal accumulation of copper that leads to protein manifestations. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to study the clinical features, biochemical and radiological abnormalities of this disorder in East India and the effect of treatment. RESULTS: Forty-nine (n = 49) cases were studied over a 10-year period. Most of the patients were men with a mean age of onset of 11.13 years. They commonly presented with dysarthria, dystonia, or drooling. The clinical features were dystonia (96%), silly smile (92%), dysarthria (80%), cognitive impairment (71%), tremors (47%), bradykinesia (45%), etc. Family history suggested an autosomal recessive origin. Pattern. Sibling evaluation revealed that 4/8 (50%) were presymptomatic. All but one had the presence of a Keyser Fleischer (KF) ring in the cornea. Serum copper was reduced in 77%, while ceruloplasmin was reduced in 94% of cases. The most common abnormality seen on CT/MRI was in the basal ganglia (74%), followed by white matter changes (59%) and brainstem changes (20.5%). The response to treatment was not as good and there was an initial deterioration in 50% of the cases. Only five patients were able to return to their school. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease has protean manifestations. All children with slowly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome should be investigated for it. All asymptomatic siblings should be screened for Wilson's disease. Early institution of appropriate treatment and lifelong continuation are indicated in all. In the present series, an earlier age of onset of neurological signs and symptoms was observed; there was initial deterioration in 50% of the cases and the response to treatment was not so good.",,"Sinha, S.;Jha, D.

491,Quercetin Cumulatively Enhances Copper Induction of Metallothionein in Intestinal Cells,"Wilson's disease, a genetic condition of copper overload, is currently treated with zinc due to zinc's ability to induce metallothionein. We are interested in non-metallic chemicals that can alter the intestinal metabolism of copper and thus help alleviate copper toxicity. We have previously shown that quercetin, a dietary flavonoid, can chelate copper. This study further examined the interaction of quercetin and copper in intestinal epithelial cells. We found that quercetin enhanced metallotonein induction by copper and that the effect was dose dependent. Quercetin also exerted a cumulative effect after repeated exposure. Repeated low dose (3-10 microM) treatment of cells with quercetin can produce the same effect on metallothoinein as higher concentration (100 microM) treatment. This property of quercetin is distinct from its chemical interaction with copper, but both may contribute to a reduction in copper toxicity. Among other flavonoids tested, two other copper chelators, catechin and rutin, did not increase the induction of metallothionein by copper, while genistein, an isoflavone that does not chemically interact with copper, increased the induction of metallothionein by copper. The effect of quercetin on copper metabolism is unique. Quercetin decreased zinc-stimulated metallothionein expression and had no effect on cadmium-stimulated metallothionein induction. The clinical application of our observation needs to be explored.",,"Kuo, S. M.;Huang, C. T.;Blum, P.;Chang, C.",2001,Winter,https://dx.doi.org/10.1385/BTER:84:1-3:001,0,0,
492,"Brain storage of copper, iron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, sulfur, and phosphorus in Wilson's disease","PROJECT: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by juvenile liver cirrhosis and neurological symptoms. Brain copper levels in WD have been reported to be 10 to 15 times normal values, depending on different brain regions. As there are very few data available on the distribution of copper in the central nervous system in WD, it seemed of interest to study the concentration of copper and other trace elements (Zn, P, Mg, Ca, Fe and S) in the brain of a deceased patient. for WD PROCEDURE: A 56-year-old woman with WD was admitted to our hospital with signs of liver failure and died within a few days. At autopsy, a brain slice that extended from the left to the right hemisphere was divided into 28 samples. Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Zinc and Calcium were determined in each sample by Induced Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. RESULTS: The mean concentration of copper, ranging from 88 to 158 microg/g of dry tissue in all brain samples, was higher than the literature reference values, while that of the other elements tested was considerably lower. CONCLUSIONS: 1) In the brain of the WD patient examined, the status of trace elements was greatly altered. More studies are needed to correlate the concentration of trace elements with pathological lesions and clinical pictures. 2) The elements considered in our study showed an unequal distribution in different areas of the brain.",,"Faa, G.;Lisci, M.;Caria, M.

493,Iron accumulation in the liver of male patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: There is accumulating evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. The genetic disorder, aceruloplasminemia, can lead to tissue storage of iron as in hemochromatosis. Because most patients with Wilson's disease, a genetic copper toxicosis, have hypoceruloplasminemia, some may be affected by iron overload. METHODS: Four male patients with Wilson's disease were enrolled in this study of iron metabolism before and after treatment. RESULTS: Pre-treatment liver copper content was high in all four male patients studied as diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Genetic analysis supported his clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease with no history of hemochromatosis. Serum ceruloplasmin levels before treatment were <20 mg/dl in all four patients. Standard treatment with penicillamine for 3-8.5 years further reduced his serum ceruloplasmin levels. Post-treatment serum ferroxidase activity was low, as was serum ceruloplasmin protein. Liver copper content decreased after treatment in all subjects. In contrast, nonheme iron in the liver increased during treatment. Pretreatment liver samples were positive for histochemical iron in two patients, and posttreatment samples were positive in all four patients. In two patients, serum aminotransferase levels recovered with rising serum ferritin concentration during the treatment period. Subsequent iron reduction by phlebotomy improved his biochemical liver damage. CONCLUSION: Iron overload related to hypoceruloplasminemia may be clinically important, particularly in male patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Shiono, Y.;Wakusawa, S.;Hayashi, H.;Takikawa, T.;Yano, M.;Okada, T.;Mabuchi, H.;Kono, S.;Miyajima, H.",2001,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.05269.x,0,0,

We found that TTM inhibits purified Enterococcus hirae copper ATPase CopB with an IC(50) of 34 nM. Dithiomolybdate and trithiomolybdate, which commonly contaminate TTM, inhibited copper ATPases with similar potency. The inhibition could be reversed by copper or silver, suggesting substrate binding inhibition. These findings allowed for the first time to estimate the high affinity of CopB for copper and silver.

495,Personality traits in patients with treated Wilson's disease determined by the Karolinska Personality Scales (KSP),"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to elucidate the personality traits of treated Wilson's disease (WD) patients compared with healthy volunteers. METHOD: Twenty-five WD patients, ten women and 15 men, with a mean age of 35.2 +/- 8.3 years completed the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP), a self-report inventory comprising 15 separate scales. The results were compared with a control series consisting of 200 men and 200 women from the general population. RESULTS: Treated WD patients scored significantly lower than healthy controls on scales related to aggressiveness-hostility and the scale measuring Psychic Anxiety. Patients with predominantly hepatic symptoms had the lowest aggressiveness-related scores and patients with predominantly neurological symptoms had the lowest Irritability, Guilt, and Detachment scores and the highest Impulsivity and Muscle Tension scores. Both groups scored low on the Somatic Anxiety scale. CONCLUSION: The present results illustrate that treated TW patients have significant deviations in personality traits, especially in scales related to aggressiveness-hostility and Psychic Anxiety, compared to healthy controls when investigated by means of an inventory. self-report, the KSP. The deviations were not related to age, age of onset, or disease duration.",,"Portala, K.;Westermark, K.;Ekselius, L.;von Knorring, L.",2001,Sep,,0,0,
496,Zinc acetate for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Zinc acetate (Galzin, Gate Pharmaceutical Co.) has been developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease, an inherited disease of copper accumulation and copper toxicity in the brain and liver. Zinc acetate has been approved by the US FDA for maintenance therapy of adult and pediatric patients with Wilson's disease, but also has efficacy in the treatment of pregnant patients and early presymptomatic patients. It also has value as adjunctive therapy for the initial treatment of symptomatic patients. The mechanism of action of zinc consists of the induction of metallothionein (Mt) in intestinal cells, which blocks the absorption of copper in the intestinal tract. A negative copper balance is caused by blocking not only the absorption of copper from food, but also by blocking the reabsorption of the considerable amount of copper secreted endogenously in saliva, gastric juice, and intestinal secretions. Zinc is quite effective in controlling copper levels and toxicity in Wilson's disease, as are other anti-copper agents. The main advantage of zinc over other anti-copper agents is its extremely low level of toxicity. The only side effect is some degree of initial gastric irritation in about 10% of patients, which usually subsides and becomes insignificant over time. As with all long-term therapies, compliance is a problem in some patients and requires regular monitoring with 24-h urinary copper and zinc measurements. As with all anti-copper therapies, overtreatment and induction of copper deficiency can occur over a long period of time. This should be avoided especially in children because copper is necessary for growth. [References: 30]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2001,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/14656566.2.9.1473,0,0,

498,"Functional analysis of Wilson Cu(I)-ATPase (ATP7B) chimeric proteins and ZntA, a Pb(II)/Zn(II)/Cd(II)-ATPase from Escherichia coli","ATP7B, the Cu(I) transporter associated with Wilson's disease, and ZntA from Escherichia coli are soft metal P1-type ATPases with mutually exclusive metal ion substrates. P1-type ATPases have a distinctive amino-terminal domain that contains the conserved metal-binding motif GXXCXXC. ZntA has one copy of this motif while ATP7B has six copies. The effect of swapping the amino-terminal domains of ATP7B and ZntA was investigated. Chimeric proteins were constructed in which the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B or only its sixth metal-binding motif replaced the amino-terminal domain of ZntA. Both chimeras conferred resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts, but not to copper salts. The purified chimeras showed activity with lead, cadmium, zinc and mercury, which are ZntA substrates. There was no activity with copper or silver, which are substrates of ATP7B. The chimeras were 2-3 times less active than ZntA. Therefore, the amino-terminal domain of P1-type ATPases cannot alter the metal specificity determined by the transmembrane segment. Furthermore, these results suggest that this domain interacts with the rest of the transporter in a specific manner for metal ions; the amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot replace that of ZntA to restore full catalytic activity.",,"Hou, Z.

500,Ultrastructural identification of iron and copper accumulation in the liver of a male patient with Wilson's disease,"There is increasing evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. Reduced ferroxidase activity secondary to ceruloplasmin deficiency can induce iron accumulation in various organs as a result of impaired iron transport. A 37-year-old man presented with an intention tremor in his right hand. Liver function tests were nearly normal, but trace element parameters were abnormal: hypocupremia, hypoceruloplaminemia, and hyperferritinemia. Images of the abdomen showed a cirrhotic liver with increased density. The diagnosis of the neurological form of Wilson's disease was confirmed by liver copper deposits obtained by blind biopsy, and the patient was diagnosed as compound heterozygous for ATP7B mutations. He was treated with 2500 mg/day of trientine hydrochloride orally. The second examination was performed after 20 months of treatment. The treatment further reduced the serum ceruloplasmin level from 8.9 to less than 4.0 mg/dl. Serum ferroxidase activity was as low as 70 U/l during treatment. Post-treatment liver histology became negative for copper but remained positive for iron. Copper X-rays from hepatocyte lysosomes were no longer detected, but iron X-rays were still very high after treatment. Therefore, microanalysis confirmed the composite overload of copper and iron in this male patient with Wilson's disease.",,"Shiono, Y.;Hayashi, H.;Wakusawa, S.;Yano, M.",2001,Mar,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0079510340054,0,0,

There are two reasons for reporting such an unlikely case. First, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentations of potentially lethal recessive traits for which therapy is available. Second, it shows that even in a monogenic disorder such as WD, the phenotype cannot be easily extrapolated from the mutated genotype; this patient had a relatively late-onset form of WD despite homozygosity for a genetic lesion that led to an apparent complete loss of WD copper transporter function.",,"Prella, M.;Baccala, R.;Horisberger, J.

503,Copper control as antiangiogenic therapy against cancer: lessons from the treatment of Wilson's disease,"The search for new anti-copper drugs for Wilson's disease is culminating in two excellent new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for initial therapy. Both are effective and non-toxic. TM is a very potent and fast-acting new anti-copper drug and its properties may be useful well beyond Wilson's disease. Angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) is necessary for tumor growth, and a sufficient level of copper appears to be necessary for angiogenesis. We hypothesize that there is a ""window"" to which the level of copper can be reduced that inhibits angiogenesis in tumors, but does not interfere with vital cellular functions of copper. Using MT therapy, this approach has worked to slow or stabilize tumor growth in various animal tumor models, and preliminary results are also very encouraging in human patients with a variety of advanced and metastatic malignancies. It is hypothesized that copper availability has played a fundamental role in growth regulation throughout evolution and that is the reason why so many angiogenic promoters seem to depend on copper levels.

504,Is Parkinson's disease the heterozygous form of Wilson's disease: PD = 1/2 WD?,"Patients with Wilson's disease (WD) often have Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, most PD patients have reduced ceruloplasmin, a characteristic of Wilson's disease. WD is an autosomal recessive disease (requires two defective copies of a gene to produce a homozygous individual) that affects 1 in 1,000 people. However, the number of people with one faulty copy (heterozygotes) is much higher, probably around 2% of the population. I hypothesize that the large number of heterozygotes for WD are at much higher risk of idiopathic PD, because these people accumulate free copper in the basal ganglia at a slower rate than homozygotes, which explains the fact that PD usually develops after of 40 years of age. . In WD, a ceruloplasmin deficiency results in the accumulation of free Cu in the liver, brain, kidneys, etc. Excess Cu results in poor absorption of Zn, which would explain the low levels of Zn in the brain of PD patients. Furthermore, the high levels of Fe found in the substantia nigra of PD patients can perhaps be explained by the binding of free Cu to iron-binding protein 1 (IBP-1), causing it to malfunction and prevents it from detaching from the transferrin receptor. TfR), which results in the expression of TfR even when the cell has a lot of Fe. The gradual accumulation of Fe and Cu would explain the damage inflicted on the substantia nigra by free radicals catalyzed by these two metals and which is aggravated by the low levels of CuZnSOD, due to the Zn deficiency mentioned above. Furthermore, if this hypothesis is correct, then PD could be used to help discover the gene(s) responsible for WD and vice versa. Furthermore, idiopathic PD could be prevented by identifying heterozygous individuals and providing them with Zn supplementation, Cu chelation therapy, and phlebotomy to remove Fe.",,"Johnson, S.",2001,Feb,https://dx.doi.org/10.1054/mehy.2000.1134,0,0,

506,Essential role for the mammalian copper transporter Ctr1 in copper homeostasis and embryonic development,"The trace metal copper (Cu) plays an essential role in biology as a cofactor for many enzymes including Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase, cytochrome oxidase, ceruloplasmin, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Consequently, Cu transport at the cell surface and Cu delivery to intracellular compartments are critical events for a wide variety of biological processes. The components that orchestrate intracellular Cu trafficking and their roles in Cu homeostasis have been elucidated by studies of model microorganisms and by characterizations of the molecular basis of Cu-related genetic diseases, including Menkes disease and Cu. Wilson's disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms of Cu uptake in the plasma membrane and the consequences of defects in this process in mammals. Here, we show that the mouse Ctr1 gene encodes a component of the Cu transport machinery and that mice heterozygous for Ctr1 exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and copper-dependent enzyme activities. Completely deficient mice for Ctr1 exhibit profound growth and developmental defects and die in utero mid-gestation. These results demonstrate a crucial role for Cu acquisition via the Ctr1 transporter for mammalian Cu homeostasis and embryonic development.",,"Lee, J.;Prohaska, J. R.;Thiele, D.

507,"Accumulation and depletion of micronutrients in schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism and Parkinson's disease?","Zinc has several crucial roles in brain development and maintenance: it binds to p53, preventing it from binding to supercoiled DNA, and ensuring that p53 elicits the expression of several key genes, such as the one that encodes type I receptors for adenine cylase pituitary-activating peptide (PACAP), which directs the embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, adrenal glands, etc.; it is required for the production of CuZnSOD and Zn-thionein, which are essential to prevent oxidative damage; it is required by many proteins, some of them with Zn fingers, many of them essential enzymes for growth and homeostasis. For example, serotonin synthesis involves Zn enzymes, and since serotonin is required for melatonin synthesis, a Zn deficiency can result in low levels of both hormones. Unfortunately, Zn levels tend to be low when Cu and Cd are in excess. In addition, high estrogen levels tend to cause increased absorption of Cu and Cd, and smoking and eating food contaminated with Cd result in high levels. from the last batch. Furthermore, ethanol ingestion increases the removal of Zn and Mg (which acts as a cofactor for CuZnSOD). Elevated levels of Cu can also be found in people with Wilson's disease, which is a fairly rare disease. However, the heterozygous form (only one defective copy of the chromosome) is not that rare. Thus, the developing fetus of a low-Zn, high-Cu pregnant woman may experience great difficulties in early brain development, which may later manifest as schizophrenia, autism, or epilepsy. Similarly, a person who accumulates Cu gradually will tend to experience a gradual depletion of Zn, with a corresponding increase in oxidative damage, eventually leading to Parkinson's disease. The crucial role of histidine, histamine, vitamin D, essential fatty acids, vitamin E, peroxynitrate, etc. are also discussed. in the possible oxidative damage that these mental illnesses imply.

OBJECTIVE: To report the characteristics of Wilson's disease with severe liver failure in a series of 17 patients and, during the second period of the study, to evaluate the efficacy of a policy consisting of early administration of D-penicillamine. PATIENTS: Seventeen consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. During the first period of the study (until 1979), none of the patients received D-penicillamine. During the second period (after 1979), all patients without encephalopathy on admission received D-penicillamine. RESULTS: The four patients observed during the first period who did not have encephalopathy at admission and did not receive D-penicillamine progressed to encephalopathy and died. Among the 13 consecutive patients observed during the second period, two patients with encephalopathy at admission did not receive D-penicillamine and underwent transplantation. The remaining 11 patients received D-penicillamine. Ten of these patients survived without the need for transplantation and returned to compensated liver disease without liver failure. In one patient, liver failure progressed and a transplant was required. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with Wilson's disease preceded by severe liver failure and without encephalopathy on admission, early administration of D-penicillamine was associated with transplant-free survival. These results suggest the importance of early diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease before the appearance of encephalopathy, and favor the early administration of D-penicillamine, which could avoid the need for transplantation in most cases.",,"Durand, F.;Bernuau, J.;Giostra, E.;Mentha, G.;Shouval, D.;Degott, C.;Benhamou, J.

Pediatric patients 1 to 5 years of age received 25 mg of zinc twice daily; patients 6 to 15 years of age, if they weighed less than 125 pounds, were given 25 mg of zinc three times a day; and patients 16 years and older received 50 mg of zinc three times a day. Patients were followed for efficacy (or overtreatment) until they were 19 years old by measuring levels of copper in urine and plasma, zinc in urine and plasma, and by quantitative liver function tests and neurological and speech scores. The patients were followed up for toxicity through measurements of complete blood count, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and clinical follow-up. Thirty-four patients, aged between 3.2 and 17.7 years, were included in the study. All doses met efficacy targets for copper control, zinc levels, neurological improvement, and maintenance of liver function, except for episodes of poor compliance. No cases of overtreatment were found. Four patients exhibited mild and transient gastric discomfort from zinc. Zinc therapy in pediatric patients appears to have a mild adverse effect on the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio, contrary to the results of an earlier large study primarily in adults. In conclusion, zinc is effective and safe for the maintenance management of pediatric cases of Wilson's disease. Our data is stronger in children older than 10 years.

513,Wilson's disease,"Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from the absence or dysfunction of a copper transporting P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. This ATPase is expressed in hepatocytes where it is located in the trans-Golgi network. and transports copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion in the bile. Under physiological circumstances, biliary excretion represents the only mechanism for copper excretion, and affected individuals therefore have a progressive accumulation of copper in the liver. When hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, cell death occurs with release of copper into the plasma, hemolysis, and tissue deposition. Presentation in childhood may include chronic hepatitis, asymptomatic cirrhosis, or acute liver failure. In young adults, neuropsychiatric symptoms predominate and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive disturbances secondary to copper accumulation in the central nervous system. Laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper content, and increased hepatic copper concentration. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 100 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are compound heterozygotes. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective therapy in most patients, and liver transplantation is curative in individuals with irreversible liver failure. Elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of Wilson's disease has allowed new insights into the mechanisms of cellular copper homeostasis. [References: 106]",,"Loudianos, G.;Gitlin, J.

514,"The level of serum lipids, vitamin E and low-density lipoprotein oxidation in patients with Wilson's disease.","UNLABELED: The objective of this study was to estimate the level of lipids and the main serum antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), and to evaluate the susceptibility of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) to oxidation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Wilson. It was hypothesized that enhanced LDL peroxidation caused by high copper levels might contribute to liver and other tissue injury. The investigated group consisted of 45 individuals with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine or zinc salts and a control group of 36 healthy individuals. Lipids were determined by enzymatic methods, alpha-tocopherol by high-performance liquid chromatography, susceptibility of LDL to in vitro oxidation by absorption changes at 234 nm for 5 h, and final products of LDL lipid oxidation as substances that react with thiobarbituric acid. In patients with Wilson's disease, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly lower compared to the control group. No difference in in vitro LDL oxidation was indicated between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: An increased susceptibility of isolated LDL to lipid peroxidation in vitro was not observed in patients with Wilson's disease. It cannot be excluded, however, that due to the low level of alpha-tocopherol, lipid peroxidation in the tissues may play a role in the pathogenesis of tissue damage in this disease.",,"Rodo, M.;Czonkowska, A.;Pulawska, M.;Swiderska, M.;Tarnacka, B.;Wehr, H.",2000,Sep,,0,0,

517,Cellular copper transport and metabolism,"Cellular Cu transport and metabolism depends on a series of membrane proteins and smaller soluble peptides that compose a functionally integrated system to maintain cellular Cu homeostasis. Inward transport across the plasma membrane appears to be a function of integral membrane proteins that form channels that select Cu ions for passage. Two membrane-bound Cu-transporting ATPase enzymes, ATP7A and ATP7B, the gene products of Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively, catalyze an ATP-dependent transfer of Cu to intracellular compartments or expel Cu from the cell. ATP7A and ATP7B function in conjunction with a series of smaller peptides, the copper chaperones, which exchange Cu at ATPase sites or incorporate Cu directly into the framework of Cu-dependent enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase and superoxide Cu, Zn dismutase. These mechanisms come into play in response to a large influx of Cu or during the course of normal Cu metabolism. [References: 153]",,"Harris, E.

518,Reproductive capacity in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease (WD) take the form of hepatic, neurological, renal, and hormonal disorders. Infertility and amenorrhea in women and hypogonadism in men with WD have been reported. Our study was designed to analyze the reproductive abilities of WD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The course of pregnancy and childbirth was investigated by means of a questionnaire in 31 untreated women (mean age 22.5 years, 82 pregnancies) and 15 women (mean age 26.2 years, 25 pregnancies) treated with D- penicillamine (Dp) or zinc sulfate (ZnS). We also studied the reproductive capacity of 27 men (mean age 27.2 years). We analyzed the congenital anomalies and the frequency of WD in the children of our patients. RESULTS: One in 10 untreated women had difficulty conceiving. The number and type of pathology (imminent abortions, gestosis, stillbirth, preterm birth) were similar in treated and untreated patients. In both groups mentioned, the most frequent pathology was spontaneous abortions, which were found in 26% of the untreated women and in 26.6% of the treated women. This percentage is higher than that of the general population. Most deliveries in patients with WD were spontaneous. No developmental malformations or serious disorders were observed in the offspring of our treated patients, 3 children of untreated patients were born with congenital heart disease. In 78 of the 110 children of our patients, we examined copper metabolism and diagnosed WE in 5 cases (from 3 families). Among 27 men investigated, only 1 was impotent.

519,Wilson's disease: early onset and lessons from a pediatric cohort in India,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical presentation and follow-up of Wilson's disease cases that occur in this hospital. METHODS: Case records of children diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD) admitted to the hospital or attending the outpatient department of Pediatrics were retrospectively studied with respect to clinical features, investigations, and family assessment at the time. of the presentation. The treatment received by the patients was noted. The clinical profile at follow-up was recorded with respect to side effects of treatment and whether the patient improved, deteriorated or stayed the same, either from the records or by calling the patient for follow-up, if possible. RESULTS: Analysis of 25 children with Wilson's disease, comprising 19 index cases and 6 siblings detected in family screening, revealed that the mean age of onset of hepatic presentation was 6.8 years versus 8 years for the neurological patient. . A quarter of index cases have a highly suspicious family history of Wilson's disease that had previously been missed. The clinical presentation was hepatic in 5 patients, purely neurological in 5, mixed hepatic and neurological in 9, hemolytic anemia in 1, and polyarthritis in 1. The patients received treatment with penicillamine D, zinc, pyridoxine, and a low-copper diet. Follow-up of 18 patients revealed improvement in most, residual dysarthria in seven, prolonged persistence of KF rings in 15, and complications such as renal tubular acidosis with osteopenia in one. CONCLUSION: The early age of onset of symptoms, prolonged persistence of KF rings, and progression of symptoms among siblings despite therapy is of interest as it may be related to high copper intake, which may be due to to the practice of using brass or copper cooking utensils Since a large number of children have a history of jaundice or death of siblings due to jaundice or cirrhosis, a high index of suspicion and detection of KF rings is emphasized as a simple and cost-effective way of detecting a curable disease at an early stage. Staged and familial screening of all index cases is imperative. Symptom progression among siblings taking oral zinc and low-dose penylamine suggests that zinc alone is not adequate for prophylaxis.",,"Kalra, V.;Khurana, D.;Mittal, R.",2000,Jun,,0,1,
520,Alterations of the visual pathway Wilson's disease: an electrophysiological study using electroretinography and visual evoked potentials,"The pathogenesis of pattern reversal visual evoked potential (PRVEP) abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) has not been previously investigated. Since electroretinography (ERG) assesses the functional integrity of the retina, it was used in conjunction with PRVEP to localize PRVEP abnormalities in Wilson's patients. Ten newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease underwent PRVEP and flash ERG shortly after the diagnosis was established. PRVEP latencies were prolonged compared to controls (P<0.001). Photopic and scotopic A waves and oscillatory potentials were prolonged (P<0.02) with a reduction in photopic A and B wave amplitudes (P<0.001). Six of these patients underwent repeat PRVEP and flash ERG after clinical improvement with specific therapy. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment visual electrophysiological studies revealed a significant reduction in PRVEP and ERG flash A wave latencies (P < 0.05) with an increase in PRVEP P100 amplitudes (P < 0.05), A waves. and B from flash ERG (p<0.01). These findings confirm the PRVEP changes reported in WD and further demonstrate the reversibility of retinal dysfunction that partially contributes to PRVEP abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ERG in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. Furthermore, there have been no previous reports in the literature evaluating the effect of specific treatment on PRVEP and GERD in Wilson's disease.",,"Satishchandra, P.;Ravishankar Naik, K.",2000,2001-05-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
521,Carboxypeptidase A inhibition by D-penicillamine: mechanism and implications for drug design,"Zinc metalloprotease inhibitors are generally designed to inactivate the enzyme by forming a stable ternary complex with the enzyme and the active site zinc. D-cysteine inhibits the carboxypeptidase, ZnCPD, forming such a complex, with a K(i) of 2.3 microM. In contrast, the antiarthritic drug D-penicillamine, D-PEN, which differs from D-Cys only by the presence of two methyl groups on the beta carbon, inhibits ZnCPD by promoting release from the zinc active site. We have given the name catalytic chelator to such inhibitors. Inhibition is a two-step process characterized by complex formation with the enzyme (K(i(initial)) = 1.2 mM) followed by release of zinc from the active site at rates up to 420 times faster than spontaneous release. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis upon completion of the second step is also dependent on the concentration of D-PEN, reflecting the formation of a thermodynamic equilibrium governed by the stability constants of the chelator and apocarboxypeptidase for zinc (K(i(final )) = 0.25 mM). The interaction of D-PEN and D-Cys with the active site metal has been examined by replacing the active site zinc with a chromophore cobalt atom. Both inhibitors perturb CoCPD dd transitions in the 500â600 nm region within milliseconds after mixing, but only the CoCPD.D-Cys complex shows a strong S --> Co(II) charge transfer band at 340 nm indicative of a metal -sulfur bond. While the D-Cys complex is stable, the CoCPD.D-PEN complex decomposes into apoenzyme and Co(D-PEN)(2) with a half-life of 0.5 s. D-PEN is the first drug to inhibit a metalloprotease by increasing the rate constant of metal dissociation from the active site. The ability of D-PEN to catalyze metal removal by carboxypeptidase A and other zinc proteases suggests a possible mechanism of action in arthritis and Wilson's disease and may also underlie the complications associated with its clinical use.",,"Chong, C.

522,Wilson's disease with overlapping autoimmune features: report of two cases and review,"We describe two women, aged 15 and 23 years, respectively, who presented with classic features of Wilson's disease (WD) and various features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The first patient was initially diagnosed with AIH and treated with prednisolone, which produced clinical improvement, with an increase in serum albumin from 22 to 30 g/l and a decrease in aspartate aminotransferase from 103 to 47 U/l. Subsequent diagnosis of WD and introduction of penicillamine gave excellent improvement and complete normalization of liver function tests. The second patient, initially also diagnosed with HAI, was treated with steroids and azathioprine with initial improvement, but subsequent deterioration. The diagnosis of WD was made 2 years after the initial AIH diagnosis, as the patient developed end-stage liver disease and required a transplant. Therefore, treatment with d-penicillamine was not attempted. We conclude that, in patients with HAI, a comprehensive screening for WE is necessary, especially when the response to steroid therapy is poor. Conversely, in patients suffering from WD with overlapping features of AIH, a combination of steroids and penicillamine may be beneficial. [References: 17]",,"Milkiewicz, P.;Saksena, S.;Hubscher, S.

523,Copper transport and its defect in Wilson's disease: characterization of the copper-binding domain of Wilson's disease ATPase,"Copper is an essential trace element that forms an integral component of many enzymes. While trace amounts of copper are needed to support life, excess copper is extremely toxic. An attempt is made here to present the current understanding of normal copper transport in relation to absorption, intracellular transport, and toxicity. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport that results in copper accumulation in organs such as the liver and brain, leading to progressive liver and neurological damage. The gene responsible for Wilson's disease (ATP7B) is predicted to encode a putative copper transporting P-type ATPase. An important feature of this ATPase is the presence of a large N-terminal domain containing six repeats of a copper-binding motif that is thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the membrane. We have cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kD) of the Wilson's disease ATPase. The metal-binding properties of the domain showed that the protein bound several metals in addition to copper; however, copper has a higher affinity for the domain. Copper binds to the domain as Cu(I) with a copper:protein ratio of 6.5:1. X-ray absorption studies strongly suggest that Cu(I) atoms are bound to cysteine residues. Circular dichroism spectral analyzes suggest both secondary and tertiary structural changes upon binding of copper to the domain. Copper binding studies suggest some degree of cooperativity in copper binding. These studies, as well as detailed structural information on the copper-binding domain, will be crucial in determining the specific role that the copper transporter ATPase plays in the homeostatic control of copper in the body and how copper transport is disrupted by mutations. in the ATPase gene.",,"Sarkar, B.",2000,Apr,,0,0,
524,"CSF copper concentrations, blood-brain barrier function, and coeruloplasmin synthesis during treatment for Wilson's disease.","During treatment of four patients with cerebral manifestation of Wilson's disease, we measured serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) copper concentration, serum coeruloplasmin concentration, serum free copper concentration, and CSF/serum albumin ratio. (AR). These measurements were treated as indicators of copper-related toxic effects on the brain and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The half-life of CSF copper concentration decline during therapy was 23.5 +/- 5.78 months (mean +/- SEM). The therapeutic target copper concentration in the CSF (mean normal concentration) is less than 20 microg/l. The average duration of therapy needed to normalize CSF copper values in our patients with a mean initial value of 76.25 microg/L was 47 months. During the first 10 months of treatment there was an increase in all cases of measured blood-brain barrier impairment (measured as the ratio of CSF albumin to serum albumin, AR). All patients showed an initial worsening of the neurological condition, on average after 1.75 +/- 0.25 months. The maximum increase in AR, from baseline, was on average 18.4 +/- 5.08%; this maximum was reached after an average of 6.9 +/- 1.5 months. The AR normalized during therapy, indicating reduced toxicity in the blood-brain barrier region. The extent of increases in AR in individual patients was not significantly correlated with the half-life of CSF copper, the half-life of serum copper, the initial half-life of the reduction in the ratio (serum copper)/(serum coeruloplasmin ), the initial concentration of copper in CSF or serum, the initial concentration of free copper in serum or the initial dose of penicillamine (within the first 2 months). We conclude that normalization of CSF copper concentration in patients with the cerebral manifestation of Wilson's disease is a slow process, even if therapy is sufficient. The initial worsening of the neurological condition that has often been reported may be reflected in impaired blood-brain barrier function, which we have measured here for the first time (using the CSF/serum albumin ratio parameter). Based on repeated measurements of RA over the course of treatment, it appears that cerebral toxicity of mobilized copper can be assessed and therapy adjusted.",,"Stuerenburg, H.

DESIGN: Retrospective study with a median follow-up of 9 years. SETTING: University medical center. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four children with liver involvement, aged between three and fifteen years, were diagnosed with Wilson's disease over an eighteen-year period. METHODS: Diagnosis was based on the presence of a family history and Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, and increased urinary and hepatic copper concentrations. RESULTS: Four patients also had neurological manifestations. Eight patients were diagnosed with fulminant liver failure resulting in death within a few days. The most common symptoms were abdominal distension and abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly was the predominant physical finding, and serum transaminases were elevated in most patients. Twenty patients had cirrhosis and six had chronic hepatitis histopathologically.

Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) was developed as an effective anti-copper therapy for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to abnormal accumulation of copper. Given the potency and uniqueness of TM's anti-copper action and its lack of toxicity, we hypothesized that TM would be a suitable agent to achieve and maintain mild copper deficiency to alter neovascularization in metastatic solid tumors. Following preclinical work that showed the efficacy of this anti-copper approach in mouse tumor models, we conducted a Phase I clinical trial in 18 patients with metastatic cancer who were enrolled in three dose levels of oral TM (90, 105 and 120 mg/day) administered in six divided doses with and between meals. Serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) was used as a surrogate marker for total body copper. Because anemia is the first clinical sign of copper deficiency, the goal of the study was to reduce Cp to 20% of baseline without reducing hematocrit below 80% of baseline. Cp is a reliable and sensitive measure of copper status, and TM was not toxic when Cp was reduced to 15-20% of baseline. The level III dose of TM (120 mg/day) was effective in reaching the target Cp without added toxicity.

The most serious sequel is progressive involvement of the central nervous system. The use of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been controversial for those patients with neurological symptoms attributed to Wilson's disease. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of OLT in patients with Wilson's disease, including those with neurological involvement attributed to copper accumulation in the central nervous system. OLT was performed in 45 patients (19 men [42.2%], 26 women [57.8%]) with Wilson's disease between 1971 and 1993 who were followed up for at least 4 years. Age at diagnosis of Wilson's disease ranged from 3 to 41 years (mean, 17.7 +/- 7.4 years). Age at OLT ranged from 8 to 52 years (mean, 22.3 +/- 9.4 years). Nineteen patients (42.2%) were under 18 years of age at the OLT. Indications for OLT included chronic liver failure in 15 patients (33.3%) and fulminant or subfulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in 30 patients (66.6%). All but 1 of the 19 pediatric patients (94.7%) were in the latter group. Twenty-five patients (55.5%) were receiving D-penicillamine, 9 patients for more than 1 year; none of the long-term treated patients developed FHF. Thirty-three patients (73.3%) survived more than 5 years after OLT. Fourteen patients (31%) died during the post-transplant period; 7 of the 14 patients (50%) were under 18 years of age. Twelve patients died during the first 3 months after OLT due to complications of the disease and surgery, 10 of whom underwent transplantation for FHF. The other 2 patients died 6 and 9 years after the transplant due to infectious problems. Eleven patients (24.4%) required retransplantation due to nonfunctioning primary graft (n = 6), chronic rejection (n = 4), and hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 1). Seventeen patients (37.7%) presented neurological abnormalities; 14 patients with Wilsonian neurological manifestations and 3 patients with components of increased intracranial pressure. Ten of 13 surviving patients with liver failure and neurological abnormalities on OLT showed significant neurological improvement. Our experience shows that OLT is a life-saving procedure in patients with end-stage Wilson's disease and is associated with excellent long-term survival. The neurological manifestation of the disease can improve significantly after OLT. Earlier transplantation in patients with an unsatisfactory response to medical treatment can prevent irreversible neurological deterioration and less satisfactory improvement after OLT.",,"Eghtesad, B.;Nezakatgoo, N.;Geraci, L.

539,"Expression and mutagenesis of ZntA, a zinc transporter P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli","The cation transporting P-type ATPases comprise an important family of membrane proteins, members of which are found in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaea. A phylogenetically ancient branch of the P-type ATPase family is involved in the transport of heavy metal ions such as copper, silver, cadmium, and zinc. In humans, two homologous P-type ATPases transport copper. Mutations in human proteins cause disorders of copper metabolism known as Wilson's and Menkes' diseases. E. coli possesses two genes for heavy metal translocating P-type ATPases. We have built an expression system for one of them, ZntA, which encodes a protein of 732 amino acid residues capable of transporting Zn(2+). A vanadate-sensitive Zn(2+)-dependent ATPase activity is present in the membrane fraction of our expression strain. In addition to Zn(2+), heavy metal ions Cd(2+), Pb(2+), and Ag(+) activate ATPase. Incubation of expression strain membranes with [gamma-(33)P]ATP in the presence of Zn(2+), Cd(2+), or Pb(2+) causes phosphorylation of two membrane proteins with molecular masses of approximately 90 and 190 kDa, they most likely represent the ZntA monomer and dimer, respectively. Although Cu(2+) can stimulate phosphorylation by [gamma-(33)P]ATP, it does not activate ATPase. Cu(2+) also prevents Zn(2+) activation of the ATPase when it is present in a 2-fold excess over Zn(2+). Ag(+) and Cu(+) do not seem to promote the phosphorylation of the enzyme. To study the effects of Wilson's disease mutations, we have constructed two ZntA site-directed mutants, His475Gln and Glu470Ala, whose human counterparts cause Wilson's disease. Both mutants show reduced metal ion-stimulated ATPase activity (about 30-40% of wild-type activity) and are much less efficiently phosphorylated by [gamma-(33)P]ATP than wild-type. Compared to wild type, the Glu470Ala mutant is more strongly phosphorylated by [(33)P]P(i), while the His475Gln mutant is more weakly phosphorylated. These results suggest that the His475Gln mutation affects the reaction with ATP and P(i) and stabilizes the enzyme in a dephosphorylated state. The Glu470Ala mutant appears to favor the E2 state. We conclude that His475 and Glu470 play an important role in the transport cycles of both Wilson's disease ATPase and ZntA.",,"Okkeri, J.;Haltia, T.",1999,2019-10-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
540,"Characterization of the interaction between Wilson and Menkes disease proteins and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone, HAH1p","Wilson's disease (WD) and Menkes disease (MNK) are inherited disorders of copper metabolism. The genes that mutate to give rise to these disorders encode highly homologous copper transporting ATPases. We used yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, along with an in vitro assay to demonstrate a specific copper-dependent interaction between the six metal-binding domains of the WD and MNK ATPases and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1. We show that several metal-binding domains interact independently or in combination with HAH1p, although domains five and six of WDp do not. Alteration of the Met or Thr residue of the HAH1p MTCXXC motif has no observable effect on the copper-dependent interaction, while alteration of either Cys residue eliminates the interaction. Mutation of any of the C-terminal Lys residues of HAH1p (Lys(56), Lys(57), or Lys(60)) to Gly does not affect the interaction, although removal of all 15 C-terminal residues eliminates the interaction. . We show that apo-HAH1p can bind copper-charged WDp in vitro, suggesting the reversibility of copper transfer from HAH1p to WD/MNKp. The HAH1/WDp interaction in vitro is metal-specific; HAH1 preincubated with Cu(2+) or Hg(+) but not with Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(3+), Fe(3+) or Cr(3 + ) interacted with WDp. Finally, we model the protein-protein interaction and present a theoretical representation of the HAH1p.Cu.WD/MNKp complex.",,"Larin, D.;Mekios, C.;Das, K.;Ross, B.;Yang, A. S.;Gilliam, T.

542,Comparative mechanism and toxicity of tetra- and dithiomolybdates in copper removal,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) can be used as a specific chelator to remove copper (Cu) that accumulates in bound form with metallothionein (MT) in the livers of patients with Wilson's disease and Long-Evans rats with tan fur ( LEC rats). However, an adverse effect, hepatotoxicity, was occasionally observed in its clinical application. The mechanism underlying the adverse effect of TTM has been studied in comparison with dithiomolybdate (DTM), and safer and more effective therapy with TTM was proposed based on the mechanism. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity was shown to be significantly increased by treatment of Wistar rats with sulfide produced through hydrolytic degradation of TTM and DTM, the latter being easier to degrade. The hydrolytic degradation of TTM was enhanced under acidic conditions. Cu in Cu-containing enzymes, such as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in plasma, decreased due to excess thiomolybdates, Cu is found in plasma as a Cu complex /thiomolybdate/albumin. . The decreased amounts of Cu in SOD and Cp were explained by sequestration of Cu from its chaperones by thiomolybdates rather than direct removal of Cu by enzymes. Although both TTM and DTM remove Cu from MT, DTM is not appropriate as a therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease due to its easy hydrolysis and sulfide production.",,"Ogra, Y.;Komada, Y.;Suzuki, K.

543,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. The Wilson disease gene is located on human chromosome 13 and encodes a copper transporting P-type ATPase, -ATP7B. About a hundred mutations occurring throughout the gene have been documented so far. The most common is the His1069Gln point mutation. Wilson's disease can present under a variety of clinical conditions, the most common being liver disease (ranging from acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis), hemolytic anemia, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is usually made on the basis of clinical findings (Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurologic symptoms) and laboratory abnormalities (low serum ceruloplasmin, increased liver copper content). Molecular genetic testing is now the standard for evaluating asymptomatic siblings. Diagnosis in patients with liver disease is difficult and requires a combination of several laboratory parameters. Lifelong treatment with chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) or zinc is usually sufficient to stabilize the patient and achieve clinical remission in most. Patients with advanced liver disease benefit from orthotopic liver transplantation. [References: 55]",,"Ferenci, P.",1999,Jun-Jul,,0,0,
544,Treatment and management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder related to copper metabolism. Clinical symptoms are due to deposition of copper in various tissues, including the liver, brain, kidneys, cornea, and others. The key treatment strategy is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering copper chelating agents and a low-copper diet. D-penicillamine is considered the first choice as a copper chelating agent. Patients require 15-25 mg/kg daily in the early stages of treatment, and this drug should also be given more than 2 hours before meals. Some undesirable or serious side effects, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and nephrotic syndrome, occur in 20-25% of all patients. In such cases, triethylenetetramine (trientine) appears to be as effective as penicillamine. This drug is usually used when D-penicillamine needs to be withdrawn. It is also sometimes given to patients with neurological symptoms as a drug of first choice. It is administered in doses of 40-50 mg/kg per day, in the same way as D-penicillamine. The administration of zinc salt has also emerged as an interesting support therapy for both treatments. A dose of 5-7.5 mg/kg daily is given before meals. The copper content of the diet should be less than 1 mg/day in the early stages of treatment. Subsequently, it can be increased to 1.0-1.5 mg/day for well-controlled periods. Liver transplantation is now performed in many countries for patients with the fulminant or chronic progressive types of Wilson's disease.

545,1H NMR studies of the reactions of copper (I) and copper (II) with D-penicillamine and glutathione,"The reactions of copper ions with D-penicillamine (PSH) have been monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy in the presence and absence of glutathione (GSH) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In D2O solution at pD = 7.4, PSH coordinates with Cu+ to form PS(-)-Cu+ under argon, as revealed by magnification of each signal. In the presence of dioxygen, the complex converted to the well-characterized purple cluster species consisting of Cu+, Cu2+, and PS2-. Addition of GSH to this solution rapidly decomposed the cluster by reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. However, the cluster species reproduced after several hours due to oxidation of Cu+ back to Cu2+. The solution containing both PSH and GSH formed three possible disulfides, PSSP, GSSG, and PSSG, under aerobic conditions. Addition of Cu+ to this solution produced the purple group again through various redox reactions. Based on these results, it was concluded that the coexistence of PSH and/or PSSP with Cu+ and/or Cu2+ leads to the formation of stable cluster species regardless of the presence or absence of other thiols such as GSH. This must be one of the reasons that PSH works in living cells as an effective drug for Wilson's disease.",,"Kato, N.;Nakamura, M.;Uchiyama, T.",1999,2015-06-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

549,Treatment of copper-associated liver disease in childhood,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Copper-associated liver disease is associated with elevated liver copper concentrations and progressive liver disease in infancy or childhood. The disease is believed to be due to excessive dietary copper overload (supply of copper-enriched water) and is also based on a genetic predisposition. Penicillamine treatment in Indian childhood illness, which probably has the same etiology, is effective when started early enough, as in Wilson's disease. Our aim was to describe the clinical features of copper-associated liver disease and to report our experience with different treatment options in German children. METHODS/RESULTS: Two children aged 6 and 10 months presented with abdominal distention due to hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis of copper-associated liver disease was made based on feeding history, standard parameters of liver function, liver biopsy, and assessment of dry weight copper concentration and urinary copper excretion. Both presented micronodular cirrhosis, ballooning of hepatocytes and Mallory bodies. In children An improvement in liver function was observed after the introduction of penicillamine therapy and a low-copper diet. Treatment was stopped after 18 months, when liver copper concentration normalized. Acute liver failure developed in child B despite initiation of treatment. The child was successfully transplanted. Both children are currently healthy 10 years after transplantation and 4 years after the start of chelation therapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that early chelation therapy with penicillamine may be successful in children with copper-associated liver disease. In case of late diagnosis and acute liver failure, a liver transplant is necessary. Our case reports highlight the urgent need for rapid diagnosis of copper-associated liver disease to initiate early chelation therapy. Copper-associated liver disease should obviously be considered in liver disease of unknown origin. Possible causes of excessive dietary copper intake should be determined.",,"Rodeck, B.;Kardoff, R.;Melter, M.",1999,2028-06-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
550,Molybdenum,"Molybdenum does not exist naturally in pure metallic form and of the 5 oxidation states (2-6) the predominant species are Mo(IV) and Mo(VI). Molybdenum rapidly polymerizes into a wide variety of complex polymolybdate compounds in solution. The vast majority of molybdenum is used in metallurgical applications (stainless steel, cast iron alloys). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is an experimental chelating agent for Wilson's disease. For the general population, the diet is the most important source of molybdenum and concentrations in water and air are usually negligible. The average daily dietary intake is approximately 0.1-0.5 mg per month. Molybdenum is an essential element with relatively low toxicity. Molybdenum-containing enzymes catalyze basic metabolic reactions in the carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles. Molybdenum elimination occurs through the kidneys and is usually complete within several weeks. Molybdenosis (tear) is a form of molybdenum toxicity that produces a disease in ruminants similar to copper deficiency. Few data are available on the human toxicity of molybdenum. A gout-like syndrome and pneumoconiosis have been associated with excessive molybdenum concentrations, but inadequate study design precludes adequate determination of the etiology of these effects.

551,Copper,"Copper is an essential trace element, which is an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. After zinc and iron, copper is the third most abundant trace mineral in the body. Copper is a noble metal, like silver and gold. Useful industrial properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloyability, and malleability. Most metallic copper appears in electrical applications. Copper is a component of intrauterine contraceptive devices and the release of copper is necessary for its contraceptive effects. The average daily intake of copper in the US is approximately 1 mg Cu and the main source is the diet. The bioavailability of dietary copper is around 65-70% depending on a variety of factors including chemical form, interaction with other metals, and dietary components. The biological half-life of dietary copper is 13 to 33 days, with biliary excretion being the main route of elimination. Copper sulfate is a gastric irritant that causes erosion of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic copper toxicity is rare and primarily affects the liver. Wilson's disease and Indian childhood cirrhosis are examples of severe chronic liver disease resulting from genetic predisposition to hepatic accumulation of copper. Serum copper concentration varies up to about 1.5 mg/l in healthy people. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur at whole blood concentrations close to 3 mg Cu/L. Chelating agents (CaNa2EDTA, BAL) are recommended in severe poisoning, but there are few pharmacokinetic data to assess the efficacy of these agents. [References: 118]",,"Barceloux, D.

552,"Metal ion transporters in mammals: structure, function and pathological implications","Despite the importance of metal ions in various catalytic functions, until recently little molecular information was available on the mechanisms by which mammalian cells actively take up metal ions. The classical concept for iron uptake in mammalian cells has been the endocytosis of Fe3+ bound to transferrin by the transferrin receptor. Studies in hypotransferrinaemic mice revealed that intestinal mucosal transferrin is derived from plasma and that its presence in the intestinal lumen is not required for absorption of dietary iron. This suggests that, at least in the gut, other non-receptor-mediated uptake systems exist. Molecular identification of metal ion transporters is of great importance, particularly as an increasing number of human diseases are thought to be related to disturbances in metal ion homeostasis, including metal ion overload and deficiency disorders. (ie anemia, hemochromatosis, Menkes disease, Wilson disease). disease), and neurodegenerative diseases (ie, Alzheimer's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and Parkinson's diseases). Furthermore, susceptibilities to mycobacterial infections are caused by defects in the metal ion transporter. The pathological implications of altered metal ion homeostasis support the vital roles played by these metal ions in the catalytic function of many enzymes, in gene regulation (zinc finger proteins), and in free radical homeostasis. Recent insights have significantly improved our understanding of how mammalian cells take up or release metal ions. The purpose of this review is to summarize these advances and provide an overview of the growing number of metal ion transporters in mammals. [References: 109]",,"Rolfs, A.;Hediger, M.

555,Zinc therapy increases duodenal concentrations of metallothionein and iron in patients with Wilson's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease is effectively treated by administration of zinc which, in vitro, increases metallothionein concentrations. To determine whether the latter also occurs in humans, we measured metallothionein and trace element concentrations in the duodenal mucosa of 15 patients with Wilson's disease: 12 treated with zinc sulfate, two treated with penicillamine, and one not yet on treatment. The control group consisted of 17 patients with dyspepsia, who underwent the same study protocol. METHODS: Metallothionein and trace element concentrations were measured in duodenal mucosal biopsies using the silver saturation hemolysate method and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. RESULTS: Metallothionein concentrations increased 1500% after zinc and 150% after penicillamine in Wilson's disease patients, relative to endoscopy-negative controls and untreated Wilson's disease patients. A significant correlation was found between duodenal metallothionein and zinc concentrations. Mucosal iron concentration increased in patients with Wilson's disease if they were treated with zinc or penicillamine. The duodenum with duodenitis also had significantly elevated iron levels compared to the normal duodenum. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc administration increases intestinal metallothionein in patients with Wilson's disease. The blockage of copper absorption and its excretion in the faeces on intestinal cell desquamation probably explains one of the mechanisms underlying the effect of zinc treatment. Despite normal endoscopy, patients with Wilson's disease have increased mucosal iron concentrations similar to those of controls with duodenitis. Therefore, metallothionein can prevent oxidative damage caused by metal toxicity.",,"Sturniolo, G.

METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory and histological characteristics and prognosis of Wilson's disease in 26 Spanish children. RESULTS: The first medical visit, at the age of 9.8+/-3.4 years (range, 4-16 years), was prompted by accidentally detected liver dysfunction (61%), symptoms of liver disease (27%) , family screening (8%), and extrapyramidal symptoms and personality changes (4%). There were laboratory data of liver failure in 27%. All copper metabolism test results (total serum copper, 24-hour urine output, serum ceruloplasmin) were abnormal in 62%, two in 27%, and one in 11%. All patients in whom extrahepatic involvement was found at diagnosis had severe liver disease. Histological findings were portal fibrosis with steatosis (29%), cirrhosis (21%), portal fibrosis (17%), chronic active hepatitis (17%), and minimal change or normality (17%).

Three other patients recovered from liver failure after 1 year of penicillamine treatment. After a follow-up of 4.5+/-3.3 years, all children survived. Penicillamine caused severe toxicity in one patient.

None of the sera tested showed reactivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase or ICA512. Five of twelve patients tested positive for anti-single-stranded DNA autoantibodies. Molecular HLA typing of autoantibody-positive subjects showed that they carry HLA haplotypes not associated with insulin-dependent diabetes. The insulin response to intravenous glucose tolerance test in two patients with autoantibodies was found to be normal.

563,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XV long-term follow-up studies,"Wilson's disease is an inherited copper accumulation disease caused by failure of biliary excretion of excess copper. Accumulated copper causes liver disease in these patients, and in perhaps two-thirds of patients, it causes brain damage leading to clinical neurological or psychiatric dysfunction. Maintenance treatment consists of reversing the positive copper balance. Early approaches have used chelators, such as penicillamine or trientine, which increase urinary copper excretion. A more recent approach has used zinc, which blocks copper absorption and increases copper excretion in the stool. Due to the high level of endogenously secreted copper in dietary secretions, the reabsorption of which is partially blocked by zinc therapy, zinc acts to remove accumulated copper from the body and prevent its reaccumulation. In this article we present data on the long-term follow-up (up to 10 years) of zinc maintenance treatment of 141 patients with Wilson's disease. The data presented document that zinc is effective as a single therapy in the long-term maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease and that it has low toxicity. The results demonstrate the efficacy of zinc therapy in the treatment of the presymptomatic patient from the start of therapy. We also present limited data on the use of zinc in the treatment of pregnant patients and children with Wilson's disease; these data also indicate efficacy and low toxicity.

570,Wilson's disease and canine copper toxicosis,"In this article, we review the current clinical and research status of Wilson's disease and canine copper toxicosis. One of the main clinical challenges in Wilson's disease is for clinicians to recognize the possibility of Wilson's disease when young patients present with liver disease, psychiatric disease, or a movement disorder type of neurological disease. Once the possibility of the disease is recognized, many copper-related tests are available that are quite accurate to make the diagnosis or rule it out. It is important to remember that this is an inherited disease and family members at risk should be screened, especially siblings. The cloning of the gene for Wilson's disease opened the possibility that a direct DNA test could be developed, allowing convenient screening of certain patients and relatives. However, the large number of mutations already found, with a no small set of mutations dominating the picture, have frustrated this approach. Once the diagnosis has been made, a variety of treatments are available. For maintenance therapy, therapy of presymptomatic patients, and therapy of pregnant patients, we use zinc. For the initial therapy of patients with liver disease, we use a combination of zinc and trientine. For the initial therapy of patients with neurological disease we use tetrathiomolybdate. Canine copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers is due to a different gene than the gene for Wilson's disease. However, the disease can be treated with the same variety of anti-copper therapies that work in humans. We recently established the linkage of the copper toxicosis gene to a microsatellite marker, making a linkage test available to breeders of Bedlington terriers. [References: 36]",,"Brewer, G.

573,Acute dystonia with thalamic and brainstem lesions after initial penicillamine treatment in Wilson's disease,"Dystonia is a common manifestation of Wilson's disease (WD). The striatum, especially the putamen, has been considered to be responsible for dystonia. We report 3 patients who developed acute generalized dystonia and rigid akinetic syndrome after initial therapy with d-penicillamine 125-500 mg daily. Brain MRI revealed lesions in the thalamus and brainstem, particularly the tegmentum and pontine base, in addition to basal ganglia lesions. After the episode, 1 patient continued to receive d-penicillamine therapy and 2 switched to zinc sulfate treatment. Generalized dystonia improved in the following 3 months and 3 years, respectively, in 2 patients. Follow-up brain MRI of these 2 patients revealed that the lesions in the thalamus and brainstem disappeared or almost completely resolved. From these data, acute generalized dystonia with thalamic and brainstem lesions may occur in patients with WD after initial d-penicillamine therapy. In addition, dystonia may resolve after resolution of brainstem and thalamic lesions.",,"Huang, C. C.;Chu, N. S.",1998,,,0,0,

576,Syndromic variability of Wilson's disease in children. Clinical study of 44 cases,"BACKGROUND: In children with Wilson's disease, there are no specific clinical or laboratory data for the diagnosis as in adulthood. OBJECTIVE: Clinical aspects and parameters of copper metabolism are evaluated in a large series of pediatric cases to establish certain criteria for diagnosis and correct treatment, even in difficult cases. METHODS: Clinical aspects, histological characteristics, laboratory parameters, and copper metabolism data have been studied in 44 children with Wilson's disease. Forty patients, treated with penicillamine, were followed up (median 77 months). RESULTS: The 44 cases were classified as: asymptomatic forms (nine cases, six of them siblings of affected subjects), chronic hepatitis (23 cases), hepatocerebral manifestations (four cases), decompensated cirrhosis (six cases), fulminant hepatic failure with hemolytic . anemia (two cases). Ceruloplasmin levels were abnormal in 37 of the 43 cases analyzed but normal in six (14%) who showed high urine copper excretion at baseline and after penicillamine loading and increased hepatic copper content. The concentration of copper in urine was pathological in 35 of the 42 cases evaluated (83%), but normal in seven patients under six years of age. Liver copper levels were very high in the 20 patients evaluated. In treatment, 27 children had favorable evolution. One patient did not present disease progression, seven patients worsened due to noncompliance with therapy (one underwent successful liver transplantation) or serious side effects. Five patients with failure died. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson's disease in children can present with a wide clinical spectrum, but liver involvement is by far the most prevalent. Early diagnosis, based on clinical suspicion and results of investigation of copper metabolism (including assessment of hepatic copper content in difficult cases), and appropriate treatment can prevent disease progression.",,"Giacchino, R.;Marazzi, M.

577,Clinical curative effects of dimercaptosuccinic acid in hepatolenticular degeneration and the impact of DMSA on bile trace elements,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the biliary copper content of nonhepatolenticular degeneration (HLD) controls and changes in trace elements in bile, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine of patients with hepatolenticular degeneration before and after treatment with dimercaptosuccinic acid. (DMSA) to further explore the etiological mechanism of HLD and to test the therapeutic effect of DMSA in patients with HLD. METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 HLD patients received DMSA orally for 4 weeks. The adult dose was 1.5 g/day and the child dose was 1.0 g/day. Bile, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine samples were obtained before and after DMSA treatment by duodenal drainage and lumbar puncture. Biliary samples from 22 controls without LD were collected through a drainage tube after surgery. A Hitachi-208 atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to analyze the copper, zinc and iron content of each sample. RESULTS: DMSA could effectively improve symptoms such as dysphasia, salivation, dysphagia, and skin darkening; limb tremor and myotonia ranked second; but showed no obvious effect on dysstasia, limb contracture and deformity, and hepatosplenomegaly. It was effective for patients who were younger and had no obvious liver damage. No serious side effects were noted during the course of treatment. Laboratory study showed that the biliary copper content of HLD patients was significantly lower than that of non-HLD controls (P < 0.01); Clearly, DMSA could improve biliary copper excretion in addition to clearly increasing urinary copper excretion (P < 0.01) and had nothing to do with biliary zinc excretion (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Altered biliary excretion of copper is directly involved in the pathophysiology of copper retention in patients with LD. DMSA is a favorable cupruretic drug for HLD patients.",,"Ren, M.;Yang, R.",1997,Sep,,0,0,
578,"Expression, purification, and metal-binding properties of the N-terminal domain of the putative copper transporting ATPase (ATP7B) from Wilson's disease","The putative copper-binding domain of the copper transporting ATPase implicated in Wilson's disease (ATP7B) has been expressed and purified as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography revealed that the fusion protein can bind to columns loaded with different transition metals with different affinities as follows: Cu(II)>>Zn(II)>Ni(II)>Co( II). The fusion protein did not bind to Fe(II) or Fe(III) loaded columns. 65Zinc(II) blot analysis showed that the domain is capable of binding Zn(II) over a range of pH values from 6.5 to 9.0. 65Zn(II) competition blot showed that Cd(II), Hg(II), Au(III), and Fe(III) can successfully compete with Zn(II), at comparable concentrations, to bind to the domain. In contrast, the domain had little or no affinity for Ca(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), and Ni(II) relative to copper. Neutron activation analysis of copper bound to the domain showed a copper:protein ratio of 6.5-7.3:1. Both Cu(II) and Cu(I) were found to have a higher affinity for the domain relative to Zn(II). Furthermore, a sharp and reproducible transition was only observed in competition experiments with copper, which may suggest that copper binding has some degree of cooperativity.",,"DiDonato, M.;Narindrasorasak, S.;Forbes, J.

SETTING: Referral hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Development of a neurological syndrome that severely impaired a child's usual daily activities and health-related quality of life after institution of penicillamine therapy. RESULTS: Initial penicillamine therapy was correlated chronologically with the development of progressive neurological deterioration in the absence of other causes of neurological syndrome. Discontinuation of penicillamine therapy and initiation of zinc therapy were followed by prompt resolution of neurological symptoms and return to baseline neurological status. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillamine therapy, even in children affected by Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation alone and without neurological disease at the start of treatment, can trigger neurological symptoms.

580,Metabolism of administered triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride in humans,"Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (triene 2HCl) has been used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, which is characterized by the accumulation of copper in various organs. Previously, we developed an HPLC system to analyze trien and found a trien metabolite in urine when trien was orally administered to humans. In this study, the metabolite was identified as 1-N-acetyltriethylenetetramine (acetyltriene) by FAB-MS and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Trien and acetyltrien were capable of combining with copper, iron, and zinc. However, the chelating activity of acetyltriene was significantly lower than that of triene. When triene was administered to healthy adults, the amount of triene excreted in the urine was approximately 1% of the administered triene, while that of acetyltriene was approximately 8%. Most of the triene was excreted within the first 6 hours after administration, while acetyltriene was excreted for more than 26 hours. Urinary levels of copper, iron, and zinc increased in parallel with trien excretion.",,"Kodama, H.;Murata, Y.;Iitsuka, T.;Abe, T.",1997,,,0,0,
581,Penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatoses: a case report and brief review of these dermatoses,"We describe a case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa with additional findings of degenerative skin changes. A 20-year-old male with hepatolenticular degeneration, in prolonged treatment with D-penicillamine, who presented a circular or serpiginous arrangement of nuchal papules. Histopathologically, the transepidermal canals were accompanied by granulomatous reactions, with several giant cells surrounding elastic fibers. In addition to these findings of a typical perforating elastosis serpiginosa, we observed scar-like skin changes within the circular arrangement of the papules. In the scar-like tissue, we found electron microscopic evidence of randomly aggregated thin collagen fibers with no tendency for systemic combined bundle formation, which is a characteristic feature of normal collagen fiber formation. Pseudoxanthoma-elasticum-like changes were seen on her neck. In his armpits and groin, a slight thickening of the skin and wrinkles were detected. The diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa does not represent all the manifestations or pathological history described above. The skin manifestations described here represent not only elastosis but also total degenerative dermatosis with overhealed collagenosis. Therefore, these dermatoses should be summarized as a single entity, penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatosis. After considering the pathogenic background and clinical similarities, we propose to simplify penicillamine-induced skin manifestations into three categories: acute sensitivity reactions, bullous dermatoses, and degenerative dermatoses.

The main objective of this report is to emphasize that Wilson's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure in children. Liver transplantation is the only effective means of treatment in patients with fulminant liver failure, but this procedure is difficult to perform due to insufficient organ donation in Taiwan.

The amount of all proteins excreted was significantly increased compared to controls, with 39% of patients having total proteinuria greater than two standard deviations from the control mean. Changes in protein excretion depended on the duration of treatment. BPM proteinuria was elevated almost exclusively in the first 2 years after initiation of treatment, indicating early tubular damage. This is supported by a high initial excretion of beta 2-microglobulin, NAG, and calcium. Increased excretion of HMW proteins, including albumin, persisted for longer periods, suggesting glomerular injury in some patients, possibly related to D-penicillamine use. Creatinine clearance remained approximately within normal limits.

586,Liver transplant: treatment of choice for hepatic and neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease,"Liver transplantation (LTX) is an approved method of treating patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis and acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease. Initially, there was some consideration about the indication of LTX in the case of Wilson's disease with severe neurological impairment but normal liver function. From 1988 to 1995, 13 of 700 LTX (1.9%) were performed for Wilson's disease. The indications for LTX were (I) intractable neurological deterioration with normal liver function (n = 4; including one patient with Child A cirrhosis), (II) fulminant hepatic failure (n = 3), and (III) end-stage liver cirrhosis ( n = 6) (Child B, n = 1; Child C, n = 5). There were 8 women and 5 men with a mean age of 27 years (range 15-34 years). All patients in group I required continuous nursing care before LTX, despite pretreatment with d-penicillamine and zinc. The most frequent symptoms in these patients were dysphagia (n = 4), dysarthria (n = 4), tremor (n = 4), sialorrhea (n = 3), ataxia (n = 3), dystonia (n = 3) and difficulties with writing (n = 3). All group II patients had hemolytic anemia. The survival rate was 100% and all patients did well after a median follow-up period of 32.8 months (range 8-68 months). The postoperative course passed without serious infections and other complications. All patients in group I revealed the first signs of improvement for all types of neurological symptoms 4-6 weeks after LTX. One patient has been symptom-free from 18 months to 5.5 years after LTX. Two patients with short-term follow-up also had marked improvement in neurological impairment, but residual symptoms are still present. One patient showed only slight improvement. We conclude that Wilson's disease may be a good indication for LTX both for neurological manifestation with stable liver function and for liver manifestation with cirrhosis or acute liver failure.",,"Schumacher, G.;Platz, K.

The interference with lymphocyte function that occurs as a side effect of zinc therapy could lead to serious problems in our patients. We evaluated the mitogenic response of lymphocytes and the activity of natural killer cells in patients with Wilson's disease treated for 5 years or more with zinc, compared to normal controls, and found no differences. In a second study, we evaluated these same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after 1 year of zinc treatment and again found no significant differences. We have seen no evidence of immune suppression or increased susceptibility to infection in our patients, who have now been treated with zinc for up to 15 years.

Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring size decreased significantly over the 5-year study period (p < 0.0001). Although the results of neurological examination, speech pathology examination, and 24-hour urinary copper level analysis in symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease improved over the study period, KF ring regression did not correlate with improvement in these clinical parameters (p > 0.05). However, there was a correlation between MRI scores and KF ring regression (p = 0.02). Anti-copper therapy with TM followed by maintenance zinc therapy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with neurologically symptomatic Wilson's disease. This treatment leads to a reduction in the size of the KF ring; however, the reduction of the KF ring is not a good predictor of clinical improvement for patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations of Wilson's disease.",,"Esmaeli, B.;Burnstine, M.

592,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. II. Initial treatment in 33 neurologically affected patients and follow-up with zinc treatment,"OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and toxic effects of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of a relatively large series of patients with neurological signs and symptoms caused by Wilson's disease. Two key aspects of efficacy are preserving neurologic function present at the start of therapy and maximizing the chance for long-term recovery. DESIGN: An open-label study of 33 patients treated for 8 weeks each, including further follow-up data from the original 17 patients. Neurological function was assessed by frequent quantitative neurological and speech pathology examinations. Several variables related to copper were studied to evaluate the effect of the drug on copper, and several biochemical and clinical variables were studied to evaluate possible toxic effects. Patients were then followed up at yearly intervals, with reported follow-up periods of 1 to 8 years. SETTING: A reference environment of a university hospital. INTERVENTION: Patients were generally treated for 8 weeks with tetrathiomolybdate, followed by maintenance zinc therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by quantitative neurological and motor speech examinations and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain. RESULTS: During the 8 weeks of tetrathiomolybdate administration, only 1 of 33 patients showed impaired neurological function. In general, copper status and potential additional toxic effects were quickly well controlled. Evaluation of individual patient data revealed evidence of a toxic side effect in only 1 patient, who exhibited reversible anemia. During the subsequent 1- to 6-year follow-up period, neurologic recovery in most patients was good to excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent form of initial treatment in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms and signs. Unlike penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate rarely leads to further, often irreversible, neurological deterioration.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Johnson, V.;Dick, R. D.;Kluin, K.

596,Wilson's disease: genetic basis of copper toxicity and natural history,"The discovery that the Wilson disease gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase has greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder and of copper metabolism in humans. The abundance of disease-specific mutations and their location at multiple sites throughout the genome have limited molecular genetic diagnosis to the family of known patients and confirm the need for de novo detection by well-proven clinical and biochemical means. It is not clear whether the variety of specific mutations will explain the wide range of clinical signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, and environmental and extragenic factors are likely to be important contributing factors. Chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine remains an effective treatment for most symptomatic neurological and hepatic Wilson's diseases. Zinc salts can be used for some asymptomatic patients and OLT for fulminant hepatitis and patients in whom pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate is under investigation for the treatment of Wilson's neurological disease. Gene therapy is the new horizon for the treatment of Wilson's disease. However, the ability to treat this disorder effectively by this means awaits further characterization of the gene product and more efficient methods for gene delivery to all hepatocytes in the liver.

600,Current interpretation of the role of copper in Indian childhood cirrhosis,"common fatal disease of the past, Indian childhood cirrhosis (CHF), which became preventable and treatable in the early 1990s, is now rare. CHF must be clearly distinguished in Indian children from other chronic liver disorders, including Wilson's disease. Markedly increased hepatic, urinary, and serum copper concentrations are characteristic of CHF. These increased concentrations are easily demonstrated histologically with orcein-rhodanine staining. Environmental ingestion of copper appears to be the most plausible explanation for CHF, as shown by feeding history, prevention of CHF in siblings and in Pune district by changing feeding containers, and drastic reduction in incidence of the ICC throughout India. The nature and role of a second factor in the causation of CHF remain unclear, although an inherited defect in copper metabolism is strongly suspected. However, CHF does not appear to be a direct early onset of Wilson's disease because ceruloplasmin is consistently normal and clinical and histologic recovery is maintained long-term despite discontinuation of D-penicillamine therapy. Descriptions of CHF-like disease in the West suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic, or both) can lead to the same end-stage liver disease: copper-associated childhood cirrhosis. CHF likely represents a specific form of copper-associated childhood cirrhosis that requires a high environmental intake of copper for its full expression.

602,Chemometric methods applied to an ICP-AES study of chemical element distributions in autopsy livers of subjects affected by Wilson's disease and beta-thalassemia,"The concentrations of seven elements (Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, P, S and Zn) in three autopsy livers (from two beta-thalassemic patients and one patient with Wilson's disease) were determined by the ICP-AES technique. At autopsy, the three livers were subdivided into a large number of samples for a detailed study of the distribution of Fe and Cu, whose accumulation characterizes the two diseases. In the same samples, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, P, S and Zn were also determined to study significant variations or anomalous trends that could help identify these diseases. Our results generally show good agreement with literature data within the limits of sample variability. Based on factor analysis and regression analysis, there is evidence of a high correlation between Fe and P contents in beta-thalassemia. This latter finding led us to tentatively propose an accumulation of Fe as a complex with P-containing molecules.",,"Aragoni, M. C.;Crisponi, G.;Nurchi, V.

603,Neurological Wilson's disease studied with magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography using dopaminergic markers.,"Four patients with neurological Wilson's disease were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). All patients had dystonia as their main clinical manifestation, but they also had dysarthria and at disease presentation had choreoathetoid movements in at least one limb. A multitracer PET approach was used to visualize various aspects of dopaminergic function; [11C]-(+)-nomifensine (NMF), [11C]raclopride (RAC), and [11C]-L-DOPA (one patient). Correlation analysis of RAC and NMF binding, as well as putamen/caudate uptake ratios, showed corresponding reductions. The patient investigated with [11C]-L-DOPA had normal striatal uptake. In general, the structural changes shown by MRI corresponded to reductions in both NMF and RAC binding. There was no apparent correspondence between the PET findings and the severity of clinical symptoms seen in the individual patient. In two patients with mild neurological impairment at the time of the investigation, PET showed severe presynaptic dopaminergic lesions in the putamen. Our data suggest that the striatal degeneration seen in Wilson's disease comprises a complex pathology involving both afferent and efferent projections. The discrete neurological deterioration seen in some patients with gross striatal pathology could be due to concomitant lesions in functionally counteracting basal ganglia circuits.",,"Westermark, K.;Tedroff, J.;Thuomas, K.

607,Hydroxyl radical formation from cuprous ions and hydrogen peroxide: a spin capture study,"It has been assumed that copper toxicity involves the catalytic formation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) from hydrogen peroxide. Addition of Cu1+ to a solution containing ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and the spin-trapping agent alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN) results in the formation of the alpha-hydroxyethyl radical or methyl radical adduct of 4-POBN, respectively. Adduct formation was prevented by the inclusion of catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. The inclusion of exogenous H2O2 in the reaction mixture increased the yield of the radical adduct derived from ethanol or Me2SO and also enhanced the formation of secondary radical adducts, including 4-POBN/.H and the methyl radical adduct of 2-methyl -2-nitrosopropane. . The alpha-hydroxyethyl adduct of 4-POBN decomposes rapidly in the presence of copper, but not iron salts, while the methyl radical adduct is relatively stable in the presence of inorganic copper. The total concentration of radical adduct detected from the reaction between Cu1+ and H2O2, determined by comparison of the integrated spectral intensity with that of the stable free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, was only 1 -5 %. of the maximum amount predicted assuming the formation of radical adducts from all the added copper. A variety of copper chelators inhibit the formation of carbon-centered radical adducts of 4-POBN, including penicillamine and triethylenetetramine, which are the main drugs used to treat the disorder of copper metabolism in Wilson's disease. The results provide clear evidence for the formation of hydroxyl radicals from Cu1+ and H2O2 (added or formed during autoxidation of reduced copper).",,"Gunther, M. R.;Hanna, P. M.;Mason, R.

611,Plasma copper and antioxidant status in Wilson's disease,"The serum copper level unbound to ceruloplasmin (loosely bound copper) has been shown to be increased in Wilson's disease, although the total serum copper concentration is usually low, reflecting a low ceruloplasmin level. To assess the contribution of non-ceruloplasmin copper-catalyzed free radical reactions to the development of complications in this disease, we investigated copper and antioxidant status in four untreated patients who had liver dysfunction with or without hemolytic anemia and compared with five patients controlled with penicillamine. therapy and 19 healthy children of the same age. We found that plasma weakly bound copper measured by the phenanthroline assay was detectable in three of four untreated patients with Wilson's disease, but was not detectable in patients on therapy or in healthy controls. Among the various antioxidants, ascorbate and urate levels were markedly reduced before treatment (mean +/- SD, 23 +/- 16 microM for ascorbate and 90 +/- 59 microM for urate) compared to values in patients. during treatment with penicillamine (67 +/- 19 and 302 +/- 78 microM, p < 0.05) and in control children (60 +/- 8 and 254 +/- 48 microM, p < 0.05).

614,Effect of growth hormone on IGF-I levels in a patient with growth hormone deficiency and Wilson's disease,"This is a case report of a child with a combination of two rare disorders: growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and Wilson's disease. To our knowledge, no comparable case has yet been published in the literature. GHD was diagnosed at the age of 4.5 years (height standard deviation (SDS) score -4.85). However, due to a difficult family history, growth hormone (GH) therapy could not be started. The child was not seen again until the age of 7.7 years (height SDS -4.77), when GHD was reconfirmed and GH therapy (dose 0.6 IU/kg/week) could be started. At that time, elevated liver enzymes (GPT 128 U/l, GOT 67 U/l, gamma-GT 28 U/l) confounded diagnostic procedures. In GH, SDS growth velocity increased from -1.86 to +4.50 in the first year and +3.87 in the second year, and SDS height increased to -4.26 and -3.59. However, serum IGF-I levels did not normalize (max. 67 ng/mL) and liver enzymes were still elevated. At the age of 10 years, Wilson's disease was diagnosed in view of low serum ceruloplasmin concentration, elevated urinary copper excretion, and high copper content in a liver biopsy specimen. Under combined therapy with D-penicillamine and GH, serum liver enzymes decreased and IGF-I levels increased to normal levels.

Two received the drug as first option and 17 after treatment with penicillamine. The change was made due to side effects, lack of improvement, or worsening of neurological symptoms. All penicillamine-induced side effects were reversed. Thirteen patients are still receiving trientine, and the mean total observation time on this treatment is 8.5 years/patient. Seven of the 13 are free of WD-related symptoms, five have mild to moderate neurological symptoms, mainly dysarthria. A patient with neurological symptoms who received trientine from the start of treatment rapidly deteriorated and now has severe dystonia. Symptoms initially worsened and then improved in one patient. All other patients improved during trientine treatment. Three patients died: two from multifocal cancer that included the liver and one that did not comply with rupture of the spleen. Two patients underwent liver transplantation for progressive liver failure: one noncompliant and one with liver cirrhosis whose liver function deteriorated despite treatment; both are now symptom free. Unexpectedly, two patients developed severe colitis, one with duodenitis as well, which improved after drug withdrawal.

617,Wilson's disease: a new gene and an animal model for an old disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism. In normal individuals, copper homeostasis is controlled by the balance between intestinal absorption of dietary copper and hepatic excretion of excess copper in the bile. In Wilson's disease, hepatic copper is neither excreted in the bile nor incorporated into ceruloplasmin, and copper accumulates to toxic levels. The Wilson's disease (WND) gene encodes a putative copper transporter protein that is expressed almost exclusively in the liver. The predicted structure of the protein product is that of a P-type ATPase with striking homology to bacterial copper transporters and the gene product of another inherited disorder of copper metabolism, Menkes disease. A rat model of Wilson's disease has recently been identified. The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat exhibits elevated hepatic copper, defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, and reduced biliary excretion of copper. The rat homolog of WND is abnormal in LEC rats. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease arise directly from copper-induced damage to hepatocytes (hepatic presentation) or indirectly following release of copper from the liver with subsequent damage to the brain (neuropsychiatric presentation) and other organs. Genetic heterogeneity (different mutations in a single gene) may explain some of the variability in Wilsonian presentations. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the demonstration of impaired copper metabolism, manifested as elevated urinary and hepatic copper levels and low ceruloplasmin levels. However, none of the abnormal findings in Wilson's disease is pathognomonic. Genetic diagnosis, in the absence of family studies, is likely to be difficult as many different mutations result in the disease. Wilson's disease is treated by lowering excessive levels of copper that have built up in the liver, brain, and other organs. Copper chelation therapy, to increase urinary copper excretion, is the mainstay of treatment. In addition, oral zinc therapy may be useful in decreasing dietary copper absorption and rendering tissue copper nontoxic by increasing complexation with copper-binding proteins. Liver transplant may be necessary for people with acute liver failure or complications of cirrhosis. Gene therapy may evolve in the future; however, medical management is effective in most patients.

The girl was clinically disease-free and had no conventional biochemical markers of Wilson's disease (ie, normal ceruloplasmin, normal serum copper, normal 24-hour urinary copper excretion). Diagnosis with restriction fragment length polymorphisms and non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with microsatellite markers showed that he was homozygous for disease-associated markers. A liver biopsy was performed and a 20-fold increased liver copper content confirmed the diagnosis. The child was treated with chelation therapy with D-penicillamine. The report of this study clearly shows the advantage of DNA ligation analysis (especially polymerase chain reaction) over conventional laboratory methods for the presymptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease before irreparable liver and neurological damage occurs. . The only limitation of this DNA-based diagnosis is the fact that it is only applicable in siblings of an index patient whose diagnosis was made by phenotypic criteria.",,"Maier-Dobersberger, T.;Mannhalter, C.;Rack, S.;Granditsch, G.;Kaserer, K.;Korninger, L.;Steindl, P.;Gangl, A.;Ferenci, P.",1995,Dec,,0,0,

Thorough evaluation of individuals with emotional disturbances, including a complete history, careful physical examination, and appropriate laboratory profile, usually rules out or raises suspicion of Wilson's disease during screening. Laboratory abnormalities require repeat studies and additional personal and family history with an emphasis on possible Wilson's disease. Then further study may be indicated.

623,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XIII: Zinc therapy in presymptomatic patients from the time of diagnosis,"Siblings of patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease each have a 25% risk of also having this autosomal recessive disease. Screening for these siblings allows for their detection and institution of prophylactic therapy before they become clinically ill. Here we report the successful treatment of 13 presymptomatic patients with zinc acetate. These patients who received zinc have been followed for 3 to 9 years. In well-compliant patients, 24-hour urine copper and plasma ceruloplasmin-free copper levels have decreased over years of follow-up, consistent with the removal of excess readily mobilized copper (potentially toxic copper). ) of the body. The effect of therapy and compliance are easily monitored by monitoring 24-hour urinary zinc and copper levels. The level of copper in the urine is a good reflection of the excess body burden of easily mobilized copper. It will increase if the control is not adequate. A decrease in urinary zinc is an early sign that patient compliance is not optimal. Hepatic copper levels in response to several years of zinc therapy may remain the same, temporarily decrease or increase. This is a reflection of zinc induction of hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters copper in a non-toxic pool. Liver copper levels should not be used to monitor therapy. Liver function is well preserved by zinc therapy and no zinc toxicity occurred in these 13 patients. No patient developed symptoms related to Wilson's disease. We conclude that zinc acetate is a completely effective and non-toxic therapy for the prophylactic treatment of the patient with presymptomatic Wilson's disease.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R.

Initial therapy in 17 neurologically affected patients,"OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and toxicity of a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in the initial treatment of a relatively large series of patients presenting with neurological signs and symptoms caused by Wilson's disease. The key aspect of efficacy was preservation of neurological function present at the start of therapy. DESIGN: An open study of 17 patients treated for 8 weeks each. Neurological function was assessed by frequent quantitative neurological and speech examinations. Several variables related to copper were studied to assess the effect of the drug on copper, and a large number of biochemical and clinical variables were studied to assess potential toxicity. Patients were then followed up at yearly intervals, with reported follow-up periods of 1 to 5 years. SETTING: A university hospital referral center INTERVENTION: Patients were generally treated for 8 weeks with tetrathiomolybdate, followed by maintenance zinc therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by quantitative neurological and speech examinations. RESULTS: None of the patients suffered a loss of neurological function. In general, copper status and potential additional toxic effects were quickly well controlled. No toxic effects were produced by the administration of tetrathiomolybdate. During the subsequent 1- to 5-year follow-up period, neurologic recovery in most patients was good to excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent form of initial treatment in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological signs and symptoms. Unlike penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate does not result in major, often irreversible, neurological deterioration.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R.

Previous Indian studies have highlighted the neurological manifestations of this disorder. Eleven patients with Wilson's disease with different hepatic manifestations are reported.

Whenever possible, liver biopsy was performed. RESULTS: Patients with Wilson's disease presented as acute viral hepatitis (n = 5), fulminant hepatic failure (n = 2), subacute hepatic failure (n = 2), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2). Therapy with penicillamine/triene and zinc sulfate was started in 9 patients; 5 showed a good response to therapy, one had to be switched to triene due to penicillamine toxicity, two died and one was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease has varied hepatic presentations and should be suspected in all patients with unexplained liver disease. Any young adult presenting with acute hepatitis or fulminant hepatic failure who has evidence of underlying chronic liver disease or associated hemolytic anemia should be investigated for Wilson's disease.

The following EPs were recorded: related to acoustically evoked events (ERP), somatosensory (SSEP), visual (VEP), and brainstem evoked potentials (BSEP). The results were compared with data from a control group matched for age and sex. Clinical signs of basal ganglia dysfunction were present in 89% of patients, oculomotor or cerebellar symptoms in 11%, but none of the individuals had any clinical evidence of visual pathway involvement. Psychometrically, 100% had mood swings without defined intellectual decline. In the EP records, 100% showed ERP abnormalities, 58.0% SSEP, and 53% VEP and BSEP. VEP and BSEP measurements did not correlate with clinical score. There was only a weak correlation of SSEP (right side) and ERP amplitude reduction with total clinical score.

Dose-response studies have shown that regimens of 50 mg elemental zinc 3 times daily (50 mg x 3), 25 mg x 3, and 50 mg x 2 are effective, but 25 mg x 2 and 50 mg x 1 they are not. adequately effective. These studies indicate that 75 mg per day is close to the minimally effective dose, but do not address the question of the necessary dose frequency. In the current study, the authors used the minimally effective daily dose, 75 mg, and studied this daily dose in regimens of 25 mg x 3, 37.5 mg x 2, and 75 mg x 1 in the treatment of four patients with Parkinson's disease. Wilson. These data have been supplemented by additional data from 11 patients treated with 25 mg 3 times daily and data from 2 patients treated with 75 mg once daily. Efficacy was assessed by 10-day copper balance and absorption of orally administered 64copper. The results indicate that a daily dose of 75 mg must be divided into at least two doses to be effective, and that the 64copper procedure is more sensitive to zinc dose than to copper balance.",,"Brewer, G.

Histologic examination of the lesions showed abnormal elastic fiber proliferations similar to those previously described at other sites, especially the skin, in patients receiving penicillamine.

MSPR was significantly reduced in WD patients. In the range of 1 to 5 Hz, normal subjects, as well as WD patients, tended to produce frequencies slightly higher than the target frequencies. This acceleration was maximal in normals between 4 and 5 Hz, whereas in WD patients the acceleration occurred mainly between 3 and 4 Hz. The test results showed considerable variation between patients. This variation can be interpreted on the basis of the theory of coupled oscillators. Comparison of speech and finger movements revealed a highly significant correlation between MSPR and the highest possible frequency of voluntary alternating movements of the index finger.

Laboratory tests and clinical scores were correlated. To quantify the impairment of voluntary movements in WD, the fastest possible isometric extensions of the index finger and the fastest alternating movements of the fingers were analyzed. Eleven patients presented abnormally slow and 15 abnormally irregular voluntary movements. The slowness of the alternating movements was correlated with the clinical score. The clinical score was also correlated with the duration of symptoms before the start of therapy. Motor tests were found to be sensitive enough to monitor improvement in neurological symptoms after initiation of therapy.

642,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XI. Interaction with other anti-copper agents,"Zinc (Zn) is increasingly used as a treatment for Wilson's disease. Some physicians have been prescribing Zn along with other anti-copper agents, such as penicillamine or triene, although in theory these drugs could have antagonistic effects. In addition, patients with Wilson's disease often take high-dose vitamin C along with Zn therapy, and there is evidence of possible interactions between vitamin C, Zn, and copper (Cu). The interactions of penicillamine, triene, and vitamin C with Zn have not been previously studied in terms of the potential effects of these agents on the efficacy of Zn in Wilson's disease. Here we have studied these interactions in the maintenance phase of therapy, using Cu balance and orally administered 64Cu absorption as endpoints. We found evidence for probable interactions of penicillamine and trien with Zn; however, the end result in the Cu balance is almost the same with Zn alone as it is with Zn plus one of the other agents. Therefore, there appears to be no advantage to co-administration. We found no detectable interaction of Zn and vitamin C on Cu balance, when vitamin C is taken in daily doses of 1000 mg.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Johnson, V.;Dick, R.

In contrast, lowering the TTH dose caused the disappearance of ringed sideroblasts. Therefore, TTH should be added as another cause of secondary acquired sideroblastic anemia. The pathophysiology of this finding, probably related to an abnormality of mitochondrial iron metabolism, is briefly discussed.",,"Condamine, L.;Hermine, O.;Alvin, P.;Levine, M.;Rey, C.;Courtecuisse, V.",1993,Jan,,0,0,
644,Geographic Variations in Wilson's Disease,"Certain features of Wilson's disease (WD) in Asia have been found to be different from those in other continents. The higher prevalence rate in Japan is presumably due to a higher consanguinity rate. In Chinese, there is a close link between WD and two gene loci for esterase D and retinoblastoma on the long arm of chromosome 13. The high proportion of patients with hepatic presentation explains the early onset of WD in the Japanese and Chinese series. . Skeletal involvement, leg hyperpigmentation, dark complexion, amenorrhea, epileptic seizures, and cerebral white matter degeneration are relatively more common among WD patients in Asia. Excess copper in the liver seems to have a protective effect against hepatocellular carcinoma and type B hepatitis. Electrophysiological studies suggest generalized functional alterations of the CNS in WD. Side effects of penicillamine are quite common and often lead to discontinuation of therapy. Trien is found to be effective with no adverse reactions. Oral zinc therapy may be a suitable alternative for long-term treatment of WD patients in developing Asian countries.

645,Chelation treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"The results of chelation treatment of 137 patients with neurological Wilson's disease are described, together with the most commonly observed toxic reactions to the different drugs used. Fifty-seven patients responded excellently to treatment and had no symptoms. Thirty-six patients recovered well but were left with some minor neurological deficit. Twenty-four patients had a poor response: although the disease process was stopped, they were more or less disabled. Twenty patients died: nine received little or no treatment, but 11 died despite apparently adequate chelation therapy. There was no obvious reason for this failure. Hepatic copper levels were estimated in six of these patients: in one it was still significantly elevated, but in the four for whom determination was possible, basal ganglia copper concentration exceeded 45 micrograms/grams wet weight. . It was not clear why the appropriate therapy failed to remove copper from the brains of these patients. There were no obvious clinical, histological or biochemical indicators of lack of response to treatment. Initial deterioration before improvement was observed in 30 patients: the prognosis for a useful recovery was not necessarily worse than that of patients who did not show this phenomenon.",,"Walshe, J.

648,Does the vegetarian diet control Wilson's disease?,"The literature indicates that copper (Cu) is less bioavailable in a vegetarian diet compared to a mixed diet. Furthermore, several groups, including ours, find a fairly marginal average intake of Cu in the typical American diet. For example, our data indicate that patients with Wilson's disease who follow a typical American diet ingest only 25% more Cu than is necessary. This suggests that a vegetarian diet, if it reduced bioavailability by 25% or more, would be a suitable maintenance therapy for Wilson's disease. Observations in two of our patients, who followed lactovegetarian diets by choice and who were poorly compliant with anti-Cu therapy, support this view. These observations suggest that vegetarian diets may be a management tool for Wilson's disease. They also further emphasize the marginal intake of Cu in American diets and suggest that some apparently healthy people, particularly vegetarians, may be at risk of mild Cu deficiency.",,"Brewer, G.

651,Wilson's disease: diagnosis made in two individuals older than 40 years,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism that is widely recognized as a disease that presents clinically in children, adolescents, and young adults. Unrecognized and therefore untreated Wilson's disease in patients older than 40 years is thought to occur rarely or not at all. We present two cases of Wilson's disease that presented at an age older than 40 years. The first is a 42-year-old Israeli woman who presented with fulminant liver failure. Serologic and biochemical investigations obtained at the time of his fulminant liver failure included copper studies that suggested a diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which was confirmed by examination of the native liver after successful orthotopic liver transplantation. The second case is that of a 56-year-old white male who presented to the hospital with a 3-year history of neurologic dysfunction, pancytopenia, and mild splenomegaly. A battery of serological and biochemical investigations suggested a diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by quantitative estimation of liver copper and the demonstration of Wilson's disease in three of his siblings, all of whom were diagnosed after identification of the probable case. This man and his brothers have been treated with d-penicillamine, with marked improvement in their neurological and liver function. The proband is currently doing well 11 years after his diagnosis was established. These two cases demonstrate that a diagnosis of Wilson's disease should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis for individuals in their fourth and fifth decades of life who present with unexplained liver disease.",,"Bellary, S.

652,Fate of orally administered triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride: a therapeutic drug for Wilson's disease,"Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TETA) is a therapeutic drug for Wilson's disease. We developed a simple fluorometric method for the detection of TETA in biological fluids using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and examined TETA concentrations in the serum and urine of two healthy adults who received TETA orally. No TETA peak was detected in the serum. The amount of TETA in the urine of the two adults was only 1.6 and 1.7% of the administered dose. However, a large unidentified peak appeared in the urine after oral administration. This peak was not observed in a mixture of TETA and control urine or in urine prior to TETA administration. When urine was analyzed after TETA administration after hydrolysis with HCl, the unidentified peak disappeared, while the TETA peak increased. These findings indicate that the substance that produced the unidentified peak is a TETA metabolite, suggesting that most of the administered TETA is metabolized and then excreted in the urine.",,"Kodama, H.;Meguro, Y.;Tsunakawa, A.;Nakazato, Y.;Abe, T.;Murakita, H.",1993,Jan,,0,0,

Five of the symptomatic patients had clinical features of liver disease at initial presentation and it was preceded by renal dysfunction in another patient. The remaining patient presented neurological characteristics. Six patients had a Kayser-Fleisher ring. Abnormal liver function tests were found in half of the patients. Ceruloplasmin was reduced in 7 of 10 patients. Serum copper and urinary copper estimates were the most useful diagnostic laboratory tests. Morphological alteration was found in the 9 patients who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy. All patients were initially treated with D-penicillamine and a clinical response was observed in seven, of which one developed neurological manifestations while receiving treatment. D-penicillamine was replaced by zinc sulfate in 3 patients who developed thrombocytopenia. The data suggest that Wilson's disease may not be rare in Saudi Arabia. For early detection and timely treatment, the disease should be suspected under appropriate clinical circumstances, especially in young patients with liver diseases.

Four patients were asymptomatic, 4 had mild neurological findings, 2 were moderately affected, and the remaining 6 had a severe form of the disease. All patients were receiving D-penicillamine at the time of the study. The most symptomatic patients had five or more sites of abnormalities on MRI. The putamen was affected in all symptomatic individuals and one asymptomatic individual, and 11 of them presented dystonia on neurological examination. A striking feature was the peripheral location of hyperintense putaminal lesions on T2-weighted images.

657,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Progress has been made in establishing the location of the gene on the long arm of chromosome 13 and in finding nearby probes that can be used to identify affected siblings of newly diagnosed patients. However, the gene has not been cloned and the molecular nature of the defect is unknown. The cause of the disease is the lack of unnecessary and excessive excretion of copper in the bile due to loss in the feces. This may be due to a lack of excretion of ceruloplasmin-packaged copper in the bile. Clinically, patients usually present in the second to fourth decades of life with liver, neurologic, or psychiatric disease, but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. Once a diagnosis of Wilson's disease is considered, reliable studies of copper variables can be performed. After diagnosis, patients must receive anti-copper treatment for the rest of their lives, to reduce copper levels and prevent copper reaccumulation. For lifelong maintenance therapy, we recommend zinc acetate due to its complete efficacy and lack of toxicity; It works by blocking the absorption of copper. For the initial therapy of the critically ill patient, no currently available therapy has proven to be ideal. A chelating-type drug, either penicillamine or triene, can be used for the initial treatment of patients with liver disease; the transition to zinc acetate can be made after a few months. For initial therapy of acutely ill patients presenting with neurologic disease, chelation should be avoided because neurologic worsening frequently occurs, probably due to copper redistribution that temporarily elevates brain copper levels. For initial treatment, zinc therapy is also not ideal because it is relatively slow acting. An experimental new drug, tetrathiomolybdate, shows promise in the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. The main challenges ahead include closing the remaining therapeutic gaps, cloning and expressing the gene to understand its function, and improving clinical diagnosis so that therapy can be instituted as quickly as possible.

659,Strategies for the development of new antiarthritic agents,"Therapeutic advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have largely focused on the development of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with improved characteristics compared to aspirin [Brooks & Day, New Engl. J. Med., 324, 1716-1725 (1991)]. For example, higher potency, safety, better tolerance in the elderly, and lower dosing frequency have been achieved. However, these agents are generally considered a palliative treatment of the symptoms of the disease. The development of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), also known as second-line drugs, for RA has not been very successful. Most of the agents currently used in this category were originally used to treat other diseases such as malignancy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), Wilson's disease (d-penicillamine), and tuberculosis (gold salts) [Pullar, Br. J. clin. Pharmac., 30, 501-510 (1990)]. Unfortunately, neither agent is ideal and each has potentially serious side effects. There have been several attempts to develop agents with new mechanisms of action that will hopefully greatly improve these current therapies. [References: 47]",,"Lewis, A. J.;Glaser, K. B.;Sturm, R.

660,Wilson's disease: current status,"OBJECTIVE: To review current concepts on the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of Wilson's disease, with emphasis on recent developments. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Published information was identified using MEDLINE and an extensive manual search of bibliographies of identified sources. RESULTS: The basic biochemical alteration responsible for altered hepatobiliary copper homeostasis in Wilson's disease has not yet been identified. The gene for Wilson's disease has been mapped to chromosome 13, but the function of its gene product has not yet been determined. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease are varied and often nonspecific and include a variety of hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric findings. Penicillamine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease, but recent experience suggests that trientine and zinc may be safe and effective alternatives. All three drugs are likely safe for use in pregnant patients with Wilson's disease. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for fulminant Wilsonian liver failure and corrects the underlying metabolic defect. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson's disease is a disorder of hepatobiliary copper excretion manifested predominantly by hepatic and neurological copper toxicosis and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Although the specific underlying biochemical defect remains to be defined, specific and usually successful therapy is available. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is critical to diagnosing this easily treatable hereditary disease. [References: 167]",,"Yarze, J. C.;Martin, P.;Munoz, S. J.;Friedman, L. S.",1992,Jun,,0,0,

663,Interactions of penicillamine with copper in vivo and the effect on hepatic metallothionein levels and copper/zinc distribution: implications for therapy of Wilson's disease and arthritis.,"D-penicillamine does not remove copper from metallothionein, but it has been suggested that it may increase hepatic levels of metallothionein. D-penicillamine was shown to increase hepatic metallothionein levels in rats; however, the effect depended on an interaction with copper. The drug accelerated exogenous copper excretion but increased the amount retained in metallothionein. This interaction of penicillamine and copper also caused changes in zinc distribution and, in particular, an increase in the thermostable zinc fraction of the cytosol. In contrast, thiomolybdates were much more effective at removing exogenous copper and even removed copper already bound to metallothionein; therefore, the copper level in the heat-stable cytosol fraction decreased. The observations support the view that patients with Wilson's disease may not be truly ""decoppered,"" but that treatment with d-penicillamine is effective because copper accumulated in the liver is bound in a nontoxic form by the increased of metallothionein. The results explain why stopping treatment is dangerous. The results may also partially explain the efficacy of copper D-penicillamine chelates as anti-inflammatory drugs.",,"McQuaid, A.;Lamand, M.;Mason, J.",1992,Jun,,0,0,

666,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: X. Induction of intestinal metallothionein,"Oral zinc therapy is effective in controlling copper balance in patients with Wilson's disease and blocks intestinal absorption of copper, as evidenced by copper-64 uptake and copper balance measurements. In this study, 64Cu uptake measurements were performed simultaneously with intestinal biopsies to investigate the relationship between reduced copper absorption and intestinal metallothionein levels in patients with Wilson's disease at different stages of zinc therapy. A pronounced increase in intestinal metallothionein levels and a sharp drop in 64Cu absorption were found 4 to 5 days after the start of zinc treatment. In contrast, metallothionein levels decreased and 64Cu absorption increased upon discontinuation of zinc therapy. The data indicate that the absorption of 64Cu varies as a function of the level of intestinal metallothionein. Intestinal levels of metallothionein were found to correlate linearly with urinary zinc levels, which reflect body zinc status. These findings support our hypothesis that intestinal metallothionein induction mediates the decreased copper absorption observed during zinc therapy. The suppressive effect of zinc on copper absorption appears to have a half-life of about 11 days.",,"Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Grider, A.;Nostrant, T.;Cousins, R. J.;Brewer, G. J.",1992,Sep,,0,0,

PD was discontinued and zinc sulfate (220 mg three times daily) was introduced. With this therapeutic regimen, his renal laboratory parameters returned to the previous level after one month. Within one year on this therapeutic regimen, the neurological manifestations resolved. After 31 months of treatment with zinc, he remains neurologically asymptomatic and his renal function is satisfactory. Patient 2, a 41-year-old woman had been diagnosed with HLD at the age of 20, when after diagnosis of the disease in her older brother, she was found to have the laboratory features of HLD and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. . PD treatment was recommended at that time, but he dropped out of follow-up. When he was 23 years old, bleeding from esophageal varices occurred. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS)",,"Barbosa, E.

672,"Treatment of Wilson's disease with triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine, 2HCl): long-term observations","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the buildup of a toxic amount of copper in the body. Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine, 2HCl) is a new chelating agent that may be effective in removing excess copper, but long-term efficacy has not yet been investigated. Here we report the use of trientine for more than 8 years in 2 patients with Wilson's disease who could not tolerate D-penicillamine. We did not find any significant side effects, except a decrease in serum iron concentration without clinical symptoms of anemia. In annual steady-state examinations, serum copper levels remained below 20 micrograms/100 ml. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was lower than that found with D-penicillamine, while baseline copper excretion, after 5 days of trientine withdrawal, remained below 100 micrograms/day.

673,Evaluation of portal hypertension: understanding will improve treatment,"For many people it may be disappointing that many uncertainties remain regarding the evaluation of PHT. Only a few findings, such as increased WHVPG and varicose veins, prove PHT. However, we have gained considerable knowledge. PHT is the consequence of a series of changes involving the intrahepatic and extrahepatic circulation. Alcohol, viruses, and drugs can alter the architecture of the parenchyma, causing cell swelling, collagen and fibrin deposition, and invasion of inflammatory cells. These processes can eventually evolve to cirrhosis. Although in the initial stages the parenchymal alteration per se can explain PHT, the increasingly impaired liver function gives rise to metabolic changes that alter hemodynamics. Advanced PHT in parenchymal liver disease is the result of the complex interaction between local and systemic changes. Current techniques for the evaluation of PHT are useful for qualitative aspects: the increase in pressure can be evaluated directly or indirectly; the portal venous system can be visualized even without arteriography. Gastroscopy remains a standard procedure for the diagnosis of PHT. Endoscopic ultrasound is particularly helpful in confirming fundal varices and evaluating changes after sclerotherapy. Increasingly, noninvasive methods to quantify PHT are becoming available, such as duplex scanning. However, you need to realize the limitations and pitfalls. Quantitative evaluation remains (still?) a technique for research centers. It is obvious that the clinician in general practice can dispense with most of the more sophisticated techniques that have been discussed here. At the moment, PHT, and in particular variceal bleeding, is most often treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Therefore, very detailed studies are only required in a minority of cases. However, the increasing knowledge opens new perspectives for the treatment and prevention of PHT at several levels. This can be quite specific treatment of liver parenchymal disease (antivirals, d-penicillamine for Wilson's disease or veins for hemochromatosis), medications that can reduce local tissue damage through more general pathways (colchicine, steroids) and medications that influence flow. A more selective blocker of portal venous pressure will undoubtedly be available one of these years. The optimal evaluation for this type of therapy requires mastering at least some more advanced techniques. Regarding non-cirrhotic PHT with causes that can range from congenital or acquired coagulation abnormalities to anatomical malformations (esophageal web) and ""natural healthy herbal tea"", measures can be taken. It is clear that before treating any of the rarer causes, an adequate diagnostic work is required. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 400 WORDS) [References: 92]",,"van Leeuwen, D. J.",1991,,,0,0,
674,Wilsonian Chronic Active Hepatitis Prognosis,"Twenty of 320 patients with Wilson's disease initially presented with chemical and laboratory features of chronic active hepatitis, histologically confirmed in 17. When first observed, all 20 had cirrhosis and 11 were complicated by ascites and/or jaundice. Eight years after the onset of liver disease, a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established and treatment with D-penicillamine was started immediately in 19 patients. One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention, for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine, disappeared in all but 1 of the patients so affected. Symptomatic improvement and near normal levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase followed within 1 year in most subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. Two patients, who did not comply with the therapeutic regimen after 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological treatment, required liver transplantation. These results indicate that the prognosis of specifically treated Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis is very good despite the presence of cirrhosis.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Scheinberg, I.

We are developing and evaluating a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for this purpose. In theory, tetrathiomolybdate has optimal properties, including an immediate blockade of copper absorption and the property of complexing with copper in the blood, rendering copper non-toxic. In this article, we present the results of six patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate for up to 8 weeks as initial therapy.

678,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. IX: Serum lipid response,"Zinc therapy in Wilson's disease is a lifelong treatment to prevent reaccumulation of copper. Previous reports have shown that in normal male subjects, ingestion of zinc has reduced the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This finding raises the possibility that lifelong zinc therapy may be atherogenic. In the present work, the effects of zinc therapy on serum lipids are evaluated over a period of years in patients with Wilson's disease. Zinc therapy reduces total cholesterol level by approximately 10% in both sexes and lowers high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by approximately 20% in male patients. The mechanisms of these interesting effects of zinc on cholesterol metabolism are unknown. The risk factor for coronary heart disease does not change significantly with zinc therapy in either sex and, moreover, remains below average in these patients after zinc therapy.

679,"Wilson's disease: clinical presentation, treatment and survival","OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic features, clinical course, and long-term overall survival of patients with Wilson's disease. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up of 14.2 years. SETTING: A university medical center and a community hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were evaluated between 1957 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with D-penicillamine (600 to 1800 mg/d). Two patients with end-stage liver disease underwent liver transplantation. MAIN RESULTS: Initial symptoms occurred at a mean age of 15.5 years. At diagnosis, the most common neurological signs were dysarthria, tremor, difficulty writing, and ataxia, followed by hypersalivation and headache. Somatic symptoms included abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia. Mean serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin and copper were 44 mg/l and 4.7 mumol/l, respectively. Mean baseline urine copper excretion was 5.5 Âµmol/d and mean liver copper concentration was 19.6 Âµmol/g dry weight. Free serum copper concentration (mean, 2.7 mumol/L) was a reliable indicator of the disease and was useful to assess the efficacy of treatment (values less than 1.6 mumol/L). D-penicillamine treatment improved most hematologic and neurologic abnormalities, but had little effect on hepatomegaly and splenomegaly and did not reverse cirrhosis. Two patients died of fulminant liver failure during the observation period, while two others with end-stage liver disease had successful liver transplantation and remain asymptomatic. Long-term survival of patients with Wilson's disease was similar to that of age- and sex-matched controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long-term treatment of Wilson's disease patients with D-penicillamine may relieve symptoms and improve prognosis.",,"Stremmel, W.;Meyerrose, K.

Before treatment, urinary copper excretion (UCE) was 70-96 micrograms/day. UCE increased to 1512-2352 micrograms/day on the day of initial administration and remained at levels between 350-1100 micrograms/day thereafter. During 2 months of trien therapy, neurological deficits regressed in three patients and only slightly in one patient. No adverse effects were observed. These results and the retrospective survey of 17 patients treated with D-PC confirmed that triene is a less potent but safer copper chelating agent than D-PC. The transient worsening of neurological deficits observed in two patients during the initial phase of treatment suggested that trien, like D-PC, should be started in small doses and increased gradually.",,"Saito, H.;Watanabe, K.;Sahara, M.;Mochizuki, R.;Edo, K.;Ohyama, Y.",1991,May,,0,1,

687,Pathophysiology and treatment of Wilson's disease,"The pathophysiology, symptomatology, and treatment of Wilson's disease are reviewed, and new approaches to medication management are discussed. Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that occurs between the ages of 6 and 60 years. Alterations in copper metabolism can result in the accumulation of excess copper in the liver, the basal ganglia of the brain (lenticular degeneration), the kidneys, the cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings), and other tissues. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is often missed; nonspecific symptoms and multisystem involvement can mimic other disease states, such as neurological and psychiatric disorders and hemolytic anemia. Screening tests for Wilson's disease include 24-hour urine copper levels, serum ceruloplasmin and copper assays, 64Cu radioactive uptake, and liver biopsy. Current methods of therapy include the use of a chelating agent, penicillamine or trientine, for rapid removal of the initial copper. Penicillamine therapy has been associated with many adverse reactions, including worsening of the patient's neurological symptoms. Zinc is a useful agent for maintenance therapy. Research studies exploring the use of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for rapid initial copper removal have shown promising results. Unless recognized and treated, Wilson's disease can cause severe symptoms and ultimately death. The current method of treatment is initial rapid elimination with chelating agents, such as penicillamine and trientine, followed by lifelong maintenance therapy with zinc.

704,Use of zinc-copper metabolic interactions in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Zinc acetate is becoming a well-established therapy for the treatment of Wilson's disease. It is excellent for maintenance therapy and for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient. Current evidence suggests that it will also be excellent for the treatment of the pregnant patient. Zinc acts by inducing metallothionein in intestinal cells, which binds to copper with high affinity, blocking its absorption and causing its excretion in the feces. We have shown that zinc, even in doses as low as 25 mg daily, negatively affects copper balance. Zinc 50 mg three times daily, with all doses separated from food, controls abnormal positive copper balance, blocks uptake of orally administered 64Cu, controls urine and plasma copper, prevents reaccumulation of hepatic copper and prevents the development or progression of symptoms of copper toxicosis in patients with Wilson's disease. Zinc acetate will probably be licensed in the near future for the treatment of Wilson's disease. We recommend that clinicians use urine and plasma copper and urine zinc as primary monitoring tools. In contrast to the comfortable situation with maintenance therapy, the initial management of critically ill patients with Wilson's disease is not well thought out. Patients with neurological diseases often initially worsen on penicillamine, and zinc acts more slowly than ideal. We have initiated studies of tetrathiomolybdate for this purpose. Studies of biliary secretions from normal subjects suggest that they excrete regulatory (excess) copper packaged in a protease-resistant fragment of ceruloplasmin. This fragment is missing in the bile of Wilson's disease. The Wilson disease gene is on chromosome 13, near the retinoblastoma locus. (SHORT SUMMARY IN 250 WORDS) [References: 23]",,"Brewer, G.

Through its cuproenzymes, copper displays a variety of metabolic functions. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry, radioisotope studies, and the establishment of cell and molecular biology have provided the necessary tools to study the absorption, metabolism, physiology, and biochemistry of copper. The vital role of metallothionein in copper homeostasis is examined. Ceruloplasmin represents the molecular link between copper and iron metabolism. Genetic predisposition to copper toxicity has been attributed to the cause of Wilson's disease in humans. Interrelationships between copper and other dietary factors are discussed.

706,Hepatic copper concentration in Wilson's disease: effect of treatment with 'anti-copper' agents,"Serial determinations of copper have been made in the livers of 10 patients with Wilson's disease. Two were studied before and eight after the start of treatment to assess the effect, if any, on metal concentration. In two patients who were not receiving therapy and in one who had been discontinued, the copper level rose. In this last patient, resumption of treatment resulted in a drop in the level of copper in the liver. A similar drop was seen in seven patients on continuous therapy. In one patient, a very poor adherent, there was a tendency for liver copper concentration to increase over a 5-year period. The three therapies investigated (penicillamine, trientine and tetrathiomolybdate) when taken regularly, appear to be effective in reducing liver copper levels. Sixty-nine unique liver copper determinations have been plotted against treatment time. This shows that the copper concentration drops rapidly in the first year. Thereafter, there is no linear relationship between duration of treatment and liver copper. Poor adherers have a higher concentration of copper in the liver than good adherers. Measurements performed on different parts of the liver showed that in only one of the 19 examples was there an overlap between the near-normal and abnormal ranges. The main mechanism of action of 'anti-copper' agents in Wilson's disease appears to be mobilization of copper from tissues, but a secondary detoxifying action may come into play later.",,"Gibbs, K.;Walshe, J.

ABP and SEP were normal in another 3 symptom-free patients. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain lesions in 4 of 7 patients. Quantified rates of brain atrophy were unaffected by treatment.

711,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, most commonly manifests in adolescence and can present with a multitude of signs and symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irreversible damage to the liver and central nervous system. The diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy and quantification of copper in the tissues. Treatment is chelation of excess copper. If left untreated, Wilson's disease is fatal. [References: 25]",,"Woods, S. E.;Colon, V. F.",1989,Jul,,0,0,
712,[Copper],"Copper is an essential trace element for life. Four points are essential: copper combines with essential enzyme systems (oxidases, transaminases), copper is necessary for the inclusion of iron in the hemoglobin molecule, copper plays a key role in the metabolism of the hemoglobin molecule, Copper plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of collagen and elastin and some vascular diseases (aneurysms) are closely related to its deficiency. Finally, there is an increase in plasmatic copper during cancerous diseases, which is important even in early stages and is usually proportional to evolution.

713,Fulminant hepatic failure without evidence of cirrhosis in a case of Wilson's disease,"We treated a sixteen-year-old Japanese girl with fulminant liver failure in Wilson's disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made immediately after admission due to low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels with high urinary copper excretion. His liver failure was accompanied by episodes of hemolytic crisis. Despite administration of D-penicillamine and repeated plasmapheresis, he died four months later from liver failure. At autopsy, the surface of the liver was smooth. Liver histology showed massive necrosis. Only a few scattered hepatocytes remained, in which copper was revealed by rhodanine staining. There was no evidence of cirrhosis. The livers of previously reported cases of Wilson's disease accompanied by fulminant hepatic failure were all cirrhotic. Our case indicated that Wilson's disease could present as true fulminant hepatic failure without preceding neurological and hepatological signs and evidence of cirrhosis.

714,Wilson's disease presenting with features of hepatic dysfunction: a clinical analysis of eighty-seven patients.,"An analysis of the symptoms of presentation and evolution was carried out in 87 patients with liver-predominant Wilson's disease. In 30 patients, in whom the diagnosis was relatively quick, the response to treatment was excellent and all recovered, although two had severe hemolytic crises. The median age of onset was 11 years (range 5 to 22). Nine patients suffered toxic reactions to penicillamine and were then treated with trientine. In 22 patients, the diagnosis was made after the appearance of neurological symptoms; in 20 the signs of liver damage had disappeared despite the lack of treatment, but in two the liver signs persisted until they affected the central nervous system. In the 20 patients in whom signs of liver disease resolved spontaneously, there was a time interval of one to eight years before neurological signs developed. All 22 patients in a third group died of liver disease without central nervous system involvement. In 19 cases the duration of the disease was short and the diagnosis was made very late or at post-mortem examination. One patient survived with progressive chronic liver damage for 20 years; the diagnosis was also made at post-mortem examination. The mean age at death was 15 years. The diagnosis was made retrospectively in 13 patients who died. In two of these, the diagnosis was confirmed by determination of liver copper concentration in saved tissue at post-mortem examination; in the other 11 the diagnosis is probable since other siblings developed a similar disease, proven to be Wilson's disease. The age range for these patients was eight to 13 years. The duration of illness from onset to death ranged from nine days to four years (mean 10 weeks). There was no example of primary liver carcinoma in this series.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1989,Mar,,0,0,
715,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. SAW. Initial Treatment Studies,"Eleven patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease were treated with zinc acetate as their only anti-copper therapy. The duration of treatment was from 8 to 37 months. Three of the patients had symptoms; in eight who were presymptomatic, the diagnosis was made because the affected siblings had symptoms. All patients evolved well clinically. Copper absorption was suppressed, as reflected by the blockade of orally administered copper 64 absorption. 24-hour urine copper and plasma copper without ceruloplasmin (freely available copper) values were reduced. Serum liver-derived enzyme values were also generally reduced in patients who had pretreatment elevations. Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed initially and repeated in seven of the patients after 12 to 35 months of zinc therapy. In five of these patients, a second biopsy sample showed higher levels of copper than the first. In three of these five, a third biopsy 6 to 23 months after the second revealed liver copper values that had returned to baseline or were lower. The initial biopsy sample from one patient showed active inflammation, which subsided with therapy. All biopsies revealed histologic scarring typical of cirrhosis, and this did not appear to change during the course of therapy. We conclude that liver copper may temporarily increase during early zinc therapy, but that accumulated copper is sequestered in a non-toxic form. On the basis of animal studies, we postulate that this sequestered copper is primarily bound to zinc-induced high levels of hepatic metallothionein. Zinc appears to be a reasonable option for the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease, particularly those with presymptomatic disease.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Lee, D.

Report of a case and review of the literature,"Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a rare complication of D-penicillamine therapy. It has been reported to occur in Wilson's disease and cystinuria, usually after many years of high-dose therapy. We present a case of D-penicillamine-induced perforating elastosis serpiginosa with unique clinical features in a 10-year-old boy with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who received only 71 g of the drug for 9 months. The case is also unusual due to the short course and low cumulative dose of the drug received and the calcification of the elastic fibers. The calcification of the elastic fibers suggests that this case may represent an unusual variant of elastosis perforans serpiginosa or an overlap with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. All reported cases of D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa are reviewed and histopathologic and electron microscopic findings are presented. The theoretical mechanisms of action of D-penicillamine on the synthesis and morphology of elastic tissue are discussed. [References: 18]",,"Sahn, E. E.;Maize, J. C.;Garen, P. D.;Mullins, S.

719,"Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. V. Changes in serum levels of lipase, amylase and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease","We observed a frequent increase in serum enzymes amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease receiving zinc acetate therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc three times daily). Values are generally normal before the start of zinc therapy, rise slightly above normal after a few weeks of therapy, and stabilize in the high normal range after approximately one year of treatment. Very high doses of zinc (800 mg/day) produce a further elevation of serum lipase and amylase without the symptoms of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pathology studies in a zinc-treated rat model receiving doses equivalent to up to 25 times the effective dose in a human, which is based on milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight, reveal that zinc treatment does not induce lesions. in the pancreas. We interpret these findings to indicate that long-term zinc maintenance therapy does not present a risk of pancreatic damage in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Brewer, G.

Ceruloplasmin concentrations in the CSF of all patients were almost the same but lower than those of controls. CSF copper concentrations in patients without neurological signs were within the normal range, 22 +/- 6 ng/mL. In contrast, CSF copper concentrations in patients with neurological signs (69-98 ng/mL) were significantly higher than normal levels before and at the start of D-penicillamine treatment; gradually decreased in response to treatment. These results suggest that the appearance of neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease is not related to ceruloplasmin concentration in CSF. CSF copper concentration in this disease appears to reflect copper accumulation in the brain and may be useful as a marker to monitor therapy.",,"Kodama, H.;Okabe, I.;Yanagisawa, M.;Nomiyama, H.;Nomiyama, K.;Nose, O.;Kamoshita, S.",1988,Jan-Feb,,0,0,

Subsequently, an 18-month follow-up revealed no abdominal pain, with a repeatedly normal serum amylase level and a normal pancreas on ultrasound. Since abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom of Wilson's disease, this possibility should be considered in untreated patients.

Treatment complications did not directly involve the disease, but were related to the therapeutic agent penicillamine.

In case 1, the data and clinical course are presented in detail: prior to therapy, daily urinary copper excretion had been elevated, and it increased during the initial stages of treatment. Serum copper concentration, already low, decreased rapidly during the initial stages of therapy and remained at a low level during subsequent treatment. In contrast to its serum level, the CSF copper level was up to 3 times higher than the normal range and decreased very slowly as clinical symptoms improved. These findings suggest transport of copper from the CNS to the CSF.

We studied 11 patients who discontinued their own treatment after being successfully treated with penicillamine (1 to 2 g per day) for periods of 3 to 19 years. Eight died of hepatic decompensation or fulminant hepatitis after a median survival of only 2.6 years. In another 13 patients, the physician discontinued penicillamine due to serious adverse reactions. In these patients, penicillamine was replaced with trientine (1 to 1.5 g per day), a newer chelating agent. All but one of these patients (who died accidentally) are alive at the time of this writing, 2 to 15 years later. Our observations suggest that discontinuation of penicillamine in patients with Wilson's disease results in rapid clinical deterioration, which is often fatal.

The mean baseline liver copper concentration was 255 micrograms/g dry weight, while the mean value after treatment was 239 micrograms. No patient demonstrated hepatic reaccumulation of copper during zinc therapy. Copper balance, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and plasma copper concentration without ceruloplasmin indicated good copper control during zinc therapy. Hepatic zinc concentration doubled or tripled from baseline, but no toxicity was observed. Hepatic zinc concentrations appeared to plateau after 12 to 18 months of zinc therapy.

751,Hepatic distribution of copper and metallothionein in Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism characterized by Cu deposition in the liver, brain, and cornea. In this study, the levels of metallothionein (MT), Cu and zinc (Zn) were analyzed in the livers of two patients with Wilson's disease. An approximately 50-fold increase in Cu levels above normal controls was observed in both patients (160 and 298 micrograms/g wet tissue). About 73% of subcellular Cu was present in the cytoplasmic fraction and most of it was associated with MT. Analysis of liver levels of MT showed a 3-fold increase (863 micrograms/g wet tissue) over control human levels (321 micrograms/g wet tissue). The two forms of MT (MT-I and MT-II) were isolated from a liver sample. Both forms contained high amounts of Cu (11 to 12 g atoms/mol), indicating the saturation of MT that had only 2 to 3 g zinc atoms. The distribution of MT in hepatocytes was investigated by an immunohistochemical method. In tissue sections with minimal tissue damage, there was intense cytoplasmic staining for MT in hepatocytes, while both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were found in tissue sections with extensive necrosis and fibrosis.

In an attempt to develop a simpler and faster tool to assess the adequacy of zinc therapy, a technique that measures the blood absorption of a small oral dose of 64-copper together with copper balance was studied. The mean maximum 64-copper uptake in the blood of nine patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine, triene, or no medication was 6.04 +/- 2.74%, comparable to normal controls. Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment. The data demonstrate that prevention of blood copper uptake in patients with Wilson's disease by zinc therapy can be assessed by copper-64 uptake and that maximal uptakes of less than 1% occur in patients with balanced copper. neutral or negative.",,"Hill, G.

The copper content, which was determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the patient's liver, kidney, and brain tissues, was 28-fold, 38-fold, and 3.5-fold, respectively, compared to the control subject, who he was 5. one year old girl and died of cerebral palsy. Each tissue was homogenized in 3 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min to obtain the cytosol fraction. Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography of cytosols from Wilson's liver and kidney showed that most of the increased copper existed as Cu-thionein (Cu-Th), in contrast to a much lower level of Cu-Th in control liver cytosol and with no detectable amount of Cu-Th in control kidney cytosol. In addition, Zn-Th was also increased in Wilson's kidney cytosol, while it was decreased in Wilson's liver cytosol.

The compounds are novel in vitro enzyme inhibitors and have also been used therapeutically, apparently successfully, in the treatment of Wilson's disease.

The effects of CS2 toxicity observed in viscose rayon workers and experimental animals are remarkably similar to the clinical profile of our grain storage workers. The use of CS2 accounts for dysfunction of peripheral axons, the auditory nerve, the optic nerve, and the extrapyramidal system, as well as altered behavioral and cognitive changes. Signs and symptoms in these workers appear to be dose-related and we noted that workers separated from areas where fumigation took place reported improvement that was not seen by co-workers who continued routine fumigation treatment. Likewise, malting laboratory workers exposed only to grain dust from 3 to 7 years showed only minimal symptoms. Although several mechanisms for altered neuropsychological function have been suggested, the chelating capacity of CS2-derived DDC and its ability to markedly increase copper and zinc in the central nervous system suggests a mechanism of toxicity analogous to copper intoxication as in Wilson's disease. and may explain the production of extrapyramidal symptoms in these patients. Copper chelation could be therapeutic in CS2 poisoning. It is obvious that both basic and clinical research will be necessary to resolve the issues raised. We applaud the EPA's decision to ban the use of 80/20 fumigants as well as methyl bromide, and trust that similar toxicants will be carefully studied before being selected to replace these earlier toxicants. We further denounce the technique of reintroducing grain dust into the food chain instead of destroying it, as the dust contains a large amount of residual fumigant material. We speculate about the possible role of CS2 and other pesticides in the food chain and the incidence of parkinsonian symptoms in these patients and the general public.",,"Peters, H. A.;Levine, R.

775,"Of mice and men, metals and mutations","In the last 15 years, several mutations have been discovered that affect copper and zinc transport in humans and mice, joining the known alteration of copper transport in Wilson's disease. Menkes disease (classical and mild variant forms) and X-linked Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IX, X-linked cutis laxa) have features in common with each other and with mouse tabby (Mobr) mutants and spotted (Moblo), respectively. There may be an allelic series of mutants in each species or two loci may be involved in each. The toxic milk mutant (tx) in the mouse may be homologous to Wilson's disease in man. The intestinal zinc absorption defect in acrodermatitis enteropathica does not yet have a homologue in mice. However, the lethal milk mutant (lm) in the mouse may be homologous to a zinc deficiency condition described in a few breastfed low birth weight infants. It is possible that many more genetic defects in copper and zinc transport will be discovered. Rather, these mutants are valuable in elucidating normal copper and zinc transport processes.

776,Genetic diseases of copper metabolism.,"There are several known examples of mutations influencing copper homeostasis in humans and animals. Pleiotropic effects are seen when the mutant gene disrupts copper flux. In some cases, the mutation alters the level of a specific copper ligand (enzyme) and the clinical consequences are unique. The two most widely studied genetic diseases in humans are Menkes and Wilson diseases. Menkes disease is a deadly X-linked disorder in which copper accumulates in some organs (intestine and kidney) and is low in others (liver and brain). Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper accumulates, if left untreated, in the liver and later in the brain and kidneys. The pathophysiologic consequences of copper deficiency and toxicity characterize these two disorders. Specific mutations of human cuproenzymes include overproduction of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in Down syndrome, absence of tyrosinase in albinism, hereditary mitochondrial myopathy due to reduced cytochrome c oxidase, and altered lysyl oxidase in chromium-linked forms. X chromosome cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Mutations that alter copper metabolism in animals are also known. Several murine mutants have been studied. The most widely investigated mutants are spotted mice, particularly brindle mice, which have a mutation analogous to that in Menkes disease. Another recently described murine mutation is toxic milk (tx), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the liver. Two other mutants, wrinkled and trembling, were once thought to exhibit abnormal copper metabolism. Recent data has not confirmed this. A mutation in Bedlington terriers very similar to Wilson's disease has been described. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED IN 250 WORDS) [References: 31]",,"Prohaska, J. R.",1986,,,0,0,

Zinc deficiency is seen in acrodermatitis enteropathica and in premature infants born to women who appear to secrete zinc-deficient milk, as seen in lethal milk mice.

797,"Clinical, endocrinological and biochemical effects of zinc deficiency","The essentiality of zinc for humans was recognized in the early 1960s. Causes of zinc deficiency include malnutrition, alcoholism, malabsorption, extensive burns, chronic debilitating disorders, chronic kidney disease, certain diuretics, the use of chelating agents such as penicillamine for Wilson's disease and genetic disorders such as acrodermatitis enteropathica and sickle cell disease. The requirement for zinc increases during pregnancy and during the growth period. Clinical manifestations in severe cases of zinc deficiency include bullous-pustular dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, emotional disturbance, weight loss, intercurrent infections, hypogonadism in men, and is fatal if left untreated. Moderate zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation and delayed puberty in adolescents, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, poor appetite, mental lethargy, delayed wound healing, taste abnormalities, and abnormal dark adaptation. In mild cases of zinc deficiency in human subjects, we have observed oligospermia, slight weight loss, and hyperammonemia. Zinc is a growth factor. As a result of its deficiency, growth is negatively affected in many animal species and in man. Since zinc is required for protein and DNA synthesis and cell division, the growth effect of zinc is thought to be related to its effect on protein synthesis. Testicular functions are adversely affected as a result of zinc deficiency in both humans and experimental animals. This effect of zinc occurs at the end-organ level and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is intact in zinc-deficient subjects. Since zinc is intimately involved in cell division, its deficiency can negatively affect testicular size and thus function. In mice, the incidence of degenerated oocytes and of hypohaploidy and hyperhaploidy in metaphase II oocytes was increased due to zinc deficiency. Zinc at physiological concentrations reduced pituitary prolactin secretion in vitro and it has been suggested that this trace element may play a role in the in vivo regulation of prolactin release. Thymopoietin, a hormone required for T-cell maturation, has also been shown to be dependent on zinc. It is clear that zinc may have various roles in the biochemical and hormonal functions of various endocrine organs. Future research in this area is badly needed. [References: 78]",,"Prasad, A.

800,Trace Element Interactions: Clinical Significance,"We examined the interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. In sickle cell anemia, the usual situation is mild to moderate zinc deficiency due to renal zinc loss. Zinc deficiency appears to cause mild copper overload and an increased ceruloplasmin level, probably by increasing copper absorption. With zinc therapy, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc, when administered in a manner that ensures efficacy (without food), usually lead to copper deficiency. We have taken advantage of the copper-depleting effect of zinc to design a new therapy for Wilson's disease. Zinc, by inducing intestinal metallothionein, inhibits dietary copper absorption and inhibits reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, leading to negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are confident that zinc blocks copper accumulation in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, zinc therapy will become available as an approach to treat this deadly disease. Animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity when both elements are administered orally, presumably through the intestinal metallothionein mechanism. In preliminary experiments in rats, we have not been able to show that the toxicity of lead entering the body by a non-oral route is affected by oral zinc supplementation.

The presence of D-penicillamine, triethylenetetramine, or dimercaptosuccinic acid (0.3 mM) also reduced copper-induced hemolysis, while 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate increased cytolysis. N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at appropriate concentrations (1 mM), as well as chromic chloride (0.3 mM), reduced copper-induced hemolysis. Higher concentrations of NEM (2 mM) were ineffective. The results may provide useful suggestions on the clinical management of copper poisoning and Wilson's disease.

804,Methods for testing D-penicillamine in a clinical setting,"Penicillamine disulfides have been analyzed by automated amino acid analysis. Because the free thiol reacts poorly with ninhydrin, other detection methods are preferred, particularly high pressure liquid chromatography using an electrochemical detector or gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Pharmacokinetic studies using these techniques have now been reported. With patients on established penicillamine regimens, the concentration of free penicillamine in plasma has been found to vary between 4 and 20 microM depending on dose and time of administration. The disulfide concentration is greater than this by a factor of 3 or 4, and an even greater amount binds to plasma and tissue proteins.",,"Crawhall, J. C.",1984,,,0,0,

806,Myasthenia gravis induced by D-penicillamine in a patient with progressive systemic sclerosis,"The development of autoimmune diseases in some patients treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) suggests that the appearance of a conduction disorder at the neuromuscular junction and the development of reversible myasthenia gravis in rheumatoid disease, progressive systemic sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease Wilson after DPA use are part of a general predisposition to autoimmune disease related to DPA therapy. The reported case is an example. APD-induced myasthenia gravis (MG) is clinically and electrophysiologically similar to spontaneous MG, although ocular signs prevail in the former. Antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor have been demonstrated, and thymic hyperplasia has also developed. Regarding the appearance of myasthenic manifestations, the duration of treatment with DPA varies from 6 to 10 months. The action of DPA on the neuromuscular junction is different from that which occurs in spontaneous MG. The pathogenesis of DPA-induced MG is still obscure. The chemical properties of DPA allow it to react with many proteins and some alteration of proteins may appear, with structural changes in the composition and antigenicity of collagen fibers. In vitro DPA causes a disorder of the bridges of the acetylcholine receptor to the alpha, beta and gamma subunits with reduction of the SS bridges in the gamma subunit. This decreases the high-affinity bond and suppresses its positive cooperative system, reducing the SS connection in the alpha unit near the acetylcholine bond. The interaction between DPA and the receptor can induce antigenic alteration in the latter, initiating autoimmune phenomena. The other possibility is that stimulation of prostaglandin E-1 synthesis by DPA may fill the allosteric site of the ACh receptor, interfering with the neuromuscular junction.",,"Marchiori, P.

First, three types of preparations (osmium-Epon sections, glutaraldehyde frozen sections, and unfixed frozen sections) were compared to determine element detectability at the subcellular level. Glutaraldehyde frozen sections were satisfactory for copper, sulfur and phosphorus. Five patients (one patient with Wilson's disease, one with chronic cholestasis, one with chronic hepatitis, and two with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis) had copper-sulfur X-ray images consistent with hepatocellular lysosomes. Second, glutaraldehyde frozen sections were used for a study of copper deposits in the livers of patients. There was a significant correlation between the copper and sulfur contents in the lysosomes of all the patients studied, but there was no correlation in the rest of the cytoplasm. Zinc was not detected in lysosomes. Whatever the copper content in the lysosomes, the ratio of delta copper to phosphorus (w/w) to delta sulfur to phosphorus was 0.60. These data indicate that most of the lysosomal copper is bound to a thiol protein, probably metallothionein, in the liver.",,"Hanaichi, T.;Kidokoro, R.;Hayashi, H.;Sakamoto, N.",1984,Nov,,0,0,

Zinc acetate was administered every 4 hours during the day and the patient was not allowed to eat for 1 hour before and 1 hour after each dose. Oral zinc therapy, used in accordance with our regimen, can now be considered in the treatment of patients intolerant to penicillamine.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of oral zinc therapy in 4 patients with Wilson's disease who, over a 3-year period, took zinc as the only medication to influence copper metabolism. Physical examinations, oral 64Cu loading tests, plasma concentrations of copper, zinc, and ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper excretion were used to monitor the effect of therapy. The doses used ranged from 3 x 100 to 3 x 400 mg of zinc sulfate per day.

824,Biological functions of ionic zinc,"We tentatively conclude from our work that intracellular calcium acts as a second messenger to affect membrane function through calmodulin activation. This activation, if it is too great, leads to pathological phenomena of adhesion and aggregation of erythrocytes. We have shown that calmodulin inhibitors can prevent some of these calcium-induced abnormalities. Since some of this work involves a very specific anti-calmodulin antibody, it seems very likely that calmodulin is involved in the production of membrane effects. Zinc appears to act on the membrane in part, at least, through inhibition of calmodulin action. Our work leads us to believe that zinc regulates copper absorption in the gastrointestinal tract in a somewhat complex way. That is, direct zinc-copper antagonism within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is not adequate to explain the effects of zinc on inhibition of copper absorption in man. From our work it appears that tissues must be loaded with zinc before an effect on copper uptake is observed. This produces a lag effect during which zinc administration does not produce a negative copper balance. However, after this delay effect, zinc has produced a negative to neutral copper balance in 5 of the 5 patients with Wilson's disease studied. At this time, therefore, we believe that zinc therapy may be offered as an alternative to penicillamine therapy in previously undiscovered patients or patients who are not yet symptomatic. However, we recommend that this therapy only be used at this time in accordance with the zinc therapy regimen that we have tested. [References: 35]",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G. M.;Prasad, A.

We compared our observations with those of 3 control cases, selected for comparable age and with liver disease with no known association with cardiac degeneration. Our results revealed cardiac hypertrophy in 5 of 9 cases of Wilson's disease. There was evidence of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, intramyocardial small vessel sclerosis, and focal inflammatory cell swelling to varying degrees in all cases. One case had AV nodal degeneration and a 15-year-old boy had severe atherosclerosis of the left main coronary artery. Two patients died suddenly, presumably as a result of an arrhythmia; one of these patients presented the most marked myocardial alterations. We were unable to correlate these changes specifically with tissue copper levels, D-penicillamine treatment, or the presence of cirrhosis. We conclude that there are definite morphologic abnormalities in the hearts of patients with Wilson's disease consistent with cardiomyopathy. Although the myocardial changes were nonspecific, the fact that 2 patients died suddenly suggests the need for a prospective study of cardiac function in these patients in the future.",,"Factor, S.

834,"Zinc, the brain and behavior","The total zinc content in the adult human body averages nearly 2 g. This is about half the total iron content and 10 to 15 times the total body copper. In the brain, zinc meets iron, the most concentrated metal. The highest levels of zinc are found in the hippocampus in synaptic vesicles, buds, and mossy fibers. Zinc is also found in high concentrations in the choroid layer of the retina, which is an extension of the brain. Zinc plays an important role in axonal and synaptic transmission and is required for nucleic acid metabolism and growth and brain tubulin phosphorylation. Zinc deficiency has been linked to impaired DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis during brain development. For these reasons, zinc deficiency during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to be associated with many congenital anomalies of the nervous system in offspring. Additionally, in children, insufficient zinc levels have been associated with reduced learning ability, apathy, lethargy, and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc and vitamin B-6 and have excess lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease, and Pick's disease are brain disorders dynamically related to zinc levels.

The findings are described and discussed with particular reference to their value, both diagnostic and prognostic, in the management of this disease. The most common abnormalities were ventricular dilatation, 73 percent; cortical atrophy, 63 percent; brainstem atrophy, 55 percent. Characteristic hypodense areas in the basal ganglia regions were present in 45 percent and were almost invariably accompanied by one or more of the other CT abnormalities. This combination of findings is considered specific for Wilson's disease in the appropriate clinical context. CT abnormalities were more common and more marked in patients with a neurological presentation, with only 2 of 40 having a normal scan. Similar changes were also demonstrated in three quarters of patients with hepatic presentation and nearly half of those with presymptomatic presentation. Nineteen patients were examined on more than one occasion to assess the influence of treatment with penicillamine or triethylenetetramine on the changes initially recorded. Fourteen showed hypodensities of the basal ganglia at the first scan and in ten of them there was a moderate to marked improvement in this abnormality in response to therapy. Corresponding to this there was a considerable clinical improvement. Despite the findings of quite severe CT abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease. suggesting considerable neuron loss, patients will continue to respond well to treatment.

By analogy with Wilson's disease, copper retention has been suggested to be hepatotoxic in PBC, and this has been the rationale for the use of D-penicillamine in this disease. The hypothesis that copper is hepatotoxic in PBC has not been proven and in this study we have evaluated the role of hepatic copper retention in the pathogenesis of PBC. Sixty-four patients with PBC have been studied. Fifty-four had increased liver copper concentrations. The synthetic function of liver cells was well preserved. All patients had normal prothrombin times and only two had subnormal serum albumin concentrations. There was no correlation between liver copper concentrations and the degree of liver cell damage assessed biochemically (aspartate transaminase) and histologically. Electron microscopy was performed on liver biopsies from five patients with markedly increased liver copper concentrations. The ultrastructure of the liver cells was consistent with cholestasis. Liver cells contained electron-dense lysosomes, which were shown to contain copper and sulfur by X-ray probe microanalysis. The characteristic organelle changes associated with copper toxicity in Wilson's disease were not observed. The biochemical, histological, and histochemical differences between PBC complicated by hepatic copper retention and Wilson's disease indicate differences in copper management in these diseases.

855,Metabolism and pharmacology of D-penicillamine in man,"D-penicillamine is rapidly absorbed from the intestine and appears in plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine cysteine disulfide, and penicillamine disulfide. Penicillamine binds tightly to serum and tissue proteins. Urinary excretion of S-methyl-D-penicillamine, penicillamine cysteine disulfide, penicillamine disulfide, and a recently identified metabolite, penicillamine homocysteine disulfide, have been quantified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, cystinuria, and Wilson's disease. Fifty percent of an oral dose is excreted in the feces, but the metabolites have not yet been fully characterized. The pharmacological effects of D-penicillamine are associated with disulfide bond formation or cleavage, thiazolidine formation, and metal chelation.

Therefore, there is a need for effective and well-tolerated alternative chelating agents to control the copper accumulation that occurs in Wilson's disease and some other chronic liver diseases. A group of tetramines (linear and macrocyclic) were tested for cupruretic activity and compared to D-penicillamine. 2,3,2-tetramine was the most effective agent when administered by tube or intravenously. It was more effective than 2,2,2-tetramine (trien) or D-penicillamine and also induced a more prolonged cupruresis. Despite their higher formation constants for copper, the macrocyclic tetramines did not induce significant cupruresis. In this study, 2,3,2-tetramine was the most effective agent in inducing cupruresis in normal and copper-loaded rats. If well tolerated by humans, it could become a useful agent for the treatment of disorders characterized by copper accumulation.",,"Borthwick, T. R.;Benson, G. D.;Schugar, H. J.",1980,Apr,,0,0,

Chromatographic and uv/vis spectroscopic and electron spin resonance (esr) methods were used. The main species formed, at neutral pH and 0.15 mol dm-3 NaCl, is the violet species shown to have the same stoichiometry as the recently reported solid-state complex, i.e. [Cu8I Cu6II (Pen)12 Cl] 5- . It is shown that the formation rate of this species (MVC) depends on the Cu concentration, the Cu:Pen ratio, the relative concentration of Cl- ions, the pH and the temperature. The formation is inhibited by the presence of O2 and biological chelates. At concentration levels found in blood plasma, the MVC ion is unlikely to be of any significance in the therapeutic action of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease. The new examination of the Cu-albumin-pen aqueous system reinforces previous findings that the pen cannot mobilize Cu that is bound to albumin. Significant binding of the plume to the protein is observed which is not related to any copper ion bound to the protein. Evidence is presented that ternary complexes of the amino acid-Cu-Pen type can be formed in blood plasma. However, they are unlikely to be physiologically significant and Pen-induced copper depletion in Wilson's disease must be elsewhere than in the blood plasma compartment.",,"Laurie, S. H.;Prime, D.

The involvement of copper toxicity in the progression of PBC is supported by the observation that higher values occur in association with liver failure that occurs in the advanced stage. Corticosteroid therapy appears to decrease liver copper levels in PBC. Although this therapy does not invariably reduce hepatic Cu content in patients with PBC, it does so in many individuals. Therapeutic trials with d-penicillamine are underway. When the results are available, they will guide us in the management of individual patients with PBC.

Urine was collected for three periods after injection, from 0 to 8 hours, from 8 to 24 hours, at which time a test dose of penicillamine was administered, and from 24 to 30 hours. Stable (endogenous) copper was also estimated in these samples and specific activity was determined. This was multiplied by a correction factor to allow for variations in dose and body weight. Findings of stable copper in urine were largely predictable. Controls and heterozygotes had the lowest copper excretion, amounts increased in presymptomatic patients to a peak in symptomatic patients. Institution of therapy was associated with a time-proportional fall in copper excretion. The most important radiochemical findings were the following. Heterozygotes excreted less injected copper than controls both under basal conditions and after penicillamine. Presymptomatic patients excreted less radiocopper than heterozygotes after penicillamine, although excretion during the 24-hour baseline period was much higher. Patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease had by far the highest radiocopper excretion in all three time periods which decreased after treatment, proportionally with time, as had been found for stable copper. These results were subjected to computer analysis. There was no overlap between the various groups with the exception of a single control subject who had combined degeneration of the pyramidal and extrapyramidal system of obscure aetiology. This patient was classified by the computer study as ""heterozygous"". These findings further support the hypothesis that the loss of a single gene for copper balance can be detected with a high degree of accuracy and also that presymptomatic patients can be selected from a sisterhood for prophylactic treatment without the risk of subjecting healthy heterozygotes to unnecessary treatment. and potentially dangerous long-term therapy.",,"Gibbs, K.;Hanka, R.;Walshe, J.

893,Failure of L-dopa to alleviate activated rigidity in Parkinson's disease,"Stiffness in Parkinson's patients can be readily quantified by determining the net work required to passively flex and extend the forearm through a 100-degree arc. The stiffness measured in this way can be subdivided into two very different types, at rest and activated. Resting stiffness, measured while the patient is relaxed, responds to all effective therapeutic agents and correlates closely with the degree of clinical improvement. Activated rigidity, measured during voluntary activity, is not relieved by any currently available medical treatment. It remains unchanged from pre-therapy levels, even in patients who may temporarily appear to have dramatic improvement in clinical symptomatology. Longitudinal measurements performed on hundreds of Parkinson's patients at intervals ranging from 5 to 15 years show continuous high levels of activated rigidity throughout the study period. In marked contrast to our extensive experience with Parkinson's patients, there is a single, well-documented case of Wilson's disease that appears to have fully recovered both by clinical examination and by all of our mechanical measurements. This patient had high levels of extrapyramidal deficit, measured repeatedly over a four-month period when penicillamine therapy was investigated. Then he was suddenly back on track and back to work full time. High resting rigidity values activated resting rigidity, akinesia, and tremor all reverted to normal and have remained normal for the past 6 years. The implication of this study is that L-dopa and related treatments only mask the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and do not slow down the underlying disease process. Penicillamine, on the other hand, probably alleviates the destructive process in Wilson's disease and may, in early cases, permanently relieve extrapyramidal dysfunction.",,"Webster, D.

In acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that produces characteristic skin lesions, alopecia, and dystrophy, low concentrations of zinc are measured in serum, urine, and hair. Intestinal absorption of zinc is reduced. In copper metabolism, two hereditary diseases with low serum concentrations and, in general, of cerulosplasmin are known.

This was accompanied by acute renal failure. In the absence of sufficient renal function for urinary excretion of penicillamine, studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential of peritoneal dialysis, ultrafiltration-reinfusion removal of ascites, and hemodialysis as alternative excretory routes for copper. The largest amount of copper, judging by the increasing concentrations in the bath, seemed to be removed by hemodialysis. But this was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum copper concentrations with rapid clinical and biochemical deterioration leading to death within 48 hours. A small amount of copper was lost with removal of the ascites. Significant amounts of copper were removed during peritoneal dialysis (36 Âµmol/day (2287 micrograms/day)), although no clinical response was evident before hemodialysis was introduced. Administration of penicillamine by the oral, intravenous, or intraperitoneal route did not produce a measurable increase in copper excretion in peritoneal dialysis fluid. Therefore, peritoneal dialysis alone appears to offer the greatest potential benefit with respect to copper removal and alteration of the course of this fulminant form of Wilson's disease.",,"Hamlyn, A.

None of the five asymptomatic siblings of patients with known Wilson's disease had Kayer-Fleischer rings at the time of the initial study. In one (untreated) of the five, Kayser-Fleischer rings developed 20 months after the initial normal slit-lamp examination. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and the absence of other ophthalmologic signs (such as nystagmus, cranial nerve palsies, and other movement disorders) can be helpful in diagnosing Wilson's disease.

905,Ocular manifestations of Wilson's disease in Iran,"In the past 5 years, 25 proven cases of hepato-lenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) have been seen in Tehran University Affiliated Children's Hospital Medical Center. The disease manifested abnormal copper metabolism in the following aspects: (1) hypoceruloplasminemia present; (2) 24-hour urinary copper excretion was low; (3) tissue copper concentration was high; (4) Penicillamine treatment led to increased urinary copper excretion and generally relief of symptoms. The ophthalmologist cannot always help the pediatrician in the diagnosis, but fourteen of the 25 patients showed a Kayser-Fleischer ring and all of them were in the older age groups. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The incidence of Wilson's disease in Iran is high; (2) penicillamine treatment may be successful; (3) Any youth with renal, hepatic, or neurological disease of uncertain etiology should undergo a detailed ophthalmological examination.",,"Kashani, A.

906,The peroxisomes of human hepatocytes.,"In an ultrastructural study of human liver biopsy specimens, we found that peroxisomes are regularly present in normal human hepatocytes. Its relationships with the endoplasmic reticulum observed in other species and in other organs were also demonstrable in this material. Some normal peroxisomes were found to show marginal plaques or peripheral crystalline inclusions that were also present in pathological samples. In certain inherited metabolic disorders (Menkes steely hair disease, analbuminemia) the volume of individual peroxisomes appeared to be considerably reduced. But most of the pathological processes that affect hepatocytes seem to produce one or more of the following: increase in volume or number per cell, changes in shape, alterations in the consistency of the matrix, appearance of dense numbers per cell, changes of shape, alterations in the consistency of the matrix, appearance of dense inclusions or grouping of peroxisomes in some portions of the cytoplasm. Some of these abnormalities are reversible based on observations in three patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. The mean +/- standard deviation of the peroxisome diameters in four normal subjects was 0.618 +/- 0.143 mm. Significant decreases or increases in mean peroxisome diameters were observed in all but two of the 16 pathological samples. There were other morphological abnormalities present in the remaining two specimens. We conclude that various pathological processes involving the hepatocyte cytoplasm exert different effects on peroxisomes. Although no specific pattern of morphological alteration emerged from this exploratory study, a possible involvement of peroxisomes should be considered whenever metabolic or pathological processes affect the liver.",,"Sternlieb, I.;Quintana, N.",1977,Feb,,0,0,

Five of the patients had a mild bleeding tendency characterized by easy bruising. Moderate thrombocytopenia was observed in three of the five bleeders and in two of the others. One bleeder was thrombocytic and hyperfibrinogenemic. Bleeding times, platelet retention, and prothrombin consumption were rarely abnormal. However, 15 of the 16 patients had some abnormality in platelet aggregation: one when adenosine diphosphate was added to platelet-rich plasma, three when epinephrine was added, and the rest when collagen was added. Collagen abnormalities were late or absent aggregation (five patients, four of whom were bleeding) and absence of a change in shape (12 of 16 patients).

915,Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that usually affects young people. Excess copper accumulates in the tissues, mainly in the liver, brain and cornea. This copper deposition results in a wide range of liver and neurological symptoms and can lead to psychiatric illness. Liver involvement often occurs in childhood, while neurological deficits are usually detected at a later age. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Ocular findings are of particular importance because corneal copper deposition, which forms the Kayser-Fleischer ring, is the only pathognomonic sign of the disease. The structure of the ring and the presence of copper have been well established. An anterior capsular deposition of copper in the lens results in a characteristic sunflower cataract in some of these patients. Other ocular abnormalities have been described, but are much less common. The pathogenesis of the disease and the basic genetic defect remain obscure. It is clear that there is an excess of copper in the tissues, but the mechanism of its deposition is unknown. Somehow, it is associated with a failure in the normal synthesis of the copper protein ceruloplasmin in serum. Another theory suggests that an abnormal protein with a high affinity for copper may bind to the metal in tissues. The diagnosis can be suggested by the clinical manifestations and confirmed by the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring. In the absence of these findings, biochemical determinations are necessary. The most important are serum ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, and liver copper concentration on biopsy. Treatment consists of administration of the copper chelating agent, penicillamine, and avoidance of high copper intake. This generally results in marked clinical improvement if irreversible tissue damage has not occurred. Lifelong maintenance therapy is necessary to continue negative copper balance. Detection and prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic individuals with the disease is especially important. Seven cases of Wilson's disease have been presented to illustrate many of the features that have been discussed, with an emphasis on ocular findings.",,"Herron, B. E.",1976,,,0,0,

In the course of penicillamine therapy, the copper content in the liver decreases, but normal values are reached only after five or more years of treatment. Normalization of liver copper concentration clearly lags behind the clinical state. A clear improvement of the clinical state is already achieved after half to one year of treatment. The correlation between hepatic copper concentration and the amount of copper excreted in the urine is statistically significant before the start of treatment and also during the administration of penicillamine. Urinary copper excretion is a good indirect indicator of liver copper concentration.",,"Marecek, Z.;Heyrovsky, A.;Volek, V.",1975,Oct,,0,0,

All were symptom-free at follow-up. Compared with baseline biopsies (four patients), post-treatment samples showed a significant reduction in portal fibrosis (two patients) or no significant change (two patients); portal inflammation and necrosis were greatly diminished or absent in three. In none was there complete restitution of normal architecture. Three patients lacked initial biopsies. In these, portal cirrhosis, inflammation and necrosis, and hepatocyte fat vacuolization were present three, five, and seven years after initiation of therapy. Lipofuscin pigment was abundant in follow-up biopsies. The data demonstrate that morphological improvement is achieved in some patients with Wilson's disease who receive penicilliamine, but that this is not predicted by biochemical factors. Sequential biopsies are necessary to fully assess the degree of cure.",,"Grand, R. J.;Vawter, G. F.",1975,Dec,,0,0,

It is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations or deletions in ZEB2. Although no cutaneous manifestation of MOWS has been documented, we found for the first time that MOWS patients harbored hyperextensibility and fragility of the skin, being similar to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the skin of a MOWS patient revealed dermal collagen fibrils with markedly reduced diameters. To study the role of ZEB2 in collagenogenesis, ZEB2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were generated by crossing ZEB2<sup>phlox</sup>/<sup>phlox</sup> mice with Cre mice under the control of the prx 1 promoter. , to target the mesoderm. The newborn ZEB2 cKO mice were small and had abnormalities in the teeth and bone of the scalp. Notably, the skin of ZEB2 cKO mice appeared loose and hyperextensible, and histological examination revealed hypoplasia of the dermis. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that dermal fibroblasts (DF) from ZEB2 cKO mice expressed decreased collagen genes 1 and 3, but increased gene MMP13. Electron micrographs of the dermis of ZEB2 cKO mice showed collagen fibrils with abnormally small diameters, resembling those of a MOWS patient. Finally, ZEB2 cKO mice showed altered fibrogenesis by subcutaneous injection of bleomycin. These results suggest that ZEB2 contributes to de novo and induced collagenogenesis and, more importantly, that MOWS is relevant to a new subtype of EDS.",,"Teraishi, M.;Takaishi, M.;Nakajima, K.;Mizuno, S.;Hiraki, Y.;Fukada, T.;Shimoda, S.;Asada, Y.;Wakamatsu, N.;Furukawa, T.;Sano, S.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.08.416,0,0,
1108,Psychosis in Wilson's disease: an unusual presentation of bipolar affective disorder,"Psychosis is a rare but recognized symptom of the neurological effects of Wilson's disease [1]. We present the presentation of a 55-year-old woman, C, who is admitted after showing deteriorating mental status. On initial evaluation in the Emergency Department, security and police restrained her and her behavior was aggressive. She spoke in a low voice, manifesting paranoid persecutory delusions, euthymic with labile affect, alternating between anger and tears, and showed uninhibited affect, behaving frontally. She was completely lacking in insight. She was detained for an evaluation period under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 2007. C. had multiple prior admissions under the MHA. Previous primary diagnoses included Wilson's disease and bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). Secondary to his Wilson's disease, he had developed liver cirrhosis, abdominal varices, portal and pulmonary hypertension (WHO functional class II) with massive splenomegaly. She has a history of behavioral outbursts; acquire a forensic history for assault on staff, police, and family members, and drunken and disorderly behavior. In the weeks prior to admission, he stopped taking all of his medications, including penicillamine. A. Neurological examination showed ataxia with a broad-based gait and minor bradykinesia. C had no flutter tremor, dystonia, or myoclonus. All other findings on neurological examination were normal. He had a copper level of 1.7 Âµmol/L, ceruloplasmin of 0.04 g/L, and a bilirubin of 50 Âµmol/L. Complete blood count demonstrated pancytopenia, and prolonged blood work highlighted low calcium with vitamin D deficiency. A CT scan of the head showed hypodensity in the putamen, which was worse in the left. There was no evident mass, infarction, or infectious process to explain the lesions. This was consistent with a brain MRI performed several months before admission, which demonstrated hyperintensity of both putamines. Such changes are recognized to be associated with Wilson's disease [2]. These findings, along with C's behaviors indicative of frontal lobe involvement, suggested to the management team a diagnosis of psychosis secondary to Wilson's neurological disease. She was successfully treated with depot paliperidone (100 mg monthly), risperidone 4 mg ON, and penicillamine (750 mg BD) along with her usual medication for liver cirrhosis. To date, it remains stable and has not been readmitted. Brain MRI and CT scan findings coupled with C's long-standing Wilson's disease cast doubt on his diagnosis of BPAD. Upon review of the case note, his previous presentations had included behavioral and neurological examination findings consistent with neurological sequelae of Wilson's disease. Psychiatric symptoms within Wilson's disease are common, with one study finding that 20% of WD patients had seen a psychiatrist [3]. Predominantly, personality change and depression are typical features, with psychosis being a rare but recognized feature. Psychiatric symptoms are a recognized side effect of penicillamine, clouding the clarity of the diagnosis [1]. Reviews of the literature suggest that Wilson's disease may present with only psychiatric symptoms for many years before neurological or hepatic symptoms develop. Therefore, Wilson's disease should not be ruled out in unusual presentations of psychosis such as C.",,"Black, L. F.;Underwood, J. F. G.",2017,October,,0,0,
1109,Optical coherence tomography as a marker of neurodegeneration in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder that leads to pathological accumulation of copper in different organs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is proposed as a marker of neurodegeneration in many neurological diseases. Total retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning and macular thickness (Mth) examined by OCT was detected in WD patients, especially those with changes on brain MRI images. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between OCT parameters and the progression of neurological signs measured by the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) in WD patients. Consecutive WD patients admitted to the Department of Neurology underwent OCT to assess macular thickness and total RNFL. The patients also had neurological evaluations according to part III of the UWDRS. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (UWDRS+) and absence (UWDRS-) of neurological symptoms. Fifty-eight patients (34 women, 24 men) were enrolled. The mean duration of treatment was 9 years (standard deviation [SD], +/-10.8). The mean UWDRS score at the time of the study was 8.4 (range 1-52; SD +/-13.9) points. Total RNFL, as well as macular thickness, were significantly reduced in the UWDRS+ group versus the UWDRS- group. A significant negative correlation was found between OCT parameters (RNFL and Mth measurements) and neurological impairment according to the UWDRS scale. This study confirms that OCT may be a useful tool for measuring the degree of neurodegeneration in WD patients and may play a role in monitoring disease progression.

1110,Diagnosis and management of fulminant Wilson's disease: the experience of a single center,"Background: Medical therapy is rarely effective in patients with fulminant Wilson's disease (FWD). Liver transplantation is limited by the lack of a donated liver in most FWD patients at diagnosis. The New Wilson index, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), and the Child-Pugh score are useful tools for liver transplant decision-making; however, neither of them is a decisive stand-alone tool. It is worth exploring a more effective and practical therapeutic strategy and re-evaluating prediction systems for FWD patients. Methods: Nine patients with FWD associated with hemolytic crisis and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) were investigated. The clinical presentation, prognostic score and medical therapies of the patients were analyzed. Results: In 7 of 9 FWD patients who received the comprehensive therapy of corticosteroids, copper chelating agent (sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate), and therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE), 6 patients recovered from FHF. The remainder had improved on integrative therapy but died of sepsis 51 days later. Two patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) died of liver failure within three or five days of hospitalization without plasmapheresis or chelation therapy. All 9 patients with FWD presented with acute liver failure, severe jaundice, and mild to severe hemolytic anemia. No marked difference in the incidence of severe hemolytic anemia was detected between the surviving and deceased groups. However, the incidence and grade of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in the non-survivor group were higher than in the survivor group. Unlike the group of deceased, the group of survivors did not present complications induced by bacterial infection. Compared with the new Wilson index, the Child-Pugh score, and the MELD score, the variation in prothrombin activity (PTA) between the surviving and deceased groups was more evident. Conclusion: For patients with FWD, the episode of severe hepatic encephalopathy and/or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis indicates a worse prognosis, and PTA is a recommendable predictor. An emergency liver transplant should be considered for patients whose PTA is below 20%, or for those with severe HE or SBP. Comprehensive therapy of corticosteroids, copper chelating agent, and TPE is effective for patients without PAS and whose PTA is greater than 20%.

1111,Dystonic dysarthria in Wilson's disease: Efficacy of zolpidem,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by copper overload in the liver and brain. Neurological presentations are primarily related to copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom, with dystonic, spastic or parkinsonian components and is usually resistant to medical or voice rehabilitation therapies. We present the case of a patient with WD diagnosed at 12 years of age, who presented with severe and constant dysarthria of dystonic origin that did not respond to benzodiazepines and anticholinergics. When he was 25 years old, he tried zolpidem at bedtime for sleep difficulties and reported a paradoxical effect of this drug on his voice. To confirm the effect of zolpidem on his dystonic dysarthria, we performed a complete evaluation of his dysarthria at baseline without zolpidem and after 4 days of treatment with 10 mg twice daily. Lexical access was assessed by semantic fluency; dysarthria by the Intelligibility Score, spontaneous speech and reading rates, the maximum time of phonation in the sustained vowel [a] and by a perceptual evaluation. Two hours after taking zolpidem, improvement was observed in all the parameters tested, except for the maximum phonation time. Semantic fluency increased by 59%, spontaneous speaking rate by 88%, and reading rate by 76%. General dystonia remained unchanged and tolerance to zolpidem was satisfactory. Since then, the patient takes 5 mg of zolpidem five times a day and 4 years later shows a persistent improvement in oral communication and good tolerance to the drug. In this single case study, we demonstrated that regular daytime intake of zolpidem could have a persistent effect on complex dystonic dysarthria that was resistant to standard medical treatments.

1112,Oromandibular dystonia in Wilson's disease,"Background: Movement disorder is common in Wilson's disease (WD), but oromandibular dystonia (OMD) has not been reported. We report on the frequency, severity, and MRI correlation of OME in Wilson's disease with neurological manifestations (WDNM) and its response to treatment. Methods: Consecutive patients with WDNM were included and their clinical, hematologic, serum chemistry, and MRI findings were noted. Neurological severity of WD and OMD was assessed. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score for dystonia was noted. The patients were treated with penicillamine, zinc and multiple anti-dystonic drugs. Clinical improvement was observed at 3 and 6 months. Results: Overall, 61 of 67 (91%) patients with WDNM had OME, with a median age of 13.5 years. Median OME severity was 2.5 (range, 1-4). Thirteen patients were anarthric and 12 were unable to eat. OME severity correlated with drooling (r = 0.29, P = 0.02), BFM score (r = 0.63, P < 0.001), pancytopenia (r = -0.26, P = 0, 04) and serum ceruloplasmin (r = 0.33, P = 0.01), but not with the location and number of MRI lesions. Compared with baseline, OME severity improved at 6 months (P < 0.001), but not at 3 months. None became asymptomatic. The improvement in OME paralleled the improvement in WDNM severity grade (r = 0.26, P = 0.04) and with the BFM score (r = 0.31, P = 0.02). Conclusion: OME was a common manifestation of WDNM occurring in 91% of patients, and OME partially improved during the study period.

1114,Wilson's disease: What has been confirmed in diagnosis and therapy?. [German],"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of copper. Presenting a wide variety of phenotypes and therefore being a chameleon within the group of metabolic diseases, the multiple clinical symptoms of WD can include hepatic, neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Early-onset presentations in childhood and late-onset manifestations in adults older than 70 years have been described. If typical laboratory blood test values are missing, the diagnosis of WD can be difficult and often involves a combination of different parameters. New testing methods, such as the identification of relative exchangeable copper, have not yet been validated within a sufficient cohort of WD patients and thus do not currently play a crucial role within the clinical setting. Consequently, any patient with a reasonable suspicion of a diagnosis of WD should be presented to a gastroenterologist (pediatric) and/or neurologist (pediatric). Various medical treatments are commonly used in the clinical setting, including drugs such as copper chelating agents. Liver transplantation may be the last reason in selected patients. Dietary changes involving a low-copper diet play only a minor role. Because the use of tetrathiomolybdate is not yet approved, treatment of advanced and progressive neurological symptoms remains a significant challenge. In any case, lifelong medical follow-up and treatment by a specialist is absolutely essential. Early diagnosis and early, lifelong treatment lead to better prognosis and do not negatively influence overall life expectancy. Copyright Â© 2017 Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH",,"Pfister, E.

1115,"Evolving Perspectives in Wilson's Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up","Wilson's disease (WD), the autosomal recessive inherited copper overload disorder, remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In the last decade, direct sequencing of the affected ATP7B gene has become commercially available, but interpretation of the results still requires careful attention. Therefore, a combination of tests reflecting altered copper metabolism is needed to make the final diagnosis. Due to the low frequency of the disease, existing treatment concepts are not based on controlled trials. Here, recent results reports from larger cohort studies challenge recommended therapies and call for individualized treatment strategies.

1117,Significant heterogeneity in the diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease (WD): results from a large Spanish registry,"There are areas of uncertainty regarding diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies in patients diagnosed with WD, one of the few rare diseases in Hepatology. Our objective was to evaluate whether the approach to diagnosis and management of WD is homogeneous between centers in a large multicenter Spanish registry. METHODS: Descriptive observational study of the GEMHEP (Spanish Group of Women Hepatologists) in which clinical and analytical data were collected from 126 patients with WD followed up in 28 Spanish hospitals. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 20 (range: 1-74) years, 60% were men. The median follow-up (FU) was 16 years (1-44). The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (70%; median age: 18 years), followed by mixed (12%, median age: 33 years) and neurological (8%; median age: 23 years). In the remaining 10%, the diagnosis was made by family screening. Kayser-Fleisher ring and cirrhosis were present at the time of diagnosis in one third of cases. Discordant results regarding non-invasive laboratory diagnostic parameters were observed in 58% of cases; while ceruplasmin (CP) levels were reduced in 88% of cases, 24-hour cupruria was greater than 100 mcg/24 hours in only 43% of patients at diagnosis. Most of the patients underwent intrahepatic copper concentration with results compatible with WE in 79%. Genetic testing was performed in half of the patients with mutations compatible with WD found in the majority (83%). DP and Zinc (Zn) were the most common initial therapies, used as single agents in 76% and 18% of patients, respectively. Treatment was changed during follow-up in half of the patients at a median of 8 years, primarily due to change to Zn maintenance therapy (47%, median 7 years) or toxicity (39%, median 7 years). 2 years). ). Despite good adherence seen in 90% of patients, up to a third of patients had abnormal liver enzymes at the last FU visit. Overweight and hypertension were more frequent in these patients (p = 0.006 and 0.05). Additional data is being collected for a more comprehensive analysis of factors associated with non-normalization of liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Discordant results with respect to standard tests for the diagnosis of WD were common in our multicenter Spanish cohort. This variability may be due to the lack of reproducibility between laboratories, which makes it necessary to perform invasive techniques in a significant number of patients. Although most patients start treatment with PD, the norm is to switch to Zn due to maintenance and/or toxicity protocol. Complete normalization of liver enzymes was not achieved in a third of cases, perhaps due to unrelated causes.",,"Berenguer, M.",2017,October,,0,1,
1118,Clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a monocentric cohort from a liver referral center,"Introduction. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, leading to liver cirrhosis and neuropsychological impairment. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low frequency of the disease. Point. To determine the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a cohort of patients from a French liver referral center. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD, examined at a hepatic referral center, at Paul-Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France. The patients were evaluated clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Liver involvement was assessed with liver biopsy and/or measurement of liver stiffness. Results. We included in this cohort 107 patients with liver symptoms of WD, 54 (50.5%) women and 53 (49.5%) men, from 1974 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 15 years with extremes from 1 to 44 years. . Fifty-seven of 107 patients (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed neurological and hepatic symptoms) at admission. The mean age at diagnosis of WD was 20.1 (>10.54) years, with a difference between the age of the ""Liver Group"" for liver symptoms (17<=8.6 years) and the other group with neurological symptoms (23 >11.4 years) (p=0.0081). Sixty-five patients (70%) had liver pathology and 72 (67%) had liver stiffness measurement. Seventy-three patients (68%) had cirrhosis at diagnosis of the disease. Forty-three patients (76%) had cirrhosis among patients with mixed (neurological and liver) symptoms and 30 (61%) in patients with isolated liver symptoms. Thirty-four of 107 patients (32%) underwent transplantation, with a mean age of 27 (>12.2) years. Among the patients who required liver transplantation, 18 (52%) had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) severe neurological disease, and 5 (14%) liver cancer. Chelating treatment was very predominantly D Penicillamine, in 104/107 patients. A change in treatment was necessary in 37 (35%) patients due to adverse events to trientine or zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke and one after liver transplant due to severe neurological symptoms. Conclusion. At presentation of Wilson's disease, two-thirds of patients referred to a hepatology referral center had cirrhosis and one-third required liver transplantation. Cirrhosis is diagnosed in 76% of patients presenting with neurological symptoms of the disease. Although Wilson's disease can be a serious disease, the prognosis is good for patients cared for in a specialized center.",,"Sobesky, R.;Bello, M.

1119,Excretion of WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) after intravenous administration in rat models,"Background Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of toxic free copper (Cu). WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational Cu protein-binding agent in development for WD. WTX101 rapidly binds Cu, creating a stable tripartite complex of tetrathiomolybdate, Cu, and albumin. Our objective was to characterize the pathways and excretion rates of intravenous (IV) WTX101 for 168 hours after administration. Methods A single IV dose of WTX101 at 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg was administered to Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats (a model for WD) and Long Evans Agouti (LEA) rats (a control strain with metabolism of WD). Cu normal). WTX101 was measured as molybdenum (Mo) in urine, feces, and selected tissues collected over 168 hours. Results In the LEC WD rat model, WTX101 was partially excreted at 168 h. Up to 45% of the dosed Mo was recovered in the excreta: renal clearance accounted for up to 29% of the dose and biliary clearance around 16%. Mo appeared to be excreted in two phases: a rapid elimination during the first 48 h mainly in the urine and a slower faecal elimination still in progress at 168 h. In contrast, control LEA rats showed almost complete excretion of WTX101 within 168 h (87%), mainly through renal clearance during the first 24 h (79%). Considering only excreted Mo, the ratio of renal to fecal excretion was 9:1 in LEA rats, but 6:4 in LEC rats. In both LEC and LEA rats, urinary Mo corresponded to molybdate, the terminal degradation product of WTX101. Excretion and tissue distribution of Mo were similar for the two dose levels of WTX101. Differences in tissue Mo distribution in LEC versus LEA rats were only found for Cu-rich organs due to the WD phenotype: substantially more tissue Mo was found at 168 h in LEC liver (with 1.5 mg/kg : 31.5 vs. 5.6% of dose) and kidney (7.6 vs. 1.5% of dose) compared to LEA rats. Conclusion In the WD model, biliary Mo excretion of WTX101 was improved compared to controls, likely reflecting different biotransformation under normal and Cu overload conditions and is consistent with the proposed MoA of WTX101. In LEA controls, low amounts of Cu are available to bind tetrathiomolybdate, allowing a higher proportion of tetrathiomolybdate to be converted to the terminal degradation product, molybdate, which does not bind Cu and is excreted in the urine. In the LEC WD model, excess Cu is bound within a tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin complex that prevents tetrathiomolybdate from converting to molybdate and results in a lower urinary elimination rate and a higher fecal excretion rate. The different tissue distribution observed between the models is also consistent with the MoA WTX101.",,"Plitz, T.;Boyling, L.",2017,October,,0,0,
1120,Decompensated Wilson's disease: Advanced hepatic encephalopathy and high bilirubin decide the need for liver transplantation. Does the New Wilson index help?,"Background: The decision about liver transplantation is quite difficult in decompensated Wilson's disease (WD). The New Wilson Index (NWI), previously thought to be useful, now has conflicting reports about its effectiveness in predicting WD outcome. Methods: Of the 85 cases of WD, 74 were acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) or decompensated CLD (DCLD). They were managed with supportive care along with a combination of d-pencylamine and zinc salt. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplant or death) at any time during the hospital stay. Results: Of the total of 74, 46 (62.2%) improved with medical management and 28 (37.8%) died (21) or received a transplant (7) within 3 months after diagnosis. Jaundice was the presenting symptom in 100% of ACLF cases and in 13 (33.3%) of DCLD cases. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was present in 52 (70.3%) of 74 decompensated cases (ACLF or DCLD): 29 cases had HE grade 1/2 and 23 had HE grade 3/4. HE grade 3/4 was present in 19/35 (54.2%) of ACLF and 4/39 (10.2%) of DCLD and the difference was significant (OR 10.39 CI 95% 3.03-35, 5, p=0.00). Among those with a poor outcome, significantly (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.15-8.16, p=0.0031) higher proportions of ACLF (18 of 35, 51.4%) than DCLD (10 of 39, 25.6%) were present. Among those with a New Wilson index (NWI)>11 (33/74 cases), 12 survived and 21 had a poor outcome. Among the 28 with poor results, 20 had HE grade 3/4. Compared with univariate analysis of clinical and biochemical parameters to identify risk factors for poor outcome, HE grade 3/4 (OR 35.8 95% CI 8.58-149, p=0.00), bilirubin >20 mg/dl (OR 14.3, 95% CI 3.58-57.2, p= 0.000), ACLF as presentation (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.15-8.16, p=0.031), AST (Mean difference 160.8, 95% CI 64.8-256, p=0.001), INR (Mean difference 1.63, 95% CI 0.93-2.33, p=0.000), NWI (mean difference 5.37, 95% CI 3.67-7.08, p=0.00) and PELD/MELD score (mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2 , p=0.00), were significantly associated with a poor outcome (Table 1). The LRA model (HE grade 3/4, bilirubin >20 mg/dL, or HD score, NWI, or INR, or PELD) improved from 62.2% to 86.5% before and after model introduction. In AKI, a significant association with poor outcome was observed only with HE grade 3/4 (adjusted OR 37.8, 95% CI 7.68-186.49 p= 0.000) and bilirubin >20 mg/dl (adjusted OR 15, 5, 95% CI 2.7-86.8). p=0.002). Conclusion: HE grade 3/4 and elevated bilirubin (>20 mg/dl) are independently associated with the need for liver transplantation in decompensated WD. NWI did not show a significant independent association with the need for liver transplantation.",,"Alam, S.;Sood, V.;Khanna, R.;Lal, B. B.;Pawaria, A.",2017,October,,0,0,
1121,Epigenetic regulation of the thioredoxin system in an animal model and in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the copper transporter, ATP7B, which leads to copper accumulation in the liver and brain. Excess copper has been shown to cause oxidative stress and alter DNA methylation. We hypothesize that dietary supplementation with the methyl donor choline, alone or in combination with the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA), will alter hepatic expression of genes relevant to the oxidative stress response pathway known as the milk thioredoxin system. Jackson's toxic (tx-j) mouse model of WD. In addition, we studied the DNA methylation profile in whole blood in healthy and WD patients. Methods: Mouse fetal liver: Wild-type and tx-j mothers consumed a normal or high choline diet 2 weeks prior to gestation until embryonic day 17, at which time fetal livers were harvested. Liver from adult tx-j progeny: Mice were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment groups: 1) normal choline in mother and offspring; 2) high choline in the mother, normal choline in the offspring; 3) high choline in mother and offspring; 4) normal choline in mother, normal choline in progeny+PCA; 5) high choline in mother, normal choline in progeny+PCA; 6) high choline in mother, high choline in progeny+PCA. Livers were harvested at 24 weeks of age. Humans: DNA isolated from whole blood from 10 healthy patients (9M/1F) and 10 WD patients (9M/1F) was bisulfite converted and used to prepare Methyl-Seq libraries for sequencing on an Illumina 2500 HiSeq. Samples were matched for age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity, and all WD samples harbored the H1069Q mutation in the ATP7B gene. Results: Fetal liver transcript levels of the oxidative stress-related genes, thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), were lower in fetal livers from tx-j mice compared to wild-type mice, and normalized in tx-j livers after maternal choline supplementation. In 24-week-old progeny, liver transcript levels of Txn1 and Prdx1 were significantly higher (10-46% and 17-41%, respectively) in males and females who received maternal and continuous choline compared to all males. other treatment groups. PCA-treated males and females that did not receive choline after weaning had lower levels of Txn1 (23-31%) compared to untreated tx-j mice. The expression of the liver protein Txn1 showed the same pattern as the expression of the Txn1 gene. Of 40 Txn-related genes surveyed in human blood, 5 genes showed hypermethylation (7-28%) and 2 genes showed hypomethylation (5-6%) in WD patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Continuous maternal choline supplementation affects hepatic Txn1 transcript and protein levels in tx-j mice, and WD patients exhibit altered blood DNA methylation profiles of genes related to the Txn system.",,"Kieffer, D.

1122,An ongoing extension of a phase 2 study of wtx101 in newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class copper protein-binding agent that reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increases biliary copper excretion . In a phase 2 study, once-daily oral administration of WTX101 rapidly reduced and controlled NCC, improved disability and neurological status, and stabilized liver function in newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease (WD) after 24 weeks . Here, we present preliminary data from 24 to 48 weeks of the ongoing extension period. Methods: The 22 patients who completed the 24-week, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study elected to continue treatment with WTX101, with once-daily response-guided individual dosing. Key parameters reviewed from 24 to 48 weeks were change in copper-corrected NCC levels in tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes (NCC-corrected), liver status, neurological and disability scores using the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Unified Wilson (UWDRS) and security. Results: Patients (18 to 64 years of age, 45% male, 86% with varying degrees of neurological symptoms, and about 50% with cirrhosis at study entry) received WTX101 at a dose of 7.5 to 60 mg/ day once daily, with most patients receiving 30 mg/day. Between weeks 24 and 48, the corrected mean NCC remained controlled (0.9 muM at week 24 and 0.5 muM at week 48). Mean international normalized ratio, albumin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score improved or remained unchanged at week 48 compared to week 24, indicating stability of liver function. Reversible ALT elevations, seen in approximately 1/3 of patients before week 24, were not seen in the extension period. Patients showed continued improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (2.2 vs. 4.1) and neurological score (12.5 vs. 16.6) at week 48 vs. week 24. Overall, WTX101 it was well tolerated. Neutropenia, seen in one patient at week 36, normalized with dose reduction. One patient discontinued treatment due to her desire to conceive. One patient with a progressive course of the disease experienced neuropsychiatric deterioration despite ongoing treatment. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be well tolerated in WD patients beyond 24 weeks of treatment. Initial improvements in free copper levels and liver and neurological status were maintained or further improved by WTX101, suggesting that WTX101 may be an effective maintenance therapy for WD. These findings, along with its simple dosing regimen, indicate that WTX101 has the potential to address several unmet needs in the treatment of WD.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F.

1125,Unusual occurrence of de novo neurological disorders in Wilsonian siblings after orthotopic liver transplantation: a case report of three sisters.,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal disorder of copper metabolism that causes progressive liver cirrhosis, neurological deterioration and renal dysfunction. Although WD is rare in number, it accounts for 6% to 20% of emergency liver transplants (LT) due to its rapid deterioration. This study is to present two of three sisters with WD who developed serious neurological complications after orthotopic liver transplantation. Case presentation: Three sisters aged 28, 25, and 19 years who were known cases of WD cirrhosis and normal neurological status underwent deceased donor HT. While the first and third sisters developed new-onset severe neurological disabilities 6 and 8 months after transplantation, respectively, the second sister showed no symptoms. Pre-transplant brain MRI revealed hyperintensity in bilateral basal ganglia, particularly in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences for both involved patients. Ceruloplasmin, copper, and urinary copper excretion at 24 h at the time of diagnosis were 13 and 12.9 (mg/dl), 26 and 32 (Î¼g/dl), and 9 and 21.8 (Î¼g) for the first and third sister, respectively. Post-transplant neurological findings were ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypersalivation, and tremor. In addition, unilateral blepharoptosis was observed in the younger sister. Continuous administration of a chelating agent (mainly zinc sulfate) against copper toxicity was considered. Neurological symptoms improved significantly 6-8 months after transplantation. Conclusion: Although the published literature indicates that better pre-transplant conditions appeared to be advantageous for better outcomes in WD patients, close monitoring of neurological symptoms remains an important area during the long-term post-transplant course. Furthermore, as new-onset neurological disabilities are not expected in WD after LT, this phenomenon should be studied further in these siblings.",,"Aliakbarian, M.;Rezayat, K.

[Spanish],"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a rare inherited disease that usually affects the liver, but can present in different ways and have multiple systemic complications. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, mainly in young patients, and taking into account the main risk groups. Timely and adequate treatment is important to avoid complications. We present three cases of this disease in a family from Granada (Antioquia, Colombia), treated at a level III institution in Cali (Colombia). The index case debuted with a neuropsychiatric disorder, the second was diagnosed based on family history, and the third started with steatohepatitis.

1127,Hereditary multiple cerebral cavernous malformations associated with Wilson's disease and lipomatosis multiplex,"We present the case of a patient with 2 Mendelian diseases: symptomatic multiple familial cerebral cavernous malformations (FCCM) and Wilson's disease. Genetic analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CCM2 and CCM3 genes, associated with cavernous malformations, and a homozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene, responsible for Wilson's disease. FCCMs were symptomatic in 3 generations. The patient also had lipomatosis multiplex, which is suggested to be a familial syndrome. In recent years, there has been a growing number of publications relating CFSCs to other pathologies, predominantly extracranial and intracranial mesenchymal abnormalities. The present study is the description of an unusual association between 2 independent hereditary diseases of confirmed genetic origin, a combination that has not been previously described.

1128,Auxiliary Partial Orthotopic Live Liver Transplantation for Wilson's Disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disease that involves disturbances in copper metabolism that result in accumulations of copper, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson's disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption from the GI tract. Liver transplantation is the only treatment option for Wilson's disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with a Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without liver failure. Our recommendation is that these patients undergo auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurological disease associated with Wilson's disease who underwent successful ancillary partial orthotopic liver transplantation from a living related donor using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurological symptoms that included tremors when walking and speech problems and a low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dl, was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18 and the patient received chelation therapy. His liver functions were normal. The donor was the patient's father, aged 57, whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplantation, serum ceruloplasmin levels at day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasound showed normal vascular flow from the native and graft liver. The patient's neurological symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration without liver failure is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation; this procedure is suggested before symptoms of hepatic and neurologic failure of Wilson's disease occur.

The patient was treated with D-penicillamine for more than 40 years. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI revealed two nodules in segment 4 (S4) and 8 (S8) of the liver. The nodule at S8 was confirmed as moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma by directed liver biopsy. The biopsy sample from the non-tumor area showed mild fibrosis but the liver was not cirrhotic. Rhodanine staining and Berlin blue staining showed accumulation of copper and iron in hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma was successfully treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation.

1130,Was Cavum Septum Pellucidum the Cause of an Intractable Seizure in a 17-Year-Old Boy With Wilson's Disease?,"Background Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP), often found incidentally in some populations, occasionally becomes symptomatic if significantly enlarged. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital defect in copper metabolism characterized by abnormal accumulation of copper in various tissues, particularly the liver and brain. Seizure disorder, although rare in both CSP and WD, can occur in some patients with either condition. Description of the case We present the case of a 17-year-old boy, a patient with known WD, who developed intractable seizures for a year, which were not controlled with a large number of antiepileptic drugs. MRI showed enlargement of her preexisting CSP, which was small and asymptomatic at the time of WD diagnosis. His WD was in a state of remission when he developed the seizure disorder. On endoscopic fenestration of the cyst, she was seizure free. Conclusions Symptomatic CSP is a rare disorder, but the coexistence of WD is even rarer. Endoscopic cyst fenestration is a novel procedure that can be successful in properly selected cases. To the best of our knowledge, CSP associated with WD has not been reported in any English literature. We present this case due to its rarity together with a review of the relevant literature.

1131,Cholangiocarcinoma in Wilson's disease - A case report,"It has been suggested that hepatobiliary carcinomas are less common in Wilson's disease (WD) than in liver diseases of other aetiology. However, the protective role of copper against malignant neoplasms is debated. Only a few cases of cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) have been published in EW. Here we present the case of a 47-year-old male patient, homozygous H1069Q, with positive Kayser-Fleischer WD ring and low ceruloplasmin level who was followed and treated with chelating agents for nine years. The patient presented neurological symptoms and liver cirrhosis at diagnosis. Clinical symptoms regressed after initiation of treatment. Rapidly developing tumor metastases were found in the bones, lungs, and liver (no jaundice). Autopsy revealed cholangiocarcinoma as the primary tumor confirmed by strong CK7 positivity and glypican-3 negativity. The curiosity of the presented case is the very rapid development of CCC despite continuous therapy with chelating agents. Copyright Â© 2017, Romanian Society of Gastroenterology.

1132,Zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: multicenter study in Japan,"Background and objectives: The AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as a treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). However, there are some reports of zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD. Here, we aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children, <10 years of age, with asymptomatic WD in Japanese pediatric centers and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective and prospective study to examine 21 children (median age 6 years, range 1-9) who met diagnostic criteria for WD and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to symptom onset at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan. No additional sequelae of WD, such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities, were observed. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 1 to 7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. We performed an abdominal ultrasound and evaluated the clinical manifestations of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for patients <= 5 years was 25 mg twice daily; for those children 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the dose of zinc if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L, and decreased it if they had adverse effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At diagnosis, 24-hour urine AST/ALT and copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 Âµg/day (5.8+/-2.9 Âµg/kg / day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after treatment initiation and remained mostly below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST /ALT: 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/L at 1 and 7 years from the start of treatment, respectively). Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly to 49+/-21 cups/day (2.2+/-1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) at 6 months after treatment initiation and remained at mostly below 75 cups/day and between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study (2.2+/-0.6 and 1.5+/-0.2 cups/kg/day at 1 and 7 years after the start of treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD using zinc appears to be to maintain both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 ug/kg/day (and less of 75 ug/day).",,"Mizuochi, T.;Eda, K.;Takaki, Y.;Iwama, I.;Araki, M.;Inui, A.;Hara, S.;Kumagai, H.;Hagiwara, S.

1133,Liver transplant in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; a multicentric french experience,"Introduction. The standard treatment for Wilson's disease (WD) is a chelating agent of copper or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of immediate severe liver failure or severe worsening during treatment. The indication of HT in neurological forms without hepatic decompensation remains controversial. Point. The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of HT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods. This is a retrospective study. Between 2002 and 2015, seventeen patients underwent LT in France for serious neurological complications of WD without improvement despite medical treatment, without liver failure. All patients received copper chelation and 4 patients received copper chelation with zinc salts. Twelve patients presented worsening after the diagnosis of WD and 5 patients after a treatment interruption without improvement after a well-performed treatment. Disease severity was assessed with the Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS) before and after LT. Results. The main neurological symptoms combined dystonic postures (15/17), parkinsonian syndrome (9/17) and tremor (3/17). The mean age at diagnosis of WD was 17.9 [6-39] years and the time interval between worsening and LT was 12.6 [3-24] months. The mean age at LT was 20.2 [11-41] years. For all patients, an emergency procedure was necessary to access the transplant. All patients had cirrhosis after native liver analysis. The CHILD score was A for all patients at the time of transplantation. The mean follow-up time after transplantation was 51.8 [3-156] months. Survival was 84%, 75%, and 66% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. For patients who died after LT due to severe sepsis, after an interval of 16 [1.5-36]. All of these 4 patients had severe sepsis with a stay in the intensive care unit prior to LT. Twelve (70%) required nutritional support (gastrostomy or jejunostomy) and 9 (53%) tracheotomy in the context of swallowing disorders. All living patients showed improvement after LT. The mean UWDRS percentage improvement was 61.2% (+/-22.2). According to the percentage of improvement, 6 patients (35%) presented a significant improvement (>70%), 5 patients a moderate improvement (30% to 70%) and 2 (12%) a slight improvement (<30%). Conclusion. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in Wilson's disease for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with unfavorable evolution died due to severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms and previous severe sepsis represent pejorative factors.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Brunet, A.

1134,Copper and molybdate metabolism in newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease treated with WTX101,"Background and objectives WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational drug with a novel copper binding mechanism. WTX101 has a favorable stability profile. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of WTX101 on copper and molybdenum metabolism parameters in this phase 2 trial. Methods: 28 newly diagnosed adult patients with blood and urine WD copper and molybdenum parameters were followed during treatment. with WTX101. Results Urinary molybdenum excretion was robust, averaging 20% to 25% of the administered dose as early as 4 weeks after initiation of treatment, 24-hour molybdenum excretion ranged from 10 to 20 mmol. This demonstrated good drug absorption. Urinary molybdenum excretion as a percentage of the WTX101 dose was the same for 15 and 30 mg/d, but lower for the 60 mg/d dose, suggesting possible saturation of absorption at doses > 30 mg/d. . Molybdenum in urine was excreted as molybdate, the terminal degradation product of tetrathiomolybdate. 24-hour urine copper averaged ~4 mmol or 254 mg before treatment and decreased at week 12 and week 24. Total plasma Cu levels increased at baseline, based on tetrathiomolybdate redistributing Cu stores. liver in the blood forming a tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin complex. Levels decreased over time. Total plasma Cu levels closely followed total plasma molybdenum, consistent with the formation of tripartite complexes. At steady state, the vast majority of molybdenum in plasma was part of a tripartite complex, with trace free molybdate not bound to Cu. A correction factor was calculated for the proportion of Cu redistributed in the blood compartment per mole of Mo, which allowed the determination of free copper. Free Cu evaluated as Cu without ceruloplasmin (NCC) adjusted for molybdenum decreased with time. Summary Administration of WTX101 was accompanied by a strong urinary excretion of molybdate demonstrating good absorption of the drug. Urinary copper excretion decreased over time in parallel with decreases in plasma free copper, corrected for NCC molybdenum. Total plasma Cu levels followed total plasma molybdenum, reflecting the redistribution of hepatic Cu and the formation of a tripartite complex in the blood. Conclusion WTX101 redistributes hepatic Cu in the blood as a tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin tripartite complex. The drug that does not bind to Cu is excreted in the urine as molybdate. Urinary copper excretion parallels improvement in copper metabolism and may be a useful marker to follow in WD patients treated with WTX101. WTX101 is a novel agent for the treatment of WD, and a better understanding of the relationship between molybdate and copper metabolism is important to optimize treatment and follow-up.",,"Askari, F.

1135,Wilson's disease: sex-specific changes in methionine metabolism and mitochondrial function in a mouse model,"Background and objectives. Women with Wilson's disease (WD) present acute liver failure more frequently than men, while men present neurological involvement more frequently than women. Although these findings have been attributed to hormonal factors, gender differences could be related to epigenetic mechanisms and their relationships with mitochondrial function. The aim of the present study was to determine whether parameters of methionine metabolism and mitochondrial function are different by gender in an animal model of WD. Methods. Tx-j mice, a model of WD (n = 9 males; n = 8 females) were sacrificed at 24 weeks of age to study differences in transcript levels of genes related to methionine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. . LC-MS directed metabolomic analysis was performed on plasma samples to compare acylcarnitine profiles. An additional group (n=4 men; n=4 women) was treated with oral D-penicillamine (PCA) for 12 to 24 weeks to compare gender-related responses to copper chelation. Results. Men had worse liver inflammation than women (1.6 +/- 0.6 vs 0.9 +/- 0.32; p<0.05), steatosis was similar and mild, and there was no fibrosis. Liver levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) were lower and S-adenosylhomocysteine were higher in men with a consequent lower ratio of SAM to SAH (2.2+/-0.7 vs 2.8 +/-1; p<0.05), an indicator of global DNA methylation potential. Transcription levels of DNA methyltransferases 1 (Dnmt1) were higher in women and Ndufab1 and Atp5j, related to mitochondrial complex I and complex V respectively, were lower in men. Metabolomic analysis revealed a higher amount of 14:2 unsaturated acylcarnitine and 12:0 saturated acylcarnitine in women compared to men. PCA reduced liver copper levels by half in males, but was not effective in females. Histological response to PCA was similar in both sexes and there were no changes in SAM and SAH levels in response to PCA. Among women, Dnmt1 transcript levels were significantly reduced after PCA, in association with higher levels of 10-acylcarnitine, indicating less overall improvement in mitochondrial function. Conclusions. Male and female WD mouse models differ based on parameters of methionine metabolism, mitochondrial function, and response to copper chelation treatment. These data provide insight into the gender differences observed in WD patients and indicate the need to adjust chelation therapy according to gender differences.",,"Medici, V.;Shibata, N.;Kharbanda, K.

1136,"An Ongoing Phase 2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of WTX101 in Newly Diagnosed Wilson's Disease Patients","Background and objectives WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational drug with a novel copper-binding mechanism, being tested in an ongoing prospective study to assess safety and efficacy in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) newly diagnosed. Methods Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD older than 18 years and treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for <= 2 years with chelation or zinc therapy initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD, and after 6 weeks, dosing was guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. . Periodic evaluations included safety, liver disease status, neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and parameters of copper metabolism. Results Twenty-eight patients have been enrolled in the study. At trial entry, most patients received no treatment or were treated for <= 28 days with WD therapy, with only 5/28 receiving treatment for > 90 days. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 mM), 25/28 had neurologic manifestations at baseline, and mean UWDRS part III was 22. Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5. Adverse events (AEs) included reversible liver elevation. tests (n=5, of which 3 were related to per protocol dose escalation) and neutropenia (n=2). After the starting dose was reduced from 60 mg daily to 15-30 mg once daily and the dose increase was limited to 60 mg once daily, WTX101 was well tolerated with few adverse events. Liver status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable in all patients. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over time on treatment. Other measurements of Cu (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) indicate a similar pattern of copper elimination. UWDRS Part III scores were greatly improved in patients with neurological manifestations or remained stable in those without. Daily activity status (UWDRS part II) showed a similar improvement. Summary WTX101 appears safe and well tolerated as initial therapy in patients with WD. Improvements in liver and neurological disease, Cu metabolism, and daily activity status were observed over time with WTX101 treatment. More data is accumulating. Conclusion Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to establish its safety and efficacy for the initial treatment of WD. The potential for once-daily dosing will increase patient comfort and adherence to treatment.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F. K.;Ferenci, P.;Ala, A.;Czlonkowska, A.;Nicholl, D.

1137,Usefulness of serum zinc level to predict the severity of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. Zinc (Zn), a copper antagonist used as treatment in WD, can inhibit copper absorption in the intestine by upregulating metallothionins (MT). However, there has been no study of the link between Zn and the severity of WD. Our objective was to evaluate the serum Zn level in a variety of liver diseases and to study its correlation with the new Wilson's Index (WI) score (1) used to predict the severity of WD. METHODS: Medical records of 26 patients with WD (8 WD with acute liver failure (ALF) and 18 WD-non-ALF) and 69 patients without WD (31 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 29 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and 9 undetermined cause of ALF), who had baseline serum Zn data before disease diagnosis, were reviewed at our tertiary hospital from 2005 to 2015. All children with WD had identified disease-causing mutations and the new WI score was calculated. in all. Corrected Zn was calculated using corrected Zn<inf>patient</inf> = (0.25xZn<sup>normal</sup>) + ((albuminalbuminnormalpatient)x( Zn<inf>patient</inf> - (0, 25xZn<sup>normal</sup>)).The correlation between the corrected Zn level and the new WI score was statistically analyzed by Pearson's correlation RESULTS: WD-ALF had a lower corrected Zn level compared to WD-non-ALF, NAFLD, AIH and undetermined cause of IHA (7.3 (5.2-11.6), 13.8 (6.1-20.2), 13.7 (11.2-16 .7), 9.9 (5.3-31.4), and 11.4 (7.6-17.8), respectively, P < 0.05).Demographic data and laboratory results are shown in In fact, there was a significant correlation between corrected Zn level and new WI score in WD patients (r = -0.554, P value = 0.004).Conclusions: Serum Zn level can predict severity In particular, a low serum Zn level can discriminate WD-ALF from an undetermined cause of ALF.(1) Dhawa n A, Taylor RM, Cheeseman P, et al.

1139,Liver transplant in Wilson's disease with neurological deterioration: evaluation in 4 patients,"Background: The objective of this work is to report our first experiences on the benefits of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of persistent neurological symptoms in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: We describe our findings in 4 WD patients with neurological deterioration or symptoms treated with HT: 2 patients underwent transplantation due to worsening of neurological symptoms despite adequate long-term medical treatment. The other 2 required LT due to symptoms associated with liver failure. Patients were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale and the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: All 4 patients experienced neurological improvement after LT. The Rankin score pre-LT of the 2 patients transplanted due to neurological deterioration was 4 versus 3 and 2, respectively, post-LT. The pre-LT Rankin scores of the 2 cases of WD transplanted for liver failure were 1 and 2, respectively, versus 0 in both post-LT cases. The UWDRS score improved in 2 cases and remained stable in 1 case with less severe deterioration. Brain MRI abnormalities were shown to be partially reversible in 3 patients and stable in 1 patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that LT could be considered for patients with WD with neurological deterioration. Â© 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.",,"Laurencin, C.;Brunet, A.

Objective: To study the efficacy of Penicillamine followed by Zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD in whom disease severity scores (Child's, MELD, Nazer's, and nNew Wilson iIndex) and 24-hour urinary copper at 3 data points were compared. three times at presentation, at transition from penicillamine to zinc, and at the end of follow-up. Results: Of the 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD studied, 10 had neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with WD. Penicillamine was changed to zinc sulfate due to financial constraints (in 28 patients) or due to adverse effects of penicillamine (in 33). Child's grade was A in 6 six patients, B in 5 five, and C in 17 at presentation (baseline). The duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, median (range) and of subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer, nNew Wilson index, Child and MELD scores) on transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement was maintained until the end of the study period. 17 Seventeen patients with Child C cirrhosis at presentation were treated with penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks followed by zinc for 344 (41-652) weeks, of whom 15 had significant improvement in liver function and disease severity scores up to the end of follow-up. 3 Three of the 31 study patients died at 284, 112, and 437 weeks. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in a resource-limited setting for patients with symptomatic hepatic WD in all degrees of initial disease severity. Our data also suggest that some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease can be managed with medical treatment, avoiding liver transplantation.",,"Gupta, P.;Choksi, M.;Goel, A.;Zachariah, U.;Sajith, K.

1141,Psychiatric comorbidity in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a relatively rare autosomal recessive hereditary disorder that causes copper accumulation in different organs, mainly the liver and brain. Psychiatric disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic problem in WD. A relevant article search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar, for articles focusing on psychiatric disorders in WD published between 1985-2016. Ninety-two articles were included in this review, showing the findings of 35 observational and case-control studies and 57 case reports. This study discussed the findings on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in WD, their impact on the lives of those diagnosed, and the efficacy of available treatments on psychiatric outcomes in WD. It is confirmed that psychiatric disorders are common in WD, with a high prevalence of mood disorders, and contribute to poorer quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Because specific therapies for WD lead to good life expectancy, medication adherence and clinical management should be justified by a multidisciplinary approach, including careful hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric evaluation and education of those affected and their families.

1143,Yeast as a model for the identification of new survival-promoting compounds applicable to the treatment of degenerative diseases,"Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in the development and normal metabolic functioning of organisms. Excessive cell death is the cause of many degenerative diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and Wilson's disease, for which current therapies remain insufficient. Current therapies focus primarily on lessening disease symptoms after cell death, rather than blocking the cell death process itself. The latter can be obtained by decreasing the presence of the toxic trigger (such as protein aggregation in the case of many commonly known neurodegenerative diseases) or by blocking the signaling cascade(s) that induce death. Given the high conservation in PCD processes between yeast and mammalian cells, in this review, we will focus on yeast as a model organism to study PCD-related diseases, as well as its use for drug discovery purposes. More specifically, we will provide a comprehensive overview of new compounds, which have been identified in yeast-based drug screens, that decrease the number of toxic triggers or inhibit PCD signaling cascades under PCD-inducing conditions.

1144,Pathological fracture of the femoral neck that led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease: a case report and review of the literature,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. It has mainly hepatic, neurological and ophthalmic manifestations. Although osteoporosis, rickets, and early arthritis are common features of WD, they are not well recognized. Musculoskeletal manifestations very rarely lead to the diagnosis of the disease. Below we present the case of a 12-year-old girl who consulted for a pathological fracture of the neck of the femur of 3 months' evolution. The diagnosis of WD was made by investigating the cause of the pathological fracture, which was managed by performing a conventional McMurray intertrochanteric osteotomy. At 6-month follow-up, the fracture had healed and the patient was able to walk with support. WD can be a rare cause of pathologic fracture. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with a pathological fracture who present with associated neuropsychiatric or hepatic manifestations.

1146,The plausibility of maternal exposure to toxic substances and nutritional status as factors contributing to the risk of autism spectrum disorders,"Recent research suggests that the maternal environment may be especially important for the risk of developing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, maternal infections, micronutrient deficiencies, obesity, and exposure to toxic substances are likely to interact with genetic risk factors to disrupt fetal brain development. Objectives: The objective of this article is to investigate the plausibility of maternal exposure to toxic substances and nutritional status as causal factors in the development of ASD. Methods: This article reviews current research investigating the hypothesis that maternal exposure to toxic substances and prenatal micronutrient intake are important modifiable risk factors for ASDs. Results: Zinc, copper, iron and vitamin B9 are identified as specific micronutrients with relevance to the etiology of ASD. Specific toxicants induce a maternal inflammatory response that leads to fetal micronutrient deficiencies that disrupt early brain development. Importantly, maternal micronutrient supplementation is associated with a reduced risk of ASD. In addition, animal studies show that micronutrient supplementation can prevent the teratogenicity and developmental neurotoxicity of specific toxicants. Discussion: These findings lead to the hypothesis that maternal infection, obesity, and exposure to toxic substances (eg, valproic acid, endocrine-disrupting plasticizers, ethanol, and heavy metals) are environmental risk factors for ASDs leading to to fetal micronutrient deficiencies as a result of a maternal inflammatory process. response. It may be possible to use markers of inflammation and micronutrient status to identify women who would benefit from micronutrient supplementation or dietary interventions to reduce ASD risk. However, more research is needed to demonstrate a causal role for fetal micronutrient deficiencies and to clarify the underlying mechanisms that contribute to ASD.

1147,6-year-old boy with Wilson's disease-A diagnostic dilemma,"6-year-old boy presented with a 2-month history of progressive abdominal distention and jaundice. He was profoundly jaundiced with ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy. Viral markers and slit-lamp examination for the Kayser-Fleischer ring were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper 24 hours after challenge with D-pencylamine were normal. Anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive 1:20, and liver biopsy showed micronodular cirrhosis with abundant hyaline and copper-stainable Mallory deposits. Liver histology was indicative of Indian childhood cirrhosis, while the presence of autoantibodies, elevated transaminases, and increased globulin suggested autoimmune hepatitis. Genetic studies identified the p.R969Q mutation in the ATP7B gene, which resolved the dilemma and confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD).

1148,Copper(I) binding properties of anti-copper drugs for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the P-type copper ATPase, ATP7B, which transports copper out of cells and is therefore crucial for copper excretion. bile from excess copper. WD is characterized by toxic accumulation of copper primarily in the liver and brain, leading to liver disorders and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unlike many other genetic disorders, WD is treatable, mainly through copper chelation therapy, which mobilizes copper from the body, improving its urinary excretion. Although several drugs are currently available to remove copper, their binding affinities for Cu(I) and their interaction with essential cellular copper proteins have not been quantitatively characterized to date. Using an ESI MS-based approach, we have determined the Cu(I) binding affinities of five of the major drugs discovered: penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate, and tetrathiomolybdate, by exploring its ability to extract Cu(I) ions from two cellular Cu(I) binding proteins, which have different Cu(I) binding affinities. We report that the Cu(I) binding affinity of decoppered drugs varies by four orders of magnitude and depends on the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule. The structure-activity relationships obtained are important to understand the action of copper chelating drugs and the development of new generation drugs that can provide better therapeutic results.",,"Smirnova, J.;Golendukhina, E.;Jarving, I.;Tougu, V.;Plitz, T.;Palumaa, P.",2017,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14174,0,0,
1149,Characterization of ZEB2 enhancers during brain development,"Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB2) is a transcriptional repressor that is an essential regulator of the nervous system during development. Heterozygous de novo mutations in ZEB2 are associated with multiple neurological defects, including Mowat-Wilson syndrome, due to haploinsufficiency of ZEB2 expression during development. Therefore, mutations in ZEB2 enhancers that regulate its neuronal expression could give rise to a similar phenotype. However, enhancers of ZEB2 have yet to be characterized. Using enhancer-associated ChIP-seq data, we identified 13 sequences in the Zeb2 locus that might function as neuronal enhancers during development. Using the zebrafish enhancer assay, we characterized nine neuronal enhancers, where four function as notochord enhancers and two function as neuron-specific enhancers. Interestingly, the four notochord enhancers that drove a similar GFP expression pattern have no sequence homology, prompting us to further determine the transcription factors that activate these enhancers. We found the TF repertoire likely to regulate the activity of these enhancers that are required for spatiotemporal expression of ZEB2 during neuronal development. The characterized enhancers shed light on the mechanism of action of ZEB2 regulation and may serve as potential sequences that should be screened for mutations in patients in whom no mutation was found in the ZEB2 coding region.",,"Bar Yaackov, R.;Birnbaum, R.",2017,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14174,0,0,
1150,Iron and copper in fetal development,"Copper and iron are essential micronutrients. Because they can accept and donate electrons, they are critical to many energy-dependent chemical reactions. For example, copper is a fundamental part of the enzymes ceruloplasmin, hephaestin, and zyklopen ferroxidases, as well as enzymes such as dopamine-beta-monoxygenase, while iron is part of the catalytic site of many cytochromes and enzymes involved in the desaturation of iron. fatty acids. Therefore, as expected, copper and iron deficiency, especially during pregnancy, when cell proliferation and differentiation are very active, suboptimal nutritional status can have serious consequences. These problems can persist into adulthood, with an increased risk of mental problems such as schizophrenia and, at least in animal models, hypertension and obesity. In this review, we consider what these problems are and how they can arise. We examine the role of copper and iron deficiencies separately during fetal development, in terms of birth outcome, and then how problems with in utero status may have long-term sequelae for offspring. We examine several possible mechanisms of action, both direct and indirect. Direct causes include, for example, reduced enzyme activity, while indirect causes may be due to changes in cytokine activity, reductions in cell number, or increased apoptosis, to name just a few. We examine a very important area of nutritional interactions between micronutrients and conclude that while we have made significant progress in understanding the relationship between micronutrient status and pregnancy outcome, much remains to be learned.

There are numerous diseases caused by protein misfolding, mainly due to mutations in the respective gene. The consequences of this misfolding may be that proteins effectively lose their function, either by being removed by the cellular quality control machinery or by accumulating in the wrong intracellular or extracellular location. A number of mutations that cause protein misfolding and impair trafficking to the final destination, for example, cystic fibrosis, Wilson's disease, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1, result in proteins that retain partial function if its folding and trafficking is restored by molecular or pharmacological methods. it means. In this review, we discuss several mutant proteins within this class of misfolding diseases and provide an update on the status of molecular and therapeutic developments and potential therapeutic strategies being developed to counteract these diseases.

1153,The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism, arising from a mutation in the ATP7B gene. The diagnosis of WD is usually established by blood tests and clinical findings. In this case report, our aim was to emphasize the contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of WD, as well as treatment monitoring. A 19-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of progressive dysarthria and nocturnal tremor in her right hand. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria, postural and action tremor, and motor weakness in the lower limbs. The EEG was normal. Kayser-Fleischer rings were observed bilaterally. The results of the blood tests were as follows: serum ceruloplasmin 16.3 mg/dL (normal: 25-63 mg/dL), serum copper level 32 mg/dL normal: 70-140 mg/dL) and excretion of 24-hour urine copper 56.5 mug/day (normal 24-hour urinary excretion 20-50 mug/day) Abdominal ultrasound revealed heterogeneous hepatic echogenicity with a suggestion of superficial nodularity. The cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal high T2 signal in putamine, dorsal midbrain and pons. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Treatment with trientine and zinc was started. After one month of therapy, the patient was reassessed. There was a significant decrease in tremor with functional motor gain. Repeat MRI showed a significant decrease in previously detected signal abnormalities. Result: The MRI findings faithfully reflected the clinical response to therapy. Conclusion: Although it is not a primary diagnostic tool in WD, MRI can be useful both to establish the diagnosis and to document the response to treatment.",,"Ozturk, O.;Ozturk, S.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00234-017-1872-5,0,0,
1154,Thrombotic microangiopathy in the setting of systemic diseases: four cases from pediatric clinical practice,"Introduction: Thrombotic microangiopathies result from the interaction between predisposing factors and triggering events. Material and methods: We present four pediatric cases with unusual forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in the setting of systemic diseases. Results: Case 1: 5 years old, acute pancreatitis with complement activation and HUS triad (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure). Early treatment with eculizumab results in rapid hematologic and renal remission. MRI shows anatomical variant (pancreas divisum) associated with a high risk of spontaneous pancreatitis. Recurrence of pancreatitis in treatment with Eculizumab, without signs of TMA. Genetic analysis shows risk haplotypes in CHF, MCP, and CFHR3-CFHR1 deletion. Did pancreatitis trigger aHUS or vice versa? Case 2: 2 years old, M5 acute myeloid leukemia, after haploidentical BMT, complete chimerism. After BMT, he develops transfusion-dependent anemia, malignant hypertension, and proteinuria. Transient stabilization after suspension of cyclosporine. Progressive disease with a two-fold increase in creatinine, renal biopsy shows MAT. In treatment with Eculizumab normalization of blood pressure and renal function, without proteinuria. Hemoglobin recovery, without the need for transfusions. Material for genetic study from saliva (donor blood cells), pending results. Case 3: 15 years old, previously healthy, presents with cholestasis and HUS triad. Ocular evaluation shows the Keyser-Fleischer ring. Urine copper and low ceruloplasmin confirm a diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Hemolytic anemia only improves with Trientine treatment. Progressive recovery of hemoglobin and renal function. Marked activation of complement, CFB-Antibodies and variant CFHR5. Case 4: 10 years old, Wilson's disease. Three years after liver transplantation, he presents with HUS-triad in the setting of a viral infection. Recovery after discontinuation of treatment with Tacrolimus and Everolimus. Carrier of CHR1 and 3 homozygous deletions. Conclusions: These cases illustrate the relevance of considering TMA in diseases not related to aHUS in which complement activation and endothelial damage can be triggers or consequences of complement activation.

1155,Canine Copper Associated Hepatitis,"Copper-associated hepatitis is being recognized with increasing frequency in dogs. The disease is characterized by centrilobular hepatic copper accumulation, leading to hepatitis and eventually cirrhosis. The only way to establish the diagnosis is by histologic evaluation of copper distribution and copper quantification in a liver biopsy. Treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine is the most widely used treatment. In addition, a low-copper/high-zinc diet may help prevent hepatic copper accumulation or reaccumulation. Mutations in the copper metabolism genes COMMD1 or ATP7A and ATP7B have been associated with hepatic copper concentrations in Bedlington terriers and Labrador retrievers, respectively. In the Labrador Retriever, dietary copper intake is a major contributor to the disease phenotype.

1156,Zeb2 recruits HDAC-NuRD to inhibit Notch and controls Schwann cell differentiation and remyelination,"The mechanisms that coordinate and balance a complex network of opposing regulators to control Schwann cell (SC) differentiation remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor homeobox 2 (Zeb2, also called Sip1) that binds to the zinc finger E-box is a critical intrinsic timer that controls the initiation of SC differentiation by recruiting histone deacetylases HDACs 1 and 2 (HDAC1 /2) and nucleosome co-repressor complexes of the remodeling complex and deacetylase (NuRD) in mice. Zeb2 deletion arrests SCs in an undifferentiated state during peripheral nerve development and inhibits remyelination after injury. Zeb2 antagonizes inhibitory effectors including Notch and Sox2. Importantly, genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals a Zeb2 target gene encoding the Notch Hey2 effector as a potent inhibitor of Schwann cell differentiation. Surprisingly, a genetic variant of Zeb2 associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome disrupts interaction with HDAC1/2-NuRD and abrogates Zeb2 activity for SC differentiation. Thus, Zeb2 controls SC maturation by recruiting HDAC1/2-NuRD complexes and inhibiting a Notch-Hey2 signaling axis, pointing to a pivotal role for HDAC1/2-NuRD activity in peripheral neuropathies caused by ZEB2 mutations.

Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with a dysfunction of copper metabolism due to mutation of the ATP7B gene. WD presents with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmic, and other manifestations. Neurological symptoms include parkinsonism, dystonia, and ataxia. The clinical course is highly variable and delay in diagnosis is not uncommon. Diagnosis of WD is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests when genetic characteristics are available. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent or minimize permanent neurological complications. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of WD followed up at the INCN (Movement Disorders Unit and Neurogenetics Research Center). Demographic and clinical data, as well as biochemical parameters (especially serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper excretion); neuroimaging and specialized consultations were extracted from the medical records. Local institution IRB approval was obtained for this study. Results: Eight of the 19 identified patients were included in the study. 87.5% (7) were male. Our WD patients had a mean age of 26 [17-44] years and a mean age of onset of 23.7 [12-44] years; the mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 20.3 [3-72] months. Parkinsonism was the predominant phenotype in this group, and together with dysarthria were the two most frequent symptoms at baseline (37.5%). The Kayser-Fleischer ring was confirmed in 62.5% (5) of the patients. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration was 12.5 mg/dl [2.3-23.4] and the mean 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 109.6 ug/24 hours [33.2-278]. The most common finding on brain MRI was changes in signal from the putamen (50%), followed by the thalamus (37.5%). 87.5% (7) of the patients started treatment shortly after diagnosis and 75% (7) received penicillamine therapy. Conclusions: This is the first series of cases on WD in the Peruvian population. The cases of WD in our Peruvian cohort seem similar to those described in other populations; however, the delay in diagnosis is higher than others reported worldwide.",,"Sarapura, E.;Ramirez-Quinones, J.;Cornejo-Olivas, M.;Torres, L.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26972,0,1,

Here, we present the case of two clinically distinct presentations of acquired copper deficiency syndromes secondary to five years of excessive use of zinc-containing denture adhesives: myeloneneuropathy and severe macrocytic anemia and neutropenia. Methods Extensive laboratory tests and histological evaluation of the liver and bone marrow were required to rule out other pathological processes and establish the diagnosis of copper deficiency. Results Initial presentation was a myelopathy involving the posterior columns. Serum and urinary copper decreased significantly and serum zinc increased. At the second presentation (five years later), multiple hematologic abnormalities were detected. Serum copper decreased again, while serum zinc increased. Conclusions Zinc overload is a preventable cause of copper deficiency syndromes. This rare entity presented here highlights the importance of patient as well as provider education.

1162,Drosophila melanogaster models of metal-related human diseases and metal toxicity,"Iron, copper and zinc are essential transition metals for life because they are necessary in many biological processes. Organisms have evolved to acquire metals from nutrition and to maintain adequate levels of each metal to avoid the harmful effects associated with their deficiency, excess, or misplacement. Interestingly, major components of metal homeostatic pathways are conserved, and many orthologs of human metal-related genes have been identified and characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila has gained recognition as a useful model for studying human diseases, including those caused by mutations in pathways that control cellular metal homeostasis. Flies have many advantages in the laboratory, such as a short life cycle, easy handling, and inexpensive maintenance. Also, they can be bred in large numbers. In addition, flies are highly valued because they offer a considerable number of genetic tools to address some of the unresolved questions related to disease pathology, which in turn could contribute to our understanding of metal metabolism and homeostasis. This review recapitulates the metabolism of the main transition metals, namely iron, zinc and copper, in Drosophila and the usefulness of this organism as an experimental model to explore the role of metal dyshomeostasis in different human diseases. Finally, a summary of the contribution of Drosophila as a model for testing metal toxicity is provided. Copyright Â© 2017 by the authors.

1164,Supply of copper chelating agent (TETA) to the central nervous system using surface-modified liposomes,"The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) complicates the treatment of many central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including the copper storage disease Wilson's disease. His CNS symptoms represent a serious problem, as therapy for Wilson's disease does not cross the BBB. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is the transfer of drugs through the BBB with colloidal transport systems such as liposomes. The aim of the present study was to encapsulate triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper chelating agent, in surface-modified liposomes and to investigate its permeation through the BBB. Liposomes were modified with cationized bovine serum albumin or penetratin, a cell-penetrating peptide. Liposomes were characterized for size, PDI, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency. The size was between 139.4 +/- 1.9 nm and 171.1 +/- 3.5 nm with PDI below 0.2. The zeta potentials of the vectored liposomes were at least 6.9 mV higher than those of the standard liposomes. Cryo-TEM micrographs showed the liposomal structure, integrity, and similarity in structure and size between loaded, unloaded, vectored, and non-vectored liposomes. In vivo experiments in rats showed up to 16-fold higher brain uptake of TETA in vectored liposomes compared to free TETA or TETA in non-vectored liposomes, demonstrating successful delivery to the brain using targeting surface modifications. . Tissue analysis indicated that TETA concentrations in the brain were high enough to treat Wilson's disease.

1165,Chelation in metal intoxication-Principles and paradigms,"This review provides an update on the general principles for the investigation and use of chelating agents in the treatment of metal poisoning. The clinical use of the older EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate) and BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) chelators is currently limited due to the inconvenience of parenteral administration, their own toxicity, and the tendency to increase the neurotoxicity of various metals. The hydrophilic dithiol chelators DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercapto-propanesulfonate) are less toxic and more effective than BAL in the clinical treatment of heavy metal poisoning and are available in capsules for oral use. . In copper overload, DMSA appears to be a potent antidote, although d-penicillamine is still widely used. In iron chelation, thiols are ineffective, since iron has a higher affinity for the ligands than nitrogen and oxygen, but the new oral antidotes for iron, deferiprone and desferasirox, have entered the clinical field. Comparisons of these agents and desferrioxamine infusions are in progress. The general principles for the research and development of new chelators are briefly described in this review.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical records was carried out between December 2010 and May 2015 in the Gynecology and Obstetrics and Gastroenterology services, including pregnant women diagnosed with chronic liver disease prenatally or during pregnancy. Results: The frequency of chronic liver disease in pregnancy was 50 among 10,823 deliveries (0.4%). Twenty-six women with chronic liver disease had 50 pregnancies during the study period. Fifty percent of the women had cirrhosis. Maternal complications occurred in 22% of the study group. Variceal hemorrhage occurred in 4% and hepatic decompensation occurred in 16%. There were two maternal deaths (4%). Obstetric complications such as preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, and puerperal infection occurred in 18, 14, and 18%, respectively. Abortion occurred in 34%, 55% in cirrhotics and 4.8% in non-cirrhotics. The live birth rate of 76% was significantly higher (p < 0.014) in the non-cirrhotic group compared to the cirrhotic group. Conclusion: Pregnancies in chronic liver disease are associated with a high rate of abortions.

We present the case of a 19-year-old woman who received a liver transplant for acute liver failure secondary to Wilson's disease, who developed headache as the only symptom of a serious neurological complication after transplantation. The clinical course and neuroimaging demonstrating aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are presented. Neurological complications and difficulties of medical management in an immunosuppressed patient are discussed. Headache in a recent transplant patient for acute liver failure may be a sign of a serious brain complication, subarachnoid hemorrhage.

1171,"Late-onset Wilson disease, dementia, Ekbom and Whittera syndrome","Objective: The objective of this study is to describe a patient with late-onset Wilson's disease, dementia and Ekbom syndrome. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which causes impaired biliary excretion of copper and its accumulation, first in the liver but ultimately in the brain and other tissues. Ekbom syndrome is characterized by a firm conviction on the part of the patient that he is infested by parasites that emerge from the skin, mouth, eyes, or genital region. Methods: We present the case of a patient with an atypical presentation of Wilson's disease with Ekbom syndrome. Results: A 69-year-old male with chronic liver disease referred to the Neurology group to investigate cognitive impairment, mostly executive complaints and episodic memory deficits of 3 years of evolution. Neurological examination showed only wing tremor. At follow-up, the patient worsened and became agitated, aggressive, and confused. After 6 months he began to say that there were bugs moving on his skin, which were not observed by his relatives. Subsequently, he developed extrapyramidal signs, with bradykinesia and muscle rigidity. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Total serum ceruluplasmin was low on 2 occasions: 6.9 and 11. Ophthalmological evaluation showed Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and D-penicillamine was started, with no clinical response. Conclusions: Ekbom syndrome is normally related to psychiatric conditions or dementia, but its presence should lead to suspicion of other neurodegenerative disorders since it can present before other classic signs. Although late-onset Wilson's disease is rare and does not usually present with early dementia, it can have an atypical course. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of dementia, especially as it is potentially treatable if diagnosed early.",,"Germiniani, F.;Marques, P.;Zorzetto, F.;De Oliveira, L.;Teive, H.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,0,
1172,Disappearance of clinical and imaging manifestations in Wilson's disease after controlled therapy with tetrathiomolybdate and zinc,"Objective: To present a case with Wilson's disease (WD) whose neurological and imaging alterations disappeared after controlled therapy with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (AT) and zinc acetate (Zn). Background: Treatment of Wilson's disease remains a challenge for clinicians. A strict control of the different copper pools is necessary. Methods: Case report. Therapy control formula: ""Free"" serum copper (FC) = total serum copper - (serum ceruloplasmin x 3). Copper removal status: CF <10mug/dL. Copper deficiency: HR <5mug/dL Results: A 25-year-old woman presented with a rapidly progressive tremor with severe functional impact lasting 1 year. He had asymptomatic chronic liver disease without portal hypertension. Physical examination: Bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings and tremor at rest in both upper limbs, both proximal and distal, of moderate amplitude. Most significant tremor in both upper limbs appeared within a few seconds after taking any antigravity stance, or simple action (""wing slam"" tremor). Once it appeared, it was of increasing amplitude, and spread to the entire body, trunk, head and lower extremities. It would only disappear if he returned his upper limbs to the resting position. Occasionally, dystonic posturing of the right hand was observed. No other anomalies. Investigations: Normal serum copper, elevated 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum ceruloplasmin. Normal liver function tests. She was compound heterozygous for the p.L1305P and p.H1069Q mutations in ATP7B. Brain MRI prior to treatment (Figure 1A): bilateral and symmetric hypointensity in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and hyperintensity in the putamen, lateral thalamus, central pons, and dorsal midbrain. She was initially treated with D-penicillamine, Zn and vitamin B6, with worsening of neurological symptoms and poor tolerance. D-penicillamine was withdrawn and AT was started. She had a spectacular improvement 15 days after starting treatment, being asymptomatic at 4 months. It reached the state of uncoppering 7 months after the start of the TA and was eliminated, leaving only maintenance Zn (FC 5-10mug/dL). A brain MRI 4 years after treatment was normal (Figure 1B).

Conclusions: The association of AT+Zn as initial therapy and Zn as maintenance therapy was effective in controlling Wilson's neurological disease, through strict control of the different copper pools.",,"Posada, I.;Garfia, C.;Ostos, F.;Ramos, A.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,0,
1173,"WTX101, a Novel Copper-Modulating Agent for Wilson's Disease, Demonstrates Efficacy and Safety in an Open-label, Multicenter, Phase 2 Study","Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 treatment for 24 weeks in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational first-in-class copper-modulating agent for the treatment of WD. Although WD therapies are available, there are significant unmet medical needs regarding efficacy, side effects, and treatment convenience. Methods: WD patients older than 18 years, treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for = 2 years with chelation or zinc therapy, initially received 15 or 30 mg WTX101 once daily. After 6 weeks, dosing was individually guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. Assessments included copper control, neurological and disability status using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), liver status, and safety. Results: Twenty-eight patients entered the study. Mean baseline non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.6 muM) and 23/28 had neurological manifestations (mean UWDRS Part 3 score of 22.8). The primary endpoint of copper control was met in 79% of patients (p<0.001). The mean reduction in NCC levels was 77% (p<0.0001). Both neurological status (p<0.0001) and disability (p<0.001) improved as measured by UWDRS Parts 3 and 2, respectively. In addition, liver status, as measured by the modified Nazer score, stabilized or improved in most patients. WTX101 treatment was generally well tolerated and most reported adverse events were mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 2). Reversible elevations in liver tests were observed in 39% of patients and these elevations were generally mild to moderate, asymptomatic, and normalized with dose adjustments. No initial drug-induced neurological worsening was observed upon initiation of WTX101 treatment. Conclusions: Once-daily treatment with WTX101 has the potential to rapidly reduce and control free copper and improve neurological status and disability in patients with WD. Furthermore, WTX101 was generally well tolerated and no cases of neurological worsening were observed when starting WTX101. Along with its simplified dosing, WTX101 has the potential to address unmet needs at WD. Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to establish its safety and efficacy for the treatment of WD.",,"Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Askari, F.;Bronstein, J.;Czlonkowska, A.;Ferenci, P.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

1174,"Neurological worsening in patients receiving treatment for Wilson's disease: frequency, causes and results","Objective: To study the pattern of neurological worsening (NW) in patients undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WD is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment consists of copper chelation and can reverse neurological disability and prevent disease-related mortality. However, some patients develop worsening neurological signs during treatment. This may be drug-induced, or due to noncompliance, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or emergent psychosis.a, b Methods: Between 2005 and 2016, we prospectively recruited 120 consecutive patients who visited our Wilson disease clinic. and we monitor your neurological disability during treatment. using Level 2 of the Global Assessment Scale for Wilson's disease (GAS for WD).b All received penicillamine (125-2000 mg/day) except 5 who were on trientine (300-1800 mg/day). Results: Among the 120 patients (72 men; 48 women) we observed 64 cases of WN in 44 patients (30 men). The first signs of WN were irritability or worsening dysarthria, Wilson's facies, or Kayser-Fleischer rings. Noncompliance with treatment was the most common cause and was observed in 16 patients during the intensive early phase of copper chelation and in 18 patients during the maintenance phase. Most of these patients dropped out of treatment multiple times. Drug-induced NW was observed in 12 patients; 11 with penicillamine (mean dose 900 mg; range 750-1750 mg) and 1 with trientine (900 mg). The time between the start of treatment and NW varied widely (mean 2.8 months, range 0.5-14 months). In 10 patients, this worsening was reversible for a mean period of 1.2 months (range 0.5 to 4 months) with a brief reduction of the drug. However, in two it led to long-term disability. NW due to disease progression was seen in four patients within the first few months of starting treatment and improved with ongoing copper chelation. Emergent psychosis and intercurrent illnesses explained 11 and 3 cases of WN, respectively. These also improved with continuous chelation. Conclusions: NW is seen in more than a third of patients undergoing treatment for WD, with noncompliance being the most common cause. Monitoring of neurological disability using the GAS scale for WD makes it possible to detect such worsening, identify its cause, and respond appropriately (encouraging compliance, reducing the dose, or continuing the course of treatment).",,"Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,1,
1175,Follow-up of liver steatosis and fibrosis in children with Wilson's disease by transient elastography (Fibroscan),"Objectives and study: Liver involvement in children with Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fibrosis. Pharmacological treatment aims to preserve liver function and improve the clinical status of patients. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens, France) has already been applied in many chronic liver diseases for non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis. Our aim was to assess the change in liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis and selected laboratory markers of liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease using Fibroscan. Methods: We included 33 children (19 women) with a mean age of 11.5 years with Wilson's disease, treated with zinc or d-penicillamine. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded. At baseline and after a median period of 1.5 years, all patients underwent median probe Fibroscans (M) to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter, CAP). At the same time, repeated laboratory tests of liver function were performed. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Results: At the start of the study, our patients had liver enzymes ALT-49.5U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26U/I (19.5-35.5) slightly elevated and well preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial Fibroscan examination showed a normal mean liver stiffness of 4.4 kPa (M probe) (4.0-5.4) and slightly elevated hepatic steatosis CAP-257dB/m (235-283) [middle, lower and upper quartile ]. After a period of 1.5 years, we found a decrease, but not statistically significant, in ALT, AST, and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than the reference results (p = 0.02). Similarly, we have not observed a marked difference in hepatic steatosis (PAC) or liver stiffness by Fibroscan when comparing baseline and repeat measurements. Conclusion: 1. Liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis do not appear to improve significantly in the short-term follow-up observation period of children with Wilson's disease, as measured by Fibroscan. 2.

1176,The first study on the prevalence of Wilson's disease in the Portuguese population,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder responsible for an abnormal deposition of copper in the tissues. The global prevalence is estimated at 1:40,000, although recent studies suggest a possible underdiagnosis. There is a lack of studies on epidemiological information on WD in Portugal. The main objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of the disease. The secondary objectives focused on a descriptive analysis of the main clinical, pathological and biochemical characteristics of the course of WD in this population. Methods: The study design was retrospective and included WD patients of all ages, observed between 1995 and 2015, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months and confirmed to have been born in the northern region of Portugal. Patients were identified using the clinical coding system of the Portuguese National Health Service based on clinical data from thirteen Portuguese hospitals, histological evaluation of liver biopsy, and hospital prescription records. Statistical analysis was performed to establish possible clinical-analytical correlations through the chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Friedman and Wilcoxon U tests. Results: We identified and collected clinical data on 94 patients with WD, six of whom died. The prevalence of WD in the last 20 years was 1:37,000 with a current prevalence of 1 per 45,000 inhabitants and an incidence of 1 per million people/year. The age of pediatric presentation was 55.8% with a median age at diagnosis of 16.6 years (12.3-20.8) and male gender in 53.2%. The mean follow-up was 15.2+/-8.8 years. Predominant liver disease was the most frequent form of presentation in 54.8%, with 37.0% of these presenting cirrhosis; mixed neurological/hepatic symptoms in 17.9% and predominant neurological presentation in 10.7%. Neurological symptoms were associated with a later onset of the disease (p=0.001) and a greater presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (p<0.001), detected in 27.0% of all patients. Liver transplant was performed in 23.9%. Regarding therapy, penicillamine was the most used, with adverse reactions observed in 24.8% and trientine in 41.0% of patients at some point in the disease. A significant reduction in hepatic hepatic enzymes was observed at 6 and 12 months after starting treatment (AST: p=0.002; ALT: p=0.002), which was not observed in urinary copper excretion. Conclusion: This study constitutes a further step in a better understanding of the epidemiological, clinical and disease management of WD in the northern region of Portugal, which seems similar to previously published works in other countries. Given that more than half of the patients with WD were diagnosed in the pediatric age, efforts should be focused on the development of tools aimed at establishing an early diagnosis for better management of the disease.",,"De Sousa, B.

1177,Disorders of hepatic copper secretion: Wilson's disease and pleomorphic syndromes,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disease whose prevalence is higher than previously thought. Caused by genetic variations that target the copper (Cu) transporting P-ATPase Atp7b and disrupt Cu clearance by the liver, Atp7b truncations are associated with early severe liver disease and missense mutations with late-onset liver disorders. neurological Asymptomatic onset and false unimportance of early symptoms often delay crucial early diagnosis and life-saving treatment. Occasional acute liver failure persistently threatens the lives of patients with WD. The severity and progression of the disease strongly depend on the genetic background that organizes the response to oxidative damage caused by high levels of free Cu. In this review, the authors focus on the prevalence, genetics, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment options in WD. They also discuss the new association of cuprotoxicosis with pleomorphic syndromes, of which MEDNIK is the first example, produced by genetic variations that interrupt universal protein transport mechanisms and thus perturb Atp7b trafficking linked to Cu excretion. .

1179,Atypical clinical and radiological features of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes hepatic, neurological and other systemic manifestations. The diagnosis should be considered in a young patient with chronic liver disease and neurological manifestations. Case report: In our case, a young male presented with insidious and gradually progressive difficulty walking and sitting. On examination, the patient had a stuporous gaze and was unable to vocalize. On motor examination, dystonia and exaggerated deep reflexes were present (Featured Figure). The Kayser-Fleischer ring was visible on both sides with the naked eye. His serum ceruloplasmin decreased, his serum copper level increased slightly, and his 24-hour urinary copper excretion increased to approximately 10 times the normal value. His USG abdomen showed liver with coarse abnormal echo. On MRI of the brain, there was a ""giant panda face appearance"" with white matter abnormalities (Figure 1). Discussion: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. In Wilson's disease with neurological presentations, the symptoms are predominantly extrapyramidal, such as dystonia, tremors, dysphasia, dysarthria, and ataxia. Our case presented neurological manifestations, predominantly dystonia, dysarthria and cognitive impairment. Brain MRI showed white matter involvement in the bilateral frontal cortex along with the typical features seen in Wilson's disease. These white matter abnormalities are rare and have been infrequently reported. Our patient was treated with zinc because trientine and tetrathiomolybdate were not available, and showed improvement in neuropsychiatric aspects. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion is required when dealing with adolescents and young adults with abnormal movements and neurobehavioral abnormalities. A high degree of suspicion and early detection of WD are essential as its diagnosis can be easily missed, but if diagnosed early and treated appropriately, the patient can lead a normal life.",,"Goyal, S.;Dabla, S.;Sharma, B.;Yadav, K.",2015,JuneÃ¯Â¿Â½July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2015.07.158,0,0,
1180,Encapsulated Trientine Dihydrochloride Nanoparticles for Copper Chelation Therapy in a Rat Model of Non-Wilsonian Brain Copper Toxicosis,"Trientine cannot mitigate cerebral copper overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered trientine-loaded nanoparticles compared with conventional trientine for 90 days in a Wistar rat model for non-Wilsonian cerebral copper toxicosis. High resolution liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, biochemical estimations, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, nanoparticle preparation and their physicochemical characterization were performed. Trientine nanoparticles exhibited a mean size of 351 nm and less than 34% release of trientine. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of trientine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based trientine administration group compared to the conventional trientine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based Trientine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary Cu levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat model of Cu toxicosis. Conventional trientine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections corroborated by 63%, and a 16% reduction in liver and brain copper content, respectively, compared with the Cu-intoxicated group. not treated. However, liver and brain sections from the nanoparticle-based trientine therapy group demonstrated grade 1 copper, and no copper deposition was corroborated by a 46% and 28% reduction in liver and brain copper content, respectively, compared to the untreated copper-intoxicated group. Taken together, the present study reveals the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of trientine nanoparticles to chelate more brain copper and alleviate neurological deficits even at half the dose that is administered in conventional trientine therapy.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1181,Spatial investigation of elemental distribution in the liver of Wilson's disease after D-penicillamine treatment by LA-ICP-MS,"Currently, the copper chelator D-penicillamine (DPA) is the first-line therapy for Wilson's disease (WD), which is characterized by excessive copper overload. Lifelong DPA treatments aim to reduce the amount of excess, damaging copper retention in the liver and other organs. Although DPA shows a beneficial effect in many patients, it can cause serious side effects. Despite several years of copper chelation therapy, discontinuation of DPA therapy may be associated with rapidly progressing liver failure, indicating a high residual copper load in the liver. In order to investigate the spatial distribution of remaining copper and additional elements, such as zinc and iron, in human and rat liver samples after DPA treatment, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA -ICP-MS) the imaging method was applied. Untreated LPP<sup>-/-</sup> rats, an established animal model for WD, appeared with a high overall concentration of copper and a distribution of hot spots of copper distributed over liver tissue. In contrast, a low (>2-fold lower) overall copper concentration was detected in the liver of DPA-treated animals. However, it is important to note that the distribution of copper was highly heterogeneous with the lowest concentrations in the direct vicinity of blood vessels, as observed by a new zonal analysis. A needle biopsy of human liver from a WD patient treated with DPA confirmed the finding of inhomogeneous copper deposition after chelation therapy. In contrast, comparatively homogeneous distributions of zinc and iron were observed. Our study indicates that a high-resolution LA-ICP-MS analysis of liver samples is excellent for following the efficacy of chelation therapy in WD patients.

1182,Wilson's disease in China,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Its incidence is higher in China than in Western countries. ATP7B is the causative gene and encodes a P-type ATPase, which is involved in holoceruloplasmin synthesis and copper excretion. Disease-causing variants of ATP7B disrupt the normal structure or function of the enzyme and cause copper deposition in multiple organs, leading to various clinical manifestations. Given the variety of presentations, misdiagnosis is not uncommon. Genetic diagnosis plays an important role and has gradually become a routine test in China. The first Chinese spectrum of ATP7B disease-causing mutations has been established. As a remediable hereditary disorder, most patients with WD have a good prognosis with early diagnosis and chelation therapy. However, clinical trials are relatively few in China, and most treatments are based on the experience of experts and evidence from other countries. Specific appropriate regimens for Chinese patients with WD need to be studied and developed.

During this period, the importance of these elements to human disease, including their contribution to the global burden of disease, has been increasingly recognized. New analytical methods allow biomonitoring data to be linked to health outcomes. Future research using modern chemical methods will focus more on elemental speciation and measurement of lower concentrations leading to further identification of adverse effects and critical organs. Over the past two decades, extensive knowledge about the essentiality and toxicity of trace elements in humans has emerged, and difficulties in defining a range of acceptable oral intakes for essential elements have now been largely overcome. Biological monitoring of trace element concentrations in various media, such as blood or urine, is of great importance and a general description is given. As an example, a more detailed description of the biological control of cadmium is provided, explaining biokinetics, including the role of metallothionein in modifying kinetics and toxicity.

1185,"Efficacy and safety of a new copper-modulating agent (WTX-101) for Wilson's disease: results of an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study","Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients. Newly Diagnosed WD Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a novel copper-modulating agent under development for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). Although WD treatments are available, there are significant unmet medical needs regarding efficacy, side effects, and dosing simplicity. Design/Methods: WD patients older than 18 years, treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for < 2 years with chelation or zinc therapy, initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD. After 6 weeks, dosing was individually guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. Assessments over 24 weeks included neurological and daily activity status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), liver status, copper parameters, and safety. Results: Twenty-eight patients entered the study. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 uM), 23/28 had neurological manifestations (mean UWDRS part III score 22), and all had liver involvement. Final results will be presented at the 2017 AAN Annual Meeting. Preliminary data indicate that neurological overall (UWDRS part III) and daily activity (UWDRS part II) scores were improved in patients with neurological manifestations. Liver status stabilized or greatly improved. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over time on treatment. Other measurements of Cu (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) indicate a similar pattern of copper elimination. In general, WTX101 was well tolerated. Adverse events included reversible elevated liver tests in approximately 30% of patients and neutropenia. Conclusions: Treatment with WTX101 once daily for 24 weeks improved neurological disease, liver status, and copper control in patients with newly diagnosed WD. WTX101 appears to be well tolerated. No drug-induced paradoxical neurological impairment was observed. Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to establish its safety and efficacy for the treatment of WD.",,"Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Askari, F.;Bronstein, J.;Czlonkowska, A.;Ferenci, P.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

1186,"Late-onset Wilson's disease, dementia, Ekbom syndrome, and white matter hyperintensities","Objective: The objective of this study is to describe a patient with late-onset Wilson's disease, dementia and Ekbom syndrome. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which causes impaired biliary excretion of copper and its accumulation, first in the liver but ultimately in the brain and other tissues. Ekbom syndrome is characterized by a firm conviction on the part of the patient that he is infested by parasites that emerge from the skin, mouth, eyes, or genital region. Design/Methods: We present the case of a patient with an atypical presentation of Wilson's disease with Ekbom syndrome. Results: A 69-year-old male with chronic liver disease referred to the Neurology group to investigate cognitive impairment, mostly executive complaints and episodic memory deficits of 3 years of evolution. Neurological examination showed only wing tremor. At follow-up, the patient worsened and became agitated, aggressive, and confused. After 6 months he began to say that there were bugs moving on his skin, which were not observed by his relatives. Subsequently, he developed extrapyramidal signs, with bradykinesia and muscle rigidity. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Total serum ceruluplasmin was low on 2 occasions: 6.9 and 11. Ophthalmological evaluation showed Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and D-penicillamine was started, with no clinical response. Conclusions: Ekbom syndrome is normally related to psychiatric conditions or dementia, but its presence should lead to suspicion of other neurodegenerative disorders since it can present before other classic signs. Although late-onset Wilson's disease is rare and does not usually present with early dementia, it can have an atypical course. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of dementia, especially as it is potentially treatable if diagnosed early.",,"Marques, P.;Larissa, B.;Germiniani, F.;Teive, H.

1187,Copper deficiency in a patient with a previous diagnosis of AIDP,"Objective: to report a case of copper deficiency in the context of previously reported AIDP. Background: Copper deficiency (CD) has been recognized to cause myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and hematologic abnormalities. Its known causes are enteropathies, zinc ingestion and gastric surgery, with approximately 20% of cases without known aetiology. Design/Methods: Case report Results: A 32-year-old woman with a history of AIDP presented with ascending weakness, numbness, pancytopenia, and, on arrival, loss of bowel and bladder function. His examination found gross paraplegia and hypoesthesias below the T3 level, with a single delayed ascending myotonic response to patellar stimulation. The patient also described rapid loss of dental enamel in the previous months, gross peripheral ataxia, and labile affect. With a history of AIDP, he was started on 5 days of IV methylprednisolone. Towards the end of her course of intravenous steroids, it was discovered that she had multiple nutritional deficiencies, namely: thiamin, copper, and folic acid. His examination improved, although the cause remained unclear. After completion of the steroid course, plasmapheresis was started. The issue of low ceruloplasmin in the context of low copper briefly brought Wilson's disease into the differential, specifically withholding copper supplementation until ruled out by 24-hour copper excretion. Meanwhile, plasmapheresis, which is known to reduce circulating copper, was continued for possible CIDP treatment. Once Wilson's disease was ruled out, copper supplementation was restarted at 8 mg daily, which showed mild improvement in symptoms and anemia leading to subsequent discharge. Conclusions: The presentation of CD mimicking a chronic inflammatory demyelinating radiculopathy, particularly in the context of previous AIDP, proved to be a challenge in diagnosis and treatment. Where the initial positive response to steroids and plasmapheresis suggested an inflammatory aetiology, the subsequent ebb and flow suggested the opposite. The question remains whether the initial episode of AIDP in the previous year was in fact the initial presentation of said DC vs CIDP.",,"Upadhyaya, P.;Ghodsianzadeh, F.;Romero, R.;Bhavaraju-Sanka, R.",2017,,,0,0,
1188,Non-wilsonian hepatolenticular degeneration: clinical and magnetic resonance imaging observations in four families from South India.,"Non-wilsonian hepatolenticular degeneration (NWHD) is a heterogeneous neurological disorder secondary to chronic acquired liver disease. Genetically determined familial NWHD is rare, poorly understood, and often confused with Wilson's disease (WD). We analyzed the clinical and MRI profiles of patients with NWHD who did not have an obvious cause of acquired liver disease, such as alcohol intake or hepatitis. Six patients from four families (four men, two women, mean age: 17.0 +/- standard deviation 7.9 years), who presented a chronic extrapyramidal disorder similar to WD and imaging tests (abdominal ultrasound/MRI) were studied. ) of cirrhosis. They lacked Kayser-Fleischer rings or biochemical and/or genetic evidence of WD. Clinical features included dystonia (n = 6), parkinsonism (n = 3), tremor (n = 1), cerebellar ataxia (n = 3), orofacial dyskinesia (n = 1), behavioral abnormalities (n = 3), and cognitive. decrease (n = 1). Brain MRI revealed T1-weighted hyperintensity in the pallidum (n = 6), crus cerebri (n = 4), putamen (n = 1), caudate (n = 1), thalamus (n = 1), and red nucleus ( n = 1) with T2-weighted shortening in some of these regions. Additional findings included giant cisterna magna (n = 1), giant panda sign face (n = 1), and thin corpus callosum (n = 1). Areas of ""blooming"" were observed on susceptibility-weighted images in two patients in the caudate (n = 2) and putamen (n = 1). The finding of T1 shortening is different from that of WD, where most lesions are hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. Extrapallidal T1 hyperintensity is also a rare finding in NWHD. The appearance on MRI of intense T1 shortening together with the lack of increased susceptibility changes suggests that the most likely mineral deposited is manganese. The association of this neurological disorder and liver cirrhosis in the absence of acquired liver disease is a distinct disease entity. This syndrome may represent a disorder of manganese metabolism resulting in its toxic deposition. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Nagappa, M.;Sinha, S.;Saini, J.

The objective is to describe a series of generally accepted approaches for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of Wilson's disease. The recommendations are based on a systematic review of the literature in Medline (PubMed version), Embase (Dialog version), and the Cochrane Library databases using entries from 1966 to 2011. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) used in other EASL CPGs was used and compared to the somewhat different grading system used in the AASLD guidelines (Table 1A and B). Unfortunately, there is not a single randomized controlled trial in Wilson's disease that has been optimally designed. Therefore, it is impossible to assign a high or even moderate quality of evidence to any of the questions addressed in this guide.

1190,Canine models for the cover of the cover homeostasis,"Copper is an essential trace nutrient metal involved in a multitude of cellular processes. Hereditary defects in copper metabolism result in disorders with a serious clinical course, such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease. In Wilson's disease, copper accumulation causes liver cirrhosis and neurological abnormalities. The lack of genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson's disease points to the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In several non-Wilsonian forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain elusive. Several populations of purebred dogs are affected by copper-associated hepatitis that shows similarities to disorders of copper metabolism in humans. Gene mapping studies in these populations offer the opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. Furthermore, due to the relatively large body size and long lifespan of dogs, they are excellent models for the development of new treatment strategies. An example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review addresses the opportunities offered by canine genetics for the discovery of genes involved in disorders of copper metabolism. Furthermore, the potential for the use of dogs in the development of new treatment modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived liver organoids, is highlighted.

1191,D-penicillamine combined with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism enhances breast and lung cancer cell responses to radiation and carboplatin through H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2< mediated oxidative stress. /inf>,"D-penicillamine (DPEN), a copper chelator, has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent evidence suggests that DPEN in combination with biologically relevant concentrations of copper (Cu) generates H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in cultured cancer cells, but the effects of this on responses from cancer cells to ionization radiation and chemotherapy are unknown. Elevated steady-state levels of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> were detected in MB231 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells after treatment with DPEN (100 microM) and sodium sulfate. copper (15 microM). Clonogenic survival demonstrated that DPEN-induced cancer cell toxicity was Cu-dependent and significantly ameliorated by glutathione depletion [using butionine sulfoximine (BSO)] as well as inhibition of thioredoxin reductase [using Auranofin (Au)] before of the exhibition. Catalase treatment inhibited DPEN toxicity, confirming that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was the toxic species. Furthermore, pretreatment of cancer cells with iron sucrose enhanced DPEN toxicity while treatment with desferrioxamine, an Fe chelator that inhibits the redox cycle, inhibited DPEN toxicity. Importantly, DPEN also demonstrated selective toxicity in human breast and lung cancer cells, relative to normal untransformed human breast or lung epithelial cells, and increased cancer cell killing when combined with ionizing radiation or carboplatin. Consistent with the selective toxicity of cancer cells, normal untransformed human lung epithelial cells had significantly lower labile iron stores than lung cancer cells. These results support the hypothesis that DPEN mediates selective killing of cancer cells as well as radiochemosensitization through a mechanism involving H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> catalyzed oxidative stress. by metal ions and suggest that DPEN could be reused as an adjuvant in conventional cancer therapy.

1193,A new risk locus in the ZEB2 gene for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population,"The ZEB2 gene encodes the zinc finger E-box binding protein. As a key regulator of epithelial mesenchymal differentiation, ZEB2 plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis and its high level of expression has been observed in glioma patients. Different mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia conducted in Caucasians showed a significant association of rs12991836, located near the ZEB2 gene, with schizophrenia. Therefore, we carried out a case-control study to further investigate whether this genomic region is also a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. In total, 1248 schizophrenia cases (SCZ) (middle age+ /-SD, 36.44+/-9.0 years), 1344 cases of bipolar disorder (BPD) (mean age+/-SD, 34.84+/-11.44 years), 1056 major depressive disorder cases were recruited (MDD) (mean age +/- SD, 34.41 +/- 12.09 years) and 1248 healthy control samples (mean age +/- SD, 30.62 +/- 11.35 years). In this study, we genotyped 12 SNPs using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. We found that rs6755392 showed a significant association with SCZ (rs6755392: adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=0.016; adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.052; OR (95% CI)=1.201 (1.073~ 1,344)).

1197,Clinical characteristics and evolution in patients with osteomuscular-type Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease of the musculoskeletal type is a rare condition that often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and is easily misdiagnosed. During the past 10 years, eight Chinese patients with musculoskeletal-type Wilson's disease were identified in our clinic. Methods: Clinical information was collected from medical records and follow-ups. The genetic study was performed in each patient. Serum ceruloplasmin, Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver function, brain MRI, and abdominal ultrasound were also evaluated. Results: The median age of onset is 12 years. The patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while hepatic or neurological signs were minimal. Most of the patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms later with a mean interval of 36 months. All had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/L). Most patients (6/8) have Kayser-Fleischer rings and abnormal liver ultrasound. Arthralgia resolved with copper chelation therapy. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal-type Wilson's disease presents without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes clinical diagnosis difficult. Serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination, and genetic testing help establish the diagnosis. Early diagnosis can initiate effective treatment and prevent further damage.

1201,"Prospective Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Hepatic Copper Content, as Determined Using the Whole Core of a Liver Biopsy Specimen","Liver copper determination is an important test for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD). However, the method has not been standardized, diagnostic accuracy has not been prospectively evaluated, and the optimal cut-off value remains controversial. Accordingly, our aim was to prospectively assess the diagnostic accuracy of liver copper content, as determined using the whole core of a liver biopsy sample. Patients for whom liver biopsy was indicated were included consecutively. Liver copper content was determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy. All assays were performed using careful quality control by a single technician. Diagnosis of WD was based on the WD score or its combination with clinical follow-up results. A total of 3,350 consecutive patients underwent liver biopsy. Six hundred and ninety-one patients, including 178 with WD, underwent two-pass liver biopsy with liver copper determination. Mean liver content in WD patients was 770.6+/-393.2 Âµg/g dry weight (wt). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of liver copper content for the diagnosis of WD in the absence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis at a cut-off value of 250 ug/g dry weight. they were 94.4%, 96.8%, 91.8% and 97.8%, respectively. The most useful cut-off value was 209 ug/g dry weight, with a sensitivity and specificity of 99.4% and 96.1%, respectively. A total of 23.3% of patients without WD and PBC had liver copper content >75 Âµg/g dry weight. Conclusion: A liver biopsy sample of more than 1 mg dry weight can reliably reflect liver copper content and should be used for liver copper determination. Liver copper determination is a very valid procedure for diagnosing WD, and the most useful cut-off value is 209 ug/g dry weight.

1202,<sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics investigation of copper-loaded rats: a model of Wilson's disease,"Background and Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD), also known as hepatoleticular degeneration (HLD), is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of copper metabolism, which causes copper to accumulate in body tissues. In this study, rats fed a copper-laden diet are used to exhibit clinical manifestations of WD, and organ damage induced by copper toxicity is studied. To investigate the metabolic behaviors of the ""decoppering"" process, penicillamine (PA) was used to treat copper-loaded rats, since this chelating agent could eliminate excess copper through urine. To date, there has been limited metabolomic study on WD, while the metabolic impacts of copper accumulation and PA administration have yet to be established. Materials and methods: A combination of <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis were applied to examine the metabolic profiles of urine and blood serum samples collected from the PA-treated WD copper-loaded rat model. . Results: Copper accumulation in copper-loaded rats is associated with increased lactate, creatinine, valine, and leucine, as well as decreased blood serum glucose and taurine levels. There were also significant changes in p-hydroxyphenylacetate (p-HPA), creatinine, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), dimethylamine, N-acetylglutamate (NAG), N-acetylglycoprotein (NAC) in the urine of these rats. Notably, changes in p-HPA, glucose, lactate, taurine, valine, leucine, and NAG were reversed after PA treatment. However, there were no changes for dimethylamine, alpha-KG, and NAC as a result of treatment. Compared to controls, the concentrations of hippurate, formate, alanine, and lactate changed when PA was applied and this is probably due to its side effect. A tool called SMPDB (Small Molecule Pathway Database) is presented to identify the metabolic pathway influenced by the copper-laden diet. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the potential application of NMR-based metabolomic analysis to provide more insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the disorder due to WD.

1203,Functional analysis and pharmacological response to zinc and D-penicillamine in stable ATP7B mutant liver cell lines,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of anti-copper treatment on the survival of liver cells expressing different ATP7B mutations in cell culture. METHODS: The most common mutations in Wilson's disease (WD) p.H1069Q, p.R778L and p.C271*, found in the ATP7B gene that encodes a hepatic copper transporter, were studied. The mutations represent the major genotypes from the United States and Europe, China, and India, respectively. A human hepatoma cell line previously established to drive ATP7B knockout was used to stably express WD mutants. Mutant ATP7B mRNA and protein expression, cell survival, apoptosis, and protein trafficking were determined. RESULTS: Low temperature increased ATP7B protein expression in several mutants. The intracellular localization of ATP7B was significantly affected in the mutants. Mutants were classified as high survival, moderate survival, and non-survival based on their viability upon exposure to toxic copper. Survival of the p.H1069Q mutant and, to a lesser extent, p.C271* was improved by D-penicillamine (DPA) treatment, while the p.R778L mutant showed a pronounced response to zinc (Zn) treatment. In general, DPA treatment resulted in higher cell survival compared to Zn treatment; however, only the combined Zn + DPA treatment fully restored cell viability. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that the basic impact of a genotype could be characterized by analysis of mutant liver cell lines. Copyright Â© 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, plasmapheresis and chelation therapy are indispensable and effective even for WD with a score >= 11. In addition, continuous haemodiafiltration (CHDF) with these treatments is essential for acute liver failure (ALF) in WD with encephalopathy. hepatic because CHDF can exclude toxic substances. metabolites that can cause brain damage. Here, we describe four rescued patients presenting with ALF in WD and discuss available treatment options. Methods: We have experienced 11 male and 8 female patients who presented with WD at the Department of Pediatrics, Kumamoto University Hospital between 1999 and 2014. One male and 4 female patients were diagnosed as WD with ALF by a combination of clinical findings and tests. biochemical. Results: The NWI score was >= 11 in cases 1 to 3. Cases 1 and 2 with hepatic encephalopathy received plasmapheresis, CHDF, clotting factor replacement therapy (CFRT), and HT. Cases 3 and 4 without encephalopathy achieved stable status without LT by plasmapheresis, blood infusion, and CFRT. Conclusions: It is better to undergo HT for WD patients with NWI score >=11, however, there is a possibility of remission by plasmapheresis and medical therapy even without HT. WD patients with an NWI score >= 11 can be rescued with conservative therapy when the ALF of WD does not present with ALF and hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, ALF with hepatic encephalopathy itself is an indication for LT in WD.

In this context, several neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions have been reported for the proteolytic fragments of APP sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, and monomeric beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). APP is a metalloprotein and binds copper and zinc ions. Synaptic activity is correlated with the release of these ions in the synaptic cleft and the deregulation of their homeostasis is related to different neurodegenerative diseases. Metal binding to APP or its fragments affects its structure and its proteolytic cleavage and thus its physiological function at the synapse. Here, we summarize the current data supporting this hypothesis and provide a model of how these different mechanisms might be intertwined with one another.

1210,Multifocal myoclonus as a precursor manifestation of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is one of the few curable movement disorders that manifests in a variety of presentations, so WD should be considered in any patient with a movement disorder younger than 50 years. Although WD is one of the causes of myoclonus, it is rarely seen in WD and is usually an associated finding. We present the case of an adolescent patient with WD who presented with cortical multifocal myoclonus of 6 months' duration with subsequent development of generalized dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, and cognitive impairment. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was present on slit-lamp examination. Serum copper, urinary copper, serum ceruloplasmin, and brain MRI were consistent with a diagnosis of WD. Copper chelation was started along with other symptomatic treatments and dietary modifications. The myoclonus resolved at 3-month follow-up with improvement of other symptoms. This case report emphasizes that myoclonus may be the main and presenting feature of WD.

1211,"Restless Legs Syndrome in Wilson's Disease: Frequency, Characteristics, and Mimics","Objective: To determine the characteristics, clinical significance, frequency, and mimics of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a Wilson's disease (WD, n = 42/f = 18) cohort, compared with matched healthy controls. Materials and methods: Structured clinical interviews (patients and family caregivers), repeat neurological examinations (evening and bedtime), comprehensive laboratory tests, WD, RLS, and sleep-specific rating scales, and video polysomnography. Results: Thirteen patients with WD (13/42 = 31.0%) clearly met the five diagnostic criteria for RLS; in eight patients (19.1%), the RLS burden was clinically significant. The RLS was of moderate severity, equally distributed between the sexes, manifested mainly at nightfall and before falling asleep, and had developed mainly after the clinical manifestation of WD (time elapsed 10.2 +/- 14.5 years). , even at a young average age (27.5 +/- 11.5 years). Known features associated with RLS were either absent (normal kidney and iron parameters) or rare (positive family history, polyneuropathy). Compared with WD patients without RLS, RLS patients were significantly older and had suffered longer on WD. WD-specific RLS mimics as well as confounding motor comorbidities of RLS (dystonia, tremor, chorea) were common and diagnostically challenging; in difficult cases differentiation was achieved by clinical observation of motor behavior in the evening or at night. Conclusion: RLS was common in this WD cohort and could be causally related to WD. RLS must be included in WD diagnostic work. In complex motor disorders, the differential diagnosis of RLS may require an evening/night exam and video polysomnography. In patients with WD with clinically significant RLS, treatment with dopaminergic substances may be considered. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1212,Trace metal regulation of neuronal apoptosis: from genes to behavior,"The genetically programmed form of neuronal death known as apoptosis plays a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease. Apoptosis is also responsible for neuronal death after traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, and seizures. The cognitive and behavioral consequences of all of these disorders can be devastating. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis are complex. However, it is this very complexity that provides us with a wide range of potential targets for the development of antiapoptotic strategies. Therefore, our laboratory is currently exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for neuronal apoptosis, with a particular focus on the role of the metals copper, zinc, and iron. Each of these metals is essential for the normal development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). However, imbalances, either due to excess or deficiency, can lead to neuronal apoptosis. In this review, we show the relationship between these metals in neurodegenerative disorders and CNS injury, and the mechanisms that govern neuronal survival and apoptosis. Â© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1216,Usefulness of transient elastography to predict the outcome of Decopper Therapy in a 13-year-old girl with acute or chronic liver failure due to Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of copper. Decopper is the effective treatment with an excellent result if the disease is diagnosed early [1]. However, most patients with severe manifestations such as acute liver failure or acute chronic liver failure require urgent liver transplantation [2]. Although a recent study showed that transient ultrasound-based elastography (Fibroscan) could be used to predict liver fibrosis with a cut-off value of 6.6 kPa [3], there have been no useful clinical data of Fibroscan in untreated WD, especially to predict the outcome of initial treatment. Methods: Outcome: A 13-year-old girl with jaundice, ascites, and coagulopathy of 6 months' duration, referred from a local hospital for liver transplantation. Wilson's disease was diagnosed in our hospital with positive KF rings, low serum ceruloplasmin, high urinary copper, and neuropsychiatric involvement. Liver biopsy was omitted due to uncorrectable coagulopathy. Transient elastography was measured at 50.6 kPa (Photo 1A). During admission, the patients presented grade I-II encephalopathy with fluctuation of consciousness and hyperreflexia. Treatment with depenicillamine and zinc sulfate was started. Four weeks later, clinical features and laboratory parameters remained abnormal (Table 1); however, the Fibroscan value decreased dramatically (17.8 kPa) (Image 1B), reflecting the good response to treatment and patient compliance. Conclusion: We present a case of WD with severe manifestation that could require liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is less possible with the unpredictable waiting list time, therefore decopper therapy is started after diagnosis of WD. Response to treatment will take up to 3 months from baseline [1], therefore the novel parameter is needed to predict treatment outcome. We recommend the use of transient elastography, in addition to clinical response and liver function testing, not only to predict treatment outcome but also to assess patient compliance in long-term follow-up.

1217,Copper homeostasis as a therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with mutations in SOD1,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, and there is currently no cure or effective treatment. Mutations in a gene encoding a ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), were first identified as a cause of familial forms of ALS. It is widely accepted that mutant SOD1 proteins cause disease through gain in toxicity but not through loss of physiological function. SOD1 is an important copper-binding protein and regulates copper homeostasis in the cell; therefore, mutant SOD1 toxicity could arise due to disruption of copper homeostasis. In this review, we will briefly review recent studies implicating the roles of copper homeostasis in the pathogenesis of SOD1-ALS and highlight therapeutic interventions that target pharmacological and genetic regulations of copper homeostasis to modify the pathological process in SOD1-ALS.

Patients and methods: Description of clinical and laboratory findings. Results: A 35-year-old woman was referred to a neurology service for symptoms of resting, postural, and kinetic tremor of the upper extremities, as well as head tremor. The diagnostic study revealed Kaiser-Fleischer rings in both eyes, high levels of copper in urine (200 mg/24 h with normal value [nv] <100, low levels of ceruloplasmin (17.5 mg/dL-nv22-58 ) and marginally low serum copper (0.6 ug/mL-nv0.7-1.4).A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established.However, the patient's chest X-ray showed enlargement of the pulmonary hila which was confirmed , using computed tomography to represent enlarged lymph nodes, angiotensin converting enzyme was 72.2 U/L (nv 12-68), spirometry was normal (FEV1: 87%, FVC: 88%, Dlco: 81%, FRC: 89%, RV: 82%, TLC: 84%) and no significant hemoglobin desaturation in six-minute walk test (97% to 96%, distance walked: 360 m) Bronchoalveolar lavage performed: Cells: 0.132 x10<sup>6</sup>, alveolar macrophages 44%, lymphocytes 42%, neutrophils 6%, mononuclear cells 3%, eosinophils 5% CD4/CD8 ratio: 2.57 The patient started treatment He was treated with triethylenetetramine (Trientin) for his primary disease and was followed up for his stage I sarcoidosis.

1220,Update on the clinical management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD), although relatively rare, is an important genetic metabolic disease due to highly effective therapies that can save lives. It is a great imitator and requires a high index of suspicion for a correct and timely diagnosis. Neurological, psychiatric, and hepatological problems in WD are highly nonspecific, and we discuss the most common clinical phenotypes. Diagnosis remains laboratory-based, and here we review the major challenges and obstacles in laboratory evaluation of WD, including the emerging role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of WD. WD is a single-gene disorder but has very high allelic heterogeneity with >500 disease-causing mutations identified, and new insights into phenotype-genotype correlations are also reviewed. The gold standard of therapy is chelation of excess copper, but there is much unmet need due to potential clinical deterioration in treated patients and potential adverse effects associated with currently available chelation drugs. We also review the most promising new therapeutic approaches, including chelators targeting specific cell types, cell transplantation, and gene therapy.

1221,Surgical treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in the ATB 7B gene, which is a membrane-bound copper transporting ATPase. Impaired excretion of copper results in increased serum levels and accumulation of copper in the body. Various signs can be observed in liver, nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart. There are also changes in blood chemistry. Objective: A forty-six-year-old patient presents with Wilson's disease in the treatment rooms of the Plovdiv Dental Faculty. She needs complete dental care. He has also had an ischemic stroke. Methods and results: Since the treatment plan began with extraction of teeth under local anesthesia, a complete blood count and INR were performed. Oral mucosa and bone were biopsied for evidence of pigment in these tissues. The biopsy results also showed copper accumulation in them. Conclusion: It is a rare disorder, approximately 1 in 40,000, which seriously affects the liver and the nervous system. It requires a deep analysis and discussion about the clinical and paraclinical approach in order to avoid possible complications and achieve the desired results.

1224,Liver transplant in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; the french experience,"Introduction: The standard treatment for Wilson's disease (WD) is copper chelating agent or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. The indication of HT in neurological forms without hepatic decompensation remains controversial. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of HT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods. This is a retrospective study. From 2002 to 2015, nine patients (mean age 21 [12-42] years) underwent LT in France for severe neurological complications without neurological improvement despite medical treatment, without acute liver failure. All patients received copper chelation and 2 patients received copper chelation with zinc salts. Results. Neurological symptoms were heterogeneous, combining dystonic posturing, akinesia, cerebellar ataxia, chorea, and parkinsonian syndrome. The CHILD score was A for all patients at the time of transplantation. All patients had cirrhosis after native liver analysis. The mean interval between diagnosis of WD and LT was 11.4 [5-28] months and the mean follow-up time after transplant was 50 [2-42] months. Five patients (mean age 19 [12-30] years) with a mean follow-up of 80 [2-156] months had neurological improvement after LT, with a significant improvement in quality of life. Four patients (mean age 24 [15-42] years) did not have significant improvement in neurological symptoms and died of infectious complications, after a mean interval of 13 [2-36] months. Three of the four deceased patients had severe parkinsonian syndrome and akinesia that limited movement and swallowing. No correlation has been shown between genetic mutations and prognosis. Conclusion: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in WD for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with unfavorable evolution died due to severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms could be a pejorative factor.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Vanlemmens, C.;Hermeziu, B.;Adam, R.;Cherqui, D.;Castaing, D.;Samuel, D.;Woimant, F.;Duclos-Vallee, J.

1226,Evaluation of renal function in children with Wilson's disease. [Turkish],"Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate renal function in Wilson's disease (WD) using urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and the NAG/creatinine activity index. Materials and Methods: Twenty age- and gender-matched children with WD were determined as the patient group and 37 healthy children were determined as the control group for the study. NAG levels were calculated as mlU/L and the NAG activity index was determined as mlU/mg. Results: while four (20%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, chronic hepatitis, neurological WD, fulminant hepatitis and acute hepatitis were observed in six (30%), five (25%), three (15%) and two. (10%) patients, respectively. Of the children, 13 (65%) were on treatment with trientine and zinc and seven (35%) were on treatment with d-penicillamine and zinc. Ten (50%) children had proteinuria, one (5%) had glycosuria, and one (5%) had microscopic hematuria. While mean urinary sodium and creatinine levels were significantly lower compared to controls (p = 0.048 and p = 0.001, respectively), NAG and NAG indices were significantly higher (p = 0.049 and p = 0.03). ). It was observed that the clinical presentation was not effective in these parameters (p>0.05). No relationship was found between the Child-Pugh score and these parameters (p>0.05). Conclusions: It was concluded that although WD by itself and/or the drugs used for treatment have negative effects on the renal function of children with WD, however, it has no effect on the severity of liver damage and the clinical presentation of the disease.

In the present study, the patient was a 35-year-old woman who presented with buckling from drinking (bulbar palsy) and dysphagia over a nine-year period. Genetic analysis of the patient identified Thr935Met and Pro992Leu mutations, which lead to unloading barriers to copper metabolism. In addition, MRI revealed a susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) hyperintense area in the bilateral substantia nigra and lentiform nuclei. These SWI observations indicated that there were ""mineral deposits"". The present case demonstrates that the hyperintense area of SWI in the bilateral lentiform nuclei, substantia nigra and red nucleus combined with the patient's symptoms indicated that there is a possibility of diagnosing WD when it is not detected by genetic analysis. Furthermore, it demonstrates that systemic mineral removal therapy (including manganese, iron, and copper) can be successful in the initial treatment of WD. Copyright Â© 2016 Spandidos Publications.

1231,Clinical spectrum of ocular malformations in four patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by a specific facial gestalt, intellectual deficiency, Hirschsprung's disease, and multiple congenital anomalies. Heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox2 (ZEB2) gene cause MWS. ZEB2 encodes Smad-interacting protein 1, a transcriptional co-repressor involved in the TGF-beta and BMP pathways and is strongly expressed early in development in mice. Rarely, ocular abnormalities have been described in patients with this syndrome. Here, we describe four patients (two men and two women; mean age 7 years) with MWS and ocular malformations. Ocular abnormalities included iris/retina colobomas, optic nerve atrophy or absence, hyphema, and profound refractive problems, sometimes with severe visual consequences. All ocular malformations were asymmetric and often unilateral and all ocular segments were affected, similar to the nine previously reported cases of MWS with ophthalmologic malformations (iris/chorioretinal/optic disc coloboma, optic nerve atrophy, retinal epithelial atrophy , cataract and corectopia). In the human embryo, ZEB2 is expressed in the lens and neural retina. Using the present report and data from the literature, we set out to determine whether or not the presence of ocular manifestations could be due to the specific type or location of the mutations. We conclude that the presence of ocular malformations, although a rare feature in MWS, should be considered as part of the clinical spectrum of the condition.

1232,Spectro of ZEB2 mutations that cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome in Japanese populations,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, microcephaly, epilepsy, agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, congenital heart defects, Hirschsprung disease, and anomalies. urogenital/renal It is caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations, including missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and deletions in ZEB2 at 2q22. ZEB2 encodes the zinc finger E-box binding protein homeobox 2 consisting of 1,214 amino acids. Herein, we report 13 missense and 27 frameshift mutations from 40 newly identified MWS patients in Japan. Although the clinical findings of all Japanese MWS patients with missense and frameshift mutations were quite similar to previous review reports of MWS caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and ZEB2 deletions, the frequencies of microcephaly, Hirschsprung's disease, and urogenital/renal anomalies were small. The patients harbored mutations spanning the region between amino acids 55 and 1204 in wild-type ZEB2. There was no apparent correlation between genotype and phenotype among patients. A transfection study demonstrated that the cellular level of the longer form of the mutant ZEB2 protein harboring the p.D1204Rfs*29 mutation was remarkably low. The results showed that the ZEB2 3' end frameshift mutation causes MWS due to ZEB2 instability.

1234,Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases by Chelators,"Changes in metal ion homeostasis occur with aging, which may precipitate the development of neurodegenerative diseases in susceptible individuals. Slight increases in the iron content of specific brain regions, sometimes as little as twofold, can have a devastating effect on brain function. In this current review, we will initially discuss the changes that occur in brain iron homeostasis during healthy aging and longevity, and how alterations in its concentration and distribution can accelerate various neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in metal ion homeostasis of other metal ions, namely copper and zinc, also occur in neurodegenerative diseases and will be discussed. In the last five years, the use of iron chelators has been reported to slow the progression of the disease and even improve clinical symptoms in some neurodegenerative diseases; clinical trials have confirmed its efficacy in specific neurodegenerative diseases, namely Friederich's ataxia and Parkinson's disease. The development of new chelators that can target specific regions of the brain, combined with drugs that can modulate inflammatory processes, will further raise the hope of eradicating these debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.

Many articles describe the well-known role of this metal in human physiology and pathophysiology, but current and reliable reviews of the role of zinc deficiency in many diseases are lacking in the related literature. In this article, we describe the role of zinc deficiency in the control of oxidative stress, immune response, proliferation, and the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of selected diseases such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

1236,Manifestations and course of Wilson's disease in pediatric patients carrying the very rare atb7b l708p mutation. [],"OBJECTIVES: To characterize a group of 11 pediatric patients, aged between 3 and 13 years, affected by Wilson's disease on the island of Gran Canaria. METHODS: Genetic, biochemical and pathological characteristics have been analyzed in this group of patients, as well as their response to treatment and clinical evolution. RESULTS: Genetically, the group was fairly homogeneous, with a very high prevalence of the L708P mutation (four homozygotes and five heterozygotes). Despite being initially screened for asymptomatic hypertransamineemia, all patients had some degree of liver damage that was never accompanied by neurological manifestations. Liver damage was more severe in a compound heterozygote with a novel mutation, G1266W, affecting a motif in the ATP7B polypeptide that is highly conserved in similar proteins among metazoans. Serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper, along with determination of hepatic copper content, were found to be of great diagnostic value, whereas urine copper measurements were found to be much less conclusive. All patients responded well to D-penicillamine treatment with no documented adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The patients of Gran Canaria constitute, globally, one of the largest groups of patients with WD with a high incidence of a single mutation, which allows us to define the early symptoms and the evolution of the disease in patients who are carriers of the ATP7B L708P mutant allele. and the study of WD in a genetically homogeneous background.",,"Pena-Quintana, L.;Garcia-Luzardo, M.

1237,Pyoderma gangrenosum: a new manifestation of Wilson's disease?,"17-year-old girl, a known case of Wilson's disease, presented with a nonhealing skin ulcer followed by jaundice, ascites, and progressive fatigue for 1 month. Wilson's disease was diagnosed 5 years ago and had been well controlled on d-penicillamine. At consultation, it was discovered that he had not been compliant with his medication in the previous 6 months. On examination, he presented with severe pallor, jaundice with moderate ascites, and edematous feet. Investigations revealed severe hemolytic anemia and impaired liver function. The lesion was diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum on skin biopsy. The appearance of a skin lesion followed by deterioration of the liver disease and hemolysis suggested uncontrolled Wilson's disease as the triggering factor. Chelation therapy improved hemoglobin and liver function and led to ulcer healing. We describe pyoderma gangrenosum as a new manifestation of Wilson's disease. Copyright Â© 2015 INASL.",,"Freg, G. N.

1238,Wilson's disease: health-related quality of life and risk of depression,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and requires lifelong medical treatment. Therefore, the analysis of quality of life has gained more attention. The objectives of this study were to examine the risk of depression and health-related quality of life in patients suffering from Wilson's disease. Methods: Sixty-eight patients were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 Depression Scale was used to assess depression. The Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of life. Results: The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 indicated that 21% (14/68) of the patients were at risk of major depressive disorders (scores > 10) and 35% (24/68) were at risk of mild depression (scores 5 -9). ). Women had significantly lower quality of life scores than men. Manifestation of primary neurological disease was associated with significantly lower total and short form 36 subdimension scores compared with primary or mixed hepatic presentation. In general, patients with Wilson's disease experienced a better quality of life than patients with other chronic liver diseases. Conclusions: Since patients with Wilson's disease are at high risk for depressive disorders, active screening for depression is mandatory. Patients with primary neurological symptoms are at increased risk of reduced quality of life. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,"Schaefer, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1239,The role of zinc in liver cirrhosis,"Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. It acts primarily by binding to a wide range of proteins, affecting a wide spectrum of biological processes, including cell division, growth, and differentiation. Zinc is essential for a large number of structural proteins, enzymatic processes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency can lead to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including lack of appetite, loss of body hair, altered taste and smell, testicular atrophy, brain and immune dysfunction, and decreased ability to eliminate drugs. These are common symptoms in patients with chronic liver diseases, especially liver cirrhosis. The liver is the main organ responsible for zinc metabolism, which can be affected by liver diseases. On the other hand, zinc deficiency can alter hepatocyte functions and also immune responses in inflammatory liver diseases. Liver cirrhosis represents the most advanced stage of chronic liver diseases and is the common result of chronic liver injury. It is associated with energy malnutrition, with numerous metabolic disorders, such as hypoalbuminaemia, with an imbalance between branched-chain amino acids and aromatic amino acids, and with reduced serum zinc concentrations. All of these processes can influence the clinical outcome of patients, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present review, we summarize emerging evidence on the pitovanal role of zinc in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis. Copyright Â© 2016, South Medical Clinic Foundation.

1240,Dermatoscopy and direct immunofluorescence findings of elastosis perforans serpiginosa,"Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare skin disorder characterized by transepidermal shedding of abnormal elastic fibers. We present a new case of EPS induced by D-penicillamine (DPA), and describe the clinical, dermoscopic, histopathological and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) findings. A 33-year-old woman undergoing treatment with APD presented with annular skin lesions. Digital dermatoscopy of the lesions showed a central area of pinkish and yellowish coloration with keratotic papules on the periphery, surrounded by a white halo, arranged in a way that resembled the islands of an archipelago. Other lesions showed central white to yellow coloration and 'chrysalises' surrounding keratotic plugs. Linear and granular deposits of IgG attached to the abnormal elastic fibers with DIF were observed. Dermoscopy can be helpful in diagnosing EPS. Furthermore, the findings of DIF in the skin biopsies of this case support the immune-mediated pathogenesis of EPS. Copyright Â© 2016 British Association of Dermatologists",,"Ramirez-Bellver, J.

1241,Neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease-possible treatment options for symptoms,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that mainly presents with liver symptoms, but can be accompanied by various neurological manifestations. WD can be successfully treated with chelators or zinc salts to correct abnormal copper metabolism, which often improves both liver function and neurologic deficits; however, improvement of neurological deficits may take years. Patients may initially present with severe neurological deficits that affect activities of daily living. Consequently, therapy is needed to relieve neurological symptoms. Treatment options are often based on experience with other disorders with clinically similar symptoms to WD. Covered Areas: Apart from general recommendations on anti-copper therapy and liver transplantation in patients with WD, there are no guidelines for the management of neurological symptoms. Based mainly on case reports, this review describes the most common neurological symptoms and their possible treatments. Expert opinion: There is no strong evidence regarding the treatment of neurological disorders in patients with WD. Several case studies indicate that medications used to treat movement disorders, such as tremor, parkinsonism, or dystonia, can also relieve these symptoms in patients with WD. In the case of severe and disabling neurological symptoms, treatment options for the symptoms should always be discussed with the patient.

1246,Metals and Neurodegeneration,"Metals play important roles in the human body, maintaining cell structure and regulating gene expression, neurotransmission, and antioxidant response, to name a few. However, excessive accumulation of metals in the nervous system can be toxic, inducing oxidative stress, disrupting mitochondrial function, and affecting the activity of numerous enzymes. Damage caused by metal buildup can lead to permanent injury, including serious neurological disorders. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown a strong correlation between aberrant metal exposure and a number of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, Guillain-BarrÃ© disease, the Gulf War, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Wilson's disease.

1247,Wilson's disease in thai children between 2000 and 2012 at king chulalongkorn memorial hospital,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. Clinical presentations are extraordinarily diverse and currently no single diagnostic test can confirm WD with high accuracy. A complete understanding of the presentations and improved diagnostic methods are important for disease management. Our aim was to examine the disease characteristics, management, and treatment outcome of WD in children, especially when genetic analysis and liver copper measurements were limited. Material and method: Data were collected from 21 children with WD who were treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Inclusion criteria followed the WD scoring system, where other liver diseases are systematically ruled out. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 13.5+/-3.36 years, with 19 symptomatic patients and two asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed through family screening. Varied presentations, jaundice (52%), ascites (52%), edema (52%), Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (14%), neurological abnormalities (33%), renal involvement (19%) and fulminant hepatic failure (5%). ). Based on the key parameters of the WD scoring system, 14 patients (66%) had Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. Seventeen (89%) had low serum ceruloplasmin and 20 (95%) had increased urinary copper excretion. These positive results caused the WD scoring system to accurately diagnose 66% of patients. Chelation therapy was the first line of treatment for all but one patient, who underwent a liver transplant. After therapy, liver function tests returned to normal in all patients. However, neurological symptoms did not improve with pharmacological therapy combined with chelating and neuropsychiatric agents. Conclusion: WD in children mainly affected the liver. WD was suspected in seven patients (34%), requiring further investigation. Therefore, long-term follow-up in those with suspected WD is the appropriate method for diagnosis and management in limited diagnostic tests. We suggest additional treatment and the use of clinical response to treatment as a criterion to confirm the diagnosis of WD. Copyright Â© 2016, Thailand Medical Association.

1248,Chemical and physical characterization of thermal aggregation of model proteins modulated by zinc(II) and copper(II) ions,"BACKGROUND: Metal ions are involved in protein aggregation processes in various neurodegenerative pathologies, where protein deposition occurs, and in the field of biotechnology, such as food technology, where many processes in food manufacturing They are based on heat treatments. OBJECTIVE: The influence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the thermal aggregation process of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and bovine serum albumin ( BSA), two model proteins, was studied with the aim of delineating the role of these ions in protein aggregation kinetics and elucidating the related molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Changes in protein structure were monitored by Raman spectroscopy, while aggregate growth was followed by dynamic light scattering measurements. RESULTS: Both metal ions are able to favor the aggregation of BLG, while only the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions have a promoting effect on the thermal aggregation of BSA. The reason for this different behavior is that the aggregation evolution of BLG is mainly affected by charge redistribution, while that of BSA by metal-dependent metal coordination bonding. CONCLUSIONS: Raman spectroscopy, combined with dynamic light scattering experiments, was very useful in identifying the role of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> in aggregation pathways. of BLG and BSA. The results provide evidence for the role of histidine residues in both charge redistribution and the two modes of metal binding that take place in systems containing BLG and BSA, respectively.

1249,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa and Wilson's disease: a rare but predictable consequence of long-term D-penicillamine therapy. [Portuguese],"Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is a rare perforating dermatosis found mainly in adolescents and young adults, characterized by transepidermal shedding of abnormal elastic fibers. The only known drug capable of inducing elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is D-penicillamine. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman with keratotic papules arranged in an annular pattern with central clearing and centrifugal growth, located in the anterior cervical region. The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Biopsy of the lesion showed transepidermal removal of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-shaped elastic fibers. The clinicopathological findings were compatible with elastosis perfurans serpiginosa secondary to D-penicillamine. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is estimated to occur in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. By directly or indirectly blocking desmosine cross-links between elastin molecules, D-penicillamine leads to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa may be the first manifestation of a multisystemic degenerative process of the elastic connective tissue. Copyright Â© Order of Doctors 2016.",,"Pinho, A.;Cardoso, J.

1254,High-precision isotopic analysis of essential mineral elements in biomedicine: variations in the natural isotopic ratio as possible diagnostic and/or prognostic markers,"High precision isotope analysis of essential mineral elements, mainly Ca, Cu, Fe and Zn, provides relevant biomedical information. For this application, multi-collector ICP mass spectrometry is the preferred technique. Variation in the isotopic signature of these elements is governed by alterations in their absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion. Therefore, diseases that affect the metabolism of metallic minerals, such as hemochromatosis, cancer, liver cirrhosis, and Wilson's disease, affect the isotopic composition of these elements in some body compartments. This review discusses how naturally occurring isotope ratio variations in biofluids can potentially be exploited as alternative approaches for disease diagnosis that can otherwise only be established at a later stage or by a more invasive and/or for profit method. forecast.

1255,Serum copper and zinc in a representative sample of the Bulgarian population,"Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are essential for life. The body content of Cu and Zn depends on a variety of factors: age, sex and diet, type of drinking water, geographical location and genetic predisposition. Copper status becomes even more relevant not only in rare genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease, but also in diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, glucose intolerance, and neurodegenerative and tumor diseases. The study aimed to examine the distribution of Cu and Zn in serum in a representative group of the Bulgarian population and to describe the factors that influence the metal content. It also aimed to describe the link between serum Cu levels and the frequency of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Bulgarians. Serum Cu and Zn were measured in 379 individuals (172 males and 207 females) from 5 different regions in Bulgaria by flame atomic absorption using AAnalyst 400, Perkin Elmer. Statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS, 19. The median and inert quartile range (IQR) for Cu in blood were 15.89 (13.87-7.89) mumol/L and for Zn-13.00 ( 11.7-14.68) mumol/L in the examined group. Higher levels of Cu were found in females than in males (p < 0.001). A decrease in Zn with aging was established (p > 0.05). A significant difference (p < 0.05) was found in serum Cu between young people (< 30 years) and adults older than 61 years. A statistically significant difference was observed in Cu and Zn (p < 0.05) with respect to residences.

1256,A case of Wilson's disease presenting as chronic liver disease,"Wilson's disease is one of the most common inherited liver diseases with a worldwide incidence of 10 to 30 million cases. The increased frequency in certain countries is due to high rates of consanguinity and the fulminant presentation of the disease is more common in women than in men. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, with subsequent impairment of biliary copper excretion. Subsequent accumulation of copper, first in the liver but later in the brain and other tissues, leads to clinical manifestations that may include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other disorders. Genetic testing is not practical due to the multitude of mutations that have been identified, so an accurate diagnosis relies on the judicious use of laboratory and other diagnostic tests. Lifelong palliative treatment with a different combination of drugs, or with a liver transplant if necessary, can successfully improve or prevent progressive deterioration of the disease; otherwise, death would inevitably occur. Since there is an effective treatment for this disease, an early and correct diagnosis is very important.

Its diagnosis is based on the confirmation of iron overload and the study of HFE gene mutations. Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice for hemochromatosis; prevents progression to cirrhosis. Wilson's disease Wilson's disease is due to mutations in ATP7B. Its main characteristic is copper overload that causes liver toxicity (fulminant liver failure or cirrhosis) and neurotoxicity. The drugs used to treat Wilson's disease are D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc.

1262,Diagnosis and Management of Tremor,"Purpose of review: Tremor, which is a rhythmic oscillation of a body part, is among the most common involuntary movements. Rhythmic oscillations can manifest themselves in various ways; as a result, a rich clinical phenomenology surrounds tremor. For this reason, diagnosing tremor disorders can be particularly challenging. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a simple approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with tremor. Recent Findings: Scientific understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of tremor disorders has increased considerably in recent years with the use of a wide range of neuroimaging approaches and rigorous, controlled post-mortem studies. The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are structures that seem to play a prominent role. Abstract: The diagnosis of tremor disorders is challenging. The tremor approach involves a history and neurological examination that focuses on the nuances of tremor phenomenology, of which there are many. Evaluation should begin with a history of tremors and a focused neurological exam. The review must pay attention to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the main type of tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. Next, the clinician must formulate two sets of differential diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the principal tremor. Among the most common of the first type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson's disease is the most common form of resting tremor, along with drug-induced resting tremor. This article details the clinical features of each of these, as well as other tremor disorders.

1264,Wilson's disease: an update. [German],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which mutations in ATP7B lead to dysfunction of copper metabolism. The consequence is reduced copper excretion in the bile and excessive copper deposition in the liver and brain. WD patients typically present with liver symptoms in late childhood or adolescence, or as young adults with extrapyramidal or psychiatric symptoms. However, it is important to consider WS also in patients with movement disorders after 40 years of age, particularly in combination with (sub)clinical liver dysfunction. If untreated WD results in severe disability or death. If diagnosed early, there is effective treatment that will prevent the disease from progressing and reverse some of the symptoms. Treatment with chelating agents induces renal copper excretion, and zinc salts inhibit duodenal copper reabsorption. Liver transplantation is reasonable in severe hepatic cases and is also considered for a severe neurologic course that cannot be successfully treated otherwise.

1265,Elemental Bioimaging and Speciation Analysis for Wilson's Disease Research Using muxRF and XANES,"liver biopsy sample from a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) was analyzed by micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (muXRF) to determine elemental distribution. First, benchtop muXRF was used for rough scanning of the sample under laboratory conditions. The resulting copper and iron distribution maps allowed the determination of a region of interest (ROI) for further analysis. To obtain more detailed elemental information, this ROI was analyzed using synchrotron radiation (SR)-based muXRF with a 4-mum beam size offering cell-level resolution. Distribution maps of elements additional to copper and iron such as zinc and manganese were obtained due to a higher sensitivity of SR-muXRF. In addition to this, X-ray absorption spectroscopy near the edge structure (XANES) was performed to identify the oxidation states of copper in WD. This speciation analysis indicated a mixture of copper(i) and copper(ii) within WD liver tissue. Copyright Â© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Hachmoller, O.;Buzanich, A.

1266,Zinc monotherapy in young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan,"Background and objectives: The AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as a treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). We previously reported that a reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD using zinc is to maintain 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the first 1-2 years (Mizuochi, et al. JPGN 2011;53:365). Here, we aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children, <10 years of age, with asymptomatic WD in Japanese pediatric centers and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective and prospective study to examine 21 children (median age 6 years, range 1-9) who met diagnostic criteria for WD and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to symptom onset at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan. No additional sequelae of WD, such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities, were observed. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 1 to 7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. Additional controls included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, gamma-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, iron, amylase, lipase, and prothrombin time, as well as 24-hour urinary zinc excretion. We performed an abdominal ultrasound and evaluated the clinical manifestations of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for patients <= 5 years was 25 mg twice daily; for those children 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the dose of zinc if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L, and decreased it if they had adverse effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At diagnosis, 24-hour urine AST/ALT and copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 Âµg/day (5.8+/-2.9 Âµg/kg / day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after treatment initiation and remained mostly below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST /ALT: 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/L at 1 and 7 years from the start of treatment, respectively). Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly to 49+/-21 cups/day (2.2+/-1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) at 6 months after treatment initiation and remained at mostly below 75 cups/day and between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study (2.2+/-0.6 and 1.5+/-0.2 cups/kg/day at 1 and 7 years after the start of treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD using zinc appears to be to maintain both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 ug/kg/day (and less of 75 ug/day).",,"Mizuochi, T.;Eda, K.;Takaki, Y.;Iwama, I.;Araki, M.;Inui, A.;Hara, S.;Kumagai, H.;Hagiwara, S.

1267,Serum zinc discriminated indeterminate: Acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease: Acute liver failure,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Combined clinical and laboratory findings are needed for early diagnosis. There is a suggested hypothesis that low serum zinc (Zn) is related to the phenotypic severity of WD. Indeed, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a Zn-containing metalloenzyme reflecting that actual Zn deficiency is relatively low in WD patients, could support this assumption. However, few studies highlight the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis and severity of WD. Our study aimed to observe the values of serum Zn, ALP and other baseline laboratory results in acute liver failure (AHF) of undetermined cause and WD. Patients and Methods: The medical records of children with WD (n=43) and ALF of undetermined cause (n=9) at King's College Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. diseases. WD is classified into WD-non-ALF (n=28) and WD-ALF (n=15). Serum Zn, copper, ceruloplasmin (CP), and liver function tests were recorded. Free serum copper and corrected Zn formula were calculated as follows; Free copper (mu mol/L) total copper (mu mol/L) bound copper (mu mol/L) (Bound copper 0.0472 x ceruloplasmin (mg/L)) and Zn corrected patient 0.25xZn normal + ((albumin normal/patient albumin) x (patient Zn-(0.25x normal Zn)) Results: Our study demonstrates significantly lower serum Zn, corrected Zn, and ALP in WD-ALF compared to WD non-ALF and ALF from undetermined cause (Table 1) Conclusion: The present study showed that the dramatic aberration of serum Zn in WD-ALF can discriminate WD-ALF from undetermined ALF.",,"Sintusek, P.;Dhawan, A.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000503536.79797.66,0,0,
1268,Treatment Modality and Potential Outcome of Wilson's Disease in Taiwan: A Population-Based Longitudinal Study,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, drug preference, and long-term outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores detailed clinical records from all insurers in Taiwan. The database used in this study is a random sample of two million out of 23 million recipients in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. And the integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected between 2000 and 2011. Wilson were identified as those with international disease. Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in inpatient or outpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male:female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual incidence rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The age-specific incidence rate peaked between 10 and 14 years, followed by 20 to 24 years and 25 to 29 years. 54 of the total subjects (81.8%) started treatment with D-penicillamine, compared to zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Of these 66 cases with Wilson's disease, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and 3 (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation for liver failure. Conclusions: D-penicillamine continues to be the most prescribed drug in patients with Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy.

1269,A Japanese child with idiopathic copper toxicosis,"We experienced a Japanese child with idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT), who was diagnosed with special liver histology features. Case: A seven-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for profound jaundice. He suffered from itching and stunted growth since he was 3 years old. His physical findings were jaundice, spider angioma on the cheeks, hepatospolenomegaly (palpable liver 6 cm at the right costal margin, palpable spleen 5 cm at the left costal margin) and scratches with bleeding on the skin. His laboratory results were WBC 6420/micro L, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, platelets 174,000/micro L, total bilirubin 13.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 10.6 mg/dL, AST 1477 U/L, ALT 457 U/L, LDH 393 U/L, GGT 162 U/L, Alb 2.9 g/dL, AU 2.4 mg/dL, PT 37.7%, APTT 49.4 sec, and haptoglobin 9 mg/dL. dL. Their associated copper profiles were serum Cu 215 microg/dL, ceruloplasmin 48.6 mg/dL, and 24-hour urine Cu 472.8 microg/d. Clinical Course: He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD) with normal serum ceruloplasmin level and no ATP7B gene abnormality. He was treated with trientine hydrochloride plus zinc acetate for 30 days. His 24-hour urine Cu levels increased to >2500 microg/d, while his condition was deteriorating. His new Wilson Index came in at 17. He was transferred to the Transplant Center and underwent a cadaveric liver transplant. Histology of the explanted liver: the surface of the liver and the divided face showed multiple nodular formations. The lobular architecture was altered with severe fibrosis. The swelling was minimal. Markedly Mallory body-like materials were found in the hepatocytes. The copper content in the explanted liver was 1482.3 microg/g dry weight. Both orcein and rhodanin stains stained intensely in hepatocytes. Discussion and Conclusion: TIC is one of the metabolic disorders of copper, less recognized than Wilson's disease. The pathogenesis of CTI is still unknown, but the clinical features of CTI are similar to the hepatic type of Wilson's disease. Cases of Wilson's disease with normal or elevated serum ceruloplasmin level should consider ICT.

1270,Analysis of kidney failure in 102 children with Wilson's disease,"a. Objectives Since the various manifestations of renal failure appear at different periods of Wilson's disease (WD), misdiagnosis is not uncommon. We conducted this study to find the clinical characteristics of renal failure in children with WD. b. Methods We enrolled 102 children with WD who had been treated in our department from January 1995 to December 2012. Renal failure included one of the following: abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria 1/4, hematuria, glycosuria, hypercalcinuria, or increased NAG in urine, abnormal renal function (BUN >=7.14 mmol/L, Scr>=176.8 mol/L), abnormal renal ultrasound or renal biopsy, excluding renal compromise caused by other factors c.Results Demographic data: There are 58 with analysis of abnormal urine in 102 patients with WD.Excluded 14 with one time and 10 with D-penicillamine treatment, the remaining 34 patients: 14 boys and 20 girls.The course of the disease ranged from 3 days to 10 years.Clinical presentation : 14 with hematuria, 4 with proteinuria and 15 with proteinuria and hematuria, 2 cases were nephrotic proteinuria, 1 case was renal tubular acidosis, NAG in urine increased in 12, phase morphology of red blood cells in urine was detected in 15, 3 hematuria glom erular and 12 non-glomerular. relieved Serum creatinine clearance rate decreased in 2 patients. Ultrasound revealed unsystematic kidney damage in 5 of 27 patients. Renal biopsy showed IgA deposition in the mesangial region in 2. Initial renal failure: 9 had symptoms of renal failure, 4 of them had macroscopic hematuria, 1 with edema, hematuria, and proteinuria, 1 with purpura, hematuria, and proteinuria, 1 with frequent and urgent urination, 2 with edema and severe proteinuria. Prognosis: Kidney failure in all patients improved or disappeared after treatment. d. Conclusions Renal failure with WD, including injury after D-penicillamine treatment, is not uncommon.

1271,"An ongoing phase 2, multicenter, open-label study of WTX101 in patients with Wilson's disease: first observations","Objective: The objective of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease. Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational copper removal agent being developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease. The goal of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease. Methods: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease who were treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for <=28 days with chelation or zinc therapy received WTX101 30 or 60 mg once daily during the initiation phase. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks, guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. Periodic assessments included safety, liver disease status, including synthetic function, and modified Nazer score, change from baseline in free copper. and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first six patients (age 18-53 years; 2 men) were followed for 8 to 36 weeks in the study. Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5 and 5/6 had neurological manifestations at baseline. Reversible elevated liver function tests related to per-protocol dose increases were observed in the first 2 patients. After reducing the starting dose from 30 mg BID (fully 60 mg/day) to 30 mg QD and escalating the dose to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated with no SAAs and few AEs. Liver status improved or remained stable. Initial elevated plasma molybdenum-adjusted NCC normalized on average within 3 months. UWDRS scores improved in all patients with neurological manifestations. At 3 months, the neurological examination score (part III) was reduced from approximately 30 to <10, with continued improvement thereafter. Daily activity status (part II) showed a similar improvement. Conclusions: WTX101 appears safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. With the improvement in clinical (liver and neurological) and laboratory evaluations, including copper monitoring in these early patients, further clinical evaluation is warranted to establish the efficacy and safety of WTX101.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Weiss, K.

1272,Iron accumulation in a patient with Wilson's disease: longitudinal 7T magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial ultrasound study,"Objective: To investigate longitudinal changes in clinical symptoms, 7T magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranial ultrasound (TCS) during chelation therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: Pathophysiological causes and predictive biomarkers of clinical worsening in patients with WD treated with anticopper are unknown. One of the possible contributing factors may be the accumulation of iron in the brain. Our aim was to examine longitudinal changes in T2* relaxation time and echogenicity of deep gray matter structures as measures of iron content in a patient with WD. Methods: We examined a patient with WD de novo at the beginning of the study and followed him periodically for 30 months with anti-copper treatment. Clinical severity was assessed using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). The 7T MRI imaging protocol included a 3D magnetization-prepared fast gradient echo (MPRAGE, TE = 3 ms; TR = 2300 ms) and a 2D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE, 8 echoes 4.1-25.5 ms; TR = 1820 ms) for T2 * parametric mapping. R2* values were measured in the globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put), caudate nucleus (NC), and thalamus (Thal). TCS was performed and the lentiform nucleus (NL) and NC echogenicity indices were calculated using TCS digital image analysis software. Results: A 27-year-old man developed ataxia and action tremor in his hands and was diagnosed with WD (homozygous p.H1069Q mutation) three months later. At baseline there was bilaterally pronounced LN hyperechogenicity; The R2* value at the GP (130) increased 1.3-fold compared to four age-matched controls (mean 99.9+/-(SD) 9.8). After initiation of penicillamine treatment (increased to 900 mg) the ataxia and tremor progressed to generalized dystonia along with vertical gaze palsies. After switching to trientine (increased to 900 mg) and then to zinc (150 mg) + trientine (600 mg), her symptoms gradually improved and the UWDRS score decreased from 104 to 56. The R2* value gradually increased, particularly in Put (red arrows) and Thal (green arrows) suggesting iron accumulation. This was associated with thalamic atrophy and cavitation on MP-RAGE MRI (green arrows). TCS did not show any change in the echogenicity of NL and NC during treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that increased brain iron concentration may be present in de novo WD, while increased iron deposition may accompany degenerative changes during failed anti-copper treatment. LN hyperechogenicity does not reflect R2* changes and may serve as a trait marker.

Background: Oral D-penicillamine therapy cannot attenuate cerebral Cu overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: Atomic absorption spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and physical-chemical preparation/characterization of nanoparticles were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles exhibited a mean size of 274.09 nm and less than 29.32% release of D-penicillamine under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of D-penicillamine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory along with a concomitant increase in urinary Cu levels in the Wistar rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of brain and liver sections, corroborated by a 16.4% and 60.1% reduction in brain and liver Cu content. , respectively, compared to the untreated Cu-intoxicated group. However, liver and brain sections from the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group demonstrated grade 1 Cu depositions and absence of Cu corroborated by a 47.2% and 32.8% reduction in Cu content.

Background: No case series of WD have been reported in Myanmar. This study was a hospital-based study conducted at the Department of Neurology, Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar. Methods: During the period from 2010 to 2015, 17 patients were diagnosed with definite WD and one with probable WD according to the Leipzig criteria. Results: Of the 18 patients, 8 were men and 10 women. The mean age at diagnosis was 20 years. The main presentation characteristics were: abnormal gait in 17 of 18 (94.4%); speech problems 17 (94.4%), parkinsonian features 9 (50%), tremor 8 (44.4%), cerebellar symptoms and signs in 4 (22.2%). Fourteen patients (66.6%) had psychiatric symptoms. Five patients (27.7%) had difficulty swallowing, 2 (11.1%) had seizures, and 1 (5.5%) had chorea. KF rings were positive in all patients. The serum ceruloplasmin level was low in 17 (94.4%) patients and the lower limit of normal in one patient. Only 3 patients (16.6%) had coexisting hepatic manifestations. Renal and hematological involvement was observed in 2 patients (11.1%). Three (16.6%) patients had a positive family history and one patient (5.5%) had the parents' consanguineous marriage. Only one of the siblings of the affected patients was examined and found to have WD. CT (Brain) was performed in 8 of 18 patients (44.4%) and all had bilateral hypodensity of the basal ganglia and one (5.5%) had subcortical involvement. MRI (Brain) was performed in 12 of 18 patients (61.1%) and showed hyperintense signals on T2 mainly in the basal ganglia, thalamus and midbrain. All patients were initially treated with penicillamine and zinc as maintenance therapy. One patient was 12 weeks pregnant at the time of diagnosis and was given penicillamine because trientine is not available. Her neurological symptoms improved markedly and she went into preterm labor at 34 weeks. The child was low birth weight with hypotonia and died at one year of age. Only 7 of 18 patients (38.8%) attended for regular follow-up and clinical improvements were observed, but the outcome of 11 patients was unknown.

1275,Clinical and imaging deterioration of a mild case of Wilson's disease after chelation treatment,"Objective: To present a case of mild Wilson's disease with neuropsychiatric characteristics that presented clinical and imaging deterioration five months after trientine chelation treatment. Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disorder of copper metabolism. Once the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established in our patient, appropriate chelation of ALD from AL was started, trientine was chosen as the available drug. Trientine is a chelating agent indicated as initial therapy with fewer adverse effects than penicillamine. Methods: The dose was initially 300 mg daily for the first three months and then 600 mg daily in two divided doses for the following two months. neurological deterioration has been reported as soon as the dose was increased. Neurological examination reported improvement in postural and wing tremor, as well as difficulty walking with dystonic spasms, mild sensory loss, and ataxic speech. Brain MRI was impaired compared to the previous one obtained before treatment. A characteristic giant panda sign face has been described along with lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain. Results: Treatment was discontinued but before evaluating urinary copper excretion. After two weeks without treatment, the patient's clinical status improved and urinary copper extraction and serum copper, both below normal levels, were reassessed. Conclusions: In conclusion, in this case the neurological and brain magnetic resonance impairment was due to excessive copper removal. Therefore, traditional chelating agents may not be safe when used in mild types of Wilson's disease, and preventative therapy such as zinc may be more effective and preferable.",,"Kleoniki, C.;Spiridon, K.;Cristos, T.;Aristidis, K.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26688,0,0,
1276,A case of Wilson's disease presenting with depression as the initial symptom,"Wilson's disease is a chronic disorder resulting from abnormal accumulation of copper in various organs, usually accompanied by disorders of copper metabolism due to a specific genetic abnormality. Many neurological symptoms, such as slurred speech, dysarthria, dystonia, parkinsonian feature, chorea, and ataxia, are widely known as early symptoms and syndromes of Wilson's disease. But dementia or frontal lobe syndrome can also be seen in Wilson's disease. We present the case of a 17-year-old male who presented executive dysfunction and apathy with depressed mood as the initial symptom of Wilson's disease. A 17-year-old male referred to our emergency department due to apathy of about 3 days of evolution. His vital signs and laboratory findings were nonspecific. Executive dysfunction was suspected on initial neurological examination. During observation for approximately 3 h in the hospital, he developed mild bilateral postural-action tremor and suspicious slurred speech was noted. On T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, bilateral symmetrical high signal intensities in the putamen and caudate nucleus. In his previous dietary history, he had been eating pork liver and shellfish in excess for months, which contain a high proportion of copper. Urinary copper concentration increased (2123.2 Î¼g/24 h) and serum ceruloplasmin level decreased (< 4 mg/dl). Upon diagnosis of Wilson's disease, he was treated with zinc and trientine. Wilson's disease can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms including subcortical dementia and frontal lobe syndrome. In general, hepatic dysfunction or motor symptoms are frequently seen in the early stages of the disease. But, at an early age, the acute onset of cognitive disturbances in Wilson's disease should be considered and close observation of neurological symptoms is needed.",,"Chang, H.;Park, H.;Cheong, J.",2016,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.13692,0,0,

Ultrasound and liver biopsy documented moderate steatosis, at that time interpreted as due to DCP-induced cholestasis. Phase contrast and electron microscopy revealed ciliary immobility, with no dynein in the axoneme: PCD was diagnosed. On admission, Fibroscan showed hepatic fibrosis. Brain MRI was normal. Normal ceruloplasminemia, increased cupruria (2260 mg/24 h, normal <70), fibrosis with elevated hepatic copper deposition (349 mg/g; normal <9.9) were found. The DNAI1, DNAH5, and DNAH11 genes were normal, while compound heterozygosity was found for the 2304-2305insC and R1041W mutations in the ATP7B gene, confirming WD. Patient started penicillamine, with benefit: 8 years later she is asymptomatic. Conclusion: The coexistence of WD and PCD has never been reported. Loci adjacent to ATP7B may contain dyne coding sequences, affected by mutations of nearby genes. Early diagnosis can save lives. In this case, liver failure was largely reversed with copper agents. In addition, the reduction of ceruloplasmin, being an acute phase reactant, was hampered by recurrent PCD bronchopneumonia. Being opinionated about ceruloplasmin levels can keep you from correct diagnosis and treatment.",,"Romoli, M.;Tambasco, N.;Prontera, P.;Nardi, E.;Clerici, C.;Calabresi, P.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13094,0,0,
1278,First epidemiological study of Wilson's disease in France,"Background and objectives: In the literature, the estimated prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) varies between 1/30,000 and 1/100,000. In France, with a population of 64 million, one would expect between 640 and 2,100 cases of WD. The objectives of this study are to estimate the national prevalence of WD based on data from the French national health insurance information system (SNIIRAM) and to analyze epidemiological data according to age, sex and treatments. Methods: This study involved all beneficiaries covered by the general health insurance scheme representing 90% of the French population. WD patients were identified on the existence of a long-term illness eligible for 100% health reimbursement (affection longue duree (ALD)) with code E83.0 (copper metabolism disorder) or on at least one hospitalization between 2011 and 2013 with the same code. Results: 906 patients with WD were identified, that is, a prevalence of 1.5/100,000. However, it is certainly underestimated because patients stabilized for many years are not registered as ALD. 43.2% were under 40 years of age. Almost 40% of the patients were treated with D-Penicillamine and 14.3% with Zinc Acetate, 5.6% received neuroleptics, 15% antidepressants. 5.3% had a liver transplant. Triethylenetetramine, administered as compassionate, does not appear in the base. The comparison of these data with the 500 patients followed up in the national reference center for WD will be presented. Conclusion: This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population, an important step to understand the impact of WD on public health and to further study the quality of care.",,"Poujois, A.;Tuppin, P.;Samson, S.;Chaine, P.;Girardot-Tinant, N.;Woimant, F.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13093,0,1,
1279,The frequency of copper deficiency due to overtreatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder involving excess copper. Lifelong copper removal therapy is needed, but copper deficiency can result and manifest as myelopathy and hematologic abnormalities. The objective of the study was to establish the frequency of copper deficiency as a complication of treatment in a group of patients with WD. Methods: We examined consecutive patients who underwent routine follow-up between April 2012 and April 2014. Free serum copper concentration, complete blood cell counts, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were determined to assess thoracic spine impairment. A careful neurological examination was performed to detect the presence of clinical signs of myelopathy or neuropathy. Overt copper deficiency was defined as the coexistence of a low unbound ceruloplasmin (NCC) copper concentration (<5 Âµg/dl), blood count abnormalities, or myelopathy detected on SEP and/or MRI. column. Results: 64 patients with WD (39% hepatic, 51% neurological and 10% presymptomatic features) were enrolled. The calculated NCC was <5 ug/dl (normal range, 10 - 15 ug/dl) in 14 (21%) patients. In 80% of these patients, SEP driving times were normal. Copper deficiency was diagnosed in three cases treated with zinc sulfate (two developed myelopathies with hematological signs, one leukopenia). Only one had clinical signs of myelopathy. Conclusion: Overt copper deficiency is a rare adverse effect (4.6%) of long-term treatment of WD. Neurological signs of copper deficiency are even rarer. However, a low NCC without other clinical signs is common (17%). Regular monitoring of copper metabolism parameters is essential to avoid treatment complications.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Sobanska, A.;Litwin, T.;Rakowicz, M.;Czlonkowska, A.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13092,0,0,
1280,An Ongoing Phase 2 Open-Label Study of WTX101 in Wilson's Disease Patients: Early Observations,"Background and objectives: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper agent in clinical development for Wilson's disease (WD). The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients with WD. Methods: Patients who were treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for <= 28 days with chelation or zinc therapy were started on 30 or 60 mg of WTX101 daily. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks, guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. Assessments included safety, liver status, copper parameters, and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first 6 patients were followed for 8 to 36 weeks in the study. Modified Nazer score at baseline ranged from 1 to 5 and 5/6 had neurological manifestations. Reversible elevated liver function tests were observed after per protocol dose increases in the first 2 patients. After reducing the starting dose from 60 mg to 30 mg daily and increasing the dose to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated with no SAEs and few AEs. Liver status improved or remained stable. Elevated baseline free copper normalized on average within 3 months. UWDRS scores and daily activity improved in all neurological patients. Conclusion: WTX101 seems safe and well tolerated in patients with WD, with improvement in clinical (hepatic and neurological) and laboratory evaluations. Further clinical evaluation is warranted.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Weiss, K. H.;Ala, A.;Askari, F.;Nicholl, D.;Schilsky, M.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13091,0,0,
1281,Altered zinc ion levels and transporter expression indicate that high hepatic copper disrupts zinc metabolism in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of wilson disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. This mutation affects the regulation of copper metabolism primarily in the liver, but also in the kidneys and brain. Impaired transporter function ultimately results in hyperaccumulation of copper in these organs with subsequent toxicity. Although Wilson's disease is traditionally considered a copper-related disorder, significantly (p < 0.01) elevated liver zinc levels were observed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy in the Atp7b<sup>- mouse model. /-</sup> used to study Wilson's disease. To determine the mechanisms of this observed hepatic hyperzincemia, relative transcript levels of hepatic-specific zinc transporters belonging to the ZIP and ZnT families were observed using RT-qPCR. The results obtained showed differences in the mRNA levels of zinc transporters in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Specifically, in 6-week-old animals there was an increase in the relative amount of mRNA for the ZIP9 and ZnT10 transporters. Furthermore, differences in relative mRNA abundance were observed between animals aged 6 weeks and older than 20 weeks, including decreased expression of ZIP7, ZIP9, ZnT4, ZnT6, and ZnT10 in animals older than 20 weeks. This suggests that there is indeed some connection between transcriptional regulation of hepatic zinc transporters and abnormal zinc concentrations as a result of elevated liver copper levels.",,"Meacham, K.;Burkhead, J.",2016,,,0,0,
1282,Development of a Copper-Sensitive Magnetic Resonance Contrast Agent,"Copper is the third most abundant trace metal in the body. Normally bound to important biomolecules, copper is an essential redox cofactor in various enzymatic reactions. Disruption of copper homeostasis is associated with a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Menkes, and Wilson diseases.1 Local copper concentrations can range from a few micromolars to several millimolars in these diseases.2 Early reports of copper-sensitive MRI agents showed that Zn<sup>2+</sup> interferes with the Cu<sup>2+</sup> response, limiting its use in diagnostic MRI applications.3 Here, we present the synthesis and MR properties of a new copper-sensitive contrast agent. for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This MR sensor consists of a DO3A gadolinium-based contrast agent into which a bis(benzoic acid)methyl)amine copper-selective recognition motif (L<inf>1</inf>) was introduced. The sensor shows a high selectivity to copper ions. It also exhibits high relaxivity (r<inf>1</inf>) with a 42% increase in relaxivity upon binding to 1 equivalent of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, only when fully bound to Cu<sup>2+</sup> does the sensor exhibit a 610% increase in r1 (~35 mM<sup>-1</sup>.s<sup>-1< /sup>) in the presence of physiological concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA), as reported solely for high-affinity zinc sensors (Figure 1).4 concentrations, paving the way for potential translation to preclinical imaging.

1283,Subclinical neurological involvement does not develop if Wilson's disease is treated early.,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism in which metallic deposits cause dysfunction in several organs, mainly in the liver and brain. If left untreated, WD is fatal, but early treatment results in a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the neurological status of early treated WD patients without overt nervous system impairment using neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging procedures at least 10 years after treatment initiation. Methods: Clinically assessed with the Global Assessment Scale. The presentation was hepatic in 36 subjects (95%), while 2 patients (5%) were diagnosed at a presymptomatic stage. A neurophysiological study was performed to explore the central motor conduction time of the upper and lower limbs, and the excitability of the motor cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of single pulses and paired pulses. Neuroimaging was obtained with brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive abilities and psychiatric and behavioral disorders were assessed with neuropsychological tests. TMS studies were also performed in a separate group of 15 WD patients with neurological signs (8 men and 7 women; mean age 28.2 +/- 12.1 years, mean duration of treatment 15.8 +/- 9, 14 years). Fifteen healthy subjects of the same age, education and sex, not affected by any neurological, psychiatric or other relevant clinical condition (10 women and five men; mean age 26.7 +/- 9.1 years; years of schooling 13, 2 +/- 2 4) served as a control group for clinical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric evaluation. Results: The patients were receiving treatment with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good adherence. They did not present any neurological signs in the clinical evaluation or in the specific scale of deterioration, the mean score of the Global Assessment Scale was 0.3+/-0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric evaluation ruled out subclinical involvement. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of WD can prevent the appearance of neurological damage, even at a subclinical level.",,"Ranucci, G.;Dubbioso, R.;Esposito, M.;Di Dato, F.;Leone, F.;Topa, A.;Quarantelli, M.;Matarazzo, M.;Santoro, L.;Manganelli, F.;Iorio, R.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,1,
1284,Autoimmune hepatitis or Wilson's disease or both? Challenging Case Analysis,"Objectives and study: The comorbidity of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and Wilson's disease (WD) can be considered, but has never been proven based on therapeutic response. There is a risk of misdiagnosis with the standard diagnostic approach. We describe difficult patients in whom the final diagnosis could not be established on the primary diagnostic approach and question the coexistence of AIH and WD. Methods: We identified 4 cases among 165 ED (diagnosis according to Ferenci score - FS) and 321 patients with AIH, in whom the primary diagnosis was changed or questioned. Results: 3 patients were diagnosed due to elevated serum transaminase (AT) activity and one due to acute liver failure. Case 1: Diagnosed with AIH by liver histology (steatohepatitis and fibrosis), ANA 1:640, IgG: 2824.5mg/dl, without performing LD tests. Prednisone and azathioprine (AZT) were not effective, and 1 year later a diagnosis of WD was made based on the results of ceruloplasmin, urine copper excretion, liver copper, and molecular testing. Penicillamine was introduced, steroids and AZT were withdrawn, leading to normal liver tests. Case 2: mainly did not meet WD criteria: ceruloplasmin 16 mg/dl, normal urinary copper excretion. Based on ANA 1:640 and ASMA 1:160, liver histology (severe inflammation and fibrosis) was started on prednisolone. After 1 year, the child developed psychiatric and neurological symptoms, MRI of the brain revealed abnormalities. Based on ceruloplasmin concentration, neurological symptoms, and molecular testing (1 mutation), WD was diagnosed and zinc therapy was started. Meanwhile, the patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The patient was treated with zinc, AZT and 5-ASA with good clinical and laboratory response. Case 3: had normal serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion. Based on histology (periportal inflammation), positive ANA 1:320 and ASMA 1:80, prednisolone was started. After 1 year, TAs were still elevated. In the 2nd diagnostic approach, WD was diagnosed based on ceruloplasmin 14mg/dl and molecular test (FS: 7 points). Penicillamine was started and steroids withdrawn, leading to normal liver function tests. Case 4: diagnosed with WD based on ceruloplasmin 16mg/dl, urinary copper excretion 4901ug/24h, KF ring present and molecular test (2 mutations) (FS: 9 points). Penicillamine was started but 1 month later due to hypertransaminasemia and positive ANA (1:40), ASMA (1:40) steroids were added. After the next 4 weeks, trientine was started and penicillamine was discontinued due to neutropenia. Steroid tapering led to a rise in BP, so steroids were continued. Liver biopsy performed after normalization of coagulation showed steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Conclusion: WD can usually be distinguished from AIH, but in selected cases the differential diagnosis is challenging. WD should be reassessed in patients with a poor response to steroids. In a large cohort of patients with WD and AIH, only one appears to have comorbidity, but even in this case, AIH was not fully confirmed.",,"Naorniakowska, M.;Wozniak, M.;Pronicki, M.;Kaminska, D.;Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,0,
1285,Predictors of liver steatosis and fibrosis measured by Fibroscan in children with Wilson's disease,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease in childhood can present with mild or significant liver injury as indicated by liver biopsy and liver function tests. Zinc or D-penicillamine (D-pen) appear to stop the progression of liver damage, but the efficacy of zinc is often questioned. Since liver biopsy is not usually repeated in the course of the disease, only surrogate markers can be used for the evaluation of liver disease. Recently, non-invasive transient elastography - Fibroscan (Echosens, France) has been applied in many chronic liver diseases to assess fibrosis and steatosis. Our aim was to assess liver disease progression and treatment response assessed by Fibroscan in relation to the extent and type of liver damage before treatment as assessed by liver histology and liver function tests. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed liver histology, liver copper content, and biochemical markers of 34 children with Wilson's disease aged 12.8+/-4.1 years at diagnosis and compared them with liver stiffness (LSM) and steatosis (CAP) using Fibroscan after median. 9.7-year period of treatment with zinc (n=21) or D-pen (n=13). In addition, the LSM and CAP results of patients with Wilson's disease were compared with a control group of 20 healthy controls aged 11.8+/-5.3 years. Liver histology was described semiquantitatively, including microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis (NAFLD scoring system modified by Kleiner et al.), portal and lobular inflammation, and cholestasis. Associations were tested with Spearman's R test and differences between groups were tested with Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The selected cohort of patients with Wilson's disease presented variable fibrosis (grade 3-4 in 13 patients), lobular inflammation (grade 2-3 in 2 pts), portal inflammation (grade 2-3 in 3 pts), microvesicular inflammation (grade 2-3 in 3pts) and macrovesicular steatosis (grade 2-3 in 12pts) and without cholestasis. There were no differences in pre-treatment parameters between children treated with Zn and D-pen. Liver fibrosis (LSM) assessed by Fibroscan was slightly but significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than in healthy controls [5 (4.1-6.1) vs. 4.2 (3.8-4.5) kPa ] and steatosis expressed by CAP also increased [252 (218-292) vs. 182 (119-194) dB/m]; p<0.05. We found a significant relationship between hepatic steatosis evaluated by Fibroscan (CAP) and macrovesicular hepatic steatosis in liver biopsy (r = 0.68), while LSM was not related to liver fibrosis. LSM correlated significantly with baseline total bilirubin levels (r = 0.4), but not with other liver function tests, ceruloplasmin, or liver copper content. We found no differences in the Fibroscan results between the groups treated with D-pen or zinc [LSM 5.4 (4.3-6.1) vs. 4.5 (4.1-5.8) kPa; CAP 251 (208-266) vs. 256 (235-307) dB/m]. Conclusion: Hepatic steatosis in children with Wilson's disease appears to be unresponsive to treatment and the extent of steatosis over the course of the disease is closely related to pre-treatment values. Fibrosis at the start of therapy is affected by treatment and can change significantly over time. D-pen and Zn therapy appear to be equally effective when tested with Fibroscan in children with mild liver injury.",,"Janczyk, W.;Pronicki, M.;Grajkowska, W.;Kaminska, D.;Kmiotek, J.;Naorniakowska, M.;Podlaska, M.;Socha, P.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,1,
1286,"Serum zinc levels discriminate ""indeterminate"" acute liver failure from ""Wilson's disease"" acute liver failure","Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Combined clinical and laboratory findings are needed for early diagnosis. There is a suggested hypothesis that low serum zinc (Zn) is related to the phenotypic severity of WD. Indeed, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a Zn-containing metalloenzyme reflecting that actual Zn deficiency is relatively low in WD patients, could support this assumption. However, few studies highlight the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis and severity of WD. Our study aimed to observe serum Zn values and other basic biomarkers in acute liver failure (AHF) of undetermined cause and WD. Methods: Retrospective data on children with WD (n=30) and indeterminate ALF (n=9) at King's College Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. WD patients were diagnosed using the King protocol and 23 patients were confirmed. by genetic analysis. WD is classified into WD-ALF and WD non-ALF. Serum Zn, copper, ceruloplasmin (CP), and liver function tests were recorded. Results: Our study demonstrates significantly lower serum Zn and corrected Zn in WD-ALF compared to WD non-ALF and ALF of undetermined cause. Conclusion: The present study showed that the dramatic aberration of serum Zn in WD-ALF can discriminate WD-ALF from indeterminate ALF.

1287,Brain MRI and spectroscopy in the diagnosis of early neurological involvement in Wilson's disease in children,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and other tissues, leading to hepatic and neuropsychiatric features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps in the diagnosis of neurological Wilson's disease. The literature on MR spectroscopy (MRS) in Wilson's disease is limited. The objective of this work was to evaluate the validity of brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in the early detection of central nervous system abnormalities in children with Wilson's disease. Methods: A case-control study was carried out in the Gastroenterology unit 'Department of Pediatrics and Department of Radiology' at Zagazig University Hospitals, Zagazig, Egypt, between March 2011 and March 2014 after approval. of the IRB. Twenty-six patients with Wilson's disease and 26 healthy volunteers were included. Detailed take on the story; A complete physical examination was performed, including regional anthropometric examination, complete abdominal examination, and neurological evaluation. Routine laboratory investigations included CBC' CRP' ESR, reticulocyte count, complete liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, immunoglobulin electrophoresis, and renal function tests. Specific investigations included serum ceruloplasmin level, 24-hour urine collection copper concentration, 24-hour urine collection copper concentration with D-penicillamine challenge test, autoantibody panel ( ANA, ASTHMA and ALKMA). Slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring and percutaneous liver biopsy for consistent liver histology (fatty changes or glycogenated nuclei). Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging were performed on all patients. Results: Eight patients showed abnormal magnetic resonance imaging in the form of bilateral increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia on axial T1-weighted MR images. Compared to control subjects, WD patients had highly significant decreases in N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine values (p<0.001) and significant decreases in N-acetyl aspartate/choline ratios, N -acetyl aspartate/creatine and choline/creatine (p<0.05) from the right basal ganglia. Patients complicated by liver cell failure had a highly significant decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (p<0.001) and a significant decrease in choline, creatine, N-acetyl aspartate/choline, N-acetyl aspartate/creatine, and choline/creatine ratios (p < 0.05) than uncomplicated patients. Conclusion: Abnormalities were detected on MRI in 8 patients out of 26 (30.7%), while MRI showed decreased N-aspartate acetyl, choline, creatinine, N-acetyl aspartate/choline, N-acetyl aspartate/creatine, and choline/creatine in all patients.

1288,Evaluation of exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper in ATP7b-/- mice,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene responsible for a toxic accumulation of copper, mainly in the liver and central nervous system. The diagnosis of WD is based on a combination of clinical and biological findings. Phenotypic heterogeneity can challenge diagnostic confirmation. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) and its derivative relative exchangeable copper (REC, CuEXC/total serum copper ratio, %) have recently been proposed as reliable diagnostic markers in WD. The aim of our study was to validate these new markers in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice, an animal model of WD. Methods: ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> (group a) and wild-type mice (WT, group b) were bred and investigated under the same conditions. The animals were classified by subgroups according to the age at sacrifice (group 1a and 1b = 6 weeks, 2a and 2b = 20 weeks, 3a and 3b = 40 weeks, 4a and 4b = 50 weeks). The following plasma data were compared between groups: liver function tests, serum copper (Cu), CuEXC, and REC. Histological analysis of the liver and determination of intrahepatic copper (CuIH) were also performed. One group of ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice received D-penicillamine treatment from week 40 until sacrifice at week 50 (Group 5). Results: 141 ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice and 117 WT mice were included in the study. No mice died prior to scheduled sacrifice. In the WT groups, histological analysis was consistently normal and Cu, CuIH, and CuEXC values remained stable over time. Histological analysis of ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a progressive development of chronic liver injury (group 1a: isolated moderate inflammation (48%), group 4a: inflammatory fibrosis (100%) with cirrhosis (65%). ) ). Cu, CuIH and CuEXC varied with time with maximum values at week 20 for CuIH and at week 40 for CuEXC and Cu. In each subgroup, CuIH and CuEXC were significantly higher in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to WT mice (p<0.005). The REC was also significantly higher in the ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice (mean, 37.9 vs. 11.2%, p<0.001). A cutoff value of 20% for REC provided a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100%, regardless of age, gender, or treatment use (Group 4a: 34.9% vs. Group 5: 33%). The copper binder significantly reduced liver fibrosis (p=0.03) and Cu (p=0.028) and decreased CuIH (p=0.29) and CuEXC (p=0.175). Conclusion: This study confirms the ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model as a reliable animal model of chronic copper overload liver disease. Relative exchangeable copper is a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker in this model. Further studies are needed to confirm that CuEXC is a good biomarker to monitor the evolution of mouse WD, particularly when copper chelators are used.",,"Heissat, S.;Bost, M.;Hervieu, V.;Brunet, A.

1289,Analysis of Treatments for Wilson's Disease Using Urine-Derived Patient-Specific Induced Pluripotent Stem (IPS) Cells,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease is a monogenetic disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism, resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. This causes a functional impairment of Cu excretion by the liver, followed by excessive Cu deposition in organs, mainly liver and brain. Patients show clinical heterogeneity ranging from acute or chronic liver failure and/or neurological symptoms. WD progression can be partially enhanced by zinc or chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine. Although these treatments are usually effective, serious side effects have been reported in a significant portion of WD patients. The molecular mechanisms of WD and the response to various treatments have not been fully characterized, as samples from WD patients for analysis are rare. Consequently, samples from WD patients are indispensable for examinations of the impact of ATP7B mutations on disease pathogenesis. The objective of the study is to generate a novel in vitro methodology to generate specific cells from WD patients that not only help to understand the pathogenesis, but also the efficacy of the drug. This approach can also be used as a tool to investigate new compounds as well as new gene correction methods. Methods: Urine from WD patients was processed for renal epithelial cell isolation, followed by reprogramming into WD-iPS cells using non-integrated episomal vectors. After characterization, WD-iPSCs were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells using crucial growth factors for 14 days. iPSC-Heps were characterized by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry before treatment with new chelating agents under various Cu conditions. Results: Stable cell colonies arose after culture of urine-derived cells and iPSCs generated by nucleofection with pluripotent character. iPSC-Heps were identified with similar morphology and gene expression (for example, ATP7B) compared to primary human hepatocytes. The results revealed a significant decrease in Cu content in WD iPSC-Heps after treatment with the new chelator compared to untreated WD iPSC-Heps. Conclusions: Our results indicate that iPSCs derived from urine cells of WD patients can be reprogrammed and differentiated into iPSC-Heps. WD iPSC-Heps will enable the establishment of a patient-specific in vitro platform to assess drug efficacy. Therefore, this technology seems well suited for disease modeling and will allow the evaluation of new drugs to improve WD therapy.",,"Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Guttmann, S.;Stella, J.;Chandhok, G.;Zischka, H.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1290,Retrospective study to evaluate the long-term results of trientine chelator-based treatment in patients with Wilson's disease who discontinued treatment with D-penicillamine,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of impaired hepatic copper excretion caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, resulting in copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and brain. It can be fatal if left untreated, with patients dying of liver failure or complications of progressive neurological disease. The chelating agent Trientine has been shown to be an effective second-line treatment for patients with Wilson's liver disease. This study aims to determine the long-term efficacy, that is, the clinical course of neurological disease and liver disease, the effects on copper metabolism and the safety and tolerability of the use of trientine chelator-based treatments after discontinuation of treatment with D-penicillamine. Methods: This is a retrospective, multicentre, non-randomized investigation in Europe, involving approximately 90 patients with Wilson's disease. Inclusion criteria include patients with WD diagnosed by a physician with a ""Leipzig"" score of >=3, aged between 6 and 90 years who have previously withdrawn from treatment with D-penicillamine and who have been treated subsequently. with Trientine for a minimum of 6 months. Withdrawal from D-penicillamine may be due to lack of efficacy, safety, tolerability, or other reasons. Results: Information will be collected for three endpoints.

1291,Prospective study to evaluate the long-term results of trientine treatment in patients with Wilson's disease withdrawn from D-penicillamine therapy.,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that encodes a membrane-bound enzyme responsible for copper transport in the liver. Wilson's disease patients suffer from poor copper metabolism, leading to copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and brain. Trientine, a chelating compound, is recommended as a second-line treatment for patients with Wilson's liver disease, as it leads to the removal of excess copper from the body and, as a result, prevents further accumulation of copper. This study aims to determine the clinical course of copper stores, neurological and liver disease, as well as the quality of life of patients with Wilson's disease after the start of treatment with trientine and after discontinuation of treatment with d -penicillamine. Methods: This is a prospective part of a nonrandomized, multicenter investigation involving approximately 55 patients with Wilson's disease. For this part of the study, only patients who were enrolled in the retrospective part of the study and continue to receive standard treatment with trientine were selected. The duration of the prospective trial is 12 months and assessments are performed at baseline (enrollment) and at 6 and 12 months after the baseline visit. During the three study visits. Results: The primary endpoint to be evaluated will be the percentage of patients with stable disease after 12 months of trientine treatment as scored by the investigators. The Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) will be measured at 6 and 12 months and compared to baseline data. In addition, an evaluation of serum and urinary parameters of copper metabolism will be performed at these times. Quality of life will also be measured. The time to discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events and/or inadequate response will also be evaluated. Conclusions: As a complement to the retrospective study, the results of this prospective study will inform the efficacy and safety of trientine, as well as provide valuable data on the quality of life in patients with Wilson's disease treated with trientine after discontinuation of trientine. d-penicillamine.",,"Weiss, K.

1292,Liver transplantation in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; the french experience,"Background and objectives: The standard treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) is a chelating agent of copper or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. The indication of HT in neurological forms without hepatic decompensation remains controversial. The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effect of HT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods: From 2002 to 2015, fifteen patients (mean age 20.4 [12-41] years) underwent LT in France for severe neurological complications without neurological improvement despite medical treatment, without acute liver failure. All patients received copper chelation and 3 patients received copper chelation with zinc salts. Three patients had worsened after temporary cessation of treatment without improvement after well-performed treatment. Results: The neurological symptoms were heterogeneous, combining dystonic postures, tremor, chorea and hypertonic akineto syndrome. The mean age at diagnosis of WD was 17.7 [6-39] years and the time interval between worsening and LT was 13 [4-24] months. The mean age at LT was 20.4 [12-41] years. All patients had a Child score A at LT, and analysis of the native liver confirmed cirrhosis. The mean follow-up time after LT was 52.5 [2-156] months. Eleven patients (73%, mean age 19 [12-30] years) with a mean follow-up of 56 [2-156] months had neurological improvement after LT, with a significant gain in quality of life. In 4 (27%) patients, this improvement continues. The remaining four patients (27%, mean age 24 [15-42] years) had no significant improvement in neurological symptoms and died of infectious complications, after a mean interval of 13 [2-36] months. Three of the four deceased patients had severe hypertonic akineto syndrome and one had rigid dystonia that limited movement and swallowing. There was no difference between the waiting time in the group of living patients and the group of deceased patients (12.5 [3-31] months vs. 13.7 [7-24] months, respectively). Conclusions: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in Wilson's disease for patients with worsening neurological symptoms despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with unfavorable evolution died due to severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms could be a pejorative factor.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Brunet, A.

1293,"An Ongoing Phase 2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of WTX101 in Newly Diagnosed Wilson's Disease Patients: Early Observations","Background and objectives: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational copper removal agent being developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease. The purpose of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease older than 18 years of age. Methods: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease who were treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for <=28 days with chelation or zinc therapy received WTX101 30 or 60 mg once daily during the initiation phase. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks, guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. Periodic assessments included safety, liver disease status including synthetic function and modified Nazer score, change from baseline in free copper (assessed as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) adjusted for plasma concentration molybdenum), additional copper endpoints, and neurological status using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first six patients (age 18-53 years; 2 men) were followed for 8-36 weeks in the study. Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5, and 5/6 had neurological manifestations at baseline. Reversible elevated liver function tests related to per-protocol dose increases were observed in the first 2 patients. After reducing the starting dose from 30 mg BID (fully 60 mg/day) to 30 mg QD and escalating the dose to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated with no SAAs and few AEs. Liver status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable. Initial elevated plasma molybdenum-adjusted NCC normalized on average within 3 months, with further reductions in NCC in the few patients who followed longer treatment. Other copper measurements (exchangeable copper, total serum copper, 24-hour urinary copper excretion) indicate a similar pattern of copper elimination. UWDRS scores improved in all patients with neurological manifestations. At 3 months, the neurological examination score (part III) was reduced from approximately 30 to <10, with continued improvement thereafter. Daily activity status (part II) showed a similar improvement. Conclusions: WTX101 appears safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. With improvement in clinical (liver and neurological) and laboratory evaluations, including copper monitoring in these early patients, further clinical evaluation is warranted to establish the efficacy and safety of WTX101 for the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K.

1294,Late-Onset Wilson's Disease: An Informed Diagnostic Dilemma,"Goals. This abstract presents a case of late-onset Wilson's disease in a patient with biopsy showing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods. This case report is based on a retrospective review of medical records. Results. This report presents the case of a 53-year-old obese Chinese woman with a history of ulcerative colitis, who was found to have transaminitis during a routine blood test. Abnormal liver enzyme testing revealed negative hepatitis B antigen, undetectable HBV DNA, negative immune markers, but low serum ceruloplasma (<0.08 g/L). He was also found to have elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Abdominal ultrasound showed moderate fatty infiltration of the liver. Copper excretion in 24-hour urine was performed and found to be elevated (1.69 mumol/d). Given her high urine copper excretion, she was more concerned about Wilson's disease. Slit-lamp examination showed no evidence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. He then underwent a liver biopsy that showed features consistent with moderate steatohepatitis suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, Wilson's disease. Quantification of copper in the liver parenchyma showed a dry weight of tissue copper of 4.42 mumol/g, which is consistent with the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The patient received a diagnosis of Wilson's disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Subsequent MRI revealed no central nervous system involvement of Wilson's disease. The patient was started on penicillamine at 750 mg and then counseled on weight loss strategies. Conclusions. Wilson's disease is classically described as a disease of children and young adults. However, there have been several case reports describing the disease in older adults. The diagnostic features and genetic background of patients with late-onset Wilson's disease are no different from those with early-onset. This case presents a diagnostic dilemma and approach to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in an older patient with a history, physical examination, and other findings consistent with NAFLD. The most common histologic abnormality seen in patients with Wilson's disease is steatohepatitis, which is also seen in NAFLD. As the prevalence and detection of NAFLD increases, so does the clinical suspicion. This case highlights the importance of considering the diagnosis of late-onset Wilson's disease in this population and presents an approach to diagnosis and treatment in such a patient.",,"Mitchell, R.;Ko, H.",2016,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4792898,0,0,
1295,Wilson's disease: acute dystonia during treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs,"Objectives: We present a patient with Wilson's disease who developed a partially reversible dystonia during treatment with venlafaxine or sertraline. Methods: A patient with genetically verified Wilson's disease (ATP7B p.Met769fs; p.His1069Gln comp. het.) was followed up clinically, examined with serial MRI, 18F-FDG-PET and 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT. Relevant literature was reviewed. Results: A 31-year-old man developed anxiety and depression. Treatment with venlafaxine 75 mg/day improved psychiatric symptoms but perioral dystonia occurred within 2 days. During medication with venlafaxine 150 mg/day, diplopia, action tremor and weakness were noted. Subsequently, Wilson's disease was diagnosed and copper chelation treatment with trientine dihydrochloride was started. Discontinuation of venlafaxine improved motor symptoms, but they returned after reinstatement during trientine treatment. Also under medication with sertraline 50 mg/d, there was perioral and lingual dystonia, dysarthria, blepharospasm, and gait disturbance, which were partially reversible when sertraline was discontinued. The patient's anxiety was symptomatically controlled with oxazepam without worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensities in the pons, midbrain, claustrum, and pyramidal tracts. Glucose metabolism and dopamine reuptake capacity were bilaterally reduced in the basal ganglia. Conclusions: Wilson's disease increases vulnerability to the side effects of SSRIs and SNRIs. Previously, acute dystonia has been described in a patient with WD receiving clomipramine [1]. Both the copper metabolism imbalance inherent in WD [2] and treatment with SSRIs [3,4] or SNRIs [5] are known causes of dystonia, and we suggest an additive effect when both factors were present simultaneously. The patient described showed imaging abnormalities in the midbrain and upper brain stem, suggesting involvement of monoaminergic neurons.",,"Wictor, L.;Wictorin, K.;Widner, H.;Puschmann, A.",2016,January,,0,0,
1296,Late-onset Wilson's disease with central pontine and extrapontine MRI changes,"Objectives: The classic radiological presentation of Wilson's disease (WD) with a ""giant panda"" face is typically used to distinguish WD from other extrapyramidal disorders. Central pontine myelinolysis-like (CPM-like) changes in WD are rarely reported and are distinct from the commonly known classical osmotic demyelination. Although CPM-like changes on MRI in young patients with WD are common, there are no published reports of such a radiological image in the rare cases of late-onset WD. We report a late-onset WD with sequential changes on MRI in response to copper removal therapy. Methods: A 64-year-old man with pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with a two-year history of worsening axial ataxia, postural, kinetic, and resting tremors, and cognitive impairment. His examination was also significant for generalized hyperreflexia, Babinski's sign, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed with low ceruloplasmin and with the presence of a homozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene. Results: MRI at symptom onset showed diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the pons adjacent to midbrain hyperintensity, as well as focal hyperintensity in the left thalamus and generalized cortical atrophy. After nine months of trientine chelation, partial resolution of T2 hyperintensity in the pons was observed, while hyperintensity in the thalamus became less noticeable. Conclusions: WE should be considered in all patients who present hepatic or neurological symptoms without a definitive diagnosis, regardless of age. Radiological changes similar to WD and CPM in older adult patients with WD may not be recognized, but genetic confirmation and clinical examination findings should guide treatment.",,"Biller, T.;Fatterpekar, G.;Nirenberg, M.;Brys, M.",2016,January,,0,0,
1297,Zinc and copper in Alzheimer's disease,"In a recent meta-analysis by Ventriglia and colleagues studying the association of zinc levels with Alzheimer's disease (AD), serum zinc was found to be significantly decreased in AD patients compared to healthy controls. However, such a finding does not necessarily propose a causal role for low zinc status in the pathophysiology of this neurodegenerative disease. Based on the available evidence, free copper toxicosis may play a causal role in age-related AD, and zinc therapy may be a rational causal treatment. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial testing a definitive hypothesis is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the value of zinc supplementation in the treatment of AD.

1298,A child with elevated aminotransferases on physical exam - Two new missense mutations associated with Wilson's disease were found. [Chinese],"3-year-old boy had abnormal liver function, found on physical examination, for 5 months before admission. She had no symptoms such as anorexia, lack of appetite, and jaundice, had normal growth and development, and did not have hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory examination revealed significantly reduced ceruloplasmin (35 mg/L), as well as negative hepatotropic virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. There were normal muscle enzymes, blood glucose and blood ammonia, and negative liver-specific autoantibodies. The child had a negative KF ring and normal 24-hour urine copper (0.56 mmol/L). Testing of the ATP7B gene for the boy, his sister, and their parents detected two new missense mutations in the boy and his sister, namely compound heterozygous mutations in exon 7 (c.2075T>C, p.L692P) and the exon 13 (c .3044T>C, p.L1015P), which were inherited from their father and mother, respectively. Wilson's disease was confirmed by genetic diagnosis in the boy and his sister. The boy and his sister received a low-copper diet. The child was given penicillamine to remove copper and supplemental zinc against copper uptake. His sister received zinc supplementation only because no clinical symptoms were observed. The child showed normal liver function on reexamination after 3 months of treatment. Copyright Â© 2015 Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics.",,"Zhu, Y.;Deng, S. Y.;Wan, C.

1300,Protection conferred by chelation therapy in diabetics after myocardial infarction could be replicated by high-dose zinc supplementation,"The recent Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) study, which enrolled subjects who had previously suffered a myocardial infarction, provided strong evidence that intravenous chelation therapy can markedly reduce the risk of mortality and vascular events in diabetics, while no discernible benefit was seen in undiagnosed patients. - diabetics. It has been plausibly suggested that this reflects a role for transition metal ions (iron or copper) in the genesis of advanced glycation end products, key mediators of diabetic complications that can destabilize plaque. Given that phlebotomy therapy fails to prevent vascular events in diabetics, we hypothesize that labile copper may be the main culprit whose removal by chelation mediated the benefit seen in TACT. If so, strategies that require less time and labor than chelation therapy might provide comparable benefit. Several recent studies report that trientine, a specific orally active chelator of copper, can reduce the risk of a variety of diabetic complications in rodents; a clinical trial with this agent demonstrated some decrease in left ventricular mass in diabetics with ventricular hypertrophy. However, until this agent becomes less expensive, high-dose zinc supplementation may represent a more feasible alternative. Zinc opposes the absorption and redox activity of copper through the induction of the antioxidant protein metallothionein, which binds strongly to copper. A large number of studies demonstrate that increased metallothionein expression reduces the risk of tissue damage in diabetic rodents, and in some of these studies, metallothionein expression was enhanced by zinc supplementation. Zinc supplementation also modestly improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetics and may reduce diabetes risk by protecting pancreatic beta cells from oxidative stress. A long-term study evaluating the impact of high-dose zinc supplementation in diabetics, assessing the risk of mortality, vascular events, and diabetic complications, may be warranted. Histidine, which readily forms complexes with copper that possess superoxide dismutase activity, also has the potential to alleviate the contribution of loosely bound copper to AGE formation; Furthermore, in a recent clinical study, supplemental histidine improved insulin sensitivity and exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in women with metabolic syndrome. Since ascorbate can reduce labile copper and thus enhance its pathogenicity, the impact of high-dose ascorbate supplementation on cardiovascular risk in diabetics should receive further study.

The clinical features associated with WD are highly varied. However, the subtypes generally reflect neurological, hepatic, and psychiatric symptoms. This case study reports two brothers recently diagnosed with WD. Neurological symptoms and cognitive deficits were exhibited in one brother (BL) in the form of extrapyramidal features, while the other brother (AL) only exhibited hepatic symptoms. Extensive neuropsychological tests were performed on both siblings to compare cognitive profiles. BL results indicated significantly impaired motor functioning and information processing speed, which significantly affected him in school. Aspects of executive dysfunction were also evident in addition to reduced visual and verbal memory, working memory, and attention. The AL results revealed evidence of verbal memory difficulties and aspects of executive dysfunction. A comparison of the distinct and common cognitive characteristics of the cases presented is made in terms of implications for early intervention and management of cognitive difficulties.

1307,Peripheral small fiber neuropathy in Wilson's disease: an in vivo documentation by corneal confocal microscopy,"OBJECTIVE. Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that leads to copper accumulation in hepatocytes and in extrahepatic organs such as the brain and cornea. The aim of this study was to investigate central corneal changes and, in particular, to assess corneal subbasal nerve plexus (SBNP) parameters in patients affected by WD, using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). METHODS. A total of 24 WD-affected patients and 24 healthy controls were included in this comparative cross-sectional study. One eye of each subject was examined to quantify different corneal parameters. Mean cell diameter and mean cell density of the epithelium; fiber number (NF), nerve fiber length density (NFLD), number of branches (NBr), number of beads (NBe), and fiber tortuosity (FT) of the SBNP; mean cell density of anterior, middle, and posterior stromal keratocytes; and the mean cell density, polymegatism and pleomorphism of the endothelium and central corneal sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS. Wilson's disease induced significant alterations in SBNP and corneal epithelium. The NFLD (P < 0.0001), NF (P < 0.001), NBe (P < 0.025) and NBr (P < 0.0001) were significantly lower, while FT (P < 0.0001) was significantly higher. in WD subjects compared to controls. In addition, mean epithelial cell diameter (P < 0.0001) and mean epithelial cell density (P < 0.0001) were significantly larger and smaller compared to controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The MCC showed significant corneal changes in SBNP, with concomitant changes in the corneal epithelium in WD, demonstrating the presence of small fiber peripheral neuropathy in these patients. The MCC can contribute to the diagnosis and follow-up of peripheral nervous system involvement in WD. Copyright Â© 2015, The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

The age of onset is highly variable, but EMIs mainly affect the pediatric population. However, in recent decades, advances in management and new therapeutic approaches have led to improvements in IEM patient care. As a result, many IEM patients survive into adulthood and develop their own set of complications. Also, some IEMs will present in adulthood. It is important for internists to be knowledgeable and familiar with these conditions because it is predicted that more and more adult IEM patients will need continuity of care in the near future. The review will focus on Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, citrin deficiency, and HFE-associated hemochromatosis, which are typically found in the adult population.

Synapses accumulate cognitive information from lifelong alterations in their molecular and structural composition. Current memory storage models identify post-translational modification essential for short-term information storage and mRNA translation for long-term information storage. However, the precise explanation for these modifications has not been summarized at the individual synapse level. Therefore, here we describe the spatiotemporal reorganization of synaptic plasticity at the dendritic spine level to elucidate the mechanism through which synaptic substructures are remodeled; although at the molecular level, such mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, it has been concluded that the existing mechanisms do not fully elaborate the memory storage processes. Therefore, further efforts are encouraged to delineate the mechanism of neuronal connectivity at the chemical level, including intermolecular or intramolecular binding patterns at the synaptic level, which may be a vital and permissive step of memory storage.

1312,Pregnancy and childbirth in women with esophageal varices due to hepatic vein thrombosis,"Objective: Retrospective analysis of the course of pregnancy, labor and mode of anesthesia in women with portal hypertension and esophageal varices induced by portal vein thrombosis. Material: From 2000 to 2012, seven pregnant women were admitted. None had a liver transplant (Ltx), the varices have been in the 1st stage. Each of them has been consulted by the obstetrician, the transplant surgeon and the anesthesiologist. The status of the patients during pregnancy, labor and the puerperium was analyzed. Results: The pregnancy in five cases passed physiologically. In a spontaneous abortion threat was diagnosed and treated with gestagens, two patients had tocolytics. One required varicose vein banding twice. In three the thrombocytopenia worsened, with platelet count <70g/L (up to 59g/L). They received platelet transfusion before delivery. In one case there was significant hypoproteinemia (4.7g/L). G1 GDM and oligohydramnios were found in one case. All women delivered at term (37-40Hbd). All underwent general anesthesia with the use of remifentanil. There were no fluctuations in MAP and HR. The incision time for delivery was 2.5 min. The time from opioid administration to delivery was <4 min. All children were born in good condition, weight percentile 10-90. Regional anesthesia is contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia. In patients with esophageal varices, the sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure can cause bleeding. Conclusion: Patients with portal hypertension can deliver at term. It is a high-risk pregnancy. In this group, it is desirable to shorten the second stage of labor or complete it by cesarean section under general anesthesia with remifentanil, which allows the desired analgesia to be obtained without complications in the newborn. Surveillance of pregnant women with portal hypertension should include monitoring of liver function and coagulation disorders. Copyright Â© 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

1316,No increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Wilson's disease cirrhosis during long-term follow-up,"Background and objectives: Data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Wilson's disease are scarce. We determined the risk of HCC in a well-defined cohort of Wilson's patients. Methods: All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease (Leipzig score >=4) at three Dutch referral university hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. The end of follow-up was defined as the date of HCC diagnosis, liver transplant, death, or last available hospital visit. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed to determine the incidence and mortality rate of HCC in Wilson's disease based on all published cohorts. Results: In total, 130 patients with Wilson's disease were followed up for a median follow-up of 15 years (range 0.1-51.2). At baseline, cirrhosis was present in 74 patients (57% of the total: 64% compensated and 36% decompensated). At the end of follow-up, liver disease severity improved, stabilized, or worsened in 20%, 46%, and 24% of all cases (10% unknown), respectively. Two patients developed HCC (one despite excellent copper clearance after 50 years of follow-up, the other with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease). The estimated annual risk of HCC for all patients was 0.09% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.28). Subgroup analysis in cirrhotic patients revealed an annual risk of HCC of 0.14% (95% CI: 0.02-0.46). Meta-analysis showed an annual HCC risk of 0.04% (95% CI: 0.01-0.10) and a HCC mortality rate of 2.6/10,000 person-years (95% CI: 0 .7-7.0). Conclusions: Even in case of cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is low in Wilson's disease. Our data do not support regular surveillance for HCC in Wilson's disease.

1317,Effects of tetrathiomolybdate and penicillamine on free copper and hydroxyl radical levels in the brain: an in vivo microdialysis study,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of excessive accumulation of copper. The commonly used drug d-penicillamine (PA) or trientine cause a high incidence (10-50%) of neurological worsening, which rarely occurs with tetrathiomolybdate (TM) treatment. To investigate the mechanisms of neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy, brain hydroxyl radical and free copper were assessed in vivo in this study. On days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after PA or TM administration, striatal hydroxyl radical levels of TX mice and controls were assessed by terephthalic acid (TA) combined with microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). Within the same microdialysis samples, free copper was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that both hydroxyl radical and free copper were markedly increased in the striatum of TX mice during PA administration, but not increased when TM was administered. These results suggested that the greater increase in free copper in the brain and the oxidative stress caused by some chelators could contribute to neurological deterioration.

1318,Wilson's disease caused by alternative splicing and exonation of Alu due to a homozygous 3039 bp deletion spanning intron 1 to exon 2 of the ATP7B gene,"We describe a case of Wilson's disease (WD) diagnosed at 5 years after routine biochemical tests showed elevated aminotransferases. Mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed a 3039 bp deletion in the homozygous state extending from the terminal part of intron 1 to nt position 368 of exon 2. This deletion results in the activation of 3 cryptic splice sites: an AG acceptor splice site at nt positions 578-579 producing a different breakpoint and deleting the first 577 nts of exon 2, an acceptor and donor splice site at nt positions 20363-4 and 20456-7 , respectively, in intron 1, resulting in the activation of a cryptic 94-bp Alu exon that is incorporated into the mature transcript. The resulting alternative transcript contains a TAG stop codon at the first amino acid position of the cryptic exon, which probably produces a truncated, non-functional protein. This study shows that intron exonization can also occur in humans through naturally occurring large deletions. The results suggest that the combination of DNA and RNA analysis can be used for the molecular characterization of macroscopic ATP7B deletions, thus improving genetic counseling and diagnosis of WD. In addition, these studies help to better establish the new molecular mechanisms that produce Wilson's disease. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier BV.",,"Mameli, E.;Lepori, M.

1321,Wilson's disease in association with anetoderma,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper homeostasis with predominantly hepatic and neuropsychiatric involvement. Anetoderma is a rare benign condition with focal damage to the dermal elastic tissue. Previous reports described this skin disorder in association with prolonged d-penicillamine therapy. Case presentation: A 26-year-old man was referred for evaluation of asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase levels. Investigations showed negative markers for autoimmune and chronic viral hepatitis, low ceruloplasmin level, and increased urinary excretion of copper. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderate activity and severe bridging fibrosis. Mutation analysis found a compound heterozygous genotype and supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Skin lesions consisting of numerous white to pale papules less than 7-8 mm in diameter with central protrusion located on the upper body were also noted at the time of primary physical examination. Primary anetoderma was established based on presentation and skin biopsy findings. Therapy with d-penicillamine at a daily dose of 1500 mg was started and, during a 12-month follow-up, the aminotransferase decreased to normal and the skin lesions remained unchanged. Conclusion: In our opinion, the case is the first reported association between Wilson's disease and primary anetoderma. The possible mechanism behind this relationship is discussed.

[Japanese],"37-year-old male patient presented with psychiatric symptoms, dysarthria, limb dystonia, increased tendon reflexes, and a Kayser-Fleischer ring in his late teens. Laboratory tests showed decreased concentrations of serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and elevated levels of urinary copper. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high signal intensity lesions in the bilateral putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and brainstem on T<inf>2</inf> (T<inf>2</ inf>WI). Based on the results of the MRI and laboratory data, we diagnosed this patient with Wilson's disease (WD). He was treated with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate. Four months after the start of treatment, the patient's symptoms began to improve. On a follow-up MRI obtained 6 years after treatment, the high signal intensity lesions in the T<inf>2</inf>WI had completely disappeared. However, the low signal intensity lesions in the basal ganglia had spread to the caudate nuclei. Here, we discuss the characteristics of the MRI changes in WD after treatment. The pathological basis for the low signal intensity lesions in T<inf>2</inf>WI in WD remains unclear.

1325,Increased prevalence of subcutaneous lipomas in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objectives: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of lipomas in patients with Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in the accumulation of copper in the liver and central nervous tissue. The authors often observed subcutaneous lipomas during clinical examinations of patients with Wilson's disease. This is the first study to analyze the prevalence and progression of lipoma development in patients with Wilson's disease. Study: Eighty consecutive patients attending a tertiary care center were examined for the presence of subcutaneous lipomas. Results: Subcutaneous lipomas could be detected during examination in 21 (26%) of the 80 patients with Wilson's disease. Multiple subcutaneous lipomas were present in 16 (76%) of the 21 affected patients. Lipomas were found mainly on the extremities and trunk. Neither the initial presentation nor the discovery treatment influenced the presence or evolution of lipomas in these patients. Conclusions: The formation of subcutaneous lipomas is more frequent in patients with Wilson's disease than in the general population. We suggest that the presence of lipomas contributes to the differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Copyright Â© 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Schaefer, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1327,An obese patient with altered liver enzymes: Not always non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [Dutch],"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in the Western world. Even in patients with multiple risk factors for metabolic syndrome, one must remain vigilant and exclude other causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and storage diseases. If treatment of NAFLD by weight loss does not result in improvement of abnormal liver tests, further investigation is warranted. One of the best known mimics of NAFLD is Wilson's disease. This is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the affected tissues, mainly in the liver and brain. Liver disease in Wilson's disease can present with a wide spectrum of abnormalities, ranging from asymptomatic abnormal liver tests to liver cirrhosis and even acute liver failure. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease is extremely important as the disease is universally fatal if left untreated.

Our knowledge of Wilson's disease has increased dramatically; however, the understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation and the multiple effects of copper toxicity as a basis for targeted and individualized therapy strategies is still insufficient. Clinical manifestations include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, and psychiatric disorders.

Abnormal copper metabolism is reported to have been associated with cardiovascular disease. BNP and MMP2/9 were biomarkers for congestive heart failure (CHF). There is a rare study to explore whether serum concentrations of BNP, MMP2, or MMP9 are altered in WD patients. In this study we determined whether serum concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 are increased in WD patients. Serum BNP, MMP2, and MMP9 were measured by ELISA in 34 hepatic WD patients, 68 neurologic WD patients, and 33 healthy controls. We found that serum BNP levels were higher in neurological WD patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.033). Serum levels of MMP2 were higher in patients with hepatic (p = 0.009) and neurological (p = 0.0004) WD than in controls. Serum levels of MMP9 were higher in patients with neurological WD than in patients with hepatic WD (p = 0.002) and controls (p = 0.00005), and were higher in patients with hepatic WD than in controls (p = 0). .03).

Long Evans cinnamon rats rarely exhibit neurological symptoms that preclude the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WD patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate for 90 days, especially on copper and zinc levels in liver, kidney, and brain tissues; hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene expression; and MT-III and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene in brain, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioral functions of male Wistar rats, and therapeutic evaluation of D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles administered orally for 90 days in Wistar rats intoxicated with Cu. Reverse transcription PCR and the Morris water maze test were used for expression and neurobehavioral studies. Copper-intoxicated animals showed a significant increase in ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper levels and decreased serum acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, increased hepatic MTI gene expression with impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. However, no changes were observed in the expression levels of the hepatic Atp7b gene; and MT-III and AChE gene in the brain. Cu-intoxicated rats revealed a significant increase in copper content in liver, brain, and kidney tissues (99.1, 73, and 74.9% increase, respectively), decreased liver zinc (decreased 40%) and, interestingly, increased brain zinc content (77.1% increase) compared to control rats. Histopathological studies demonstrated grade 4 copper deposits in the liver and grade 1 copper-associated protein in liver tissues of test rats by staining with rhodanine and orcein, respectively. Astrocyte swelling was observed in cerebral cortex sections of brain tissues from Cu-intoxicated rats. D-penicillamine-encapsulated chitosan/alginate nanoparticle therapy resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain Cu content, serum ceruloplasmin level, and an increase in serum AChE activity with improvement in liver and brain functions. neurological In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity can lead to increased liver and brain copper content, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, ceruloplasmin levels, and neurobehavioral alterations that may be modulated by interfering with neurotransmission. by acetylcholine; however, encapsulated D-penicillamine nanoparticles can reverse deficiencies caused by chronic Cu intoxication to a significant degree in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.;Vasishta, R.

1336,Surviving a Wilsonian crisis without a liver transplant,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD), a disorder of copper excretion, is a rare but important indication for urgent liver transplantation. Chelation therapy is ineffective in acute Wilsonian crisis, requiring liver transplantation as the treatment of choice. Case Report: A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after feeling weak, fatigued, complaining of RUQ abdominal pain and hematuria for 5 days. She experienced increasing weakness for the past 4 months, loss of singing voice, and had symptoms of biliary colic with fatty foods. She recently started birth control, but had no other medical history. On admission he presented jaundice with total bilirubin 10.8, direct bilirubin 3.1, AST 177, ALT 11, alkaline phosphatase 8, albumin 3.4, INR 1.6, hemoglobin 6.6, MCV 112, white blood cells 18.0 , platelets 195, creatinine 1.47, bilirubinuria and bilateral pleural effusions. Abdominal ultrasound revealed ascites, a dilated common bile duct, and biliary sludge. She was admitted to the PICU. He had coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, which required seven units of blood in seven days. He had a paracentesis on day two with SAAG consistent with portal hypertension. The patient underwent an extensive study while hospitalized with no responses and on the third day started taking steroids empirically. His ceruloplasmin was 21, which is low normal. He underwent liver biopsy during cholecystectomy for persistent pain in the RUQ, which showed cirrhosis and swollen glycogen-rich hepatocytes, suggestive of glycogen storage disease; this returned after his discharge. She recovered from hemolytic anemia and was sent home on day fourteen on steroids. She followed up with GI and 24 hour urine copper was ordered and 144 cups of copper were found. Prompt referral to ophthalmology revealed Kayser-Fleisher rings. He was diagnosed with WD and started on Trientine. Follow-up labs revealed a decrease in urinary copper, an ATP7B gene mutation, and improvement in her singing voice and fatigue. This case represents an often fatal presentation of WD without transplantation. This patient survived without transplant and I wonder if steroids played a role in her improvement without transplant. It also serves as a reminder of the complexity of recognizing WD in an acute environment.",,"Mohrhardt, L. S.;Wisser, K.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2015.270,0,0,

The majority of patients (72%) were diagnosed before the age of 30 years and 1.4% had an additional disease code for neurological/psychological disease. Liver cirrhosis and liver cancer were detected in 33.2% and 9.9%, respectively. Liver transplantation was performed in 4.6% of patients. D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc were prescribed for 58.3%, 29.7%, and 13.9% of patients, respectively. The median annual total medical cost per person for WD was $1,643.15. Conclusion: The prevalence of WD was slightly lower in Korea than in other countries, showing an increase since 2009. Since approximately one-third of WD patients had advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis and cancer, more efforts for diagnosis are warranted. and early treatment of WD. especially during the pediatric age.",,"Baeg, J.

1338,Functional analysis and pharmacological response to zinc and D-penicillamine in stable ATP7B mutant liver cell lines,"Objective: To evaluate the in vitro functional analysis and the pharmacological response to treatment with zinc (Zn) and D-penicillamine (DPA) of the most common disease-causing ATP7B mutations observed in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B. More than 600 disease-causing mutations are described. If left untreated, WD is fatal. Drugs commonly used to reverse Cu toxicity in WD include direct chelation by DPA or metallothionein induction by Zn salts. The impact of these drugs on the rescue of hepatocytes carrying individual mutations is unknown. Methods: Common homozygous mutations in Europe/USA were selected. USA, Asia and India for functional analysis. An ATP7B knockout hepatic cell line previously established by our group (PLoS ONE, 9:e98809, 2014) was used to generate stable mutant cell lines. ATP7B gene and protein expression was determined for all mutant cell lines. Cu-induced cell survival, apoptosis and intracellular trafficking were studied. Cell viability versus Cu toxicity was determined with treatment with Zn, DPA, or both. Results: ATP7B mRNA was similar, while protein expression varied between the different mutant cell lines. Colocalization studies with the late endosome lysosome marker lamp2 suggested impaired trafficking in the presence or absence of Cu. All mutant cell lines showed different degrees of ATP7B activity against Cu-induced toxicity and apoptosis, with p.H1069Q showing moderate ATP7B activity. On treatment with Zn, DPA, or both, most cell lines showed a characteristic response to treatment. DPA was more effective than Zn in rescuing cells against Cu toxicity. Only the combination with Zn and DPA treatment was able to rescue the mutant cells similarly to the wild type. Conclusions: The study provided information on the genotype-phenotype correlation in WD. Different ATP7B mutations showed variable sensitivity to Cu with high/moderate and low ATP7B activity. Individual ATP7B mutations showed a genotype-specific response to treatment. Combined treatment with Zn and DPA showed maximal liver cell survival. Our data suggest that the prognosis of WD patients may benefit from knowledge of mutation-specific in vitro functional analysis and the use of Zn/DPA combination therapy.",,"Chandhok, G.;Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1339,Hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Wilson's disease: results from a single center registry of 262 patients.,"Introduction: Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a well-recognized complication of cirrhosis of various aetiologies, HCC is believed to be extremely rare in Wilson's disease. Around 30 cases have been reported worldwide illustrating the rarity of this complication. We conducted this study to determine the frequency and characteristics of HCC in a cohort of 262 patients over 19 years. Patients and methods: We reviewed the medical records of patients with Wilson's disease from the Wilson's disease registry maintained from 1996 to 2014. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on a score > 4 developed by the Leipzig international group (J Hepatol 2012 ;56:671-85). The patients were treated with D-penicillamine with or without zinc sulfate. The patients were followed up regularly at intervals of 3 to 6 months. Patients with HCC were initially evaluated by ultrasonography of the abdomen followed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Results: We identified 3 cases of HCC among 262 patients with Wilson's disease. All 3 had cirrhosis with portal hypertension at diagnosis evidenced by esophageal varices and ascites. The characteristics of these patients are shown in the table. All three had multicentric HCC and presented with resistant complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, resistant ascites, and one with hemoperitoneum. Given the advanced nature of HCC at presentation, only supportive treatment could be given. Conclusions: The incidence of HCC in a large cohort of 262 patients is 1.1%. Although low, WD patients are also at risk for HCC. HCC appears to be aggressive in our Wilson's disease cohort. Patients with Wilson's disease should undergo regular screening for early detection of HCC similar to other etiologies. Those who are not sufficiently chelated appear to be at increased risk of HCC.

1340,Zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: an experience from two centers in Japan,"Purpose: We previously reported that a reasonable goal in treating young pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) using zinc is to maintain 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the first 1 to 2 years. (Mizuochi, et al.JPGN 2011;53:365). Here, our aim was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with WD and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective and prospective study to examine 7 girls (median age 5 years, range 4-8) who met diagnostic criteria for WD and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to the onset of symptoms in Kurume University Hospital and Okinawa Chubu Hospital. in Japan. No additional sequelae of WD, such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities, were observed. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 2 to 7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. Additional controls included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, total serum bilirubin, albumin, iron, amylase, lipase, and prothrombin time, as well as 24-hour urinary zinc excretion. We performed an abdominal ultrasound and evaluated the clinical manifestations of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for patients <= 5 years 25 mg twice daily; for those children 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the dose of zinc if the patients had AST/ALT > 50 U/L, and decreased it if they had adverse effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At diagnosis, AST/ALT and copper in 24-hour urine were 207+/-182/292+/-211 U/L and 143+/-68 Âµg/day (7.2+/-3.5 Âµg/kg /day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 7 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased dramatically to 35+/-7/37+/-16 U/L 1 year after treatment and remained mostly below 50U/L for the rest of the study (AST/ALT: 35+/-9 /42+/-29 and 33+/-9/41+/-17 U/L at 2 and 6 years of treatment, respectively). Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased to 54+/-18 cups/day (2.3+/-0.6 cups/kg/day) one year after treatment and remained mainly between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day during the rest of the study (1.7+/-0.7 and 1.9+/-0.9 mug/kg/day at 2 and 6 years after treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with presymptomatic WD has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with WD using zinc appears to be to maintain both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion to between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day.",,"Eda, K.;Iwama, I.;Takeuchi, T.;Takaki, Y.;Mizuochi, T.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.28235,0,0,
1341,Effect of treatment with chemical chaperones and zinc acetate on hepatocytes treated with excess copper,"[Purpose] Copper is an essential trace element in human activity. But excess copper harms human activity. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive copper deposition in various organs. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to liver disease progression in Wilson's disease. Oxidative stress induces the accumulation of abnormal proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a subcellular organelle that plays the role of proper protein folding. Accumulation of misfolded proteins disrupts ER homeostasis, leading to ER stress. Zinc acetate has been commonly used to treat Wilson's disease because it increases metallothionein production and inhibits copper absorption in the intestinal epithelium. The effects of chemical chaperones and zinc acetate on copper-induced hepatotoxicity have not been examined. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chemical chaperone and zinc acetate on copper-induced alteration of cellular homeostasis. [Methods] We used the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and the immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29). The following materials were used: copper sulfate; acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal and epoxomicin as proteasome inhibitors (PIs); batocuproin disulfonate as a copper chelator; n-acetyl-l-cysteine; zinc acetate; 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) as chemical chaperones. We detect reactive oxygen species using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein. We analyzed copper-induced ER stress by immunoblotting for ER stress markers, including eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phospho alpha subunit and X-box binding protein 1. Apoptosis of copper-treated hepatocytes with or without PI was determined by detection of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase and caspase 3 by immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. In addition, we examined cell proliferation in excess copper using Ki67 immunofluorescence staining. [Results] Excess copper induced oxidative stress and ER stress. Chemical chaperones and zinc acetate reduced copper-induced oxidative stress and ER stress. Co-treatment of copper and PI exacerbated copper-induced apoptosis. Although excess copper led to a reduction in cell proliferation, chemical chaperones rescued the proliferation block in copper-treated cells. However, zinc acetate did not exert this effect. [Conclusions] Hepatotoxicity induced by excess copper. Chemical chaperones, PBA and UDCA, and zinc acetate reduced hepatotoxicity. These results suggest that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson's disease. On the other hand, zinc acetate used as a treatment for Wilson's disease can directly inhibit liver injury.",,"Oe, S.;Miyagawa, K.;Honma, Y.;Harada, M.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.28214,0,0,
1342,Is serum copper concentration related to implantation?,"OBJECTIVE: Copper-containing contraceptive devices are thought to cause deposition of copper ions in the endometrium, leading to implantation failure. Similarly, patients with untreated Wilson's disease generally exhibited subfertility and/or early pregnancy loss. These zinc-treated patients gave birth successfully. These observations lead to the hypothesis that infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations may cause implantation failure. This study is to investigate whether serum copper concentration is related to the pregnancy rate of the human embryo in vivo. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 408 patients, with a mean age of 34.2 years, who underwent freeze-thaw embryo transfer between December 2014 and March 2015, with the same hormone replacement cycle protocol (with Estradiol > 140 pg/mL, Progesterone > 10 ng/mL on the day of transfer), with good blastocyst (3BB or more with Gardner classification), were included in the study. Pregnancy test (serum hCG), serum copper, zinc, and ceruloplasmin concentrations were measured 16 days after the first date of progesterone replacement. One hundred pregnant women without abortion at 10 weeks' gestation (P group) and 176 nonpregnant women (NP group) were compared. Student's t-test was used for comparison between two groups. The cut-off line was determined by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, and the Chi-square test was used for the 2x2 contingency table. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Age was not different between the two groups. The copper concentration of the NP group (mean of 192.3 mg/dL) was significantly higher than that of the P group (mean of 179.7 mg/dL), and the zinc concentration of the NP group (mean of 75.5 mg/dL) was significantly lower than that of group P (average 90.3mg/dL). All patients had a normal ceruloplasmin level (mean 39.4 mg/dL), refusing Wilson's disease. According to the ROC curve of copper concentration and pregnancy outcome, the negative/positive cut-off point was set at 159/160 (P=0.004 with Chi-square test). With this cut-off point, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88, 0.26, 0.68, and 0.54, respectively. Copper concentration was not related to age, estradiol, progesterone, or hCG. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum copper levels may be an independent risk factor for implantation failure. A prospective study is necessary to reveal the causal relationship.",,"Matsubayashi, H.;Kitaya, K.;Yamaguchi, K.;Nishiyama, R.;Takaya, Y.;Ishikawa, T.",2015,September,,0,0,
1343,Fatal copper toxicity despite early aggressive interventions,"Background: Copper sulfate (CuSO4) is highly toxic at doses of 0.15-0.3 g/kg with consequent hemolysis and multiple organ failure. There is no consensus on the optimal means of enhancing clearance in cases of severe copper (Cu) toxicity. Case presentation: A 19-year-old woman ingested >10g of CuSO4 solution, obtained from her mother who was a chemist. He had abdominal pain and blue emesis. Examination revealed hypersalivation and tachycardia. She was intubated due to hypoxia and aspiration. Early bronchoscopy revealed tracheobronchitis and segmental bronchial blue-green staining that was irrigated for decontamination. Endoscopy revealed grade 2 esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, and ulcerations. Late on the first day of hospitalization, he developed significant hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and anuric renal failure. He started with 1.5 g of penicillamine due to a national shortage of edetate calcium disodium and dimercaprol. Trientine was not available. He received treatment with hemodialysis (HD), exchange transfusions, methylene blue, zinc and folate. Blood drawn in the emergency department, obtained on the third day of hospitalization, revealed a serum Cu level > 500 Âµg/dl. Cu was undetectable in the dialysis fluid after two courses of HD. His renal function did not improve and his neurological status deteriorated despite decreased serum Cu levels. After 14 days, as her clinical condition did not improve, her family withdrew her care. An autopsy was not performed. Discussion: Our patient manifested severe toxicity after a large intake of CuSO4. Bronchial irrigation provided some decontamination. HD was initiated to mitigate Cu- and direct penicillamine-induced nephrotoxicity and support renal function. There was no Cu bound to penicillamine in the dialysate. Replacement of blood products and exchange transfusions may have contributed to reducing Cu load. Serum Cu at day 8 had doubled from day 3, which may represent a redistribution. Conclusions: Acute Cu toxicity is rare but carries high mortality due to severe hemolysis and multi-organ toxicity. Penicillamine is the reference treatment in cases of chronic Cu toxicity in Wilson's disease. There is no evidence for an optimal chelator for acute toxicity, but edetate calcium disodium and dimercaprol have been used successfully. In our case, despite decontamination measures, early multi-organ support, chelation, and enhanced elimination attempts, the patient died.",,"Eisnor, D.;Anwar, M.;Morgan, B.;Pomerleau, A.",2015,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/15563650.2015.1071025,0,0,
1344,MEDNIK syndrome: clinical and biochemical description of the response to prolonged zinc therapy: a case report,"Background: MEDNIK syndrome -an acronym for mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, keratoderma- is caused by mutations in the AP1S1 gene, which encodes the sigma 1A subunit of adapter protein complex-1 (AP-1). AP-1 directs the intracellular trafficking of several transmembrane proteins, including the copper transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B. We recently identified disordered copper metabolism in MEDNIK syndrome, a condition that combines abnormalities of Menkes and Wilson diseases, partially ameliorated by zinc acetate therapy. Methods: To confirm our previous observation, we performed serial clinical and biochemical evaluations in an Italian patient with MEDNIK syndrome under zinc treatment. The duration of treatment was 4 years. Results: Our patient presented liver disease, hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia, increased urinary excretion of copper, hepatic copper overload, intrahepatic cholestasis. At the end of follow-up, he showed marked improvement in liver and enteropathy, with complete normalization of serum transaminases and liver copper content. However, the skin abnormalities worsened during follow-up and he showed a stagnation of cognitive development. Conclusions: The above findings raise new questions about the clinical and biochemical effects of AP-1 dysfunction and possible therapeutic options. Chronic zinc acetate may protect affected patients from hepatic copper overload, but some copper may be required for normal brain growth and maturation.",,"Martinelli, D.;Dionisi-Vici, C.",2015,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-015-9877-x,0,0,
1345,Wilson's disease. More evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity in two sisters,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene at 13q14.3. The defective protein leads to low blood levels of ceruloplasmin and copper accumulation in the liver, basal ganglia, and cornea with clinical evidence of liver disease, tremors, dysarthria, dystonia, and psychiatric signs. Hemolytic anemia, hypertransaminasemia, renal tubular acidosis are other common findings. We present a series of 21 patients, aged 8 to 52 years, with a long follow-up on treatment with penicillamine, zinc, or both. A remarkable phenotypic variability was observed in two sisters carrying the same genotype (c.3207C->A(p.H1069Q) / c.3904-2A->G). Although both began to present symptoms at 10 years of age, the onset was characterized by neurological signs in the first (tremors, motor incoordination, language and cognitive impairment) while liver involvement was the only sign in the other. After a 20-year follow-up, the former is severely affected (MRI evidence of copper deposits in the basal ganglia and hypercogenic liver, piastrinopenia), while the latter still has moderate liver enlargement. This phenotypic variability could be explained by the intervention of modifier genes (CTR1, ATOX1, MURR1) that regulate copper metabolism in the presence of a defective function of the ATP7B protein. Further research into its role could have a profound impact on therapy as well.",,"Fiumara, A.;Sapuppo, A.;Brafa Musicoro, V.;Lepori, M.

1346,Hand stereotypies in Wilson's disease,"Objective: We present the case study of a young patient diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD) who presented stereotypes in both hands. Background: Stereotypies are a phenomenological category of Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders. The exact definition of stereotypy varies according to different authors. It is described as coordinated, patterned, repetitive, rhythmic, purposeless but apparently purposeful, or ritualistic movement, posture, or expression (Jankovic 1994). In an attempt to distinguish stereotypies from tics and other repetitive movement disorders, it is described as ""a pattern of non-goal directed movement that is repeated continuously over a period of time in the same manner and on multiple occasions, and that He tends to get distracted."" (Edwards et al 2013). Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism with excessive accumulation of copper in the basal ganglia. Hyperactive movement disorders seen in WD include dystonia (often evident in the face, jaw, neck, trunk, and extremities), tremor: postural, action-induced, intentional, resting tremor, or oscillating involvement of the proximal upper extremity (wing tremor) . Yorio et al. (1994), described the stereotypy of the toes of both feet in a patient with WD. Methods: This is a case study. Results: A 26-year-old right-handed woman presents with a history of functional impairment of approximately 3 months with slow information processing and speech dysarthria. On examination, he had purposeless flexion and extension movements in all fingers of both hands. They were involuntary, patterned, repetitive, and rhythmic. Movements slightly improved in distraction. There were occasional dystonic movements of the lips and jaw. Otherwise, the neurological examination was normal. Kayser-Fleisher rings were evident on slit-lamp examination. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensity in the bilateral striatum. Laboratory investigations showed very low ceruloplasmin, high copper levels, and abnormal liver function, confirming WD, and he was started on trientine. Conclusions: We believe that this is the first formal description of hand stereotypy in Wilson's disease. It is important and challenging to distinguish stereotypy from tremors, myoclonus, tics, dystonia, chorea, and athetosis. A videotape showing the patient's movements will be presented at the conference.",,"Mittal, S. O.;Ranpura, A.;Salardini, A.;Jabbari, B.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26295,0,0,
1347,Bone turnover and its connection to penicillamine use in Chinese patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The prevalence of osteoporosis is higher among patients with Wilson's disease (WD) than in the general public, the cause of which is still unclear. The purpose of this research is to analyze the possible causes of the high prevalence and connection between penicillamine and bone mineral density. Methods: Eight-four WD patients (44 men and 40 women) and 76 controls (27 men and 49 women) were enrolled in this study. The patients were diagnosed by ATP7B mutation analysis. Dual energy X-ray analysis (DXA) was used to assess bone mineral density (BMD). Serum phosphate, calcium, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, osteocalcin, 25-(OH)-vitamin D, and alkaline phosphatase were measured to assess bone turnover activity. Based on imaging information, laboratory tests, and previous medical history, we analyzed the correlations between BMD, bone turnover activity, and age, sex, clinical manifestations, and maximum dose of penicillamine in patients. Results: Fifty-eight patients received a DXA scan. The prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with WD was 27.58% (16/58) while in controls it was 19.74% (15/76). BMD, T-score and Z-score of the lumbar vertebrae, as well as BMD, hip-neck Z-score were significantly lower in WD patients. 25(OH)-vitamin D, serum phosphate, serum calcium, and ALP were significantly higher in WD patients than in controls. But among patients who received different maximum daily doses of penicillamine, the higher dose was associated with lower BMD. Age, gender, and clinical manifestations did not affect BMD among WD patients. Conclusion: Patients with WD have a higher prevalence of osteoporosis, lower BMD and higher bone turnover activity compared to controls. The use of penicillamine is an important precipitating factor.",,"Dong, Q. Y.;Dong, Y.;Ni, W.;Zhang, Y.;Wu, Z. Y.",2015,May,,0,0,
1348,WTX101-201: Phase 2 Study of Bis-Choline Tetrathiomolybdate in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Wilson's Disease,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of impaired hepatic copper excretion caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, resulting in copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and liver. brain. WTX101 (bischoline tetrathiomolybdate) is a novel copper agent with a unique mechanism of action (MoA) in development for the treatment of WD. WTX101 aims to improve Cu control due to the rapid formation of irreversible Cu-tetrathiomolybdate-protein complexes leading to rapid copper clearance without mobilizing free Cu that could cause tissue toxicity, including neurological impairment. Tetrathiomolybdate has been studied in several clinical trials in WD patients using ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. The study will assess whether BID individualized oral dosing of WTX101 with an upward titration design in the early phase of copper elimination is safe and effective in reducing free copper levels (NCC, adjusted for plasma Mo concentration), as well as to maintain these reduced levels of free copper. levels using QD dosing. It will also provide data on additional endpoints of free Cu, 24-hour urinary copper, and neurological outcome with the UWDRS. Methods: This is a 24-week, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase 2 study conducted in the EU and the US. An individualized dosing regimen of WTX101 with PPI is administered in patients with symptomatic WD (neurologic, stable hepatic, or combined ) newly diagnosed age 18 or older with elevated levels of NCC who have been treated for <= 28 days with chelation therapy or zinc therapy. Eligible subjects will receive WTX101 on an outpatient basis at doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg per day in conjunction with omeprazole 20 mg per day. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving normalized levels of NCC (<= 2.3 muM) or achieving at least a 25% reduction in NCC. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, change and time to normalization of NCC levels, copper endpoints (exchangeable copper, tripartite Mo/Cu/Protein complex species profiling, and copper in 24-hour urine), liver status with ALT, AST, INR, and bilirubin measurement, neurological assessment (UWDRS), psychiatric assessment (MINI Tracking), clinical symptom status (CGI), and QOL/PRO endpoints (EQ5D, MMAS-8, TSQM). The PK of WTX101 will be measured by free and total elemental Mo in plasma. Conclusions: The unique mode of action suggests that WTX101 may be an effective treatment option for WD patients who have a lower potential for neurological deterioration, while once-daily dosing offers better compliance.",,"Weiss, K.

1349,Functional characterization and pharmacological response to zinc and D-penicillamine of disease-causing ATP7B mutations in a human hepatoma cell line,"Background and objectives: In Wilson's disease (WD), hepatocyte survival is significantly affected by toxic copper (Cu) overload due to mutation of the hepatic copper transporter ATP7B. More than 600 ATP7B mutations are described. Copper toxicity in WD is commonly reversed with D-penicillamine (DPA) and/or zinc (Zn). The impact of the individual ATP7B mutation expressed in WD patients on the efficacy of standard treatment is unknown. Methods: ATP7B mutations that are prevalent in Europe/USA were selected. and Asia, as well as several common homozygous genotypes observed in India. Stable cell lines expressing the mutations were established in a human hepatoma ATP7B HepG2 knockout cell line that our group recently established (PLoS ONE, 9: e98809, 2014). Cell survival, as well as apoptosis induction, was determined in mutant cell lines after Cu exposure and Zn/DPA treatment. Results: In the mutant cell lines, ATP7B protein expression varied, while mRNA expression was at similar levels compared to wild type. Late endosome-lysosome marker lamp2 colocalization studies suggested impaired trafficking in several mutant cell lines. Mutant cell lines showed varying degrees of activity in escaping toxic Cu, with the p.H1069Q mutation showing moderate activity. No activity was observed for mutant cell lines encoding incomplete reading frames. Characteristic responses to treatment were observed after combined treatment with Zn, DPA and Zn+DPA for individual cell lines. In general, the DPA treatment was more efficient compared to the Zn treatment. Of note, only Zn+DPA treatment could fully restore ATP7B activity compared to wild-type ATP7B. Conclusions: Individual ATP7B mutations differ in their ability to escape toxic Cu and show a genotype-specific response to treatment. The type of ATP7B mutation may modulate the efficacy of Zn and DPA treatment, suggesting that current regimens could be further improved using knowledge of the functional parameters exerted by ATP7B.",,"Chandhok, G.;Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1350,copper-wilson disease,"Wilson's disease was described by Kinnier Wilson more than a hundred years ago. He focused on the neurological aspects of the disease, however, he also made a critical observation that the liver was affected. He postulated that a toxic agent was responsible for both neurological and liver damage. We only know that the toxin is copper and that it accumulates to toxic levels in the tissues due to a defect in a specific ATP7B gene that is essential for the transport and metabolism of copper in the liver. Injury to other organs, primarily the brain, is secondary to liver copper overload and increased blood copper levels. Both the liver and neurological symptoms of the disease are highly variable, ranging from mild development over the years to rapid progress leading to severe disability and death. Diagnosis is crucial for WD patients. It is based on the combination of clinical characteristics, copper metabolism studies, genetic analysis and neuroimaging. Anti-copper therapy is based on copper chelation (d-penicillamine, trientine) or inhibition of copper absorption in the intestine (zinc salts). Both types of therapy appear equally effective, and the choice depends on center experience, patient preference, and drug availability. Liver transplantation is performed only in cases with fulminant liver damage and progression of liver failure despite therapy. Anti-copper therapy should be for life. In most cases that are not diagnosed in the terminal stage, pharmacotherapy leads to clinical improvement. It is important to evaluate asymptomatic siblings and children of affected patients. Early therapy prevents the development of symptoms. Critical to therapeutic success is patient compliance.",,"Czlonkowska, A.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12813,0,0,
1351,Diagnostic value of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after 48-hour discontinuation of d-penicillamine in assessing compliance in patients with Wilson's disease.,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment with anti-copper agents is effective in most cases. However, compliance is essential. Urinary copper excretion is an important parameter for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. During long-term treatment with chelating agents, a two-day break in treatment should result in normal urine copper concentration values (<50 Âµg/dl). The objective of this study was to establish the usefulness of this method in evaluating compliance in these patients. Methods: Consecutive patients treated with d-penicillamine (DPA) for a minimum of one year undergoing routine follow-up studies at our center were examined. We evaluated parameters of copper metabolism, neurological examinations, liver status, and compliance. We performed urinary copper excretion analyzes from 24 h to 48 h after discontinuation of chelation therapy. Results: 33 patients were enrolled. The mean duration of treatment was 11.78+/-11.75 years. After 48 h of DPA discontinuation, normalization (<50 Âµg/24 h) in copper excretion was observed in 20 (87%) of 23 compliant patients. Ten patients were noncompliant and copper excretion was greater than 50 Âµg/24 h in 7 (70%) of them after cessation of APD. The specificity and sensitivity of this test was 87% and 70%, respectively. Receiver operator curve analysis found an optimal cut-off point for urinary copper excretion of 62 Âµg/dl for compliant patients. Conclusion: Measurement of 24-h urinary copper excretion after a 48-h interruption in DPA therapy in WD patients is a reliable method of confirming patient compliance and may be useful for future treatment decisions.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12807,0,0,
1352,Early neurological worsening in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The objective of our study was to analyze the frequency of early neurological worsening in patients with WD, its evolution, and the clinical and laboratory factors that may affect it. Background: Early neurological worsening during the initiation of Wilson's disease (WD) treatment is still an unresolved therapeutic problem. Methods: We analyzed 143 patients with symptomatic WD, diagnosed between 2005-2010. The early neurological deterioration group was based on worsening on the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) scored at baseline to 6 months or the appearance of new neurological symptoms. The reversibility of worsening was followed up to 24 months. In addition, the analysis was performed in subgroups with and without neurological worsening according to the selected clinical and laboratory variables and the type of anti-copper therapy. Results: Early neurological worsening in 11.1 [percentage] (16/143) of patients with WD, only in patients with neurological signs at diagnosis. The mean time to worsening from the start of EW treatment was 2.3+/-1.9 months. it was completely reversible in 53[percnt](8/15) and partially in 13[percnt] (2/15) of patients over 9.2+/-5.2 months. or zinc sulfate), the type of neurological manifestations, the initial results of copper metabolism and the parameters of liver functions had no impact on early neurological worsening. Baseline neurological symptoms (15/69 vs. 0/73; p<0.01); progression of neurological deficits scored on UWDRS part II and III (p<0.01); the occurrence of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes due to WD in the thalamus (p<0.01) and brainstem (p<0.01); Concomitant treatment with drugs potentially modulating dopamine action (p<0.05) were the main predictors of early neurological deterioration in patients with WD. Conclusions: Neurological worsening at the start of anti-copper therapy in patients with WD occurs in patients with initial severe neurological manifestation, advanced brain damage and may also be caused by concomitant treatment, but is not associated with the type of anti-copper therapy.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Karlinski, M.;Dziezyc, K.",2015,,,0,1,
1353,Zinc therapy reverses neurodegeneration in patients with Wilson's disease and parkinsonism,"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of zinc therapy in reversing parkinsonism in patients with Wilson's disease who were initially treated with penicillamine. Background: For years, the treatment of Wilson's disease has been aimed at stimulating the excretion of accumulated copper by chelating agents. The dilemma arises when patients paradoxically deteriorate, which is due to the binding agents increasing free copper levels. In contrast, zinc therapy normalizes elevated serum and urine free copper by inducing metallothionein production. Methods: In a retrospective observational study of four patients with Wilson's disease and severe parkinsonism initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared subjective and objective clinical improvement before and one year after switching to zinc monotherapy. The Global Assessment Scale (GAS) was used for clinical evaluations. Global disability was measured in four domains: liver, cognition and behavior, motor, and musculoskeletal, and neurological dysfunction was assessed in 14 main categories. Results: Three of the four patients who had deteriorated on penicillamine (0.5-1 g/d), have improved significantly to normal biochemical and clinical status on zinc (150 mg/d). The fourth patient on penicillamine 250 mg/d plus zinc 200 mg/d improved slightly in the lower extremities after one month, while he improved considerably to a symptom-free state in subsequent months on zinc monotherapy. His global disability improved by approximately 73% and neurological evaluations revealed a 100% improvement. Conclusions: The results suggest that zinc monotherapy is the safe and promising treatment for copper intoxication, and support the normalization of elevated serum and urine copper values as a rational therapeutic strategy.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.

1354,Successful initial treatment with zinc in Wilson's disease with acute liver failure and copper poisoning: there is a wonder drug,"Objectives: To evaluate initial zinc monotherapy on copper levels and liver improvement. Background: Accumulation of copper in the brain and liver is considered to be the cause of Wilson's disease. However, there is evidence to suggest free copper poisoning as the origin. Methods: Retrospectively, a 10-year-old girl with Wilson's disease presenting with diffuse jaundice, acute liver failure, hemolytic anemia, and elevated urine copper, liver function, and copper with a history of elevated urine copper was evaluated before and after initial zinc monotherapy. positive relatives. The patient was treated with 125 mg of elemental zinc per day and liver transplantation was considered in case of lack of response. Results: The patient improved biochemically and clinically within 10 days after zinc therapy, consistent with an 86% decrease in urinary copper. The revised Wilson's disease prognostic index improved from 13 to 5 and the patient was removed from the transplant list. After 2, 4, 8 weeks of zinc therapy, AST, ALT, bilirubin, and urine copper showed consistent improvements of up to 62, -26, 82, 77%, respectively, at week 8. Results from the second 8-week period indicated an additional decrease of 25, 41, 48, 86, respectively, and 33% for serum free copper, compared to previous results. No side effects or clinical deterioration have been observed. Conclusions: The results suggest that zinc therapy is a promising, fast-acting, safe and affordable option for the treatment of copper intoxication in Wilson's disease with acute liver failure. It also supports the hypothesis of normalizing elevated serum free copper as a rational targeted therapeutic strategy.",,"Avan, A.;Kianifar, H. R.;Hoogenraad, T.

1355,Copper Chelation Efficacy of D-penicillamine Nanoparticles in an Experimental Rat Model for Non-Wilsonian Brain Copper Toxicosis,"Objective: D-penicillamine is unable to mitigate cerebral copper overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Alzheimer's/Wilson disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered D-penicillamine-loaded nanoparticles compared with conventional D-penicillamine for 90 days in a Wistar rat model for non-Wilsonian cerebral copper toxicosis. Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and physicochemical preparation/characterization of nanoparticles were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles exhibited a mean size of 274.09 nm and less than 29.32% release of D-penicillamine under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of D-penicillamine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory, along with a concomitant increase in urinary copper levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in a rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections corroborated by 60.1% and 16.4% reduction in liver and brain copper content, respectively, compared with the untreated copper intoxicated group. However, liver and brain sections from the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group demonstrated grade 1 copper deposition and copper absence corroborated by a 47.2% and 32.8% reduction in copper content. liver and brain copper, respectively, compared with the untreated copper-intoxicated group. Conclusions: Taken together, the present study reveals the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy in chelating more brain copper and alleviating neurological deficits even at half the dose that is administered in the conventional therapy with D-penicillamine.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1356,Successful liver transplantation for Wilson's disease as a rare cause of liver failure after SCT in a child with aplastic Fanconi anemia,"Introduction: After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, liver toxicity may be due to various reasons, such as drug toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, hepatic veno-occlusive disease. However, other rare causes should be considered. We present a child who developed liver failure after allo-SCT and was later diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The patient was successfully treated with repeated plasmapheresis for acute liver failure and then had a cadaveric liver transplant. Materials (or patients) and methods: 13-year-old male patient diagnosed with aplastic Fanconi anemia and stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched sister. The reduced conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were moderately elevated after grafting. Hepatitis markers were negative. We thought the liver toxicity was due to the conditioning regimen. Abdominal acid did not develop. Total bilirubin levels were 10-15 mg/dl during the first three months and remained relatively stable around. Direct bilirubin levels began to rise in the patient's fourth month, coagulation tests became abnormal. Percutaneous liver biopsy was taken. In the preliminary biopsy report, toxic hepatitis was considered. All medications, including cyclosporine A, except trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, were discontinued. Bilirubin values increased during this period. Total bilirubin was 35.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 26.7 mg/dL, ammonia 194.6 mcg/dL, and ceruloplasmin 47.1 mg/dL. Patients were considered to be in hepatic coma and started receiving therapeutic plasmapheresis. Seven plasmaphereses were performed in total. The first five plasmaphereses were performed with fresh frozen plasma. Allergic reactions occurred in the last plasmapheresis. One week later, two plasmapheresis with albumin were performed. Results: Liver biopsy reported toxic hepatitis and copper accumulation. The 24-hour urine copper level was high. The patient was diagnosed as Wilson's disease. Therapy with D-penicillamine and zinc was started. One month later, a cadaveric liver transplant was performed. Two years after stem cell transplantation, the patient is disease-free, with complete donor chimerism in bone marrow, and stable liver graft function on immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion: As a result, in liver toxicity after allo-SCT, Wilson's disease should be taken into account. Patients with autosomal recessive diseases such as Fanconi aplastic anemia may have another autosomal recessive disease. For this reason, a detailed family medical history should be taken.",,"Albayrak, C.;Albayrak, D.;Kalayci, A. G.;Bicakci, A.;Elli, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/bmt.2015.37,0,0,
1357,Molecular genetic diagnosis of overlapping presentation of PFIC 3 with Wilson's disease and response to treatment,"Case: 15-year-old patient with fatigue and findings of splenomegaly and mild thrombocytopenia. Additional testing included 24-h urine copper [>100 mcg], no Kayser-Fleischer rings, normal ceruloplasmin level, and no ATP7B mutations. Liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis, focal bridging fibrosis, moderate bile duct proliferation, and a markedly elevated liver copper content (1471 Âµg/g), suggestive of WD. He was started on zinc therapy but switched to trientine due to gastrointestinal side effects. Although he received treatment with trientine for more than 12 months, his transaminase levels did not improve and urine copper remained elevated. Further evaluation for another possible etiology revealed an increase in bile acids. A trial of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for PFIC3 was started. Sequencing of the ABCB4 gene showed a heterozygous mutation c.984T > G (p.Y328*) compatible with a diagnosis of PFIC3. Trientine was discontinued and UDCA continued. With UDCA treatment, transaminases decreased but did not normalize (Table). Liver biopsy was repeated after 4 months of therapy and showed that liver copper content decreased dramatically to 135 Âµg/g liver dry weight. After 10 months, liver indices remained mildly abnormal but synthetic function remained stable. Conclusions: Accumulation of hepatic copper can be observed in cholestatic disorders such as PFIC3 at levels above the diagnostic threshold for WD, and therefore the diagnosis of PFIC3 should be considered in patients with elevated hepatic copper without clear features of WD and who do not respond adequately to treatment. UDCA ameliorates cholestasis in PFIC3 and we show for the first time a reduction in liver copper in response to treatment.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-015-9609-1,0,0,
1358,Colitis during trientine therapy for Wilson's disease: a case report,"Case: A 40-year-old newly diagnosed Wilson's disease (WD) patient with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms was started on triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) 250 mg three times a day and developed bloody diarrhea. Trientine was discontinued, and a colonoscopy showed active ileitis and severe colitis of an indeterminate nature. She was started on prednisone and had an acute worsening of her neuropsychiatric symptoms and was referred to us with a pre-diagnosis of steroid psychosis. Zinc therapy was started for her WD and prednisone was discontinued. The clinical symptoms of colitis improved and sigmoidoscopy showed resolution of her colitis. Due to persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms, trientine was restarted. He redeveloped multiple bloody stools, so the trientine was discontinued. Evaluation for other causes of colitis was negative for infection and IBD markers. A repeat colonoscopy at this time showed active colitis and proctitis. Histology showed extensive inflammation with cryptitis, crypt abscess formation, and ulcerations, suggesting drug-induced colitis. The patient was restarted on zinc therapy for her WD and colitis symptoms resolved without recurrence. All of her neurological symptoms improved and resolved over a longer period of time. He had stable liver function while receiving zinc maintenance therapy. Conclusion: Chelation therapy is an integral part of the initial therapy of symptomatic WD patients, however, patients should be appropriately monitored for side effects. Colitis is a rare side effect of trientine and zinc is an alternative therapy for WD patients with side effects due to chelation therapy.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-015-9609-1,0,0,

1362,Simultaneous Monitoring of Brain Metal Accumulation in an Experimental Model of Wilson's Disease Using Inductively Coupled Plasma Laser Ablation Mass Spectrometry,"Background: Neuropsychiatric condition with extrapyramidal symptoms is a common component of Wilson's disease (WD). WD is caused by a genetic defect of the copper (Cu) ATPase7B efflux pump. Mouse strains with natural or genetically modified transgenic defects of the Atp7b gene have served as a model of WD. These show a gradual accumulation and concentration of Cu in the liver, kidneys, and brain. However, little is known about the regional distribution of Cu within the brain, its influence on other metals, and the subsequent pathophysiological mechanisms. We have applied laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and performed comparative bioimaging of metals in brain sections of wild-type and Atp7b null mice in the age range of 11-24 months. Messenger RNA and protein expression of a panel of inflammatory markers were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blots of brain homogenates. Results: We were able to confirm Cu accumulation in brain parenchyma by a factor of two in WD (5.5 mug g<sup>-1</sup> in cortex) versus controls (2.7 mug g<sup >-1</sup> ) that was already fully established at 11 months. In periventricular regions (VPRs) known as prominent Cu-containing structures, Cu was in turn reduced by a factor of 3. This corroborates the view of PVRs as exit compartments with active transport of Cu into the cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, the Cu gradient increasing downstream of the PVR was alleviated. Otherwise, the Cu distribution architecture was essentially maintained. Zinc (Zn) increased by up to 40%, especially in regions with high Cu content, but not in typical Zn accumulation regions, a secondary effect due to the fact that Zn is, to some extent, a substrate of Cu-ATPases. The concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) were constant in all the regions evaluated. The inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, TIMP-1, and the capillary proliferation marker alpha-SMA were increased by a factor of 2-3 in WD. Conclusions: This study confirmed the stable brain accumulation of Cu in the parenchyma and found a reduction in CSF Cu in Atp7b knockout mice, underscoring the diagnostic value of microlocal analytical techniques.

1363,Genotype-phenotype correlations in a mountain population community with a high prevalence of Wilson's disease: genetic and clinical homogeneity,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by more than 500 mutations in the ATP7B gene that exhibits considerable heterogeneity of clinical manifestations even in patients with a particular mutation. Previous findings suggested a potential role for additional genetic modifiers and environmental factors in phenotypic expression among affected patients. We conducted clinical and genetic investigations to perform genotype-phenotype correlation in two large families living in a socioculturally isolated community with the highest ever reported prevalence of Wilson's disease of 1:1130. Sequencing of the ATP7B gene in seven affected individuals and 43 family members identified a common compound heterozygous genotype, H1069Q/M769H-fs, in five symptomatic and two asymptomatic patients and detected the presence of two of the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms identified. in all affected patients. Symptomatic patients had a similar clinical phenotype and age at onset (18+/-1 years), showing dysarthria and dysphagia as common clinical features at diagnosis. Furthermore, all symptomatic patients presented with Kayser-Fleischer rings and lack of dystonia accompanied by poor clinical outcomes. Our findings add value for understanding genotype-phenotype correlations in Wilson's disease based on a multifamily study in an isolated population with a high degree of genetic and environmental homogeneity compared to most reports. We observed an equal influence of putative other genetic modifiers and environmental factors on the clinical presentation and age of onset of Wilson's disease in patients with a particular genotype. These data provide valuable inferences that could be applied to predict clinical management in asymptomatic patients in such communities.

1364,Neurological manifestations of acute and chronic liver disease.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article summarizes the most common neurological sequelae of acute and chronic liver failure, liver transplantation, and other treatments for liver disease, and describes the pathogenesis, neurological manifestations, and treatment of Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The neurological manifestations of liver disease are caused by the inability of the liver to detoxify active compounds that have deleterious effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, treatments for liver disease, such as liver transplantation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and antiviral medications, can also be neurotoxic. Wilson's disease affects the liver and nervous system simultaneously and can often initially be diagnosed by a neurologist; Treatment options have evolved in recent years. SUMMARY: Acute and chronic liver diseases are commonly found in the general population. Neurological dysfunction will eventually affect a significant number of these individuals, especially if the disease progresses to liver failure. Early recognition of these neurological manifestations may lead to more effective management of these patients.

1367,Long-term results of liver transplantation for Wilson's disease: experience in France,"Background and objectives Liver transplantation (LT) is the therapeutic option for severe complications of Wilson's disease (WD). Our aim was to report on the long-term outcome of WD patients after LT. Methods: The medical records of 121 French patients transplanted for WD between 1985 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-five patients were adults (median age: 29 years, (18-66)) and 46 were children (median age: 14 years). , (7-17)). The indication for LT was (1) fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis (n = 64, 53%), median age = 16 years (7-53), (2) decompensated cirrhosis (n = 50, 41%), median age = 31.5 years (12-66) or (3) severe neurological disease (n = 7, 6%), median age = 21.5 years (14.5-42). Median post-transplant follow-up was 72 months (0-23.5). Results The actuarial survival rates of the patients were 87% at 5, 10 and 15 years. Male sex, renal insufficiency prior to transplantation, non-elective procedure, and neurological indication were significantly associated with a worse survival rate. None of these factors remained statistically significant on multivariate analysis. In patients transplanted for hepatic indications, the prognosis was worse in the case of fulminant or subfulminant course, non-elective procedure, pre-transplant kidney failure, and in patients transplanted before the year 2000. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the recent period of LT was associated with a better prognosis. At the last visit, the median calculated glomerular filtration rate was 93 mL/min (33-180); 11/93 patients (12%) had stage II renal failure and none had stage III. Conclusions Liver failure associated with WD is a rare indication for LT (<1%), which achieves excellent long-term results, including renal function.

1369,Causality of Alzheimer's disease from copper toxicity and zinc treatment,"Evidence will be presented that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) epidemic is new, the disease being very rare in the 20th century. The incidence is increasing rapidly, but only in developed countries. We postulate that the newly emerging environmental factor partially causative of the AD epidemic is ingestion of inorganic copper from drinking water and supplement intake, along with a high-fat diet. Inorganic copper can be partially absorbed directly and raise the free copper group of serum. Squitti's group has shown that serum free copper is elevated in AD, correlates with cognition, and predicts loss of cognition. Therefore, our inorganic copper hypothesis fits well with the Squitti group's data. We have also shown that AD patients are zinc deficient compared to age-matched controls. Because zinc is a neuronal protective factor, we postulate that zinc deficiency may also be partially causative of AD. We conducted a small 6-month double-blind study of a new zinc formulation and found that in patients 70 years of age and older, it protected against cognitive loss. Zinc therapy also significantly reduced serum free copper in AD patients, so efficacy may come from restoration of normal zinc levels, or reduction of serum free copper, or both.

1373,Integrated myocardial ultrasound backscatter for early detection of cardiac involvement in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background/Objectives: Videodensitometry is a feasible method of non-invasive ultrasound tissue characterization that allows early detection of changes in the myocardium. This study aimed to investigate the ultrasonic backscatter properties of the myocardium in patients with Wilson's disease. bMaterials and Methods: We compared cardiologically asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (group W) (n=18) bwith age-matched healthy controls (26.7+/-9.6 years) (group C) (n=15). The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, family history, and laboratory findings, and was confirmed by liver biopsy. Transthoracic echocardiographic quantitative texture analysis was performed on left ventricular septal and posterior wall data, and end-diastolic (d) and end-systolic (s) mean gray level (MGL) histograms were obtained. ) after background correction (c). The cyclic variation index (CVI) was calculated using the formula [(cMGLd - cMGLs) / cMGLd] x100. bResults: There were no significant differences in gender, age, body mass index, heart rate or blood pressure, and conventional echocardiographic parameters between the 2 groups. The posterior wall sMGL value was higher in group W than in group C (30.9+/-2.6 vs. 22.2+/-2.7, p=0.033). Group W had a significantly lower CVI of the septum than group C (-22+/-4.4% vs. 43.4 +/-12.9%, p<0.001), and there was no significant difference in the CVI of the posterior septum. wall (-67.0+/-15.9% vs. 41.7+/-18.6%, p=0.32). bConclusion: Abnormalities in two-dimensional gray level echocardiographic distributions were present in patients with Wilson's disease. These videodensitometric myocardial abnormalities were significantly less in patients with Wilson's disease than in controls, and this probably represents an early stage of cardiac compromise.

1374,"Osteoporosis and fractures in liver disease: Relevance, pathogenesis and therapeutic implications","It is increasingly recognized that patients with liver disease develop bone loss that can be severe enough to cause atraumatic fractures and thus markedly decrease quality and life expectancy. The estimated prevalence of liver-related osteoporosis is from 20 to 420/100,000 of the general population and of fractures from 60 to 880/100,000. It must be taken into account that up to 40% of patients with chronic liver disease may suffer a fracture. Pathogenic mediators include fibronectin, insulin-like growth factor I, and several cytokines, but vitamin D depletion and/or corticosteroid therapy contribute to worsening bone health. Despite advances in bone biology that have shed some light on the pathogenesis of this bone loss, treatment options remain nonspecific and closely linked to treatments for other forms of osteoporosis. Therefore, treatment should include calcium and vitamin D supplementation in all patients with chronic liver disease. Bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, especially in patients receiving corticosteroids. This review focuses on the prevalence of this entity, as well as the available evidence regarding the pathogenesis of bone loss in liver disease, the diagnostic steps required in all patients, and the available therapeutic options.

1375,Low copper diet as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease,"Copper is an essential element, and a deficiency or excess of copper can be life-threatening. Recent studies have indicated that the alteration of copper metabolism is one of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light of these findings, many investigators have proposed preventive strategies to reduce the risk of AD. Because the general population comes into contact with copper primarily through dietary intake, i.e. 75% from food and 25% from drinking water, a low-copper diet may reduce the risk of AD in people with poor metabolism. altered copper. We suggest that a diet-gene interaction underlies the ""copper phenotype"" of sporadic AD. In this paper, we describe the pathways that regulate copper homeostasis, the adverse sequelae related to its disorders, the pathogenic mechanism of the copper phenotype of AD, the indications for a low-copper diet, and future prospects for improving this preventive strategy. .

The current therapy for Wilson's disease, D-penicillamine, has very serious side effects, and a drug with optimal therapeutic effects and minimal side effects is important. In the present study, ciprofloxacin was conjugated with an anionic globular dendrimer to reduce intracellular copper concentration. The results showed its efficacy and safety at certain levels. Based on the results, anionic linear globular dendrimer-ciprofloxacin conjugate may be a useful option for reducing intracellular copper concentration and an investigational therapeutic agent in Wilson's disease.

1379,Abnormal copper metabolism in Niemann-Pick type C disease mimicking Wilson's disease,"Background: Niemann-Pick type C disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease in infants, adolescents, and adults. Objective: We investigated a family with two siblings who have adult-onset Niemann-Pick type C disease and have abnormal copper metabolism mimicking Wilson's disease. Methods: Case 1 was a 26-year-old Japanese man without consanguinity, who was referred to the hospital outpatient clinic for recent gait disturbance and intellectual impairment since the age of 20. He was tentatively diagnosed as a heterozygous carrier for Wilson's disease, because his brother (case 2) had been diagnosed with Wilson's disease. He presented dementia, dysphagia, dystonia, ataxia, and downward gaze palsy. The laboratory study showed mild hepatic dysfunction and moderate splenomegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thin corpus callosum and narrowed deep white matter. Case 2 35 years of age, and had developed psychiatric and motor symptoms since the age of 20. He had been treated for Wilson's disease for 11 years due to a copper deposition in his liver and abnormal copper metabolism. Symptoms had gradually worsened despite chelation therapy and gastrostomy tube feeding for a year. Molecular diagnoses for Niemann-Pick disease type C were performed. Results: Filipin staining on cultured skin fibroblasts from case 1 was partially positive and genetic analysis showed that both siblings had compound heterozygosity for p.G992R in exon 20. and IVS6-3 C>G of NPC1. Administration of miglustat for 3 months partially improved his intellectual and motor dysfunction. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis between Niemann-Pick type C disease and Wilson's disease is important for specific treatment.

DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested reverse transcription PCR (RT nested PCR) to characterize aberrant transcripts. Sequencing comparison of RT-nested PCR products showed that the c.3244-2ANC splice site mutation caused aberrant transcripts and formatted a news splice acceptor. The patient carrying the c.3244-2ANC splice site mutation presented an early age of onset, severe clinical manifestations, and poor prognosis. WD patients with the splice site mutation show severe clinical manifestations, indicating that aberrant transcripts have important implications for the WD phenotype.

1384,The copper chelator ATN-224 induces caspase-independent cell death in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Bcl-2 and other antiapoptotic proteins are associated with defective caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, resulting in chemoresistance. We have previously shown that ATN-224, a copper-chelating drug, induces cell death in murine thymic lymphoma cells transfected with Bcl-2. In the current study, we tested whether ATN-224 was effective in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells, which have increased antiapoptotic proteins through translocation or amplification. We found that nanomolar concentrations of ATN-224 induced cell death in DLBCL cells regardless of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 status. ATN-224 treatment resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release, and caspase-independent induction of cell death. In addition, ATN-224 degraded Mcl-1 and enhanced the effect of the BH3 mimetic ABT-263. These findings indicate that ATN-224 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of DLBCL. Induction of caspase-independent cell death in apoptosis-resistant DLBCL would provide a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of refractory disease.

Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a child with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease based on physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). Within 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute-onset illness characterized by delusions of persecution, fear, hypervigilance, and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations, and affective symptoms. There was no history or family history of psychosis. A week after the onset of symptoms, he was prescribed penicillamine tab, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. Following the increased dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to his hospitalization. A diagnosis of Organic Delusional Disorder (F06.2) was considered due to Wilson's disease. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started and the dose of penicillamine was reduced, which resolved the symptoms. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of the delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease should be considered.",,"Grover, S.;Sarkar, S.;Jhanda, S.;Chawla, Y.",2014,2022-10-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0019-5545.146530,0,0,

1390,Evidence for Synergistic Effects of PRNP and ATP7B Mutations in Severe Neuropsychiatric Impairment,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD), a rare cause of neuropsychiatric impairment, is associated with mutations in the ATP7B gene. Prion diseases are also rare causes of neuropsychiatric impairment that may occur sporadically without an identifiable cause, or may be attributed to mutations in the PRNP gene. Case Presentation: Here we describe a biological ""experiment of nature"" in which a patient presented with severe neuropsychiatric impairment and strong biochemical evidence of WD. Genetic analysis revealed that he was compound heterozygous for two ATP7B sequence variants (c.2165dupT, p.Arg723Glufs*32; and c.4039G > A, p.Gly1347Ser), the first of which had been reported once previously. and the second was new. . In addition, the patient was heterozygous for a PRNP variant, c.160G>A, p.Gly54Ser, which has been reported in a neuropsychiatric patient only once previously in association with a similar severe clinical course of neuropsychiatric disease and an age of early start. but without accompanying information on the ATP7B genotype. Of particular interest was the observation that the patient's older sister, who carried the same ATP7B genotype and laboratory evidence for biochemical but clinically asymptomatic WD, lacked the PRNP variant allele. Conclusions: We propose that synergism may occur between at least some allelic variants of ATP7B and PRNP, possibly exerted through effects on cellular copper metabolism.

1394,Chelating polymeric beads as potential therapies for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder caused by a malfunction of the ATPase 7B that leads to a high accumulation of copper in the body and the consequent toxic effects. We propose a mild therapy to eliminate excessive copper content with the oral administration of insoluble, non-resorbable polymeric sorbents containing selective chelating groups for copper (II). Polymeric beads with the chelating agents triethylenetetramine, N,N-di(2-pyridylmethyl)amine, and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQB) were investigated. In a preliminary copper uptake experiment, we found that 8HQB significantly reduced copper uptake (using copper-64 as radiotracer) after oral administration in Wistar rats. In addition, we measured organ radioactivity in rats to demonstrate that iodine-125 radiolabelled 8HQB is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Nonreabsorption and blockade of copper uptake were also confirmed with small animal imaging (PET/CT) in mice. In a long-term experiment with Wistar rats fed a diet containing polymers, we found that there were no signs of polymer toxicity and that the addition of polymers to the diet led to a significant reduction in copper content in the kidneys, brain , and livers of rats. We have shown that polymers containing specific ligands could potentially be new treatments for Wilson's disease.

1398,Liver transplant in neurological Wilson's disease: Is there an indication? case report,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper overload. In this disease, inadequate hepatic excretion leads to accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea. Severe neurological symptoms may develop in patients with WD, often in the absence of relevant liver damage: it is unclear whether liver transplantation (LT) could reverse neurological symptoms, and LT is not currently recommended in this setting. We present a case of regression of neurological symptoms in a patient with WD with prevalent neurological involvement. A 19-year-old man with disabling neuropsychiatric symptoms of WD including frontal ataxia, akinesia, dystonia, tremors, and behavioral disturbances in the presence of preserved liver function (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Score = 7; Child-Turcotte- Pugh score = A5) underwent LT in November 2009. At the time of LT, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated diffuse neurodegenerative changes involving subtentorial and supratentorial structures; Presence of bilateral Kayser-Fleischer ring. Four years after LT, laboratory tests show normalization of copper metabolism and excellent liver function test results. Brain MRI shows substantial enhancement of already known signal disturbances in the nuclei of the thalamus and putamen, midbrain, and pons. The Kayser-Fleischer ring has disappeared from the right eye, but a small remnant is still visible in the left eye. On neurological examination, all previous symptoms and signs are no longer present and behavioral disturbances are no longer present; psychosocial functions are fully restored. The present case provides some evidence that LT may be a valid therapeutic option for WD patients with marked neurological impairment, particularly those who no longer respond to chelation therapy.

Results: Four cases of Wilson's disease with REM sleep behavior disorder were described; three had REM sleep behavior disorder as their initial symptom. All showed mesencephalic tegmental/tectal hyperechogenicity on ultrasound, and two had ponto-mesencephalic tegmental hyperintensities on MRI.

It is important to raise awareness among psychiatric and neurological professionals regarding certain inborn errors of metabolism as, in some cases, there are disease-specific therapies that can, for example, treat the underlying metabolic causes. The following article describes the basic pathophysiology, clinical and neurological features, and available diagnostic procedures of six treatable metabolic diseases that are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms: Wilson's disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, porphyrias, homocysteinemia, urea cycle disorders, and neuropsychiatric disease. Niemann-Pick type C. (NP-C). PN-C is taken as an especially relevant example since, although it is traditionally considered a condition that presents with severe neurological and systemic manifestations in children, more and more patients are being detected with the form of onset in adolescence or the adulthood. , which is frequently associated with neuropsychiatric signs. A notable proportion of adult-onset cases have been reported in which NP-C was misdiagnosed and treated as a psychiatric condition, usually based on patients' initial presentation with psychotic or schizophrenia-like symptoms . Underlying organic causes of psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, should be considered among patients with atypical symptoms and/or resistance to standard therapy. Along with improved frameworks for further multidisciplinary diagnostic work in patients with suspected organic disease, the development of convenient and affordable biochemical screening and/or diagnostic methods has enabled new ways to reduce differential diagnoses.

In this report we present the case of a patient who developed a progressive deterioration of liver function and mild neurological symptoms two years after starting zinc therapy. A combined treatment with a chelating agent (trientine) led to a rapid and persistent recovery. The case underlines that the treatment of WD requires continuous clinical and laboratory monitoring, since disease progression can also be observed after a transient period of therapeutic success. We also emphasize that an accurate neurological examination should be a mandatory part of clinical follow-up in patients with WD. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",,"Hartmann, C.

1404,Manic episode induced by discontinuation of D-penicillamine treatment in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rarely seen autosomal recessive inherited genetic disorder of copper metabolism, leading to various hepatic, orbital, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are due to degeneration resulting from the accumulation of copper in the neurons of the brain, especially in the basal ganglia. Clinicians should consider that copper toxicity could trigger the episode in a WD patient presenting with a manic episode. When persistent manic symptoms are found in WD, copper toxicity treatment should be checked and necessary consultation should be made. In this case report, a patient with WD who developed a manic episode as a result of discontinuing treatment with d-penicillamine is presented, emphasizing the improvement in clinical symptoms when d-penicillamine was added to psychiatric treatment.

1406,Copper Chelators: Chemical Properties and Biomedical Applications,"Copper is present in different concentrations and chemical forms throughout the earth's crust, surface and deep waters, and even, in small amounts, in the atmosphere itself. Copper is one of the first metals used by humans, the first artifacts dating back 10,000 years. Currently, world production of refined copper exceeds 16,000 tons/year. Copper is an essential microelement for life, mainly due to its red-ox properties that make it a necessary cofactor for many enzymes, such as cytochrome-c oxidase and superoxide dismutase. In some animal species (eg, octopuses, snails, spiders, oysters), copper hemocyanins also act as oxygen carriers instead of hemoglobin. However, these red-ox properties also make the Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> pair a formidable catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species, when copper is present in excess in the body or in the tissues. The treatment of choice in cases of copper overload or intoxication is chelation therapy. Different molecules are already in clinical use as chelators or under clinical study or trial. It is worth noting that chelation therapy has also been suggested to treat some neurodegenerative diseases or cardiovascular disorders. In this review, after a brief description of copper homeostasis and some cases of copper dyshomeostasis, the main chelators (used or potential) are described; their properties in solution are discussed, including in relation to the presence of competing metals or ligands, under physiological conditions. The legislation of the most important Western countries is also reviewed, both in the use of chelating agents and in the limits of copper in food, medicines and cosmetics.

1407,Factors Predicting Mortality in Children With Wilson's Disease-Associated Acute Liver Failure and Comparison of Wilson's Disease-Specific Prognostic Indices,"Background and objectives: Acute liver failure (ALF) associated with Wilson's disease (WD) affects children more than adults. The predictors of mortality and outcome in patients without encephalopathy are unclear. We investigated the ability of prognostic factors and various models, including the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), to predict mortality among children with WD and ALF. Methods: We analyzed the admission characteristics of 61 children under 18 years of age with WD and IHA. Factors associated with mortality in univariate Cox regression analysis were analyzed using forward stepwise Cox hazard regression. Prognostic models such as the Nazer model, the revised Kings College model, and the pediatric end-stage liver disease/end-stage liver disease (PELD/MELD) model were compared. Results: Of the 145 children <18 years with WD, 61 experienced ALF of whom 33 (54%) died, including 22/27 (81.5%) with encephalopathy and 11/34 (32.4%) without encephalopathy. The mean age of the children with ALF was 9.7 years, 38 (62.3%) were boys. Significant prognostic factors for mortality included encephalopathy, international normalized ratio, total protein, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and white blood cell count. Forward stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression identified encephalopathy (hazard ratio 2.88, CI 1.1-7.4) and total bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.05, CI 1.02-1 .09) as predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of the Nazer index, King's College Revised Criteria, and PELD/MELD were 0.74, 0.76, and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: Mortality in children with WD and IHA is 54%, including 81.5% with encephalopathy and 32.4% without encephalopathy. Prognostic models, MELD/PELD score, Nazer index, and Kings College criteria are comparable with AUC between 0.74 and 0.76.

1408,Cytopenia and bone marrow dysplasia in a case of Wilson's disease,"We describe a sixteen-year-old boy with Wilson's disease on copper chelation and subsequent high-dose oral zinc who developed severe anemia and neutropenia. Bone marrow aspirate performed to evaluate the cause of bicytopenia revealed trilineage dysplasia. Correlating the clinical setting with the bone marrow and biochemical parameters, copper deficiency was suspected and a trial of therapy was given, after which the hematological parameters improved. This case highlights hypocupremia as a reversible cause of bone marrow dysplasia in patients with Wilson's disease undergoing chelation, where serum copper levels are not helpful in diagnosis. We also believe that monitoring blood counts in copper chelation patients may provide a clue to impending copper deficiency.

1409,Determination of serum concentration of metallothionein (MT)1/2 in patients with Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease,"We have developed an easy and specific enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the simultaneous determination of metallotin-1 (MT-1) and 2 (MT-2) in serum in both humans and experimental animals. A competitive ELISA was set up using a specific polyclonal antibody against rat MT-2. The antibody used for this ELISA showed the same cross-reactivity with MT in humans and experimental animals. The NH<inf>2</inf> terminal peptide of MT containing acetylated methionine was shown to be the epitope of this antibody. The reactivity of this ELISA system with liver, kidney and brain in MT1/2 knockout mice was significantly low, but was normal in an MT3 knockout mouse. The lower detection limit of this ELISA was 0.6 ng/ml and enriched MT-1 was completely recovered from plasma. We investigated the normal range of MT1/2 (25-75%til) in 200 healthy human sera and found it to be 27-48. ng/ml, and this was compared to serum levels in various liver diseases. Serum levels of MT1/2 in patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) were significantly lower than healthy controls and also other liver diseases. In cases of chronic hepatitis, MT1/I2 levels gradually increased, followed by disease progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In particular, we found significantly elevated plasma levels of MT1/2 in patients with Wilson's disease, levels that were very similar to those in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat (model animal of Wilson's disease). Furthermore, a significantly elevated MT1/2 level was found in patients with Menkes disease, an inborn error of copper metabolism like Wilson's disease.

The Wilson disease protein, ATP7B, functions in copper excretion into bile and copper secretion into the bloodstream in conjunction with ceruloplasmin synthesis. Several types of ATP7B mutations cause Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disease that can be treated pharmacologically.

1411,Treatment with d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate affects copper metabolism and improves but does not normalize parameters of antioxidant capacity in Wilson's disease,"The accumulation of copper in tissues due to a biallelic pathogenic mutation of the gene: ATP7B results in a clinical phenotype known as Wilson's disease (WD). Aberrations in copper homeostasis can create favorable conditions for the superoxide-producing redox cycle and oxidative tissue damage. Medications used in the treatment of WD aim to remove accumulated copper and normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood. In the present study, the effect of copper stripping treatment on copper metabolism and systemic antioxidant capacity parameters was analyzed. Patients with previously untreated WD (TNWD) (n = 33), those treated with anti-copper drugs (TWD) (n = 99), and healthy controls (n = 99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients were characterized by decreased copper metabolism parameters as well as decreased total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) level, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase, compared to controls. TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolic parameters, higher total AOP, and higher GSH levels than TWD individuals; however, no difference was observed between these two groups of patients with respect to the rest of the antioxidant capacity parameters. Patients who had received treatment with d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate did not differ in terms of parameters of copper metabolism or antioxidant capacity, with the exception of GPx, which was lower in individuals treated with d-penicillamine. These data suggest that anti-copper treatment affects copper metabolism and enhances, but does not normalize, natural antioxidant capacity in WD patients. We propose to carry out studies aimed at evaluating the usefulness of antioxidants and selenium as complementary therapy in WD.

1412,Reversible brain parenchymal lesions in Wilson's disease confirmed by MRI: Earlier administration of chelation therapy may reduce brain damage,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the resolution of brain lesions in patients with Wilson's disease during long-term chelation therapy using magnetic resonance imaging and the possible importance of the latency time between the initial symptoms of the disease and the introduction of this therapy. . Initial MRI examination was performed in 37 patients with a proven neurological form of Wilson's disease with cerebellar, parkinsonian, and dystonic presentation. Re-exploration by magnetic resonance imaging was performed 5.7 +/- 1.3 years later in 14 patients. The patients were divided into: group A, where chelation therapy was started <24 months from the first symptoms, and group B, where therapy was started >= 24 months after the initial symptoms. The symmetry of the lesions was observed in 100% of the patients. There was a significant difference between groups A and B with respect to complete resolution of brainstem and putaminal lesions (P = 0.005 and P = 0.024, respectively). If the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment are not established before 24 months from the onset of symptoms, irreversible lesions in the brain parenchyma would be expected. Thus, signal abnormalities on MRI could, at least in the early stages, represent reversible myelinolysis or cytotoxic edema associated with copper toxicity.

1415,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa induced by D-penicillamine with glans involvement,"Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is an unusual perforating disorder characterized by the extrusion of altered elastic fibers through the epidermis. Clinically, it presents as keratotic papules with a tendency to serpiginous or annular distribution that most commonly involves the sides of the neck and back. However, involvement of the penis has been rarely reported. We present a case of EPS in the neck, axilla and glans in a 42-year-old man who had received prolonged treatment with d-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. Skin biopsy revealed perforating channels containing numerous altered elastic fibers, with a characteristic ""bramble-brush"" or ""lump-lump"" appearance as evidenced by an elastin stain. The latter is believed to be pathognomonic for penicillamine-induced degenerative elastosis. These degenerative changes that occur in the glans have rarely been described in the literature.

Method: We searched the Ovid, PsychInfo, CINHAL, and PubMed databases from May 1946 to May 2012 using the keywords Wilson's disease in combination with psychiatry, psychiatry, psychosis, schizophrenia, depression, mania, bipolar, mood, anxiety, personality, and behavior Findings: Psychiatric symptoms occur before, concurrent, or after diagnosis and treatment of WD. Thirty to forty percent of patients have psychiatric manifestations at the time of diagnosis, and 20% had seen a psychiatrist prior to their WD diagnosis. When psychiatric symptoms preceded neurological or liver involvement, the mean time between psychiatric symptoms and diagnosis of WD was 864.3 days. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in WD patients varies greatly (major depressive disorder, 4-47%; psychosis, 1.4-11.3%). Certain genetic mutations of ATP7B can be correlated with specific personality traits. Conclusions: Psychiatric manifestations represent a significant part of the clinical presentation of WD and can occur at any time during the course of the disease. Psychiatric manifestations that occur without overt liver or neurologic involvement can lead to misdiagnosis.

1423,Design of intrahepatocyte copper(I) chelators as drug candidates for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene found on chromosome 13. Since the corresponding ATPase is in charge of the distribution and excretion of copper (Cu) in the liver, its malfunction leads to to a Cu overload. This brief review deals with treatments for this rare disease, which aim to decrease Cu toxicity and are therefore based on chelation therapy. Drugs used since the 1950s are first described, then a novel approach developed in our laboratory is presented. Since the liver is the main Cu distribution organ in the body, we focused on the intracellular Cu pool in hepatocytes. This Cu group is in the +1 oxidation state, and therefore soft sulfur ligands inspired by binding sites found on metallothioneins were developed. Their targeting to hepatocytes by functionalization with asialoglycoprotein receptor ligands led to their cellular incorporation and chelation of intracellular Cu.

Idiopathic dystonia refractory to medical treatment and essential tremor (ET) have been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), functional surgical therapy directed at the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) or the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (Vim). Although the pathophysiology of tremor is different in WD and ET, available experience supports DBS targeting Vim for WD patients. WD-associated dystonia is classified as secondary dystonia, and GPi stimulation has yielded mixed results in these patients. The presence of structural changes in the basal ganglia may limit the therapeutic success of DBS for WD dystonia compared to idiopathic dystonia. Despite these limitations, DBS in WD may be an effective approach to treat medically refractory residual neurological symptoms in carefully selected patients.

1429,Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissues, especially the liver and brain. The genetic defect affects the P-type ATPase gene (ATP7B). More than 500 mutations have been described that cause Wilson's disease. The most common mutation in Central Europe refers to H1069Q. Symptoms of Wilson's disease include liver or neurological conditions. The liver condition manifests as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Neurological conditions manifest more frequently after the age of 20 as motor disorders (tremor, speech and writing disorders), which can lead to severe extrapyramidal syndrome with rigidity, dysarthria, and muscle contractures. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory evaluations (neurological signs, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, elevated urine Cu volumes, Kayser-Fleischer ring). The diagnosis is confirmed by a high level of Cu in liver tissue or genetic testing. Untreated Wilson's disease results in the death of the patient. If treated properly, the survival rate approaches the survival rate of the common population. Treatment refers to removal of copper from the body using chelating agents excreted in the urine (penicillamine, trientine) or limitation of copper absorption in the intestine and reduction of copper toxicity (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). In the Czech Republic penicillamine or zinc are used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.

We present the experience of dialysis with albumin in acute liver failure (AHF) due to WD in children. METHODS: Review of records of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated with molecular adsorbents and a recirculation system. Blood and in-circuit copper level measurements were made during molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) sessions. Clinical and biological evaluations were reported after the MARS session. RESULTS: Four children, with a median age of 12.3 years, were treated between 2004 and 2009 for severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, hemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were performed, with a mean duration of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good, except for 1 child who experienced bleeding due to vascular injury after dialysis catheter insertion. Neurological improvement or stabilization was observed in all children along with improvement in Fisher's index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, lower serum copper level by 28% on average, and lower bilirubin and creatinine levels >25%. All children subsequently underwent liver transplantation with good evolution without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and stabilize children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.

Cu chelators and zinc salts are the two most important drugs used in the treatment of patients with WD; however, the molecular mechanisms of the drugs with respect to ATP7B expression have not been determined. Specific knockdown of ATP7B (KO) in the most widely used human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was established for molecular studies of disease pathogenesis and treatment. KO cells showed similar growth, Cu uptake, release, and gene expression compared to parental cells. However, in the presence of Cu, morphological changes, oxidative stress, apoptosis and loss of viability were observed. Metallothionein (MT1X) induction after Cu exposure was significantly reduced in KO cells. After zinc treatment, MT1X expression was strongly induced and a high percentage of KO cells could be rescued from Cu-induced toxicity. D-penicillamine treatment had a minor effect on KO cell viability, whereas the parental cell line showed a pronounced improvement. The combined treatment showed a highly synergistic effect on KO cells. The data suggest that zinc has a previously unrecognized effect on the viability of hepatocytes lacking ATP7B due to a high induction of MT1X expression compensating for low gene expression after Cu exposure. A combination therapy simultaneously targeting MT1X induction and Cu chelation improves overall hepatocyte survival for more efficient therapy of WD patients.

1434,Zinc monotherapy in presymptomatic Chinese children with Wilson's disease: a single-center retrospective study.,"Background: There is no official consensus on zinc therapy in presymptomatic children with Wilson's disease (WD); more data is needed. Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate therapy for Chinese children with presymptomatic WD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed presymptomatic children who received zinc gluconate at a single Chinese center specializing in pediatric hepatology. Short-term follow-up data on safety and efficacy were presented, and the effects of different doses of zinc were compared. Results: 30 children (21 boys) aged 2.7 to 16.8 years were followed up to 4.4 years; 26 (87%) children had abnormal ALT at baseline. The majority of patients (73%) received a higher dose of elemental zinc than is currently recommended. Zinc gluconate significantly reduced mean ALT (p<0.0001), AST (p<0.0001), GGT (p<0.0001) levels after 1 month and urinary copper excretion after 6 months (p<0.0054). Mean direct bilirubin levels fell significantly at 1 month (p = 0.0175), 3 months (p = 0.0010), and 6 months (p = 0.0036). Serum zinc levels increased gradually and reached a significantly higher level after 6 months (p<0.0026), reflecting good adherence to therapy. The complete blood count parameters did not change during the analysis period. 8 children experienced mild and transient gastrointestinal side effects. The higher dose of zinc did not affect response to treatment and was not associated with different or greater side effects compared to the conventional dose of zinc. Conclusion: In our cohort, zinc gluconate therapy for Chinese children with presymptomatic WD was effective, and a higher starting dose of elemental zinc had the same level of efficacy as the conventional dose.

Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhood malignancy, only two cases of ALL associated with WD have been reported to date. One patient died of relapse and infection, and the other died of neutropenic sepsis during treatment. Below we describe the case of a 10-year-old girl with WD and ALL. Adverse events of chemotherapy, including liver toxicity and severe myelosuppression, required adjustments in chemotherapy doses. After completing treatment, the patient has been in ALL remission without progression of liver damage for 2 years.

[Russian],"Wilson-Konovalov disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other target organs. The work describes a familial case of the abdominal form of the disease in three sisters, the oldest of whom died of fulminant liver failure at the age of 18 years. The second 16-year-old sister was diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis stage; his treatment with D-penicillamine resulted in a complete remission of the disease. The younger sister was diagnosed with the disease in the preclinical stage, so her good prognosis could be expected. However, the patient's refusal to treatment led to death from liver failure. This case demonstrates the importance of timely diagnosis and the possibility of a dramatic improvement in prognosis even in the stage of decompensated liver cirrhosis.",,"Rozina, T. P.;Ignatova, T.

1438,Long-term observation of patients with Wilson's disease: a single center experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. If the patient remains undiagnosed and untreated, the outcome of the disease can be fatal. Lifelong therapy provides normal survival for WD patients. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Objective: To evaluate the clinical course and long-term outcome of patients with WD. Material and methods: Sixty-five patients with WD (22 women and 43 men) with a mean age of 37 years (range, 18-65 years) were analyzed from January 2003 to December 2013. Survival analysis by the method of Kaplan-Meier and the Logit model was used. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (43.08%) had liver disease alone, thirty-two (49.23%) - with hepatic and neurological presentation, three - with neurological features without signs of liver injury. There were also two asymptomatic patients. The following liver forms were confirmed: steatosis (in 6.6%), hepatitis (in 41.7%) and cirrhosis (in 51.7% of patients). There was a mean delay in diagnosis of 39 months. At the end of the study, 74.2% of the cirrhotic patients were in Child A stage. Two patients developed acute liver failure after treatment discontinuation. We observed a hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic patient. Six patients with Child C liver cirrhosis had a fatal outcome during observation. Three of them had concurrent diseases: HBV and autoimmune cirrhosis. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was detected in 35.4% of the patients, being more common in those with neurological symptoms. The cumulative survival rate of people with WD after the first onset of symptoms was up to 76.38% at the end of year 15, and after diagnosis, 77.29%. The impact of delayed diagnosis of WD on overall survival was estimated. For each year of delay in diagnosis, the probability of death increased by approximately 10%. There was a beneficial effect of D-penicillamine (Dp) treatment in almost all patients. There were no complications during the pregnancies, with stable disease and normal delivery. CONCLUSION: Our observation showed a late diagnosis of WD. In most patients, the course of the disease was stable or even improved during treatment. The mortality rate increased in patients with cirrhosis.

1439,Improvement in the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient treated with copper chelators,"Introduction: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic, debilitating and progressive disease that leads to premature death, frequently due to failure of the right ventricle (RV). The pathobiology of severe PAH is based on the formation of angioproliferative lung lesions that lead to obstruction of blood flow. Recent experimental studies show that copper is necessary for lesion formation, and that copper chelation can prevent and even reverse lesions. Tetrathiomolybdate is a highly effective copper chelator used to treat Wilson's disease and has been used to treat malignancies refractory to therapy. Clinical case: We present the experience of the use of tetrathiomolybdate (ATN-224) for copper chelation in a patient diagnosed with idiopathic PAH 3 years ago. A 59-year-old woman with significant symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue (Class III of the New York Association), despite treatment with amlodipine, bosentan, and sildenafil, was evaluated with a 6-minute walk test (417 m), catheterization Cardiac (systolic and mean). pulmonary arterial pressure of 58/24 and 32 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance of 4.6 wood units), Doppler echocardiogram (showing systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of 73 mmHg), and cardiac MRI (RV ejection fraction 48% and volume systolic of 75 ml). He was then started on ATN-224 (150 mg twice daily) which he continued for 16 days before stopping due to hypotension. No additional changes were made to the patient's therapy. Repeat evaluation showed an improved NYHA class (-1 class), an improved 6-minute walk test (+83 m), a decrease in Doppler-estimated systolic pulmonary pressure (-30 mmHg), and an increase in the fraction of RV ejection (+11%). ) and stroke volume (+15 mL). Discussion: PAH is a progressive disease and current PAH treatments have minimal impact on pulmonary artery pressure and RV ejection fraction or stroke volume and are therefore considered to slow disease progression. instead of modifying its course. The current case shows an unexpected change in the natural history of the disease that appears to be associated with the introduction of copper chelation therapy. Although ATN-224 was poorly tolerated at the dose used (drop in systemic blood pressure), we suspect that the short duration of ATN-224 treatment led to significant ""remodeling"" of pulmonary vascular lesions, as observed in the experimental animal. PAH model. The result of this single case, in our opinion, justifies further studies with copper chelation in PAH.",,"Grinnan, D.;Abbate, A.;Farr, G.;Bogaard, H. J.;Voelkel, N. F.",2014,,,0,0,
1440,Penicillamine-induced perforating elastosis serpiginosa: is it useful to switch to zinc?,"Objective: Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare, although not exceptional, cutaneous adverse effect of penicillamine. Here we describe a 15-year-old white boy with neurological and hepatic-onset Wilson's disease (WD) who developed keratotic granulomatous annular populous skin lesions in the nape area and right arm during the third year of penicillamine therapy. Methods: WD was diagnosed at the age of 12 years by the presence of irregular proximal tremor, dysarthria, micrograph, labile mood, and inappropriate behavior. The patient also had hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with mild hypertransaminasemia. Diagnosis was based on low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high 24-hour urine copper values, high liver copper concentration, and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. Molecular analysis showed the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene. Penicillamine therapy was started with a favorable response on neuropsychiatric symptoms. Liver function tests (LFT) remained normal. Based on the characteristics of the lesions and the findings of the skin biopsy, EPS was diagnosed. Results: Topical steroid treatment was tried without benefit. Given the worsening of the skin lesions with significant visual impact, treatment with penicillamine was discontinued 3 months after the start of EPS and it was replaced by zinc acetate. In the following months, the skin lesions persisted unchanged without histological signs of progression after three years of zinc monotherapy, while the general symptoms and LFTs remained normal. Conclusions: Although penicillamine is an effective and generally safe drug for patients with WD, the risk of some serious cutaneous and non-cutaneous adverse events might suggest a more extensive use of zinc monotherapy as maintenance therapy in patients with WD.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Leone, F.;Tufano, M.;Vajro, P.;Spagnuolo, M.

1441,To study the cause of death in patients with Wilson's neurological disease,"Objectives: To study the cause of death in patients with neurological Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a treatable autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and is characterized by protein manifestations due to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea, and other tissues. Although treatable but still deaths in WD patients are not rare. Methods: We studied the cause of death in 44 patients diagnosed with WD based on a detailed clinical evaluation of the Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea and biochemical studies (decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper and increased urinary copper) and neuroimaging. Results: A total of 6 patients (13.6%) died during the observation period. The main cause of death was delayed diagnosis. The mean delay in diagnosis for all patients was 18.9 months, while for those who died it was 25.4 months. Of the 6 patients who died, 5 patients had a dystonic presentation while one had a parkinsonian presentation. Five of the 6 patients were young (under 18 years of age) and one was an adult. Four of the 6 patients showed poor compliance with treatment (zinc and penicillamine), as well as with regular follow-up. Conclusion: The institution of early and correct diagnosis of adequate treatment and continuation for life can prevent devastating consequences since WD is a treatable disorder.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2014,October,,0,0,
1442,"Wilson's disease: ten years of retrospective experience at the national liver institute, Egypt","Background and objectives Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Our goal is to determine the common clinical presentations, laboratory findings, diagnostic methods, and long-term outcomes in Egyptian patients. Methods All medical records were reviewed, between 2000 and 2010, in the pediatric hepatology service. Detailed disease follow-up data was collected for each patient. Serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, and other routine laboratory investigations. Slit-lamp examination for Kayser Fleisher rings and 24-hour urine for copper were performed before and after penicillamine challenge. Percutaneous liver biopsy was also performed in most patients. Results The most significant hepatic presentation was jaundice and Kayser Flisher's rings. The most significant laboratory findings were copper excretion after depencylamine challenge (1546.57 +/- 99.55 mg/Dl) and the decrease in mean ceruloplasmin concentration (13.8 +/- 2.38 mg/dl) below 20 ug. /dl. There was a significant increase in albumin and a significant improvement in prothrombin time after treatment.

1443,A Phase I Pharmacokinetic Profile Study in Patients Receiving Trientine Dihydrochloride for the Treatment of Wilson's Disease,"Background and objective: Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is a common treatment for Wilson's disease; however, data on pharmacokinetics are limited to healthy subjects. The aim of the study was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters that are supposed to be representative of the steady state in patients with Wilson's disease treated with trientine. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01874028 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty subjects (9 men, 4 boys, mean age 39.3 years [12-61]) with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease were exposed to trientine after oral administration of the dose standard for that subject. Blood samples were taken 0.5; one; 1.5; two; 3; 4; 6; 8 and 12 h after dosing. Trientine concentration in plasma samples was measured by LC-MS/MS after protein precipitation extraction in the calibration range of 20-2000 ng/mL. Results: Trientine was rapidly absorbed, with a tmax between 0.48 and 4.08 hours post-dose. There was some variability in exposure, with a 10-fold range in Cmax and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly less when pharmacokinetic parameters were dose-normalized (6.7-fold range in Cmax/D and 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). Terminal half-life, where defined, was broadly consistent between subjects (range 2.33 to 6.99 hours). AUC0-8 could be calculated in 14 of 20 subjects, however, since dosing occurred at steady-state pharmacokinetics, AUC0-t is representative of exposure over the dosing interval. There were no marked differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between adult subjects (n=16) and children (n=4). The Cmax range was 508-3100 ng/mL in adults and 309-1940 ng/mL in children; the equivalent ranges for AUC0-t were 1240-17100 ng.h/mL and 1500-8060 ng.h/mL, respectively. When pharmacokinetic parameters were normalized for the administered dose, Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children remained within the ranges for adult subjects. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetics of trientine in subjects with Wilson's disease were similar to those reported in healthy subjects. (Figure presented).",,"Weiss, K.

1444,Sex differences in liver SAM:SAH ratios and gene transcript levels after prenatal and postnatal choline supplementation and copper chelation treatment in an animal model of Wilson's disease.,"Bottom. Methionine metabolism, critical for DNA methylation reactions, may provide epigenetic regulation of genes involved in liver damage in Wilson's disease (WD). We hypothesized that perinatal maternal choline treatment might modify the sex-specific response to penicillamine in offspring in the tx-j model of WD. Methods. Control (8 mmol/kg choline) or choline-supplemented (36 mmol/kg) diets were administered to female wild-type and tx-j mice starting 2 weeks before mating and continuing in the offspring until 24 weeks of age. . A tx-j subgroup of both sexes received oral penicillamine with or without a choline-supplemented diet from 12 to 24 weeks of age. Results. Decreased ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), an index of DNA methylation capacity, decreased in each sex of tx-j offspring mice, consistent with known downregulation of SAH hydrolase levels in this mouse model of TD (Table 1). The SAM:SAH ratio was higher in female tx-j mice than in untreated males (p<0.05). Separate treatments with choline or penicillamine were associated with similar increases in the SAM:SAH ratio in male tx-j levels versus wild-type. While the ratio increased with each separate treatment in tx-j males, it decreased with each separate treatment in tx-j females, but was not changed in either sex by the combination of choline and penicillamine. Transcript levels of Dnmt3b, a regulator of DNA methylation in tx-j mice, were increased in untreated tx-j of both sexes, and decreased by separate or combined treatment with penicillamine and choline in tx-j male, but were not modified by any other. treatment in female tx-j mice. Grp78 transcript levels were increased in tx-j mice of both sexes, reduced to control levels by choline in male tx-j but only by combined treatment with penicillamine and choline in female tx-j mice. Conclusions. Our results indicate different sexual responses to copper chelation and methyl donors in the tx-j model of WD that could explain the different phenotype between genders in WD.

1445,No increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease during long-term follow-up,"Background and objectives: Although liver cirrhosis is a frequent complication in Wilson's disease (WD), data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in these patients are scarce. Here we report HCC risk in a well-defined WD cohort unequivocally proven with long-term follow-up (FU) and correlate HCC risk with efficacy of copper removal therapy and severity of liver disease. Methods: All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD (Leipzig score >= 4) in three Dutch referral university hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. The end of FU was defined as the date of HCC diagnosis, liver transplant death, or last available hospital visit. Results: In total, 130 patients with WD were followed for a median FU of 15 years (range 0.1-51.2). The total number of years of FU was 2336. The median age at diagnosis was 16 years (range 0-43). Presentation was asymptomatic, exclusively hepatic, neurological, combined, and unknown in 4%, 55%, 9%, 30%, and 2% of cases, respectively. The median Leipzig score was 8 points (range 4-13). At the start of the study, cirrhosis was present in 74 patients (57% of the total: 64% compensated and 36% decompensated). At the end of FU, liver disease severity improved, stabilized, or deteriorated in 20%, 46%, and 24% of all cases, respectively. Twenty-eight patients received a liver transplant. Five patients died from complications of their liver disease and two deaths were related to liver transplantation. In patients who were treated for at least one year (n=111), zinc, penicillamine, or trientine (alone, sequential, or combined) were prescribed in 92%, 69%, and 14% of patients, respectively. At the end of FU, the efficiency of copper removal based on values of serum ceruloplasmin-unbound copper concentration (target: <10 mg/dL) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (target: <100 mg /24 hours), was excellent in 34% of patients, moderate in 42%, poor in 13%, and unknown in 11%. Two patients developed HCC. The first patient was a 39-year-old man with decompensated cirrhosis in combination with HCC. The second patient was a 63-year-old woman with unequivocal WD diagnosed 50 years earlier. Despite an excellent recovery at the end of FU, he progressed to decompensated cirrhosis in which HCC developed. There were no additional risk factors for liver disease in either patient. The estimated annual risk of HCC for all patients was 0.09% (95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.28). Subgroup analysis in cirrhotic patients revealed an annual risk of HCC of 0.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.45). Conclusion: even in the case of cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is low in Wilson's disease and does not seem to be related to the efficiency of stripping. Our data do not support regular HCC surveillance in WD.",,"Van Meer, S.;De Man, R. A.;Van Den Berg, A. P.;Houwen, R.;Linn, F.;Siersema, P. D.;Van Erpecum, K.

1446,Neuropsychiatric interface in a patient with depression,"Psychiatric manifestations are significantly predominant in most patients with Wilson's disease (WD) at onset. Nearly half of patients undergo psychiatric hospitalization prior to diagnosis of WD. Goals/Objectives: To report a case of WD presenting with unresponsive depression. Methodology: 31-year-old patient who came with complaints of gradual onset of withdrawn behavior, irritability, sad mood and slowness of movement for 1 year. A private psychiatrist made a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. He was started on antidepressants and received 10 Electro Convulsive Therapy. However, he did not perceive any improvement and discontinued treatment due to side effects. Patient presented at KJSH after 6 months due to worsening symptoms. At the consultation, h/o tremors, difficulty speaking and tilting the body backwards while sitting for a few months. Neurological examination revealed brisk deep tendon reflexes. In MSE, the patient had delayed psychomotor activity, making facial gestures with mannerisms. His mood was sad with restricted affect. Ideas of helplessness, hopelessness and death wishes were expressed. Magnetic resonance imaging showed gliosis with calcification in bilateral basal ganglia. The ophthalmological examination reveals a Keyser Fleischer ring. Investigations revealed elevated liver enzymes and high urinary Cu. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and started on Tab. penicillamine. Discussion: Although WD is rare, it commonly presents with psychiatric symptoms. Depression is extremely common in WD patients, affecting 30-60% of them. Mood disorders show a limited response to antidepressants, while the use of chelating agents leads to normalization of mood and improvement of non-psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Psychiatrists should be aware of the psychiatric manifestations of WD. A differential for Wilson's disease may be considered if the patient shows poor response or oversensitivity to psychotropic medications.

1447,Wilson's disease: Catatonia as the only manifestation,"Introduction: Catatonia is a clinical presentation with varied causes ranging from infectious causes to metabolic causes. Wilson's disease is one of the known causes of catatonia, but catatonia has been reported to be a rare (0.01%) presentation of Wilson's disease. We present a case of Wilson's disease that presented as catatonia as the only manifestation. Case Report: Mrs. S, a 20-year-old single Muslim woman who presented with a 5-month history of acute onset suggestive of catatonia (mutism, stupor, ambiguity, waxy flexibility, and rigidity). The patient had no history of psychiatric illness. There was a family history of suicide in an older brother and two older sisters who had died of 7 months of illness of similar presentation. The patient did not respond to the 3-day trial of intravenous lorazepam and 10 days of modified electroconvulsive therapy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple hyperintensities in the internal capsule and basal ganglia. Ultrasound (USG) of the abdomen was normal. Biochemical investigations showed an increase in urinary copper, a decrease in serum copper, and a decrease in blood ceruloplasmin. Slit-lamp examination was normal, and neuropsychiatric examination revealed a catatonic state with no obvious cardinal neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and the patient improved with penicillamine, zinc sulfate, and lorazepam. Implications: Wilson's disease should be maintained as a differential diagnosis in young adults presenting with catatonia.",,"Singh, A. P.;Kukreti, A. K. P.;Jhirwal, O.",2014,January,,0,0,
1448,Metal-chelating pseudopeptides and their possible medical applications,"Wilson's disease (WD) is one of the main genetic disorders of copper (Cu) metabolism in humans. In this rare disease, the ATPase ATP7B responsible for the excretion of excess Cu from liver cells is defective and, consequently, toxic Cu accumulates in the liver [1]. To treat WD, we propose innovative Cu chelators, with the following properties: (i) they show a high affinity for Cu(I), which is the oxidation state of excess intracellular Cu (ii) they are selective for Cu( I) with respect to potentially competing endogenous metals such as Zn(II) and (iii) they are soluble in water. The mimetics of the binding sites found in the proteins involved in Cu homeostasis are good candidates that meet all these expectations. Therefore, pseudopeptides were designed to mimic Cu(I) coordination by metal-sequestering proteins such as metallothioneins. They are constructed from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as a tripod anchor and functionalized with three amino acids cysteine or D-penicillamine [2, 3]. The symmetric nonbiological scaffold C<inf>3</inf> acts as a platform that orients the three binding arms in the same direction to coordinate the Cu(I) ion. To promote intracellular Cu chelation and internalization into hepatocytes, these sulfur ligands have been functionalized with sugar units to target liver cells through asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-Rs). The obtained glycoconjugates were shown to release high-affinity Cu chelating agents in liver cells. This confirms that the use of intracellular Cu(I) chelators is very promising to treat Cu overload in WD [4]. (Figure presented).",,"Jullien, A.

1449,Possible implications of copper chelation on iron homeostasis in patients with Wilson's disease. Effect of penicillamine on ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity,"Introduction: Ceruloplasmin (Cp) belongs to the family of multi-copper ferroxidase proteins. It is involved in the loading of Fe on serum transferrin. Defective copper loading in apo-ceruloplasmin (apo-Cp) may be due to mutations in the ATP7B gene that characterize Wilson's disease (WD). WD patients are treated with copper chelators such as penicillamine (PA). Objectives and methods: We postulate that copper chelators will reduce copper incorporation into apo-Cp, which will affect ferroxidase activity; consequently disrupt iron homeostasis. Hereby, we investigated the in vitro effect of Cu and Cu-PA on HepG2 viability (MTT assay), Cp ferroxidase activity (pPD oxidase assay), and Cp, ferritin, and transferrin expression (Western blot). In addition, we examined the activity of serum Cp ferroxidase activity in 5WD patients who are homozygous for a mutation in the WND gene and are treated with PA. Results and Conclusions: In vitro: Cu decreased (50%) the viability of HepG2 cells, while Cu-PA co-treatment significantly altered cell morphology, further decreased cell viability (70%) and induced cycle arrest cell in G2/M phase. Cp expression in HepG2 cells was increased by Cu, decreased by PA, and unchanged by Cu-PA. Ferritin expression in HepG2 cells decreased with cells treated with Cu, PA and Cu-PA Transferrin expression shows a qualitative decrease in cells treated with PA and control Cu-PA (0.022-0.027 units). Mild elevation was noted in 2 patients while the transferrin level was in the normal range. Cp Ferroxidase activity in both HepG2 cells and serum from WD patients was significantly decreased. The recommended lifetime treatment with Cu chelators would influence the incorporation of Fe into transferrin, which could consequently lead to Fe deposition in the liver. The implication of our findings calls for reassessment of WD patients treated with PA for iron complications.",,"Usta, J.;Majarian, T.;El-Rifai, O.;Barada, K.",2014,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12919,0,0,
1450,Symptomatic copper deficiency in a patient with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by an excess of copper that leads to copper accumulation and requires lifelong copper removal treatment. However, excessive treatment with anti-copper agents can cause copper deficiency which can present with neurological and hematological symptoms. We present a WD patient with copper deficiency during zinc sulfate therapy. Clinical case: A 37-year-old woman with presymptomatic WD diagnosed in 1998, treated with zinc sulfate, who was admitted to our clinic in 2013 due to paresthesia in fingers and toes of 3 months' duration. His neurological examination was normal. He had leukopenia (WBC 2.9 x 10<sup>9</sup>L, normal range 4.5-10.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Serum ceruloplasmin 0.92 mg/dl (normal range 25-45), serum copper concentration <5 Î¼g/dl (normal range 70-140), urinary copper excretion 11 Î¼g/24 h (normal range 0- 50) were markedly reduced. MRI of the cervical spine showed a linearly increased T2 signal lesion in the posterior column of the cervical spinal cord. Somatosensory evoked potentials showed impaired conduction in the dorsal column. Electromyography showed no neuropathy. The vitamin B12 level was in the normal range. Liver function test was normal. Zinc sulfate was removed. Within 1 month the leukopenia completely resolved. Serum ceruloplasmin (5 mg/dl) and serum copper concentration (20 Î¼g/dl) 6 months later were higher than in previous tests. Urinary copper excretion remained low (12.5 Î¼g/24 h). MRI of the cervical spine 6 months later shows marked improvement. Nine months after discontinuation of anti-copper treatment, d-penicillamine was introduced instead of zinc sulfate. Conclusion: Copper deficiency as a result of anti-copper treatment can cause neurological and hematological signs. Treatment should be regularly monitored.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Sobanska, A.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-014-7337-4,0,0,
1451,Neuro-Wilson disease: Report of seven cases and review of the literature,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper overlap, dominated by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms. The objective is to review the genetic aspects, diagnosis and treatment of Neuro-Wilson through a series of patients followed up at the sahloul neurology department, CHU Sousse. Methods: We present seven cases collected in the department of neurology CHU Sahloul Sousse. All patients had neurological signs with or without extraneurological symptoms. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on the clinical, biological and radiological results. Results: Seven patients, two boys and five girls. The mean age was 25.5 years, with an extreme that ranged from 14 to 48 years. Neurological signs reveal the disease in six patients and the most frequent symptoms are tremor. One patient had cerebellar ataxia and another has had seizures. Three of the patients had a familial form with autosomal recessive transmission. Kayser Flecher's ring was found in one patient. Cupric balance was altered in all patients, including associated hemochromatosis. Brain MRI was pathological in two patients with lesions in the basal ganglia. All patients were treated with penicillamine D with good evolution in five patients. Conclusions: When left untreated, the course of Wilson's disease is always fatal. The treatment is based on copper binders, zinc salts and liver transplantation. The prognosis of Wilson's disease seems even better as the neurological and hepatic symptoms are not pronounced.",,"Ben Algia, L.;Chatti, I.;Benhalima, M.;Saied, Z.;Khefifi, A.;Ben Amor, S.;Benammou, S.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-014-7337-4,0,0,
1452,Mixed-type polyneuropathy in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's Disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of abnormal copper metabolism that predominantly affects the central nervous system and the liver. Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported in the setting of WD and is not well characterized. Objectives: To report a patient with WD with peripheral neuropathy. Design: Case report. Setting: Neurology Diagnostic Unit, POSan Martino, Oristano, Italy. Methods: A 58-year-old male with WD treated with trientine referred to our center for mild weakness of the distal extremities with hypoesthesia. Clinical evaluation showed mild leg weakness with foot drop and hyporeflexia. A nerve conduction study was performed using standard techniques (Medtronic Keypoint v5.09). Distal motor latency, F-wave latency, motor nerve conduction velocity, and CMAP in the deep peroneal, posterior tibial, median, and ulnar nerves were evaluated; Sensory nerve conduction velocity and SBP were measured in the sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Analyzing her anamnestic and laboratory data, no other cause of polyneuropathy was found. Results: The electroneurographic findings suggested a mixed-type length-dependent asymmetric sensorimotor neuropathy. Conclusion: We confirm the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in WD. Consistent with the literature, our findings also showed both myelin and axonal damage. Polyneuropathy may occur despite therapy, although an iatrogenic contribution cannot be excluded.",,"Aste, R.;Salaris, E.;Pische, M. G.;Floris, E. R.",2014,June,,0,0,
1453,A novel pathogenic mutation of ATP7B in a Thai patient with a very mild form of Wilson's disease,"Objective: To describe a new mutation of Wilson's disease and its clinical manifestations. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism derived from the mutation of the ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13. The H1069Q mutation, which is the most frequent mutation in the United States and northern Europe, is associated with late onset and less severity. Methods: 39-year-old woman, master's graduate. He had progressive right hand dystonia and noted mild right hand weakness for 25 years. Three years after onset it progressed to generalized dystonia and chorea. He had no tremors, rigidity, or seizures. He had no history of psychiatric problems or other underlying disease. There was no family history of WD. He was diagnosed with WD at another hospital, but was lost to follow-up for 5 years. Physical examination showed no signs of chronic hepatic stigmata. He had generalized dystonia that was more prominent on the right hand and buccolingual region and generalized chorea that was more prominent on the left side. He had mild weakness on the left side and normal eye movement. Ocular examination revealed a Kayser-Fleischer ring. He had no rigidity or tremor, normal cerebellar sign, normal sensation, and no other long tract signs. Investigations showed low serum ceruloplasmin level, 2 mg/dl (20-60), normal serum copper, 0.33 ppm (0.66-1.50), and high urinary copper level, 98 ug/24hr-ur ( 17-43). Liver function test and liver synthetic function were in the normal range. Brain MRI showed a typical feature of WD. Detection of mutations in the 21 exons of the ATP7B gene was performed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, followed by sequencing of the altered fragments. Results: A new single base deletion resulting in a new frameshift translation, NM-000053.2(ATP7B) c.3168delT;p.Leu1057 Trpfs*64, and a splice defect in intron 17, NM-000053.2( ATP7B) c.3700-1G>C (IVS17-1G>C) were identified in this patient. She was treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate. Clinical improved. The KF ring disappeared. Serum ceruloplasmin and urine copper level returned to normal range. Conclusions: The patient presented progressive generalized chorea dystonia without other typical signs and symptoms of WD. The severity of the disease was mild. Genetic testing showed a new WD mutation. This mutation may be associated with a favorable prognosis.

1454,To study the response to treatment in patients with neurological Wilson's disease,"Objective: To evaluate the response to treatment in patients with neurological Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that make a protein important for copper transport and removal of excess copper. of the body The disease presents with features that primarily suggest involvement of the liver and brain. It most commonly affects children or young adults and has an invariably fatal course if not adequately treated with discovery therapy. Zinc and D-penicillamine are the commonly available drugs for the treatment of WD in India. Methods: This study was carried out in 31 patients who were diagnosed with WD based on clinical features suggestive of WD; detection of Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea by slit-lamp examination and biochemical parameters (24-hour urine copper greater than 100 micrograms/day; serum ceruloplasmin less than 20 mg/dl and serum copper less than 75 micrograms/dl) . All patients received zinc and penicillamine. Results: All 31 patients were started on zinc (elemental zinc 50-2150 mg/day) and penicillamine copper chelation therapy (250-1500 mg/day). Neurological worsening occurred in 16 (51.6%), decreased platelets in 13 (54.2%), increased transaminases in 6 (19.4%) and skin rash in 5 (16.1%) patients. In these patients, penicillamine was withdrawn and restarted after stabilization of clinical and biochemical parameters. Adjuvant therapy with trihexyphenidyl, levodopa, and pyridoxine was used. After reinstitution of penicillamine, 10 (32.25%) patients showed improvement. Of the remaining 6 (19.4%) patients, 4 (12.9%) never regained their pre-penicillamine status and were lost to follow-up. The remaining 2 patients (6.45%) worsened even more and died. A 24-hour urine copper measurement was performed on patients to monitor adequacy of treatment. Variable improvements were observed: 13 (41.9%) completely improved to pre-illness level of functioning; 12 (38.7%) presented incomplete improvement with sequelae; 4 (12.9%) were lost to follow-up and 2 (6.45%) patients died. Conclusions: Twenty-five (80.6%) of our patients showed improvement with more than half of them showing complete improvement. Therefore, early and correct diagnosis together with institution of adequate treatment (with careful clinical and biochemical monitoring) and continuation for life can prevent devastating consequences as the disease is treatable.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25914,0,0,
1455,A case of copper deficiency myelopathy with features of parkinsonism and iron accumulation in the brain,"Objective: To present a case of copper deficiency myelopathy with characteristics of parkinsonism and cerebral iron accumulation. Background: Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) occurs as a result of acquired copper deficiency and has an appearance similar to the subacute combined degeneration of vitamin B12 deficiency. Acquired copper deficiency is rare and can occur as a result of gastric surgery, excessive zinc intake, prolonged TPN, and malabsorption. Progressive spastic tetraparesis, paresthesias, and sensory ataxic gait are seen in CDM. Characteristic MRI findings are hyperintensities in the dorsal columns of the cervical spine with extension to the brainstem. Hypointensities on brain MRI have not been reported. We present a case of CDM with characteristics of parkinsonism and brain iron accumulation. Results: An 81-year-old man presented with a 20-year history of progressive gait instability, leg stiffness, and macrocytic anemia. He was diagnosed and treated for vitamin B12 deficiency. Serum ceruloplasmin (CP), copper (Cu), and urinary Cu excretion levels were consistently low at 10.3 mg/dl, 0.48 mcg/ml, and 9 ug/spec. The patient denied a history of gastric surgery or excessive zinc supplementation. He was treated with Cu orally and IV without response. Five years after presentation, it was discovered that he had Parkinsonism, including; bradykinesia, rigidity, masked facies, hypophonia, and sialorrhea. He had a markedly stooped posture and a spastic gait. A trial of levodopa was unsuccessful. Brain MRI revealed iron deposition consistent with aceruloplasminemia (ACP). Iron, transferrin, ferritin, zinc, and HgbA1c were normal. Testing of the CP gene showed no previously identified mutations consistent with ACP. Conclusions: This case is unique in two ways: there is no underlying cause for Cu deficiency without correction of serum levels after treatment and accumulation of iron in the brain found on MRI suggestive of neurodegeneration with iron accumulation. in the brain (NBIA). MRI findings and low urinary Cu excretion exclude Wilson's disease (WD). This case appears to be one of a subgroup of patients with low CP and Cu levels that do not fit the diagnosis of WD or PCA. This combination of CDM and NBIA has not been described and could represent a new form of ACP or two coexisting diseases in a single individual. Brain MRI should be obtained in cases of CDM, especially those with progressive symptoms or lack of response to Cu supplementation.",,"Frei, K.

1458,Pregnancy in women with Wilson's disease: The copper connection,"Background Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by liver cirrhosis and neurological disorders. This is a report of two patients with Wilson's disease and their successful journey during pregnancy and lactation. There are only a few reports on pregnancy outcome in Wilson's disease (WD) from India. The authors of this study emphasize that pregnancy in Wilson's disease is safe and successful when treatment with a chelating agent is continued without interruption. Case Case one was a 30-year-old known case of G4P1L1A2 Wilson's disease from 7 years of age. She had two miscarriages and a C-section in the past. She had been taking d-penicillamine since the age of 7 years, which was changed to zinc sulfate as recommended by the neurophysician during pregnancy. She delivered by elective caesarean section and continued on zinc sulfate after delivery. Case two was a 24-year-old G2A1 who was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at age 13. She had been taking d-penicillamine and continued to do so throughout her pregnancy. She had discontinued penicillamine therapy alone 1 year prior to her pregnancy and had developed severe psychotic symptoms, mood disturbances, and poor memory. He was restarted on d-penicillamine with rapid improvement in symptoms. She had a healthy baby by normal vaginal delivery. Conclusion Successful pregnancies and uneventful term delivery can occur in mothers with WD undergoing treatment. These women require anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. The main goal of treatment is to protect the mother from copper toxicity and at the same time protect the fetus from possible teratogenesis due to low copper levels. A regimen of d-penicillamine during pregnancy can control the disease without harming the fetus. Treatment should not be discontinued during pregnancy and zinc therapy should be considered. Patients with Wilson's disease who are contemplating pregnancy should have their liver function and copper status evaluated.",,"Mehta, P.;Vishwanath, U.;Agarwal, P.",2014,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.12788,0,0,
1459,Complete neurological recovery in Wilson's disease: Experience with 100 consecutive patients treated between 2005-2013,"OBJECTIVE: To study the neurological outcomes of Wilson's disease (WD) after copper removal. BACKGROUND: Judicious copper removal can prevent WD-related mortality and reverse neurological disability. DESIGN/METHODS: Between 2005 and 2013 we prospectively recruited 100 consecutive patients with WD and WD-related neurological disability. All received penicillamine or trientine at the recommended doses (125 mg/day - up to 2 g/day) in the initial decopper phase of treatment. Treatment was followed using the standard WD-specific scale, the Wilson's Disease Global Assessment Scale (GAS for WD). RESULTS: There was no mortality during the eight-year study period. Of the 100 patients, 56 were men. The mean age of onset of the disease was 12.4 years (range 3-35). According to the three-point Severity of Illness Scale (SS3), at the time of enrollment, 43% of patients had severe neurological disability (defined as being bedridden, mute, requiring enteral feeding and bladder catheterization) . While 37% had moderate neurological disability and 20% mild. Dystonia was the most common movement disorder (77%), followed by parkinsonism (53%) and tremor (47%). Of the 100 patients, 4 were lost to follow-up after the initial visit and two were refractory to decoppering. All other 94 patients showed significant neurological recovery during a mean follow-up of 20.7 months (range 4-36). 70% of the 94 patients (including 68% of patients with severe neurological disability) showed complete neurological recovery and were able to resume normal life on a par with their peers. At last follow-up, 30% of the 94 patients show ongoing recovery. Promisingly, improvements were also seen in several movement disorders, including dystonia and parkinsonism. Adverse events observed included decoppering-induced transient neurological impairment (n=15), thrombocytopenia (n=20), emergent psychosis (n=10), rash (n=6), non-traumatic fracture (n=4), and lupus. induced by penicillamine (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Our report reinforces that remarkable neurological recovery can be expected in WD patients with judicious decoppering.

Background: D-penicillamine cannot mitigate cerebral copper overload and neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: high resolution liquid chromatography, atomic analysis. Absorption spectrophotometry, biochemical estimations, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and preparation of nanoparticles and their physicochemical characterization were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles exhibited a mean size of 274.09 nm along with less than 29.32% release of penicillamine D over 2 h under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased levels of D-penicillamine in the brain of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory, along with a concomitant increase in urinary copper levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in a rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine therapy resulted in negative rhodanine staining of liver and brain sections corroborated by 60.1% and 16.4% reduction in liver and brain copper content, respectively, compared with the untreated copper intoxicated group. However, liver and brain sections from the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group demonstrated grade 1 copper deposits and copper absence corroborated by a 47.2% and 32.8% reduction in copper content. liver and brain copper, respectively, compared with the untreated copper-intoxicated group.

Material and Methods: In this study, 194 patients (156 index cases) at Istanbul Medical College with a median follow-up of 51 months (13-105 months) and 1069 patient-years were retrospectively evaluated for pregnancy. All patients met the 2012 EASL Wilson's disease guideline criteria. Results: 20 (16 index cases) of 84 women had a total of 49 pregnancies. At presentation, 7 patients had decompensated cirrhosis, 4 had compensated cirrhosis, 6 had neurological signs (dysarthria, tremor, etc.), and 9 were in the precirrhotic stage. Of 16 prediagnosis pregnancies, 9 resulted in miscarriage. Of 33 post-diagnosis pregnancies, 5 resulted in spontaneous abortion and 5 ended (one due to fetal anomaly and 4 at the request of the patients). Of 23 live births, one was born premature and died within three weeks. No abnormalities were reported in the other 22 and they are still alive and healthy. One patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and Wilson's disease after 7 abortions. Under treatment, she gave birth after two miscarriages. One of the patients who discontinued her medication during pregnancy died in the second month postpartum due to liver failure. The other patient developed tremor in the third trimester and her treatment was restarted. Drug doses were reduced during pregnancy; one patient was treated with zinc (100 mg/d), one was treated with 600 mg of trientine plus 100 mg of zinc, and the others were treated with D-penicillamine 600 mg/d and zinc 100 mg/d. Copper deficiency did not develop in any of the pregnancies. The patients breastfed their babies. After lactation, drug doses were increased when necessary. No wound healing problems occurred after cesarean section in 10 patients who were under treatment with D-penicillamine (600 mg/day). Conclusion: Wilson's patients can become pregnant under combined therapy (chelation and zinc) even if they have decompensated cirrhosis. During pregnancy, medications should be administered twice daily (D-penicillamine 600 mg/d, trientine 600 mg/d, zinc 100 mg/d) and treatments should never be discontinued. At given doses, D-penicillamine does not affect wound healing after cesarean section.

1463,The experience of Wilson's disease at Istanbul Medical College O,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms associated with positive copper balance. It is possible to improve survival and quality of life with chelation therapy, even during a decompensated stage. Material and methods: In this single-center study, we shared 20 years of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of 194 cases (156 indexes) diagnosed according to the EASL 2012 Wilson's disease criteria. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded and investigated all possible causes of liver disease. Results: 56.7% (110) of the total patients were male, with a mean age of 22.3 +/- 10 years at the time of diagnosis, with a delay in diagnosis of 19 +/- 33 ( 0-168) months. 35.7% of all patients had a hepatic form, 20.7% a neurological form, and 28.9% a hepatoneurological form. 14.7% of the patients were asymptomatic. Family screening revealed 38 patients, of whom 24% had compensated liver cirrhosis and 39.5% had normal findings. HBsAg positivity was 3.1%, Anti-HCV 0.5%, respectively. Patients had low serum ceruloplasmin levels (<20 mg/dL) 86%, elevated 24-hour urine copper production (>100 mcg) 89.9%, and elevated liver copper (>250 mcg/g) 84.7 %. During the course of treatment, ceruloplasmin levels decreased in 89% of patients and were below the diagnostic limit (p < 0.05). More frequent in patients with neurological signs, 65.7% had a Kayser Fleischer ring. Serum albumin levels increased, transaminase levels decreased, prothrombin time shortened, and clinical ascites disappeared significantly with treatment. Four people with medication nonadherence developed neurological symptoms. Ten patients were switched from D-penicillamine to trientine due to increased neurological symptoms. During follow-up, we lost 15 patients due to pharmacological noncompliance; one patient due to bleeding from duodenal varices and one patient due to sepsis (D-penicillamine treatment increased transfer dysphagia and caused aspiration pneumonia). 315 siblings of 93 index cases were examined. Secondary tests were requested in 89 cases because they met some diagnostic criteria. The parents of 46.4% had intra-family marriages.

1464,Are low albumin and high alanine transaminases useful in predicting poor outcome of medical therapy in Wilson's chronic liver disease (CLD)?,"Introduction: The New Wilson index is not a reliable predictor of outcome in chronic Wilsonian liver disease. The aim of this study was to analyze predictive risk factors for poor outcome in Wilson's disease presenting as chronic liver disease. Methods: Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as CLD was managed with D-pencylamine (10-20 mg/kg/day) and zinc combination therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplant or death) at the time of diagnosis. Results: Thirty-three cases presented in the last 3 years. Five of 7 presenting as acute chronic liver failure (ACLF), 6 of 20 as decompensated CLD had a poor outcome. All 6 compensated CLD, 2 of 7 ACLF, and 14 of 20 with decompensated CLD improved. On univariate analysis, bilirubin, AST, ALT, Child Pughs score, and New Wilson index score were significantly higher in those with poor outcomes. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association with poor outcome: high ALT (adjusted OR 1.062, 95% CI 1.007-1.12, p = 0.015) and low albumin (adjusted OR 0.052, 95% CI 0.005). -0.56, p = 0.028). With a 20 IU increase in ALT the odds ratio increases by 3.3 (95% CI 1.15 to 9.58) and a 1 gram decrease in albumin increases the odds ratio by 0, 95 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.995). Conclusion: High ALT and low albumin are independently associated with poor outcome of medical treatment in WD presenting as CLD. Child Pugh and New Wilson index scores did not show a significant association with poor outcome.",,"Alam, S.;Khanna, R.;Sood, V.;Rawat, D.",2014,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-014-9519-7,0,0,
1465,Report of the ASFA Apheresis Registry Study in Wilson's Disease,"Purpose: Wilson's disease is a rare (1:30,000) autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the ATP7B gene that results in copper accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea, and kidneys. Although treatment options are available, such as low-copper diets, zinc acetate, tetrathiomolybdate, and copper chelation, patients may still have an attack before the disease is diagnosed or after diagnosis due to ineffectiveness or intolerance of the treatment. current therapy. Patients with crisis of Wilson's disease often present with fulminant hepatic failure, severe DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, and multi-organ failure, with rapid clinical deterioration. Eventually, many patients require a liver transplant. In this setting, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been used to remove copper and provide a bridge for liver transplantation. Most of the studies describing the use of plasmapheresis for Wilson's disease have been case reports. Here we report the collective experiences through the ASFA apheresis registry on Wilson's disease. Methods: The ASFA apheresis registry study is a multicenter registry study. Both prospective and retrospective data are allowed in the registry; the latter involve data collection through January 2000. Study data was collected and managed using the REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted by the National Children's Health System. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure web application designed to support data capture for research studies. The record includes patient demographic and clinical information, information about the apheresis procedure, treatment schedule, and treatment outcome/complications. All participating sites had obtained approval from the ASFA Apheresis Registration Subcommittee of the ASFA Applications Committee, as well as local IRBs. Results: To date, a total of 10 patients (three men and seven women) with Wilson's disease treated between 2005 and 2013 were included in this study. The median age at first diagnosis was 16 years (range 6-30 years). ). The median age at the first TPE was 17 years (range 6-61 years). Patients underwent a total of 43 TPEs, with most patients requiring one intensive TPE session. The median number of TPE procedures was 3.5 (range 1-9). Apart from one patient who had received a TPE before the patient was transferred to the study site, no patient received TPE before the first TPE of the registration study. All TPEs used ACD-A as an anticoagulant, 98% (42/43) of TPEs targeted 1-1.25 plasma volumes, and 95% (41/43) of TPEs were performed with a balance of 100% liquids. All patients had a central line placed for TPE. After TPE, 90% (9/10) of patients underwent liver transplantation, all 10 patients (transplanted and non-transplanted) have a survival of at least 6 months. Conclusion: The 10 patients with Wilson's disease who underwent plasmapheresis had a positive outcome in terms of survival at 6 months. As the first study report of the ASFA apheresis registry, we demonstrate the value of using this registry to collect apheresis-related patient outcomes from multiple centers.",,"Wu, Y.;Pham, H.

Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases in patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. Objective: To assess the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson's disease. Methods: Nineteen patients with Wilson's disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. . Results: Eight patients (all women) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates one and five years after transplantation were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, liver symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one after OLT compared to time of initial diagnosis and compared to pre-OLT status. OLT. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. Conclusion: Survival after OLT for Wilson's disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. In general, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, corroborating the arguments for expanding the indication for liver transplantation in patients with symptomatic neurological Wilson's disease with stable liver function.

1467,"Iron, zinc and copper in retinal physiology and disease","The essential trace metals iron, zinc, and copper play important roles in both the physiology and disease of the retina. They are involved in various functions of the retina, such as phototransduction, the visual cycle, and the neurotransmission process, being tightly bound to proteins and other molecules to regulate their structure and/or function, or as free, unbound metal ions. Elevated levels of ""free"" or loosely bound metal ions can exert toxic effects, and to maintain homeostatic levels to protect retinal cells from their toxicity, there are appropriate mechanisms such as metal transporters, chaperones, and the presence of certain ion molecules. storage that bind metals to form non-toxic products. The pathways for maintaining homeostatic levels of metals are closely interrelated, and various metabolic pathways directly and/or indirectly affect their concentrations, compartmentalization, and oxidation/reduction states. Deficiency or excess of these metals in the retina can result from systemic depletion and/or overload or from mutations in genes involved in the maintenance of metal homeostasis in the retina, and this is associated with retinal dysfunction and pathology. . Iron accumulation in the retina, a characteristic of aging, may be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Zinc deficiency is associated with poor dark adaptation. Zinc levels in the human retina and RPE decline with age in AMD. Copper deficiency is associated with optic neuropathy, but retinal function is preserved. Changes in iron and zinc homeostasis in AMD have led to speculation that iron chelation and/or zinc supplementation may help in its treatment. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Ugarte, M.;Osborne, N.

1468,Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissues, especially the liver and brain. The genetic defect affects the P-type ATPase gene (ATP7B). More than 500 mutations have been described that cause Wilson's disease. The most common mutation in Central Europe refers to H1069Q. Symptoms of Wilson's disease include liver or neurological conditions. The liver condition manifests as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Neurological conditions manifest more frequently after the age of 20 as motor disorders (tremor, speech and writing disorders), which can lead to severe extrapyramidal syndrome with rigidity, dysarthria, and muscle contractures. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory evaluations (neurological signs, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, elevated urine Cu volumes, Kayser-Fleischer ring). The diagnosis is confirmed by a high level of Cu in liver tissue or genetic testing. Untreated Wilson's disease results in the death of the patient. If treated properly, the survival rate approaches the survival rate of the common population. Treatment refers to removal of copper from the body using chelating agents excreted in the urine (penicillamine, trientine) or limitation of copper absorption in the intestine and reduction of copper toxicity (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). In the Czech Republic penicillamine or zinc is used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.

Early treatment can prevent irreversible tissue damage. Objective: We report on four families with an occurrence of WD in two consecutive generations to highlight the need to test children of affected parents. Results: In all families, one parent was known to be affected by WD. Children from two families were not screened for the disease until the appearance of liver disease in one and neurological symptoms in the other. In two other families, detection of children as soon as the diagnosis was made in the affected parent allowed timely rescue of advanced liver disease in one, while two affected children were asymptomatic. In three children, the diagnosis required direct sequencing of the ATP7B gene. Two new disease-causing mutations are reported. Conclusion: Patients with WD should be offered genetic counseling when considering pregnancy and offspring should always be screened for the disease. Diagnostic difficulties based on copper abnormalities in asymptomatic children who are obligate carriers of the Wilson gene and the usefulness of molecular diagnosis are discussed.

This article reviews new knowledge on this topic and places it in the context of established procedures. It focuses on Huntington's disease, as this is the disorder for which the most management publications have been published in recent years. Management begins with proper diagnosis and differential diagnosis, with the goal of finding disorders with chorea amenable to causal treatment. The place of genetic testing and the importance of genetic counseling are emphasized, as well as the importance of accurate observation over the course of the disorder to tailor appropriate therapies. Pharmacological treatment is based on little evidence but largely on the experience of centers dedicated to the care of patients with Huntington's disease. It focuses primarily on the motor and psychiatric aspects of the phenotype. Nonpharmacologic treatment is important and is best offered in a multidisciplinary care setting.

1473,"Reuse as a strategy for the development of orphan drugs, evidence of European approvals","Introduction: Increasing awareness of the value of drug reuse has led to a number of initiatives to make discarded drug candidates available for screening. Reuse has been suggested to have considerable use in drug identification for the treatment of rare diseases. The 78 orphan drugs approved in Europe provide a useful set to analyze the evidence for reuse. Areas covered: Approved orphan drugs in Europe were classified as reused, as drugs developed specifically for orphan indications, or as drugs that had been classified as orphan drugs after their usefulness had been established. Medicines were also classified as novel medical entities, biologics, and natural products. The majority (60%) of the approvals were from novel medical entities, including 17 of the 19 approved biologics. Natural products provided 10 of the approved drugs, while 30 (38%) of the approvals were repurposed drugs from other indications. Expert Opinion: Identifying drugs for the treatment of rare diseases requires cost-effective discovery approaches. As disease prevalence or incidence declines, the need for lower-cost approaches becomes more important. The systematic use of reuse provides better opportunities to achieve these goals and can facilitate the subsequent development of the resulting drugs.

1474,Liver diseases in pregnancy: Diseases not exclusive to pregnancy,"Pregnancy is a special clinical state with several normal physiological changes that influence the organs of the body, including the liver. Liver disease can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both pregnant women and their babies. Few challenges arise in arriving at an accurate diagnosis in light of such physiological changes. Laboratory test results must be interpreted with care and it is prudent to know what normal changes to expect to avoid clinical misjudgment. Other challenges involve treatment methods and their safety for both mother and baby. This review summarizes liver diseases that are not unique to pregnancy. We focus on viral hepatitis and its mode of transmission, diagnosis, effect on pregnancy, the mother, the infant, treatment, and lactation. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson's disease, Budd Chiari, and portal vein thrombosis in pregnancy are also discussed. Pregnancy is rare in patients with cirrhosis due to metabolic and hormonal changes associated with cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding can occur in up to 38% of cirrhotic pregnant women. The management of portal hypertension during pregnancy is discussed. Pregnancy increases the pathogenicity leading to an increased rate of gallstones. We discuss some of the interventions for gallstones in pregnancy if symptoms arise. Finally, we provide an overview of some of the options in the management of hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma during pregnancy. Â© 2013 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

1475,Wilson's disease update,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of chronic copper toxicosis characterized by excessive deposition of copper in the body, primarily in the liver and brain. It is a progressive and fatal disease if left untreated. Excessive accumulation of copper results from the inability of the liver to excrete copper into the bile. Copper is an essential trace metal and plays a crucial role in many metabolic processes. Almost all of the copper in the body is bound to protein. In WD, the slow but relentless accumulation of copper overwhelms copper chaperones (copper-binding proteins), leading to high levels of free copper and copper-induced tissue injury. The liver is the central organ for copper metabolism, and copper initially accumulates in the liver, but is shed to other tissues over time. WD has protean clinical manifestations attributable mainly to hepatic, cerebral and musculoskeletal deterioration. The diagnosis of WD is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical features and laboratory tests. The identification of several high-frequency mutations identified in different population studies around the world has revived interest in the development of DNA chips for rapid genetic diagnosis of WD. All symptomatic and presymptomatic patients require lifelong copper removal with careful clinical follow-up. Copper ensures that presymptomatic people remain symptom free. With judicious decoppering, even severely neurologically impaired patients eventually improve and can return to normal life and resume school or work on par with their peers. Treatment regimens and patient follow-up using the WD-specific Global Assessment Scale for WD (GAS for WD) are discussed.

1476,Stagnant loop syndrome: a rare cause of severe malabsorption,"Background: Intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a consequence of post-surgical anatomical abnormalities, as well as other diseases of the small intestine, can cause malabsorption. Clinical Case: A female patient had several abdominal operations due to recurrent intestinal obstructions. Initially, he presented with severe megaloblastic anemia. Subsequently, she suffered weight loss, diarrhea, edema, recurrent anemia (despite vitamin B12 replacement), and severe protein, lipid, iron, and vitamin malabsorption. Vague information about surgeries performed, difficult-to-interpret bowel anatomy, and unusual cholestasis made it difficult to reach a diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth due to stagnant loop syndrome. Antibiotic treatment only temporarily improved the patient's condition. After reestablishing intestinal continuity and after resection of an enteroenteric fistula as well as an intestinal conglomerate, the patient did not present symptoms again. Conclusion: This patient's history indicates that the diagnosis of a stagnant loop syndrome can be difficult. The primary goal with regard to surgically created small intestinal bacterial overgrowth should be correction of the underlying small intestinal abnormality, whenever possible. Â© 2013 S.

We recently showed that TETA is metabolized in vitro by the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine-N<sup>1</sup>-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) and by thalisine acetyltransferase (SSAT2) to its monoacetylated derivative (MAT). TETA acetylation is increased in SSAT1-overexpressing mice compared to wild-type mice. However, SSAT1-deficient mice metabolize TETA at the same rate as wild-type mice, indicating the existence of another N-acetylase responsible for its metabolism in mice. Here, we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SSAT2 in HEPG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes from SSAT1-deficient or wild-type mice reduced metabolism of TETA to MAT. In contrast, 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadecane (SpmTrien), a charge-deficient analog of spermine, was an extremely poor substrate of recombinant human SSAT2 and was metabolized by SSAT1 in HEPG2 cells and in cells. wild-type primaries. hepatocytes Thus, despite the similar structures of TETA and SpmTrien, SSAT2 is the main acetylator of TETA, whereas SpmTrien is mainly acetylated by SSAT1.

Urinary copper excretion values are well established in the diagnostic protocol for Wilson's disease, whereas they have not been evaluated in dogs. The objectives of this study were to characterize basal and D-penicillamine-induced urinary excretion of copper, zinc, and iron in dogs in relation to hepatic copper concentration. Crosses of Beagles, Beagle-Bedlington terriers homozygous for the COMMD1 gene mutation causing copper toxicosis, and Labrador retrievers with normal or increased liver copper concentrations were investigated. Hepatic copper phenotype was determined by histological evaluation of liver biopsies and measurement of liver copper concentration by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Urinary excretion of copper, iron, and zinc was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry under basal conditions and after oral administration of a single dose (20 mg/kg body weight) of the chelator D-penicillamine. There was a rapid increase in urinary excretion of copper and zinc, but not iron, after administration of D-penicillamine. This increase was not different between dogs with high or normal liver copper concentrations. D-penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion and copper/creatinine ratio did not correlate with hepatic copper concentrations in the dogs studied, although baseline urinary copper/zinc ratios did correlate with hepatic copper concentrations in dogs studied.

The clinical presentation can be quite variable and they may present with only neurological features without hepatic symptoms. These neurological manifestations usually follow a subacute or chronic course. Acute-onset anarthria as the predominant and precursor presenting feature has rarely been reported in the literature. We present the case of a 12-year-old girl who presented acute onset anarthria and dystonia of 1 month duration. On further evaluation, a diagnosis of WD was made. The patient showed partial improvement after she was started on copper chelating agents and anticholinergics.",,"Verma, R.;Bhandari, A.;Tiwari, N.;Chaudhari, T.

1487,Spasmodic muscle cramps and weakness as presenting symptoms in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that has enormous variability in its presentation. The phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to late diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy who presented with spasmodic and increasingly intense muscle cramps in the lower extremities for 3 months. Physical examination revealed calf tenderness and dark flat lesions on the ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase 114 IU/L ( 16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Comprehensive evaluation of his myopathy, including MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/ dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), reticulocyte percentage 4.5% (0.5%-2.5 %), a negative direct Coombs antibody test, ceruloplasmin 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL) and 24-h urine basin 393 jar/24 h (15-60 jar/24 h). Liver biopsy showed advanced patchy fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 ug/g (10-35 ug/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic shortening of T1 within the bilateral basal ganglia. Triene therapy was started for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have resolved and remain normal at 21-month follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is rare and is usually defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness. In patients with unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms and liver abnormalities, a diagnosis of WD should be considered and appropriate evaluation initiated.

1492,Novel metal bioimaging techniques by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the diagnosis of fibrotic and cirrhotic liver disorders,"Background and objectives: Inherited disorders associated with metal overload or unwanted toxic accumulation of heavy metals can lead to morbidity and mortality. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease, for example, may develop severe liver pathology including fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. While relevant disease genes are identified and genetic testing applied, liver biopsy in combination with metal detection techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is still applied for accurate metal diagnosis. Vice versa, several metals are required in trace amounts to carry out vital functions and their deficiency due to rapid growth, pregnancy, excessive blood loss, and insufficient nutritional or digestive absorption results in organ and systemic deficiencies. Established in situ techniques, such as EDX-ray spectroscopy, are not sensitive enough to analyze trace metal distribution, and quantification of metal images is difficult. Methods: In this study, we developed a quantitative biometallic imaging technique of human liver tissue using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to compare the distribution of selected metals in cryo-sections from healthy subjects and fibrotic. cirrhotic livers. Results: Most metals are homogeneously distributed within normal tissue, while they are redirected within fibrotic livers, resulting in significant metal deposits. Furthermore, total iron and copper concentrations in the diseased liver were found to be 3-5 times higher than in normal liver samples. Conclusions: Biometal imaging via LA-ICP-MS is an innovative and sensitive diagnostic tool that will impact clinical practice in the identification and evaluation of liver metal disorders and to detect subtle metal variations during fibrogenesis. ongoing hepatic Â© 2013 MM et al.",,"M-M, P.;Weiskirchen, R.;Gassler, N.;Bosserhoff, A.

1494,ATP7B analysis of a family of Wilson's diseases. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease is a genetic copper toxicosis due to deficiency of the hepatic copper transporter ATP7B. The primary injury is copper-induced liver injury that progresses to cirrhosis and may be complicated by extrahepatic injury. Compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B were identified from a 16-year-old male patient with neurological Wilson's disease. A family study revealed different mutations in the parents, parental compound heterozygous mutations in the 12-year-old sister, and a maternal mutation in the 14-year-old sister. Consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of this disease, family members with compound heterozygous mutations are affected, but those with a heterozygous mutation are not affected by copper toxicosis. Both the proband and an asymptomatic sister with the disease trait were effectively treated with penicillamine and vitamin B<inf>6</inf>.

We present the case of a 16-year-old boy who presented a history of multiple pathological fractures, severe joint deformities, liver dysfunction, cognitive impairment and limb dystonia. On examination, the patient had pinched facies, pallor, and total leukonychia. Bilateral Kayser Fleischer (KF) ring was present. Musculoskeletal examination revealed pectus carinatum, bilateral genu valgus, and pistol-butt deformity of the left elbow joint. There was splenomegaly and moderate ascites. Neurological examination revealed mild rigidity and intermittent episodes of dystonic posturing of all four limbs. On this basis, a diagnosis of WD with dystonia with liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension with renal tubular acidosis with renal rickets was considered likely.

1496,Copper phenotype in Alzheimer's disease: dissecting the pathway,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the basis for the onset and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, none of these seem to clarify the complexity of the pathogenesis. In fact, diverse and independent pathogenic pathways can be interrupted at the same time, each contributing to the etiology of the disease. In recent years, researchers have begun to study biometals in greater depth. Several studies have shown that metal dyshomeostasis can improve the onset and progression of AD. Specifically, different authors have hypothesized that alterations in metal metabolism are associated with an increase in metal-related oxidative stress and with the formation and precipitation of beta-amyloid oligomers. Studies conducted in vivo, in vitro, in living patients, and in silico have shown that local and systemic defects in copper metabolism are hallmarks of AD. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the disease may alter copper pathways. More specifically, a copper phenotype for AD can be proposed, based on defects found in genes involved in copper metabolism. In this review, we describe copper dyshomeostasis in AD patients and attempt to explain the basis of the copper phenotype in AD. By dissecting copper pathways, we highlight mechanisms that may underlie the disease. We also discuss several associated translation results. Copyright Â© 2013 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

1498,Neurochemical and behavioral characteristics of toxic milk mice: an animal model of Wilson's disease.,"Toxic milk mice have an inherited defect of copper metabolism. The liver phenotype of toxic milk mice is similar to clinical findings in humans suffering from Wilson's disease (WND). In the present study, the neurotransmitter system and locomotor performance in toxic milk mice were examined to verify the feasibility of this animal model to study the neuropathology of WND. Mice of 2 and 12 months of age were used in the experiment. Mice were tested according to rotarod and footprint protocols. Monoamine content in brain structures was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. To detect neuronal loss, the expression of specific enzymes of dopaminergic [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)], noradrenergic (dopamine beta-hydroxylase) and serotonergic [tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)] neurons was analyzed by Western blot. 12-month-old toxic milk mice demonstrated poor locomotor performance on behavioral tests. Motor deficits were accompanied by increased copper and serotonin content in different brain regions and a slight decrease in dopamine concentration in the striatum. The expression of TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and TPH in the various brain structures did not differ between toxic milk mice and control animals. Despite differences in brain pathology between humans and rodents, further exploration of neuronal injury in toxic milk mice is warranted to further the understanding of neuropathology in WND.

1499,Seguimiento de la therapy en la enfermedad de Wilson mediante la prueba de radiocobre oral. [Germanio],"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper transport that leads to inhibition of biliary copper excretion. Metal overloads mainly in the liver and basal ganglia lead to hepatic clinical symptoms but also extrapyramidal motor and psychiatric symptoms. Depending on the stage of the disease, therapy with chelating drugs and zinc is possible, but must be given for life without longer interruptions. With early diagnosis and subsequent treatment, the prognosis for Wilson's disease is excellent, and the need for a liver transplant can usually be avoided. Treatment monitoring is essential because chelating penicillamine therapy is complicated by side effects, triene is not always available, and it is reported not to respond to zinc therapy. Method: For the evaluation of enteral copper reabsorption inhibition in our study, an oral radiocopper test was performed in 58 patients with Wilson's disease. Patients were administered 10 MBq <sup>64</sup>Cu and serum radioactivity was measured at 1 hour and/or, respectively, 3 hours after intake. In total, 91 tests were evaluated. Results: No inhibition of copper reabsorption was found in 1 patient under penicillamine therapy. Partial inhibition of enteral resorption could be demonstrated for triene in 6 patients. 48 tests showed sufficient inhibition with zinc therapy. In 36 tests of patients taking zinc, the inhibition was shown to be insufficient. In 6 of them it could be improved by increasing the dose. Triene has also been shown to inhibit copper reabsorption by this test. No inhibition is observed with penicillamine. Conclusion: The high prevalence of insufficient effectiveness of zinc therapy requires continuous monitoring. The radiocopper test allows estimating the influence of zinc on copper reabsorption in Wilson's disease. Further studies are needed to assess the usefulness of this test.

1501,Long-term nutritional evaluation in children with Wilson's disease. [Chinese],"Objective: To investigate the long-term nutritional status of children with Wilson's disease treated by different methods. Methods: Fifteen children with Wilson's disease were followed up for anthropometric measurements (height and body weight), detection of biochemical blood parameters (blood routine, liver function, blood calcium and phosphorus), and determination of bone density. The children were divided into a penicillamine group and a penicillamine + zinc sulfate group according to therapies, and comparisons were made between the two groups. Results: Of the 15 children, 1 presented growth retardation and the other mild malnutrition. There were no significant differences in weight-for-age percentile and Z-score (WAZ), height-for-age percentile and Z-score (HAZ), and body mass index (BMI) percentile and Z-score ( BMIZ) between two groups (P >0.05). There were 3 children with mild anemia in the penicillamine group and 1 child with mild anemia in the penicillamine + zinc sulfate group. Alkaline phosphatase values in children in the penicillamine group were higher than normal except in two children. Blood calcium was elevated in 1 child in the penicillamine group. Bone density Z-scores of the mid-tibia and distal radius were -3 and -3.5, respectively, in 1 child in the penicillamine group, which were lower than normal values. There were no significant differences in hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and bone density ratio of the middle tibia to that of the distal radius between two groups (P> 0.05). Conclusion: Children with Wilson's disease have a normal nutritional status after long-term copper shift and a low-copper diet.

1505,Therapy for systemic metabolic disorders based on the detection of basic corneal landmarks in childhood. [German],"Many systemic lysosomal storage disorders show basic corneal opacities as early as childhood. The lysosome is a cell organelle, produced by the Golgis apparatus, which is surrounded by a membrane and contains hydrolytic enzymes that break down food molecules, especially proteins and other complex molecules. Ophthalmologists' accurate diagnosis of corneal opacity at slit lamp can reveal the correct interpretation of the specific lysosomal storage disorder. It is very important to diagnose these types of diseases as soon as possible because today the development of systemic enzyme therapies has expanded the therapeutic arsenal for the current standard of care. The following corneal landmarks of systemic storage diseases and modern systemic therapy are presented: cornea verticillata in Fabrys disease, periodic infusion of alpha-galactosidase a; Kayser-Fleischers ring in Wilson's disease, zinc, trienetine, low-copper diet; multiple pinpoint crystals in cystinosis, cysteamine, Raptor RP 103 (DR cysteamine) that reduces cytotoxicity in the form of continuous lysosome cystine dissolution, kidney transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant; peripheral ring, but not true lipid arch, and moderate stromal turbidity in LCAT deficiency, injection of recombinant enzyme or encapsulated LCAT-secreting cells; diffuse stromal haze in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS).

A complex form of copper-associated hepatitis has recently been characterized in the Labrador retriever. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of d-penicillamine treatment for copper-associated hepatitis in this breed, to study the effects on hepatic concentrations of copper, iron, and zinc, and to evaluate parameters to predict the optimal duration of treatment. . Forty-three client-owned Labrador retrievers that were diagnosed with increased liver copper were treated with d-penicillamine and underwent at least one follow-up examination that included liver biopsy for histopathologic scoring of inflammatory lesions. Liver concentrations of copper, iron, and zinc were determined at baseline and follow-up biopsies by instrumental neutron activation assay. The influence of initial hepatic copper concentration, gender, age, formulation of d-penicillamine, and the occurrence of side effects on hepatic copper concentration after a certain period of treatment were investigated using a generalized mixed model. D-penicillamine was shown to be effective in reducing hepatic copper concentration and associated inflammatory lesions. Parameters derived from the model can be used to estimate the required duration of d-penicillamine treatment for Labrador retrievers with increased liver copper concentration. Continuous lifelong treatment with d-penicillamine is not recommended in this breed, as there may be a risk of hepatic copper and zinc deficiency.

1507,Roles of astrocytes in brain copper homeostasis.,"Copper is an essential element that is required for a variety of important cellular functions. Since not only copper deficiency but also copper excess can seriously affect cellular functions, the cellular metabolism of copper is strictly regulated. In the brain, astrocytes appear to play a critical role in copper metabolism. With their strategically important location between capillary endothelial cells and neuronal structures, they are ideally positioned to transport copper from the blood-brain barrier to brain parenchymal cells. Consequently, astrocytes have the ability to efficiently absorb, store, and export copper. Cultured astrocytes appear to be remarkably resistant to copper-induced toxicity. However, exposure to copper can cause profound alterations in the metabolism of these cells. This article will summarize the current understanding of astrocyte copper metabolism, describe copper-induced alterations in astrocyte glucose and glutathione metabolism, and address the potential role of astrocytes in brain copper metabolism. diseases that have been related to alterations in copper homeostasis in the brain.

However, symptoms can, on rare occasions, worsen even when WD is being treated. In this paper, we report a case related to unusual neurological deterioration during decupuration therapy for WD. Case presentation: A 28-year-old man was diagnosed with WD 13 years prior to his clinic visit; however, his drug compliance has been poor over the years. He was treated with trientine because in recent years he has presented tremors and dysarthria. However, he developed dysarthria and dystonia in his extremities, which were worse on the right side and had been worsening for several weeks despite good medication compliance. His symptoms fluctuated. It was initially misdiagnosed as dystonia; although it turned out to be a seizure due to cortical degeneration. These symptoms resolved completely with antiepileptic drugs. Furthermore, the cortical enhancement of the bifrontal degeneration has disappeared on MRI. Conclusion: This case showed unusual epileptic neurological impairment due to cortical degeneration during decupure therapy. Seizures in WD can easily be mistaken for part of dystonia. However, fluctuating symptoms suggest a seizure. Â© 2013 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Kim, Y. E.;Yun, J. Y.;Yang, H. J.;Kim, H. J.;Jeon, B.

1516,Wilson's disease: changes in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease,"Hepatic metabolism of methionine may play an essential role in the regulation of methylation status and liver injury in Wilson's disease (WD) through the inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) by copper (Cu) and the consequent accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We studied the transcription levels of selected genes related to liver injury, the levels of SAHH, SAH, DNA methyltransferase genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b), and global DNA methylation in the tx-j mouse (tx-j), an animal model of WD. Findings were compared with those of control C3H mice, and in response to penicillamine Cu chelation (PCA) and dietary supplementation of methyl donor betaine to modulate methylation and inflammatory status. Transcript levels of selected genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation were initially reduced in tx-j mice, further reduced in response to PCA, and showed little or no response to the betaine. The levels of hepatic Sahh transcripts and proteins were reduced in tx-j mice with a consequent increase in SAH levels. Hepatic Cu accumulation was associated with inflammation, as indicated by histopathology and elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha). Dnmt3b was downregulated in tx-j mice along with global DNA hypomethylation. PCA treatment of tx-j mice reduced Tnf-alpha and ALT levels, betaine treatment increased S-adenosylmethionine and Dnmt3b levels, and both treatments restored global DNA methylation levels. Conclusion: Reduced hepatic Sahh expression was associated with increased hepatic SAH levels in the tx-j model of WD, with consequent global DNA hypomethylation. Higher overall DNA methylation was achieved by reducing inflammation by Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We propose that increased SAH levels and inflammation affect the widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD.

Here we show that the zinc finger homeobox gene Zfhx1b (Sip1, Zeb2) is required in the MGE, directly downstream of Dlx1 and 2, to generate cortical interneurons expressing Cxcr7, MafB, and cMaf. In its absence, Nkx2-1 expression is not repressed, and cells that would normally become cortical interneurons appear to transform into a subtype of GABAergic striatal interneurons. These results show that Zfhx1b is required to generate cortical interneurons and suggest a mechanism for the epilepsy seen in humans with Zfhx1b mutations (Mowat-Wilson syndrome).

1521,Efficacy and safety of oral chelators in the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes liver and neurological symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large cohorts. We evaluated the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and the outcomes of patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 380 patients with Wilson's disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria, and an additional 25 patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurological and liver symptoms and for adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier estimate; data collected over a mean of 13.3 years after therapy began). RESULTS: Medication changes were common, resulting in the analysis of 471 chelating monotherapies (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients who received trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were more common among those receiving D-penicillamine than among those receiving trientine (p = 0.039). Forty-eight months after therapy, liver impairment was reported in only 4 of 333 patients initially treated with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were seen in more than 90% and neurological improvements in more than 55% of treatment-naÃ¯ve patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurological deterioration was seen less frequently in patients who received D-penicillamine first (6 of 295) than in those who received trientine first (4 of 38; P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson's disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable results, although D-penicillamine had a higher rate of adverse events. Few patients who received chelation therapy had neurological deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine. Â© 2013 AGA Institute.",,"Weiss, K.

Clinical Case: The patient was a 15-year-old boy who had been seen by several gastroenterologists for dysphagia and sialorrhea. He had been prescribed different medications. X-rays of the upper digestive tract and two endoscopies were performed. After all the clinical manifestations, low serum ceruloplasmin, low copper, high 24-hour copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleischer rings led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Treatment with D-penicillamine was started. The dysphagia was cured after a few days of treatment. Neurological symptoms improved after two weeks of treatment.

1526,Clinical approach in Wilson's disease using the Leipzig scoring system,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder of copper accumulation and toxicity. It is treatable, if diagnosed early. Recognition is clear in typical clinical presentations. Unexplained liver test abnormalities are a diagnostic challenge and require further testing. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Objective: to investigate the clinical characteristics and diagnostic possibilities in WD. Material and methods: 63 patients with WD (22 women, 41 men) were analyzed from June 2010 to March 2013, aged between 18 and 64 years at the end of the evaluation. For the diagnosis, the Leipzig scoring system was used. RESULTS: Patients were followed from 3 months to 21 years from diagnosis. Diagnosis was based on suspicion and clinical findings, copper metabolism parameters, ultrasonography, ophthalmologic examination, liver biopsy, MRI, DNA analysis, and evaluation of the Leipzig scoring system at final evaluation. Twenty-seven patients (42.9%) had liver disease alone, thirty-one (49.2%) - with hepatic and neurological presentation, three with neurological features without signs of liver injury, and two asymptomatic patients. Hepatic presentation was as follows: steatosis (4/63), hepatitis 38.1% (24/63), cirrhosis in 47.6% (30/53), acute liver failure after stopping treatment (2/63), hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic patient. The mean ceruloplasmin level was 0.137 g/l. 24-hour urine copper increased. The provocation test with D-penicillamine showed a mean value of urinary copper excretion of 17.69 mumol/24 h. According to the Leipzig diagnostic criteria, 55 (87.3%) patients had a score >=4 (max. 12). Eight patients had a score of 3, but the exclusion of another etiology and the clinical course of the disease confirmed the diagnosis. 23 (36.5%) patients had a Kayser-Fleischer ring and 4 - sunflower cataract. Liver biopsy was performed in 23 patients, with positive rhodamine staining in 9. DNA analysis was performed in 54 patients and mutations were found in 26 (48.1%). CONCLUSION: WD is a treatable hereditary disorder. It should be considered in liver diseases to prevent delayed recognition and progression of copper metabolic disorder. Our experience confirms that the Leipzig scoring system with a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters of copper metabolism, genetic tests and liver biopsy is useful for the diagnosis of WD in clinical practice.",,"Gancheva, D.;Atanassova, M.;Stamboliyska, M.;Kotzev, I.;Kaneva, M.",2013,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050640613502900,0,0,
1527,Scintigraphy with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-mebrofenin in the evaluation of liver function in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by decreased biliary excretion of copper and defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, leading to copper accumulation primarily in the liver, brain and the kidneys. Clinical manifestations related to the accumulation of copper in the liver include liver diseases ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to establish whether dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy (DHBS) with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-mebrofenin can be used to assess liver function in WD. Material and methods We studied 37 consecutive patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine (18 men and 19 women; mean age 39+/-4 years) with clinical evidence of liver disease. All patients underwent standard biochemical liver function tests, including ALT, AST, GGT, AP, TOT BIL, ALB, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and DHBS with mebrofenine <sup>99m< /up>Tc. Liver biopsies were performed in all WD patients. Liver tissue was examined for routine liver histology (fibrosis grading and staging) and liver copper content. DHBS acquisitions (30 s/frame for 60 min) were obtained after an iv injection of 110 MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc mebrofenine. Time-activity curves of the regions of interest located on the liver parenchyma (H) and the main intrahepatic bile ducts (B) were recorded. The times required to reach 50% of peak liver activity (50% HTmax), maximum liver activity (HTmax) and the time to reach 50% decrease in HTmax (HT<inf>1/2</inf> ) were calculated. In addition, times to peak biliary peak counts (BTmax) and to half peak activity (BT1/2) were calculated. The quantitative results of the scintigraphy were compared with the biochemical parameters and liver histopathology. Results All patients showed low levels of serum ceruloplasmin and copper, respectively (3.05+/-0.2mg/dl and 57+/-18mug/dl) and high urinary excretion of copper in 24h (201+/-42mug/dl). 24 hours). Based on Metavir fibrosis staging, 16 patients (43%) were classified as F1, 7 as F2 (19%), 8 as F3 (22%), and the remaining 6 as F4 (16%). Analysis of quantitative DHBS data showed slow hepatic uptake (>HTmax) and hepatobiliary excretion (>HT<inf>1/2</inf>) in almost all patients. A positive correlation was observed between the histological findings and the values of 50% HTmax (p= 0.004), HTmax (p=0.001), HT<inf>1/2</inf> (p=0.006) and BTmax (p= 0.02). In addition, in the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant correlation was found between 50% of HTmax, HTmax, HT<inf>1/2</inf>, BTmax and high degree of fibrosis (F4) versus another degree of fibrosis. With the exception of bilirubin (p<0.01), no correlation was found between biochemical liver function tests and DHBS parameters. Conclusions This study demonstrated the clinical utility of DHBS as a non-invasive diagnostic modality to assess the degree of liver fibrosis, making it possible to reduce the number of liver biopsies in the long-term follow-up of patients with WD.",,"Serra, A.;Sini, M.;Loi, G.

Objective: The objective of this study was (1) to investigate the effects of copper lactate injected intraperitoneally (0.15 mg Cu/100 g body weight) daily for 90 days on the levels of copper and zinc in the tissues of the liver and brain, biochemical parameters, and neurobehavioral functions of male Wistar rats, and (2) therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) administered orally for 90 days in intoxicated rats. with copper. Results: Copper-intoxicated animals showed a significant decrease in serum acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory along with a significant increase in copper content. in the liver (99.1%) and the hippocampus (73%). ; and interestingly, a 40.7% decrease and 77.1% increase in zinc content in liver and hippocampus, respectively, compared to control rats. Massive depositions of grade 4 copper and grade 1 copper-associated protein in hepatocytes from copper-intoxicated rats were corroborated by rhodanine and orcein staining, respectively. Copper-intoxicated rats demonstrated swelling and increased numbers of copper-deposited astrocytes in the choroid plexus. Degenerated neurons with pyknotic nuclei were also observed in brain sections of Cu-intoxicated rats. D-penicillamine NPs of medium size (275 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (35%) were synthesized. HPLC studies demonstrated a higher concentration of D-penicillamine by NP therapy compared to conventional D-penicillamine therapy in liver and brain tissues. NP-based therapy resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain copper content with improvement in neurological functions. Conclusion: The study shows the first in vivo evidence that D-penicillamine-encapsulated NPs can reverse deficiencies caused by chronic copper intoxication to a significant degree in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.

1530,Utility of zinc acetate treatment in 15 patients with childhood-onset Wilson's disease: a single center experience.,"Treatment of Wilson's disease is based on the use of copper chelators to promote excretion of copper from the body or the use of zinc to reduce copper absorption in the ileum. Here we report the utility of zinc acetate therapy for Wilson's disease in children. Fifteen patients, including 6 men and 9 women, were treated with zinc acetate. Before treatment, 6 patients were given nothing, 5 were treated with penicillamine and 4 with trientine. Median liver function levels measured at 0 months, 6 months, and 1 year were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase 48, 35, and 33 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase 71, 25 and 46 IU/l; mu-glutamyl transpeptidase 49, 46 and 55 IU/l. The mean value of localized urinary copper was 1112 Âµg/l (0.15 Âµg/mg/creatinine) with the use of a chelator and 141 Âµg/l (0.10 Âµg/mg/creatinine) without the use of a chelator. chelating Three patients experienced nausea and one experienced discomfort in the oral cavity.

1531,The promise of tetrathiomolybdate copper-reducing therapy in the cure of previously incurable advanced cancer and the treatment of inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) complexes copper with proteins in a strong tripartite complex. This complex with dietary protein is excreted in the feces, causing a negative copper balance. In the blood, this complex, TM, free copper and albumin, makes free copper unavailable and toxic. TM, developed for Wilson's disease, is very effective for the neurological presentation, for which no other drug is optimal. Reducing copper to intermediate levels with TM, levels high enough to avoid clinical deficiency, inhibits many cytokines, such as those that promote fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. TM is effective in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis, inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TM is effective in mouse models of inflammatory disease involving the liver and heart, and in four mouse models of immunomodulated disease. In humans, TM met both primary endpoints in a one-year randomized controlled trial in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune attack on the bile ducts. TM shows great promise in the areas of fibrosis, inflammation, and autoimmunity diseases. As long as steroids are helpful, TM will be better and safer. Most excitingly, recent developments show that MT can cure previously incurable advanced metastatic cancer. Tumor growth requires angiogenesis (Folkman). Many angiogenic promoters are copper-dependent, particularly those active at the level of micrometastatic cancer. LEADING CUE: TM COMPLETELY INHIBITED CANCER GROWTH IN THE HER/2neu GENETIC MOUSE BREAST CANCER MODEL. Microclusters of cancer cells, which were still there after a year of MT therapy, were unable to grow due to a lack of angiogenesis, while all controls had large cancers. Human trials ignored this clue and tested MT only against advanced cancers. These can recruit many promoters, many not dependent on copper, and only modest effects in these trials generated little interest. Now two US groups are curing metastatic cancer with MT by going back on the mouse trail. One group requires conventional excision with no evidence of disease (NED), although the disease is considered incurable due to micrometastases. After three years of TM, the cancer is cured, with 10 different advanced metastatic cancers, hitherto incurable. The second group uses MT from the start, and conventional therapy plus certain therapies targeting the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer, curing many patients with different metastatic cancers. We have started a randomized controlled trial of TM in micrometastatic osteosarcoma in dogs. It appears that TM can cure many previously hopeless cancer cases.",,"Brewer, G. J.",2013,November,,0,0,
1532,Zinc in human health: its discovery 50 years ago and its current impact,"The essentiality of zinc in humans was established in 1963. During the last 50 years, tremendous advances have been observed in the clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans. The main contributing factor to zinc deficiency is the high protein consumption of phytate-containing cereals in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion people may be zinc deficient. Conditional zinc deficiency has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease and other chronic diseases. The main clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs did not live past the age of 25 and died from intercurrent infections. In 1963, we knew of only 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know of >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells is involved in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration and is highly effective to decrease the incidence. of infection in the elderly. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity, but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",,"Prasad, A. S.",2013,November,,0,0,

The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established and treatment with zinc acetate was started. An associated pancreatitis was diagnosed at presentation, based on elevated serum amylase and an ultrasonically enlarged pancreas. Subsequently, regular follow-up revealed no abdominal pain, with a repeatedly normal serum amylase level and a normal pancreas on ultrasound. Since abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom of Wilson's disease, this possibility should be considered in untreated patients. We conclude that pancreatitis may be associated with Wilson's disease, possibly due to copper deposition in the pancreas, and is likely to respond to copper chelation therapy.",,"Kumar, T. S.

1534,Cytopenia and myelopathy associated with hypocupremia: a national retrospective review,"Background: Copper is an essential trace mineral that is involved in several important enzymatic processes throughout the body. Recent individual case reports and small studies have shown that copper deficiency can cause reversible hematological changes and irreversible neurological damage. Introduction: We chose to conduct a national study, looking at all cases of copper deficiency in Scotland over a 5-year period using data from a national reference laboratory. Results: Of 16 identified patients, we determined that 86% had hematologic and neurologic features of copper deficiency, while 18% had hematologic features only at presentation. Twelve of sixteen patients had elevated serum zinc concentrations (>18 mum/L) due to zinc-containing dental fixatives (9 patients), oral zinc replacement therapy after proximal bowel resection (1 patient), Wilson treated with zinc (1 patient) and skin burns requiring topical zinc treatment (1 patient). 94% of patients had hematologic features as the initial manifestation of copper deficiency, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Patients who underwent subsequent bone marrow testing had appearances of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with excess blasts, unclassified marrow dysplasia, or probable myelodysplasia (MDS). 75% of patients had neurological symptoms or signs, including progressive gait difficulties and paresthesia, or gait difficulties without sensory signs. Clinical examination was consistent with spastic paraparesis (with or without sensory neuropathy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal T2 hyperintense foci in the subcortical white matter, and atrophy of the cerebrum and cerebellum was also seen on computed tomography (CT). Spinal cord MRI showed a signal change in the dorsal columns in either the cervical or thoracic cord. 93% of cytopenias responded to copper replacement and addressed the original cause of copper deficiency, but only 25% of patients improved their neurological function, while 33% deteriorated and 42% remained unchanged. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that copper deficiency is an underrecognized cause of various types of cytopenia, which are reversible but can progress to major neurological injury if left untreated. We illustrate the importance of early identification of these patients to prevent irreversible neurological injuries.",,"Gabreyes, A.;Abbasi, H.;Forbes, K.

Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported in the setting of WD and is not well characterized. Here we describe a WD patient with peripheral neuropathy. A 58-year-old male with WD treated with trientine was referred to our center for mild weakness of the distal extremities with hypoaesthesia. Clinical evaluation showed mild leg weakness with foot drop and hyporeflexia. A nerve conduction study was performed using standard techniques (Medtronic Keypoint v5.09). Distal motor latency, F-wave latency, motor nerve conduction velocity, and CMAP in the deep peroneal, posterior tibial, median, and ulnar nerves were evaluated; Sensory nerve conduction velocity and SBP were measured in the sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. No other cause of polyneuropathy was found. Electroneurographic findings suggested a mixed-type length-dependent asymmetric sensorimotor neuropathy. We confirm the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in WD. Consistent with the literature, our findings also showed both myelin and axonal damage.

Methods: A 29-year-old woman presented with painful contractures of the left hand, dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait disturbance. Symptoms had initially started 4 months earlier with eversion of the right hand and contracture for 2 weeks with spontaneous resolution. He denied exposure to toxins, substance abuse, or similar family history. Results: He presented normal mental status, dysarthria, hypophonia, dystonia, chorea and broad-based gait. Early Kayser-Fleisher rings were observed on ophthalmologic examination. The diagnosis was confirmed with low serum ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper. Liver function test was normal. Brain MRI showed bilateral T2 hyperintensities involving the putamen, thalamus, and brainstem with the characteristic ""double panda sign."" Conclusions: The ""double panda sign"" feature for Wilson has been described in few reports. It is formed by the ""giant panda face"" in the midbrain [1] and the ""miniature panda face"" in the pons [2] and is caused by preservation of normal signal intensity in the red nuclei and the side pars. reticulata of the substantia nigra, hypertinence in the tegmentum and hypointensity of the superior colliculus.

Combination therapy (administered at intervals to avoid interference) was switched to zinc therapy only after normalization of transaminases. Normal transaminases and negative copper balance at 12 months of therapy were considered successful therapy. Clinical and biochemical response time (AST and ALT <60 IU/L) was calculated. Thirty-three cases (median age 127.21+/- 42.27 months) were included. Liver transplantation (LT) was offered to 5 cases with fulminant liver failure. Of the rest, 28 cases with chronic liver disease (CLD): 4 of the 5 presented as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 3 of the 17 decompensated CLDs required LT. All 6 compensated CLD, 1 of 5 ACLF, and 14 of 17 decompensated CLD were successfully treated with medical therapy. Twenty-one (75%) of the 28 cases successfully treated with medical therapy. Twenty cases showed clinical response within 6 months and 1 case at 12 months. Fifteen cases showed biochemical response at 6 months and the remaining 6 cases at 12 months. Conclusions: 75% of cases improved with combined therapy with response within 6 months.",,"Alam, S.;Khanna, R.;Sood, V.",2013,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-013-9633-z,0,1,
1538,Prediction of poor outcomes with medical treatment at diagnosis in Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as chronic liver disease (CLD): is the new Wilson index useful?,"Twenty-eight cases of WD presenting as CLD were managed with D penylamine and zinc. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplant or death) at the time of diagnosis. Four of 5 presenting as acute chronic liver failure (ACLF), 3 of 17 as decompensated CLD had a poor outcome. All 6 compensated CLD, 1 of 5 ACLF, and 14 of 17 with decompensated CLD improved. On univariate analysis, bilirubin, AST, ALT, Child Pughs score, and New Wilson index score were significantly higher in those with poor outcomes. In the logistic regression analysis, the significant association with poor outcome was high ALT (adjusted OR 1.062, 95% CI 1.007-1.12, p= 0.015) and low albumin (adjusted OR 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.56). , p= 0.028). With a 20 IU increase in ALT, the odds ratio increased by 3.3 (95% CI 1.15 to 9.58), and a 1 g decrease in albumin increased the odds ratio by 0. 95 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.995). Conclusion: High ALT and low albumin are independently associated with poor outcome of medical treatment in WD presenting as CLD. Child Pugh and New Wilson index scores did not show a significant association with poor outcome.",,"Alam, S.;Khanna, R.;Sood, V.;Rawat, D.",2013,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-013-9633-z,0,0,
1539,Articular manifestations and bone changes in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background Wilsone's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder that leads to pathological accumulation of copper in various organs, especially the brain and liver. The most frequent clinical manifestations consist of the hepatic form and the neurological-psychiatric form. Joint problems are common and affect a high percentage of patients suffering from WD. Joint involvement in patients with WD has not been studied in detail to date. WD treatment is very effective. One approach involves treatment with penicillamine. Alternatively, zinc can be used. Treatment must be lifelong. On the other hand, the treatment of arthropathy is difficult and mostly not very successful. The objective was to determine the location and types of changes in the affected joints in a group of patients diagnosed with WD and to determine if there is any relationship between the type of treatment and the joint manifestation. Objectives To evaluate the changes in the clinical and imaging evaluation of patients with WD after a period of 5 years. Methods From the group of 41 patients diagnosed with WD, a group of 10 patients with arthropathy was selected. They were evaluated for anamnesis, clinical assessments, radiography and ultrasound of the affective joints, bone densitometry of the hip and lumbar spine. The complete evaluation was repeated after 5 years. Results The ages ranged from 19 to 61 years, the average age was 36 years. They were 8 women and 2 men. The knee was the most frequently involved joint. Other joints affected (in decreasing order of frequency) were the wrists, shoulders, metacarpophalangeal joints, ankles, and lumbosacral spine. The patients had involvement of 1-15 joints/patient. The physical finding consisted mainly of pain, pain on movement, stiffness, and crepitus in the affected joints. 5 patients had decreased range of motion in the abnormal joints and 2 had hypermobility. Over a 5-year period, 5 patients had arthritis (detected clinically and sonographically) lasting from 1 month to 2 years. Radiographic changes included joint space narrowing, osteophytes, cysts, soft tissue calcification, and bone fragmentation. 3 patients had osteoporosis and 3 osteopenia. After a 5-year period, there was an increase in the number of affected joints, radiographic changes, and a decrease in T-score at the lumbar spine in this group of patients. More radiographic changes can be seen in patients treated with penicialamine than with zinc. Conclusions Wilson's disease is related to morphological damage to the skeleton, premature osteoarthritis, arthritis and osteoporosis. Although all the patients were treated with penicillamine or zinc and the neurological-psychiatric and hepatic manifestations remained stable, there was progression of the arthropathy. More changes have patients with penicillamine. Further studies with large numbers of patients are needed.",,"Sleglova, O.;Marecek, Z.",2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-eular.2083,0,0,
1540,Analysis of the clinical characteristics of Wilson's disease in 181 cases,"Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics of Wilson's disease. Methods: 181 cases of Wilson's disease were retrospectively studied. Results: Male patients were significantly more than female patients. The number of patients from 8 to 29 years of age was significantly higher than that of other age periods. Hepatic and extrapyramidal symptoms were two main symptoms at onset. Liver function in 40-60% of patients had been impaired. More than 95% of patients had dysfunction on liver ultrasound, brain CT, and brain MRI. Penicillamine was generally effective. The main cause of death was liver failure. Conclusion: Wilson's disease often occurs in men and young people. Hepatic and extrapyramidal symptoms are the main clinical symptoms. Liver ultrasound and brain CT/MRI should be one of the auxiliary diagnostic devices. Liver function has been impaired before the onset of symptoms. Penicillamine was generally effective.",,"Shaoquan, Z.;Li, M.;Jing, L.",2013,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-013-9429-0,0,0,
1541,Wilson's disease (WD) in Malaysia: a single center experience,"Background/aims: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder with defective biliary excretion of copper leading to its accumulation in the liver and brain. We present the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of patients with WD in our center. Methods: All patients with WD (n = 35) referred to our center from 2000 to 2012 were retrospectively studied. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 16 years [range = 8-59] with 60% women. Five (14.3%) tested positive for a history of parental consanguinity. Thirty-one (88.6%) of the patients presented exclusively liver involvement and 4 (11.4%) had mixed neurological and liver involvement. Nine (25.7%) were fulminant WD, 14 (40%) chronic WD with hepatic decompensation, and 12 (34.3%) without hepatic decompensation. All patients had serum ceruloplasmin below 0.2 g/L [median=0.12 g/L, range=<0.06-0.24], 27 (77.1%) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 25 (83.3%) had urinary copper excretion above 1.6 umol/day [median = 6.34 umol/day, range = 1.71-65.07]. First-line treatments were penicillamine monotherapy (54.3%), penicillamine plus zinc (42.9%) and one (2.8%) did not receive any treatment because she died shortly after admission. Thirteen (38.2%) of the penicillamine patients developed complications, namely hematuria (n = 2), proteinuria (n = 1), hematologic (n = 1), IgA nephropathy (n = 1), hyperprolactinemia ( n = 1), myasthenia gravis (n = 1), breast gigantism (n = 1), mucositis (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), and rashes (n = 4). Thirteen patients changed medication to trientine (n = 6), zinc (n = 3), trientine plus zinc (n = 2), and penicillamine plus zinc (n = 2). One patient received a liver transplant due to poor response to penicillamine therapy. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months (0.06-132). At the end of follow-up, 37.1% died and the mortality rate in fulminant WD was 77.8%. Conclusions: WD in our population affects females more, diagnosed at an early age and mainly chronic WD with hepatic decompensation. All patients had low ceruloplasmin and a high proportion had Kayser-Fleischer rings. Penicillamine intolerance occurred in 38.2%. The mortality rate was 37.1%.",,"Shahar, H.;Tan, S. S.;Shamsul, A.

1542,Encapsulated Trientine Nanoparticles Can Chelate Liver and Brain Copper and Reverse Neurological Impairments Caused by Chronic Copper Intoxication,"Animal models of Wilson's disease rarely show neurological abnormalities, and the accumulation of copper in the brain precludes the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease. The aim of this study was to (1) investigate the effects of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate (0.15 mg Cu/100 g BW) daily for 90 days on copper and zinc levels in liver and brain tissues and neurobehavioral functions of male Wistar rats, and (2) The therapeutic efficacy of trientine dihydrochloride-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles (NP) administered orally for 90 days in copper-intoxicated rats. Animals administered copper exhibited significantly decreased serum AChE activity, increased hepatic metallothionein I gene expression, impaired neuromuscular coordination, and spatial memory compared to control rats. Copper-intoxicated rats showed a significant increase in copper content in liver, hippocampus, and kidney tissues (99.1, 73, and 74.9% increase, respectively), a 40.7% reduction in copper content of liver zinc and, interestingly, a 77.1% increase in hippocampal zinc content with a concomitant increase in serum and urine copper and zinc levels compared to control rats. Massive deposition of grade 4 copper and grade 1 copper-associated protein in hepatocytes from copper-intoxicated rats was corroborated by rhodanine and orcein staining, respectively. Copper-intoxicated rats demonstrated swelling and increased numbers of astrocytes, copper deposition in the choroid plexus, and neuronal degeneration. Trientine NPs of medium size (355 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (28%) were synthesized. Nanoparticle-based therapy resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain copper content. HPLC studies demonstrated a higher concentration of trientine by NP therapy compared to conventional trientine therapy in liver and brain tissues. In conclusion, the present study provides the first in vivo evidence that trientine-encapsulated NPs can reverse deficiencies caused by chronic copper intoxication to a significant degree in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1543,Long-term follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease diagnosed in childhood: Reasons for treatment changes,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper mainly in the liver. The treatment is based on chelators and/or zinc. The efficacy of zinc monotherapy has been questioned by Weiss et al. [one]. Objective: to evaluate the reasons for treatment changes in patients with WD diagnosed in childhood. Methods: 44 patients with WD referred to our Pediatric Service (1984-2012) were analyzed. 42 had hepatic presentation and 2 were recruited for family screening. For each patient, the type of treatment performed was classified as: d-penicillamine; zinc salts; combination of d-penicillamine and zinc. Reasons for treatment changes were: treatment failure, adverse events, patient demand (not related to adverse events), and maintenance regimen. We excluded from our analysis the suspension of treatment linked to the change to maintenance therapy. We calculated the duration of each treatment block until the change of medication or until the end of the follow-up period. We analyzed events of treatment changes using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: 44 (31 males, median age at diagnosis = 5.9 years, range = 1-16.9) of the 48 patients evaluated were selected for treatment analysis. Changes in medical treatment were common events resulting in a total of 79 treatment blocks (32 penicillamine therapy, 35 zinc therapy, and 12 combination therapy). Of these, 76 (31 on penicillamine treatment, 34 on zinc treatment, and 11 on combined treatment) were eligible for analysis. Medication change due to treatment failure or adverse events, not related to transition to maintenance therapy. 36%). Discontinuation due to adverse events was more common in patients receiving penicillamine with 6 (5 penicillamine, 1 combination) of 42 block treatments discontinued for this reason. Medication change due to treatment failure was observed in 16 blocks of 76 (21%): 8 of 31 penicillamine treatments (26%), 4 of 34 zinc blocks (12%), and 4 of 11 combined blocks ( 36%). This reached statistical significance when comparing zinc versus combination therapy, but not zinc with penicillamine. Among treatment failure blocks, nonadherence to therapy was reported in 1 of 8 penylamine treatments (12%), 2 of 4 zinc treatments (12%), and 4 of 4 combination treatments (100%). Conclusion: Interruption of therapy due to treatment failure and/or adverse events was more common with penicillamine than with zinc. Unlike Weiss's data (1), our study confirmed that zinc monotherapy is effective in controlling liver disease in patients with WD, diagnosed and treated since childhood.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Tufano, M.;De Micco, I.;Nunziata, F.;Leone, F.;Iorio, R.",2013,2022-09-30 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2013.08.161,0,1,
1544,Levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction (small fibers) in patients with Wilson's disease (WD),"Background: Autonomic dysfunction has rarely been described in patients with WD. Objective: To describe a series of patients with WD, levodoparesponsive parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction. Methods: After IRB approval, we evaluated 4 patients with WD and parkinsonism for the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction and performed the water-induced skin wrinkle test - SWT (Teoh, JNNP 2008;79:835). Results: Patient 1: A 37-year-old woman who presented cirrhosis at the age of 33 was diagnosed with WD and treated with ZnSO4, penicillamine and pyridoxine/B-complex vitamins. From the age of 35 she developed parkinsonism sensitive to pramipexole and levodopa, with burning and numbness in arms and genital area and urinary incontinence. NCS/EMG was normal. Water-induced SWT revealed small fiber dysfunction (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 1). Patient 2: A 23-year-old male diagnosed with WD at the age of 14 and treated with penicillamine+pyridoxine. From the age of 21, he developed parkinsonism sensitive to levodopa, with tremor at rest, weight loss, dysphagia and dysphonia. NCS/EMG was normal but water-induced SWT was abnormal (mean wrinkle 0.25). Patient 3: A 34-year-old man presented with psychosis, behavioral dysfunction, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, and episodes of loss of consciousness. He was treated with penicillamine and B-complex vitamins. NCS/EMG and water-induced SWT were normal (mean wrinkles of 4). Patient 4: A 38-year-old woman presented with liver dysfunction, behavioral changes, and parkinsonism at 24 years of age. She was diagnosed with WD and treated with penicillamine and biperiden. Parkinsonism almost completely remitted with penicillamine. SWT was normal (mean wrinkle 3.6). Conclusions: A subset of WD patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism also have abnormalities in SWT (autonomic dysfunction).",,"Gondim, F. D. A. A.;Oliveira, I. S.;Araujo, D. F.;Melo, A.

1545,D-penicillamine versus zinc sulfate as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a hereditary treatable disorder of copper metabolism. However, there is no international consensus on first-line therapy. Objective: Our objective was to compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic WD who were started with d-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as the drug of choice. Patients and methods: 143 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with symptomatic WD between 2005 and 2009 were included. The decision on the first-line drug was made at the discretion of the physician. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neuropsychiatric and hepatic WD. Results: Neurological and enzymatic improvements were achieved with similar frequency. In patients with neuropsychiatric WD, the probability of remaining on first-line therapy was similar for APD and ZS (20% vs. 24% at final follow-up). In patients with hepatic WD, it was significantly higher for ZS (31% vs. 12%). After adjusting for type of WD, gender, age at diagnosis, and the presence of at least severe liver symptoms, patients treated with APD were more likely to experience worsening (OR 3.84, 95% CI: 1.15-3 .85) during the first 6 months of treatment APD patients were significantly more compliant (94% vs. 81%), but experienced more adverse effects (15% vs. 3%). Conclusions: DPA and ZS are effective in most patients with WD. Despite certain differences, none of them seem clearly superior. Therefore, ZS can be considered a reasonable alternative to DPA as first-line therapy.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Karlinski, M.;Czerska, M.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.467,0,1,
1546,Wilson's disease and psychiatric disorders: Is there comorbidity or indicator of relapse?,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a rare pathology that results from a change in the ATP7B gene on the long arm of chromosome 13. This implies a reduction in copper transport in bile and its accumulation in the body, especially in the brain. Objective: The objective of this study is to illustrate the importance of psychiatric disorders in WD. Clinical case: A 25-year-old woman with a personal history of Wilson's disease (WD) who presented with acute psychotic manifestations. In the psychiatric interview, a state of psychomotor agitation, aggressiveness and a concept of depressed mood with suicidal intentions is found. In addition, he has a bilateral extrapyramidal syndrome. Blood levels of copper and ceruloplasmin are collapsed. The patient confirmed that she had stopped her treatment with D-penicillamine for two months. Discussion: WD begins as liver, neurological or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of patients. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric, accounting for only 10%. The illness may include later isolated behavioral problems, a schizophrenic syndrome, or a manic-depressive syndrome. The main difficulty was establishing whether or not psychiatric disorders are included in the DT matrix. Indeed, neuropsychiatric comorbidity in the setting of WD is significant. Poor adherence to treatment, copper balance, and improvement after reintroduction of D-penicillamine confirm a psychiatric relapse of WD. Conclusion: In WD, psychiatric manifestations can precede, complicate somatic disorders or be independent. Early diagnosis is necessary to provide specific treatment.",,"Mrabet, S.;Ellouze, F.;Mrad, M. F.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.394,0,0,
1547,Increased frequency of seizures due to copper deficiency in Wilson's disease,"Background: Epileptic seizures have been reported in Wilson's disease (WD) in 6-7% of patients, mostly after chelation therapy. Pyridoxine deficiency due to penicillamine, direct copper toxicity, pathologic changes, metabolic encephalopathy, and, rarely, copper deficiency are the mechanisms attributed to seizures. Objective: To present a patient with WD and intractable seizures, undergoing chelation and antiepileptic treatment with a strict copper-restricted diet. Patients and methods: A 29-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency department due to recurrent seizures. She had been diagnosed with WD and epilepsy in another center previously treated with penicillamine, zinc acetate, and carbamazepine. Less frequent complex partial secondary generalized seizures had begun after taking penicillamine and responded well to carbamazepine initially. He complained of an increase in daily seizure frequency ranging from 5 to 10 in recent months. Results: Although effective serum carbamazepine level and additional levetiracetam therapy changed oral trientine and pyridoxine chelation therapy, daily seizure frequency was not reduced and low serum copper level [0.3 ug/dl (70 -140)] has been attributed to seizures. Zinc acetate and strict copper-restricted diet were discontinued. As serum copper levels increased during follow-up [16 ug/dl (70-140)], seizure frequency decreased. Conclusion: Epileptic seizures respond well to antiepileptic treatment in WD. In this case, additional antiepileptic and pyridoxine therapy did not reduce seizure frequency. The relationship between decreased seizure frequency and increased serum copper levels shows that copper deficiency can cause intractable seizures in patients taking chelating therapy on a strictly copper-restricted diet.",,"Kaleagasi, H.;Oksuz, N.;Ozal, S.;Yilmaz, A.;Dogu, O.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.209,0,0,

1549,Isosteric analogs of natural polyamines with altered carbon chain length and additional amino groups,"The cationic biogenic polyamines spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) interact with negatively charged components of cells and are essential for their growth and viability. Spm and Spd are positively charged at physiological pH (7.4) and the location of the charges defines their recognition. Altering the length of the carbon chain and adding additional amino group(s) to the polyamine backbone gives rise to isosteric analogs with a reduced degree of protonation. The total net charge of 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadecane (SpmTrien), which is the Spm isoster, is +3 at physiological pH [1], while 1,8-diamino-3,6 -diazaoctane, (Trien), which is the analog of Spd, is +2. Although these analogs have different localization and total net charge, they still have some of the properties of their parent polyamines. Trien, being an excellent chelator of Cu2+ ions, is used to treat Wilson's disease when the person is intolerant to penicillinamine and Trien was recently shown to improve left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with type 2 diabetes [2]. Trien is a mimetic of Spd: it penetrates cells poorly and cannot fulfill most of the cellular functions of Spd. However, Trien exhibits some substrate properties of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) reaction [3], but its physiological acetylating enzyme is thalisin N-acetyltransferase [4]. SpmTrien is a more successful mimetic of Spm: it efficiently penetrates into cells and can fulfill some of the cellular functions of Spm [3]. In cells and in vivo, SpmTrien is acetylated by SSAT1 and then oxidized by acetylpolyamine oxidase to Trien [3,5]. Therefore, SpmTrien can be considered a bioactive precursor to Trien.",,"Weisell, J.;Hyvonen, M.;Khomutov, A.;Alhonen, L.;Vepsalainen, J.;Keinanen, T.",2013,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12340,0,0,
1550,Different types of facial dystonias in a patient with Wilson's disease treated with botulinum toxin type A,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BoTN-A) in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) and multiple types of facial dystonias and retrocollis. Describe the different types of abnormal movements that this patient presents. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by impaired excretion of this metal, resulting in its accumulation in many organs, including the liver, brain, and cornea. Clinically, patients present with psychiatric, neurological, or hepatic symptoms. BoNT treatment is the first-choice approach for most focal dystonias, including those associated with WD. Methods: A 20-year-old girl presented with a 9-month history of abnormal behavior, mild symmetric parkinsonism, dysarthria, and short-lasting severe retrocollis and blepharospasm. Neurological examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings, smiling facial expression, sustained open-mouthed smile, dystonic dropped jaw, and mild symmetric parkinsonism. There were frequent and irregular crises of severe blepharospasm and retrocollis. Brain MRI showed bilateral basal ganglia T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the midbrain, thalamus, putamen, and white matter. Serum ceruloplasmin and urine copper studies confirmed the diagnosis of WD. Treatment with zinc and penicillamine D was established. Different types of facial dystonias and retrocollis were treated with BoTN-A with an adequate protocol. Results: BoTN-A improved facial and cervical dystonia by 80% with mild side effects (blurred vision). The improvement in quality of life was noticeable. Careful visual analysis showed different types of facial dystonias, including smiling facial expression with risus sardonicus, sustained open-mouthed smile, dystonic dropped jaw, and irregular and frequent attacks of severe blepharospasm and retrocollis. Conclusions: BoTN-A is a safe and effective treatment for the different types of facial dystonias and retrocollis associated with WD.

1551,Initial zinc therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease with acute liver failure and copper intoxication: a clinical observation,"Objective: To assess whether (1) initial zinc therapy works for liver failure in WD; (2) liver transplantation can be prevented by initial zinc therapy; (3) there is some correlation between normalized copper levels and clinical improvement. Background: Copper accumulation in the brain and liver has been assumed to be responsible for neurodegeneration and liver disease in WD. Thus, treatment has been aimed at promoting urinary copper excretion by chelators, while strong evidence since 1961 supports the idea of normalizing copper poisoning with zinc. Methods: In an observational study in a 10-year-old girl with WD presenting with acute liver failure, hemolytic anemia, and high urinary copper, liver function and copper were retrospectively monitored before and after initial zinc therapy. The patient received 125 mg/d of elemental zinc. Liver transplantation was also considered. Liver enzymes, bilirubin, and urine copper were monitored at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of zinc treatment. Results: The patient improved biochemically and clinically within 10 days of zinc therapy, consistent with a decrease in urinary copper of 86%. The revised WD prognostic index improved from 13 to 5, and the patient was removed from the transplant list. After 2, 4, 8 weeks of zinc therapy, AST, ALT, bilirubin, and urinary copper revealed consistent improvements of up to 62, 226, 82, 77%, respectively, at week 8. Results from the second 8-week period indicated an additional decrease of 25, 41, 48, 86, respectively, and 33% for serum free copper, compared to previous results. No side effects or clinical deterioration have been observed during the 16-week treatment period. Conclusions: The results suggest that zinc is a promising, fast-acting, safe and affordable option for the treatment of copper intoxication in WD with acute liver failure. It also supports the hypothesis of normalizing high serum free copper, which can save lives, as well as costly and risky liver transplantation, instead of stimulating excretion of accumulated copper.",,"Avan, A.;Kianifar, H.

1552,Evidence-based effective switch from traditional chelation therapy to zinc monotherapy in four patients with Wilson's disease and parkinsonism,"Objective: To compare clinical improvement in patients with Wilson's disease (1) following normalization of high urinary and serum free copper rather than excretion of copper accumulation and (2) with zinc therapy, with and without penicillamine. Background: For years, the treatment of Wilson's disease has aimed to stimulate the excretion of copper accumulated by chelating agents. However, the dilemma arises when patients paradoxically deteriorate with them. Zinc, on the other hand, is generally minimized by being restricted to maintenance or concomitant therapy. Chelators increase free copper levels in serum and urine, while zinc normalizes values by interrupting intestinal absorption of copper. Methods: In a retrospective observational study of four patients with Wilson's disease and parkinsonism initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared subjective and objective clinical improvement before and after switching to zinc monotherapy. Results: Three of the four patients who were impaired on penicillamine (0.5-1 gram per day) improved significantly to a normal biochemical and clinical state on zinc (150 milligrams per day). The fourth patient on penicillamine (250 milligrams per day) plus zinc (200 milligrams per day) improved in her lower extremities during the first month, while she improved markedly on zinc monotherapy in subsequent months. Conclusions: The results of the four patients suggest that zinc is a promising, safe and affordable treatment for patients with copper poisoning and neurological Wilson's disease. Furthermore, they support the rationale of normalizing elevated serum and urine copper values rather than stimulating excretion of accumulated copper that induces free copper intoxication.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.

1553,Current status of Wilson's disease: Does early treatment protect against nervous system deterioration?,"Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact on the nervous system of Wilson's disease (WD) in patients treated early (ET) with long-term disease. Background: Neurological disorders (ND) have been frequently described during the course of WD, especially when treatment is delayed. In recent years, most cases of WD have been diagnosed in childhood due to the appearance of hypertransaminasemia (HT), receiving early treatment and apparently not showing subsequent disease progression. Methods: A clinical, neurophysiological and neuroradiological evaluation has been carried out in patients with WD with a long duration of disease and treatment. Clinical neurological evaluation was performed using the neurological section of the ""global assessment scale"" (GAS) for WD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed to study central conduction time and cortical excitability with the paired-pulse technique exploring short-interval cortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation. Each patient underwent a brain MRI. Results: 27 patients (16 M, age range 13-47 years) with a mean disease duration of 16.5 years (range 7-28) were evaluated between 2011 and 2012. All patients started treatment shortly after the diagnosis and currently receiving pennicillamine. (6 patients) or zinc acetate (21 patients). TMS and brain MRI studies were normal in 23 subjects who were diagnosed with WD for childhood onset of HT and never reported ND. The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed in adolescence with onset DN, only 2 of them still present neurological signs (GAS 16-18) but all have alterations in brain MRI while TMS findings are normal. Conclusions: During the last decades, the natural history of WD seems to change, since the nervous system might not be affected when patients are diagnosed in childhood and receive early treatment (Ala A 2007). Our study confirms that patients with ET, not presenting DN at the beginning, do not show clinical neurological signs even after a long duration of the disease. The normality of TMS and brain MRI studies also suggests the absence of subclinical nervous system impairment.",,"Esposito, M.;Dubbioso, R.;Manganelli, F.;Ranucci, G.;Didato, F.;Matarazzo, M.;Iorio, R.;Santoro, L.",2013,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25605,0,1,
1554,Levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and small fiber dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: To describe a series of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) associated with parkinsonism sensitive to levodopa and autonomic dysfunction. Background: Patients with WD present or develop a wide variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms during the course of their illness. Few reports have described autonomic dysfunction in WD patients. Methods: Record review of 4 WD patients who were evaluated for neuromuscular dysfunction and underwent a water-induced skin wrinkling test (Teoh, JNNP 2008;79:835). This study was approved by the local institutional IRB. Results: Patient 1: A 37-year-old boy who presented cirrhosis at 33 years of age was diagnosed with WD and treated with ZnSO4, penicillamine and pyridoxine/B-complex vitamins. From the age of 35 he developed parkinsonism sensitive to pramipexole and levodopa, burning and numbness in arms and genital area and urinary incontinence. NCS/EMG was normal, but skin water-induced wrinkling test (SWT) revealed small fiber dysfunction (4-digit mean wrinkle of 1). Patient 2: A 23-year-old boy was diagnosed with WD at age 14 and has been treated with penicillamine and pyridoxine ever since. From the age of 21, he developed parkinsonism sensitive to levodopa, with tremor at rest, weight loss, dysphagia and dysphonia. NCS/EMG was normal but water-induced SWT was abnormal (4-digit wrinkle mean 0.25). Patient 3: A 34-year-old boy presented with psychosis and marked behavioral dysfunction followed by levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and episodes of loss of consciousness. He has a family history of WD and was treated with penicillamine and B-complex vitamins. NCS/EMG and water-induced SWT were normal (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 4). Patient 4: A 38-year-old boy presented with liver dysfunction, behavioral changes, and parkinsonism (resting tremor in the upper limbs and akinetic-rigid state) at 24 years of age and was diagnosed with WD. She was treated with penicillamine and biperiden. Parkinsonism almost completely remitted after treatment with penicillamine. Water-induced SWT was normal (mean 4-digit wrinkling of 3.6). Conclusions: A subgroup of WD patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism also have skin wrinkle test abnormalities (autonomic dysfunction).",,"Gondim, F. A.;Araujo, D. F.;Oliveira, I. S.;Melo, A.

1555,Alterations in cortical excitability and central motor conduction time in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: To determine changes in cortical excitability in patients with WD by measuring resting cortical motor threshold (RMT) and Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Background: Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, leads to generalized structural alterations of the central nervous system. However, little is known about the neuronal dysfunction in this disorder. Methods: The subjects of this study were 13 patients (10 men and 3 women) with WD diagnosed by the presence of Kayser-Fleischer and biochemical parameters. TMS was performed using a figure-eight coil attached to the Magstim 200 stimulator. Resting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) were recorded. The RMT was determined using standard techniques and the CMCT by the 'F' wave method. The comparison was made with data from 26 healthy controls. Results: The mean age of the patients was 19.5 +/- 9.5 years, the mean age at onset of symptoms was 16.5 +/- 10.7 years, and the mean duration of illness was 2.8 +/- 2.5 years. Of the 13 patients, 11 patients were receiving treatment with zinc sulfate and/or penicillamine and two patients were not taking any medication. Dysarthria was the presenting symptom in five patients (38.5%). Chorea, tremors, dystonia, and abnormal gait were the presenting symptoms in two patients (15.4%) each. RMT was recordable in 10 patients and non-recordable in three patients. Compared to controls, WD patients in whom RMT could be recorded had significantly higher mean RMT and CMCT (RMT: 80.9 +/- 14.8 vs. 41.1 +/- 7, p < 0.0001, CMCT: 6.7 +/- 0.5 ms vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 ms, p < 0.0001). The duration of the disease of the three patients in whom RMT could not be recorded was 4, 2 and 1 years. In two of these three patients it was possible to obtain a PEM with active contraction of the right IDF. The CMCT in these two patients was also prolonged (8.8ms and 5.6ms). Conclusions: WD patients have reduced cortical excitability and prolonged central motor conduction time, which may be due to intracortical presynaptic motor impairment. Follow-up studies are required to determine if these changes are reversible with copper removal therapy.",,"Jhunjhunwala, K. R.;Prashant, D. K.;Pal, P.

1556,A case of Wilson's disease with apraxia of eyelid opening treated with botulinum toxin,"Objective: To describe the response to botulinum toxin injection in a case of severe neuropsychiatric Wilson's disease with lidopenizing apraxia. Background: Ocular findings such as Kayser-Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts are well known to be associated with Wilson's disease. Other ocular findings have been reported and are sometimes believed to be coincidental. To our knowledge, apraxia of eyelid opening has been described only once by JR Keane in 1988. There is no case report of apraxia of eyelid opening treated with botulinum injection in Wilson's disease. Methods: The patient experienced a worsening of his neurological condition after initiation of d-penicillamine with the development of apraxia of eyelid opening. He used sensory tricks to open his eyes. He was functionally nearly blind and needed assistance to walk due to the closure of his eyes. No weakness or ptosis was detected on examination. We injected onabotulinumtoxinA A into the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally into the pretarsal portion of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Ocular findings also indicated Kayser-Fleischer rings, sunflower cataracts, eye flutter, and square wave jerks. Results: Two days after the injection, the patient noted a dramatic improvement in his condition with a significant improvement in his quality of life. Side effects were not reported. Conclusions: This is the second case of apraxia of eyelid opening in Wilson's disease and the first reported response to botulinum toxin injection. Our findings also support the idea that lid opening apraxia is a pretarsal dystonia with the presence of sensory tricks, the association with dystonia of the lower face (risus sardonicus) and the response to botulinum toxin injection.",,"Dufresne, A.

1557,Accumulation of brain metals in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the concentration of copper, iron, zinc, and manganese in WD brain autopsy tissues and their association with the phenotypic presentation of WD. BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism with pathological tissue accumulation of copper, mainly in the liver and brain. Previous studies have shown that the accumulation of other metals in brain tissue occurs in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. However, until now this issue has not been quantitatively examined in WD. DESIGN/METHODS: Study material consisted of 17 brains (12 WD patients, 5 controls) obtained at autopsy. Samples were taken from 4 different regions of each brain: frontal cortex, putamen, dentate nucleus, and pons. The levels of copper, manganese and zinc were evaluated by plasma mass spectrometry. Iron concentration was measured with atomic absorption spectroscopy. The clinical presentation of WD was considered hepatic or neuropsychiatric. RESULTS: Copper content increased homogeneously in all investigated structures of WD brains compared to controls (41.0+/-18.6 vs. 5.4+/-1.8 mg/g, p<0. 01). Manganese and zinc concentrations in WD brains were similar to controls and did not differ between brain parts tested. However, iron concentration in the dentate nucleus was significantly higher in WD brains (56.8+/-14.1 vs. 32.6+/-6.0 ug/g, p<0.05). There were no associations between the concentration of any metal in any part of the brain and the clinical presentation of WD. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our findings, during WD copper accumulates in different parts of the brain, regardless of the predominant phenotypic presentation. Zinc and manganese do not appear to be involved in the pathology. However, it appears that larger amounts of iron accumulate in the dentate core. We speculate that this effect may be due to decreased ceruloplasmin level, but further studies are needed.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Gromadzka, G.;Szpak, G.;Bulska, E.",2013,,,0,0,
1558,Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine-encapsulated chitosan/alginate nanoparticles in a rat model of copper toxicity and neurobehavioral disorders,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD) viz. Cinnamon Long Evans rats rarely exhibit neurological symptoms that preclude the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WD patients. The aim of this study was to 1. examine the effect of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate for 90 days, especially on copper and zinc levels in liver, kidney, and brain tissues; hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene expression; and MT-III and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene in brain, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioral functions of male Wistar rats, and 2. Therapeutic evaluation of D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles administered orally for 90 days in Cu-intoxicated Wistar rats. Reverse transcription PCR and the Morris water maze test were used for expression and neurobehavioral studies. Copper-intoxicated animals showed a significant increase in ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper levels and decreased serum acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression with neuromuscular coordination and impaired spatial memory. However, no changes were observed in the expression levels of the hepatic Atp7b gene; and MT-III and AChE gene in the brain. Cu-intoxicated rats revealed a significant increase in copper content in liver, brain, and kidney tissues (increase of 99.1, 73, and 74.9%, respectively), decreased liver zinc (decreased 40%) and, interestingly, increased brain zinc content (77.1% increase) compared to control rats. Histopathological studies demonstrated grade 4 copper deposits in the liver and grade 1 copper-associated protein in liver tissues of test rats by staining with rhodanine and orcein, respectively. Astrocyte swelling was observed in cerebral cortex sections of brain tissues from Cu-intoxicated rats. D-penicillamine-encapsulated chitosan/alginate nanoparticle therapy resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain Cu content, serum ceruloplasmin level, and an increase in serum AChE activity with improvement in liver and brain functions. neurological In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity can lead to increased liver and brain copper content, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, ceruloplasmin levels, and neurobehavioral alterations that may be modulated by interfering with neurotransmission. by acetylcholine; however, encapsulated D-penicillamine nanoparticles can reverse deficiencies caused by chronic Cu intoxication to a great extent in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.;Vasishta, R.

1559,Wilson's disease in children: the rate of liver cirrhosis,"Introduction: The initial manifestation of WD is variable and is rarely detected in children under 5 years of age, manifesting in most cases with abnormal liver function. Objective: To determine the rate of liver cirrhosis in children with WD. Materials and Methods: 101 children (boys - 50; girls - 51; mean age 12.3+/-2.9 years). The diagnosis of WD was supported by the decrease in serum ceruloplasmin (SC), the increase in urinary copper excretion: basal (Cu0) and after provocation with D-penicillamine (Cu1), the presence of Kaiser- Fleischer (KF), increased hepatic copper content and genetics. analysis. Cirrhosis is diagnosed on the basis of morphological data or complex laboratory and instrumental investigations. Results: In the initial diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, WD was established in 44 (43.6%) children aged 13.3+/-2.1 years: in children under 12 years - in 14 (31.1%), older than 12 years - even in 30 (53.6%) patients (p < 0.05). In children with liver cirrhosis, the presence of extrapyramidal neurological symptoms - 36.4% of cases, the presence of KF - in 68.2% children, hemolytic anemia (AH ) negative acute Coombs - in 20.5% children, compared with patients with WD in the absence of cirrhotic hepatic transformation (n = 57), in which the rate of neurological symptoms was - 10.5%, the presence of KF - 24.6%, the presence of HA - 3.5% children. In children with WD in liver cirrhosis stage: Cu0 189.5 [111.1; 492.9] mcg/24h, Cu1 2015.5+/-1206.7 mcg/24h, which significantly exceeds children with WD in the absence of liver cirrhosis: Cu0 100.8 [74.7, 133.0] mcg /24h, Cu1 1529.0+/-866.9 mcg/24h (p < 0.05). SC does not depend on the stage of WD: in hepatic cirrhosis SC was 9.1+/-5.2 mg/dl, and in its absence - 11.3+/-7.6 mg/dl (p > 0.05 ). Conclusion: In pediatric practice, there is a late diagnosis of WD, which leads to the diagnosis of the disease in 43.6% in the liver cirrhosis stage. Liver cirrhosis in children with WD is associated with the presence of CF (68.2%), neurological symptoms (36.4%), and higher levels of urinary copper excretion.",,"Chetkina, T.;Potapov, A.;Varichkina, M.;Pakhomovskaya, N.;Senyakovitch, V.;Tumanova, E.;Karagulian, N.",2013,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-8278%2813%2961384-7,0,0,
1560,Acute hemolytic anemia as initial presentation of Wilson's disease in children,"Background: Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Hemolytic anemia (HA) in WD occurs in up to 17% of patients at some point during their illness. Objectives: Objective: Our objective was to detect WD among children with HA. Design/Method: Methodology: 20 cases (mean age 8.8+/-3.9 years) with HA Coombs negative who attended the hematology clinic of Cairo University Children's Hospital were screened for WD using the level of Serum ceruloplasmin, 24-h urinary copper before and after D-Pencilamine challenge test (PCT) and slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleisher. Results: Results: No case presented low ceruloplasmin while bilateral Kayser Fleisher rings were detected in 5% of our cases. Urinary copper was elevated by 5% before and 40% after PCT. According to the scoring system used, one case had definite WD and 7 cases were likely to have WD. These 8 (40%) cases were called group B and were compared with the rest of the patients (group A). Group B had significantly lower hemoglobin, MCV, and MCH, and retics (p = 0.04, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04), respectively, and significantly higher urinary copper after penicillamine (p = 0.000) compared to group A ( unlikely Wilson).

1561,Orphan drugs and rare diseases in Andorra,"Background and objective: To establish the prevalence of rare diseases (RD) in treatment with orphan drugs (DO) and their economic impact on the pharmaceutical budget (PB). Setting and method: Retrospective, observational study, during a period of 1 year (05-01-2011 to 05-01-2012), of patients diagnosed with RD in treatment with OD in Andorra. The estimated population is about 80,000 people and this country has only one hospital. The data was obtained from 1. Data registry of the inpatient/outpatient pharmacy software (Farmatools) to identify the DOs dispensed by the hospital pharmacy department and obtain variables related to the use of Medications in the units and cost in euros. . 2. Sales report of OD imported by the international wholesaler during the study period. DO requests from community pharmacies were included. 3. Orphanet website to establish variables: OD/RD indication ratio and estimated prevalence of RD in Europe (revised May 2012). We include OD that received a European Marketing Authorization. Triemtine has also been included because it has an orphan designation status. Main outcome measures: Type of OD, Type of RD, number of patients diagnosed and treated, cost of OD (euros), annual drug budget of the Hospital Pharmacy (euros). Results: 18 patients treated with OD due to DR were identified, 50% male, 67% adults (range 14-64 years) and 33% elderly (>65 years). The general prevalence was 18/80,000 (equivalent to 22.5/100,000), with 8 different DRs and a patient/DR ratio of 2.25 (range 1-5). The specific prevalences were: pulmonary arterial hypertension: 5/80,000, systemic sclerosis and multiple myeloma: 3/80,000, Wilson's disease and chronic myeloid leukemia: 2/80,000, medullary thyroid carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome: 1/80,000 . The indication for OD has not been achieved in two cases: aerosolized tobramycin in the treatment of bronchiectasis with chronic pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa without cystic fibrosis (2 patients) and sorafenib for the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (1 patient). Distribution of OD (number of patients): bosentan (6), tobramycin aerosol (2), imatinib mesylate (2), lenalidomide (2), sildenafil citrate (2), trientine (1), zinc acetate dihydrate ( 1), azacitidine (1), pirfenidone (1), sorafenib, thalidomide (1), intravenous ibuprofen (0). The economic impact of the DO on the pharmaceutical budget of the Hospital in the study period was 8.2%. Of this 8.2, 16.5% refers to off-label OD use. The economic distribution of OD based on ATC category was: A: 2.1%, C: 29.7%, G: 0.7%, J: 4.1%, L: 63.4%.

1562,Hepatocellular carcinoma in a case of Wilson's disease,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver tumors are extremely rare in Wilson's disease. We present the case of a 41-year-old patient who presented hepatocarcinoma associated with Wilson's disease. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 16 years. He came to the hospital at the age of 41 with abdominal pain and radiographic evidence of a mass in the right hepatic lobe, with the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules. The patient died 7 days after admission. We conclude that patients with Wilson's disease should be considered at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver imaging and alpha-fetoprotein level should be included in the follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: In this paper we describe the case of a young patient with Wilson's disease associated with HCC, who was diagnosed with HCC after 25 years of treatment with penicillamine and zinc. Results: Wilson's disease is a hepatolintic degeneration resulting from a mutation in the ATP7B gene, responsible for the production of a protein important for copper transport and the elimination of excess free copper from the body. D-penicillamine contains a free sulfhydryl group that functions as a copper chelating moiety. Its main effect is to promote urinary excretion of copper and reduce the affinity of proteins for copper. Oral zinc interferes with copper absorption, induces metallothionein (an endogenous metal chelator) in enterocytes, which has a higher affinity for copper than for zinc, causing it to bind to luminal copper and thus therefore prevent their entry into the circulation [7, 8]. Hepatic copper is supposed to have a protective effect against malignant transformation [9, 10]. Some studies have found that copper can prevent the occurrence of HCC [11, 12]. However, patients with longstanding Wilson's disease who are maintained on D-penicillamine are at increased risk of developing HCC. On the other hand, patients with Wilson's disease require lifelong therapy. Interruption of therapy can lead to the development of acute failure. In this case report, the long period of illness with pinicillamine therapy played a role in the presence of HCC. Whether copper increases or reduces the risk of HCC remains to be determined [13]. A variety of important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been identified and have a well-known effect on the development of HCC. These include hepatitis B carrier status, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hereditary hemochromatosis, and cirrhosis of almost any cause [14]. While the development of HCC in patients with Wilson's disease is extremely rare. In conclusion, regular follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease with regular monitoring of alfafetopritien level and abdominal ultrasound is recommended to discover HCC earlier and may benefit from another HCC treatment modality, i.e. surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation , transarterial chemoembolization, or other modality indicated. Possible consideration for inclusion in a transplant program may benefit patients in some cases.

Mutations in the SLC30A10 gene, which encodes a manganese transporter, cause a syndrome of liver cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia, and hypermanganesemia. Methods: We present 10-year longitudinal clinical characteristics, MRI data, and treatment response to chelation therapy from the originally described patient with a proven homozygous mutation in SLC30A10. Results: The patient presented with early-onset generalized dystonia and mild hyperbilirubinemia accompanied by elevated levels of manganese in whole blood. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, characteristic of manganese deposition. Treatment with intravenous edetate calcium disodium produced clinical improvement and a reduction in hyperintensities on brain imaging. Conclusions: We want to highlight this rare disorder which, along with Wilson's disease, is the only potentially treatable inherited metal storage disorder to date, which can otherwise be fatal as a result of complications of cirrhosis.

1567,The basic molecular memory.,"We propose a tripartite biochemical mechanism for memory. Three physiological components are involved, namely the neuron (individual and circuit), the surrounding neural extracellular matrix, and the various trace metals distributed within the matrix. The binding of a metal cation affects a corresponding nanostructure (shrink, twist, expand) and the dielectric sensitivity of the chelating node (direction) within the matrix network, detected by the neuron. The neural extracellular matrix serves as an electroelastic network, in which neurons manipulate multiple trace metals (n > 10) to encode, store, and decode cognitive information. The proposed mechanism explains the low energy requirements of the brain and the high rates of storage capacity described in multiples of Avogadro's number (N<inf>A</inf> = 6 x 10<sup>23</sup>). Supporting evidence correlates memory loss with trace metal toxicity or deficiency, or failure to deliver/transport metals to the matrix, or their degradation. Inherited diseases that revolve around dysfunctional trace metal metabolism and memory dysfunction include Alzheimer's disease (Al, Zn, Fe), Wilson's disease (Cu), thalassemia (Fe), and autism (metallothionein ). The tripartite mechanism points to electroelastic interactions of neurons with trace metals distributed within the neuronal extracellular matrix, as the molecular basis of ""synaptic plasticity"" that affects short-term memory, long-term memory, and forgetting.

In this article, we demonstrate that P57/Gd, a new prion-based contrast agent, can selectively image tissues with excessive copper accumulation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The selectivity of P57/Gd binds copper(II) over other physiologically relevant cations such as zinc, iron, manganese and calcium. To simulate a copper metabolic disorder, we treated mice with an intraperitoneal injection of CuSO<inf>4</inf> solution to induce renal copper overload. Magnetic resonance signal intensities of renal cortex and medulla of copper-enriched animals administered P57/Gd were found to correlate with ex vivo copper concentrations determined by plasma-coupled mass spectrometry. inductively.

1570,Therapeutic suggestions in chronic occult hypertransaminasemia,"Less than 25% of asymptomatic adults have elevated transaminase levels in a first evaluation, a third of these patients have normal values in a new test. Of those with elevated ALT at retest, some demonstrate acute liver disease (with normal ALT in less than 6 months), and the others represent the category of chronic (greater than 6 months) elevation of transaminases. The etiology of chronic hypertransaminasemia can be elucidated in 90% of cases, due to liver disease with an occult/atypical evolution, or due to extrahepatic causes of chronic elevation of transaminases. The remaining 10% represents the category of unexplained elevation (obscure cause) of transaminases. Occult/atypical liver diseases are represented by chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver congestion, drugs and liver toxins, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, a1-antitrypsin deficiency , parasites diseases. The extrahepatic causes that can determine chronic transaminase elevations are hemolysis, soft muscle diseases (polymyositis), occult celiac disease, adrenal insufficiency, and thyroid pathology. There is still 10% of patients in whom the etiology cannot be explained. These patients are generally kept under surveillance, periodically reassessed, and undergo a second liver biopsy; which can reveal nonspecific lesions, NASH, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis. There are cases in which spontaneous normalization of transaminases was observed in the surveillance period. Chronic hypertransaminasemia is quite frequent, and has a high addressability for the doctor of patients with this type of pathology, being for most of them a casual finding in a routine blood test. It is also important to have a clear diagnosis in order to start specific treatment as soon as possible for those patients who may benefit from it.

1572,Can mothers with Wilson's disease breastfeed their baby? [Japanese],"Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in various tissues. To eliminate the accumulated copper in the body, patients are treated with the administration of trientine, penicillamine or zinc. These treatments must be continued throughout your life. Recently, breastfeeding is recommended for babies in the world. When patients with Wilson's disease have a baby, they want to breastfeed their babies even while they continue their treatment for Wilson's disease. However, no studies have been conducted on the safety of feeding breast milk to mothers undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease. This study deals with the safety of breast milk feeding in mothers undergoing treatment for Wilson's disease. Materials and Methods: Breast milk was obtained from 4, 4 and 2 patients with Wilson's disease who were treated with trientine, penicillamine and zinc, respectively. As control breast milk, colostrum, transitional and mature milk were obtained from 16, 6 and 11 healthy mothers, respectively. Copper and zinc concentrations in breast milk were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. At the same time, copper distribution profiles in breast milk were also analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS. The level of copper bound to trientine or penicillamine in the patients was also analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS. Results and Discussion: Concentrations of copper and zinc were near normal in the breast milk of mothers with Wilson's disease treated with the drugs described above. A slightly higher concentration of zinc and copper was detected in some of the patients' breast milk, but these levels were within those of infant formula. In HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of breast milk from these mothers, the highest peak was detected in copper bound to lactalbumin. No peak of trientine and penicillamine was detected in the milk. Conclusions: These results suggest that mothers with Wilson's disease can breastfeed their infants even while continuing treatment for Wilson's disease.",,"Izumi, Y.",2012,January,,0,0,

The objective is to describe a series of generally accepted approaches for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of Wilson's disease. The recommendations are based on a systematic review of the literature in Medline (PubMed version), Embase (Dialog version), and the Cochrane Library databases using entries from 1966 to 2011. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) used in other EASL CPGs was used and compared to the somewhat different grading system used in the AASLD guidelines (Table 1A and B). Unfortunately, there is not a single randomized controlled trial in Wilson's disease that has been optimally designed. Therefore, it is impossible to assign a high or even moderate quality of evidence to any of the questions addressed in this guide.

1576,Zinc and liver disease,"Zinc is an essential trace element required for normal cell growth, development and differentiation. It participates in DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and cell division and activation. It is a critical component in many zinc proteins/enzymes, including critical zinc transcription factors. Zinc deficiency/impaired metabolism is seen in many types of liver disease, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and viral liver disease. Some of the mechanisms for zinc deficiency/altered metabolism include decreased dietary intake, increased urinary excretion, activation of certain zinc transporters, and induction of hepatic metallothionein. Zinc deficiency can manifest itself in liver disease in many ways, including skin lesions, poor wound healing/liver regeneration, altered mental status, or impaired immune function. Zinc supplementation has been documented to block/attenuate experimental ALD through multiple processes, including stabilization of intestinal barrier function, decreased endotoxemia, decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased oxidative stress and attenuation of apoptotic death of hepatocytes. Clinical trials in human liver disease are limited in size and quality, but it is clear that zinc supplementation reverses clinical signs of zinc deficiency in patients with liver disease. Some studies suggest an improvement in liver function in both ALD and hepatitis C after zinc supplementation, and 1 study suggested better markers of fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C. The dose of zinc used for the treatment of liver disease is usually be 50 mg of elemental zinc taken with a meal to lessen the potential side effect of nausea.

1578,Selective divalent copper chelation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus,"Many workers have identified oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as key pathogenic mechanisms in age-related metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease). However, although numerous molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain these processes, their precise nature remains obscure. This author has previously suggested that, in such diseases, these two mechanisms are likely to occur as manifestations of a single underlying disturbance of copper regulation. Copper is an essential but highly toxic trace metal that is tightly regulated in biological systems. Several rare genetic disorders of copper homeostasis in humans are known: these mainly affect several proteins that mediate intracellular copper transport processes and can lead to states of copper overload or deficiency in tissues. These examples illustrate how altered regulation of copper transport pathways can cause organ damage and provide important insights into the impact of defects on specific molecular processes, including those catalyzed by the copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A (mutated in Menkes disease), ATP7B (Wilson's disease), and copper chaperones such as cytochrome c oxidase, SCO1 and SCO<inf>2</inf>. In diabetes, impaired copper regulation manifests as elevations in urinary excretion of Cu<sup>II</sup>, systemic chelatable Cu<sup>II</sup>, and complete copper balance, in an increased of pro-oxidant stress and defective antioxidant defenses. and in progressive damage to the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves. Links between dysregulated copper and organ damage can be demonstrated by selective chelation of Cu<sup>II</sup>, which simultaneously prevents/reverses both copper dysregulation and organ damage. Pathogenic structures in blood vessels that contribute to the binding and localization of catalytically active Cu<sup>II</sup> probably include advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), as well as atherosclerotic plaque: the latter probably undergoes modification by AGEs in herself. The defective regulation of copper mediates organ damage through two general processes that occur simultaneously in the same individual: elevation of Cu<sup>II</sup>-mediated prooxidant stress and deterioration of copper-catalyzed antioxidant defense mechanisms. This author has proposed that diabetes-induced copper dysregulation is an important new target for therapeutic intervention to prevent/reverse organ damage in diabetes, heart failure, and neurodegenerative diseases, and that triethylenetetramine (TETA) is the the first of a new class of anti-diabetic molecules, which work by targeting these copper-mediated pathogenic mechanisms. TETA prevents tissue damage and promotes organ regeneration by acting as a highly selective Cu <sup>II</sup> chelator that suppresses copper-mediated oxidative stress and restores antioxidant defenses. My group has used TETA in a comprehensive program of non-clinical studies and proof-of-principle clinical trials, thereby characterizing copper dysregulation in diabetes and identifying numerous linked cellular and molecular mechanisms through which TETA exerts its therapeutic actions. Many of the results obtained in nonclinical models regarding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic organ damage have not yet been replicated in patient tissues, so their applicability to human disease should be considered inferential until the results of studies informative clinics are available. Based on the evidence from the studies reviewed in this paper, trientine is now moving into the later stages of pharmaceutical development for the treatment of heart failure and other diabetic complications.

1580,Penicillamine increases free copper and ameliorates oxidative stress in the brain of mice with toxic milk,"Wilson's disease (WD) is characterized by the accumulation of copper derived from a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Penicillamine (PA) causes 10-50% of patients with neurological symptoms to worsen neurologically in the early stage of administration. The aim of this study was to determine how copper metabolism changes and whether the change affects the brain of toxic milk (tx) mice, an animal model of WD, during AP administration. Concentrations of free copper and protein-bound copper in the serum, cortex, and basal ganglia of tx mice administered PA for 3 days, 10 days, and 14 days, respectively, were investigated. The expression of the copper transporters, ATP7A and CTR1, was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. SOD, MDA, and GSH/GSSG were then detected to determine if oxidative stress changed correspondingly. The results revealed elevated concentrations of free copper in serum and brain, and reduced concentrations of protein-bound copper in the brain of tx mice during AP administration. Meanwhile, a transient increase in expression of ATP7A and CTR1 in general was observed in the brain parenchyma by immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, ATP7A and CTR1 were found to localize mainly to the Golgi apparatus and the cell membrane, respectively. Strong ATP7A staining was found at the choroid plexus in tx mice on the third and tenth days of PA treatment, but rare ATP7A and CTR1 staining at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Decreased concentrations of GSH/GSSG and increased concentrations of MDA were also observed in the cortex and basal ganglia. Our results suggested that elevated free copper concentrations in the brain could lead to increased oxidative stress during PA administration. The increase in free copper in the brain could come from copper mobilized from brain parenchymal cells, but not from serum based on ATP7A and CTR1 expression analysis. Â© 2012 Chen et al.",,"Chen, D.

1581,Current and future techniques in the evaluation of dysphagia,"Dysphagia is common in the general population and is usually due to mechanical obstruction or dysmotility. Patient demographics and symptom assessment are often helpful in determining the likely cause and guiding further investigation and treatment. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is usually caused by neurological conditions where treatment options are limited. In contrast, many of the esophageal causes of dysphagia are amenable to treatment. Gastroscopy is usually the first test of choice, given its diagnostic and therapeutic potential, especially when it comes to mechanical causes. Esophageal motor function can be assessed using a variety of techniques, ranging from radiology, such as the barium swallow, to specific motility tests, such as manometry and impedance monitoring. The choice of test is based on the clinical indication and the results should be interpreted in conjunction with the patients' symptoms. High resolution manometry with topography is now the new benchmark for motility studies. Several new techniques for motility testing, such as esophageal ultrasound and functional lumen imaging probe, have also become available, but are currently limited to the research setting.

1584,New novel mutation of the ATP7B gene in a family with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The WD gene encodes a copper transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B) found on chromosome 13q14.3. Mutation of this gene disrupts copper homeostasis, resulting in copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas and copper intoxication at these sites. Since the discovery of the WD gene in 1993, approximately 300 disease-specific mutations have been identified. We recently evaluated a Korean family with WD. The proband, a 17-year-old boy, visited our hospital due to abnormal behaviors that included generalized slowness of movement, dysphagia, drooling, and ataxia. Laboratory results revealed decreases in serum copper and ceruloplasmin and an increase in urinary copper excretion. He had liver cirrhosis, brain lesions, and Kayser-Fleischer corenal rings. Molecular genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene showed that he was heterozygous for the deletion mutation c.2697-2723del27 in exon 11. Further study of family members revealed that his father and younger brother had the same mutation. The deletion mutation c.2697-2723del27 in exon 11 has not yet been reported as a WD-causing mutation and an in-frame deletion is not expected to lead to in-frame switching. Therefore, we report a new ATP7B gene mutation in a family with WD. Â© 2011 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Lee, J. Y.;Kim, Y. H.;Kim, T. W.;Oh, S. Y.;Kim, D. S.;Shin, B.

This study investigated whether heterozygotes reach this value and compared serum copper levels, ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper excretion before and after administration of d-penicillamine to parents of patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: Fifty parents of adult patients were enrolled to obtain serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels along with 24-h urinary copper excretion before and after administration of 1.g d-penicillamine. Results: Serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper were significantly lower in fathers than in mothers (mean 21.8 x 27.8 mg%; 71.4 x 88.0 mg%; p<= 0.001). Mean baseline 24-h urine copper excretion was higher in fathers (26.2 x 18.7 Âµg/24 h, p= 0.01), but did not differ between sexes after d-penicillamine (521 .7 x 525.3, range 31.6-1085.1 mug). /24h, p= 0.8). Conclusions: The mean values of serum copper, ceruloplasmin and baseline urinary copper excretion were different between men and women. Heterozygotes did not reach the current diagnostic threshold for urinary copper excretion 24 hours after d-penicillamine administration. The increase in urinary copper excretion after d-penicillamine challenge was much greater than five times the upper limit of normal urinary copper excretion in most heterozygotes and should not be considered when diagnosing Wilson's disease. .

1593,Surgery in a patient with liver disease,"Surgery is often needed in patients with concurrent liver disease. The multiple physiological functions of the liver place these patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Diseases that require surgery, such as gallstones and hernias, are more common in patients with cirrhosis. Assessment of the severity of liver dysfunction prior to surgery is important and the risk-benefit of the procedure must be carefully evaluated. The severity of the disease can vary from a mild increase in transaminases to decompensated cirrhosis. If possible, surgery should be avoided in the emergency setting, in the setting of acute and alcoholic hepatitis, in a patient with childhood class C cirrhosis or with a MELD score greater than 15, or in any patient with extrahepatic organ dysfunction. significant. In this subgroup of patients, all possible means should be attempted to treat these patients conservatively. Modified Child-Pugh scores and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores can fairly reliably predict mortality after surgery, including non-hepatic abdominal surgery. Preoperative optimization would include control of ascites, correction of electrolyte imbalance, improvement of renal dysfunction, cardiorespiratory evaluation, and correction of coagulation. Global hemostasis tests such as thromboelastography and thrombin generation time may be more predictive of bleeding risk compared to conventional coagulation tests in patients with cirrhosis. Correction of the international normalized ratio with fresh frozen plasma does not necessarily mean a reduction in bleeding risk and may increase the risk of volume overload and lung injury. The international normalized liver ratio may better reflect the coagulation status. Recombinant factor VIIa in patients with cirrhosis who need surgery needs further study. Intraoperatively, safe anesthetic agents such as isoflurane and propofol are recommended to avoid hypotension. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and benzodiazepines should not be used. Intra-abdominal surgery in a patient with cirrhosis becomes more challenging in the presence of ascites, portal hypertension, and hepatomegaly. Uncontrolled bleeding from coagulopathy and portal hypertension, sepsis, renal dysfunction, and worsening liver failure contribute to morbidity and mortality in these patients. Measures should be taken to reduce ascitic leaks and infections. All patients with cirrhosis undergoing major surgery should be referred to a specialized center with experience in the management of liver diseases.

1596,Role of the human high-affinity copper transporter in the regulation of copper homeostasis and sensitivity to cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy,"The high-affinity copper transporter (Ctr1; SCLC31A1) plays an important role in regulating copper homeostasis because copper is an essential micronutrient and copper deficiency is detrimental to many important cellular functions, but excess copper is toxic. Recent research has revealed that human copper homeostasis is tightly controlled by interregulatory circuits involving copper, Sp1, and human (hCtr1). This circuit uses the transcription factor Sp1 as a copper sensor to modulate the expression of hCtr1, which in turn controls cellular copper and Sp1 levels in a mutual 3-way regulatory circuit. Post-translational regulation of hCtr1 expression by copper strains has also been described in the literature. Because hCtr1 can also transport platinum drugs, this finding underlines the important role of hCtr1 in platinum drug sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy. Consistent with this notion is the finding that elevated hCtr1 expression was associated with favorable treatment outcomes in cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. Furthermore, studies of cultured cells demonstrated that elevated hCtr1 expression can be induced by depleting cellular copper levels, resulting in increased cisplatin uptake and its cell-killing activity. A phase I clinical trial has been conducted with a combination of trientine (a copper chelator) and carboplatin with encouraging results. This review discusses new insights into the role of hCtr1 in regulating copper homeostasis and explains how modulation of cellular copper availability might influence treatment efficacy in platinum-based cancer chemotherapy through regulation. of hCtr1.

1597,Wilson's disease: Canadian perspectives on presentation and outcomes in an adult outpatient setting.,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To describe the authors' clinical experience with a cohort of 48 adult patients followed up in an outpatient setting. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of patients diagnosed with WD was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine graphs were identified and 11 were excluded on further review. At the time of diagnosis, 14 patients were asymptomatic, with 13 hepatic, 15 neurological, and 6 mixed hepatic/neurological presentations. Ceruloplasmin levels were low (<0.20 g/L) in 94% and 24-hour urine copper levels were high (>0.60 Âµmol/L) in 95% of cases. D-penicillamine was the most common initial treatment (48%), with zinc being the most common in the review (65%). Overall, biopsy and ultrasound reports documented cirrhosis in 53%. Portal hypertension, defined as splenomegaly (>12.0 cm), reversed portal venous flow on ultrasound, or varices/gastropathy on endoscopy, was observed in 63%. At last review, 39% had elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (>34 U/L) and/or alanine aminotransferase (>40 U/L). One death and one transplant occurred, while three patients had encephalopathy, two developed jaundice, two developed ascites, and one experienced variceal bleeding. Of 21 neurological patients who presented, 14 improved compared to baseline, and four recovered almost completely. Eleven patients experienced documented episodes of neurological deterioration, including four with a non-neurological presentation. Diagnostic MRI showed basal ganglia (64%), brainstem abnormalities (64%), and atrophy (36%); follow-up showed lesions in the basal ganglia (50%) and atrophy (55%). CONCLUSION: WD is a diverse chronic disease with generally favorable outcomes for patients who respond to initial therapy, which can be predominantly managed in an outpatient setting.

1598,Clinical efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for Wilson's disease: a systematic review of 9 randomized controlled trials.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Despite being treatable, there is no universally accepted treatment regimen. Currently, several Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease in China, but reliable scientific evidence on the effectiveness of such therapies is lacking. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of ChMM as an alternative or adjuvant therapy for Wilson's disease. A systematic literature search of different medical databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing CHM as monotherapy or CHM as adjuvant therapy with Western conventional medical therapy in the treatment of Wilson's disease. A total of 687 participants were included in nine eligible studies. The main findings are that CHM as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for Wilson's disease may improve clinical symptoms, promote urinary excretion of copper, improve liver function and/or liver cirrhosis, and have fewer adverse effects compared with CHM. Western conventional drugs. medicine. Furthermore, CHM generally appeared to be safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. However, the evidence presented in this review is insufficient to justify a clinical recommendation due to the generally low methodological quality of the included studies. In conclusion, CHM appears to be beneficial and safe for Wilson's disease, but high-quality evidence is still needed to further evaluate this therapy. Therefore, further well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Wang, Y.;Xie, C. L.;Fu, D. L.;Lu, L.;Lin, Y.;Dong, Q. Q.;Wang, X. T.;Zheng, G.

This report describes the second case report of a Nigerian child with Wilson's disease in three decades. Presentation of the case. An eight-year-old African boy presented with generalized edema, ascites, and proteinuria. Over the next three weeks, he developed conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, severe coagulopathy, and prominent extrapyramidal features consisting of rigidity, tremors at rest and on action, a shuffling gait, slurred speech, and emotional lability. Slit-lamp examination of her eyes revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts. Her serum ceruloplasmin level was 5 mg/dL. Using the scoring system proposed by the 8<sup>th</sup> International Meeting of Wilson Disease and Menkes Disease, the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. Conclusions: Wilson's disease occurs in African children, although the diagnosis is rarely made.

1601,From suspected liver metastases to diagnosis of Wilson's disease in a patient with seminoma,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea due to inadequate biliary excretion of copper. It should be considered especially in young patients who have findings of liver disease with unexplained etiology. The clinical presentation of the disease can be variable and different types of liver parenchymal changes can be seen on imaging modalities. Multiple nodular lesions simulating metastasis can be detected. This condition may force doctors to look for a malignancy. In addition, it can cause misdiagnosis as advanced stage of the disease when it coexists with a malignant neoplasm. Wilson's disease has been reported to coexist with some malignancies; however, coexistence with seminoma has not been reported before. Approximately 40% of testicular cancers are pure seminomas. Liver metastases are rare in seminoma. In this article a case of Wilson's cirrhosis is reported.

1602,Excretion of metallic elements in 24-hour urine in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder that causes copper accumulation and subsequent toxicity. D-penicillamine, a potent metal chelator, is an important therapy for Wilson's disease. To investigate the changes of metallic elements under D-penicillamine treatment, we determined the levels of Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Se, Mn, Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Tl and Al by ICP-MS in urine. of 115 patients with Wilson's disease who had received treatment with D-penicillamine for 1 month to 22 years in maintenance doses, as well as 115 age-matched healthy controls. The levels of Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd and Mn in the 24-h urine of the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls (P<0.05), and the increases observed in the the levels of Mg, Ca and Zn were directly correlated with the duration of treatment with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 (Ca) and 0.313 (Zn), respectively (P<0.05) . On the other hand, the levels of Al and As in the 24-h urine were lower than those of the controls (P<0.05) and were negatively correlated with the time of treatment with R of -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As ), respectively, (P<0.05). Therefore, this study indicates that the levels of metallic elements may be altered in patients with Wilson's disease under treatment with D-penicillamine.

1611,Quality of life and psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease: The relevance of bipolar disorders,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder caused by a gene located on chromosome 13, which involves the transport of copper through cell membranes. The disease can cause reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, resulting in the accumulation of this metal in the liver, central nervous system, kidneys, and other organs. The objective is to define the frequencies of psychiatric disorders in WD, the degree of affectation of Quality of Life [QoL] in patients with WD and the relevance of psychiatric disorders in the QoL of people with WD. Methods: This is a systematic review. Significant articles were searched in PubMed using specific keywords. Results: Like other neurological diseases, WD is characterized by a chronic course and need for treatment, impaired functional outcomes, and a high frequency of psychiatric symptoms, although a specific association between bipolar disorders and WD was recently found. Despite this, since today few studies are carried out on the quality of life of patients with WD related to psychiatric symptoms. Some new reports showed a link between the presence of diagnosed bipolar disorders, brain damage, and poor quality of life. Conclusion: Prospective studies in large cohorts are required to establish the effective impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders, in particular bipolar disorders, on quality of life in WD and to clarify the causal link between brain damage, psychiatric disorders and worsening of QoL.

1615,Decreased serum antioxidant capacity in patients with Wilson's disease is associated with neurological symptoms,"Background and objectives Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper disposition caused by a mutation of the ATP7B transporter gene, leading to copper accumulation in predisposed tissues. In addition to a genetic predisposition, other factors are likely to contribute to its clinical manifestation. The aim of the study was to assess whether oxidative stress affects the phenotypic manifestation of WD. Methods In 56 patients with WD (29 men; 26 with the hepatic form, 22 with the neurological form, and eight asymptomatic; mean age 38.5 +/- 12 years), total serum antioxidant capacity (TAC) and inflammatory parameters ( hs-CRP, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) were analyzed and related to the clinical manifestation and mutations of the ATP7B gene. The control group for CT and inflammatory parameters consisted of 50 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Results WD patients had a significantly lower TAC (p < 0.00001), lower levels of IL-10 (p = 0.039), as well as higher levels of IL-1beta (p = 0.019) and IL-6 (p = 0.005) compared to control subjects. TNF-alpha, hs-CRP and IL-2 did not differ from controls. Patients with the neurological form of WD had a significantly lower TAC than those with the hepatic form (p<0.001). In addition, the lower TAC was associated with the severity of neurological symptoms (p=0.02). No relationship was found between inflammatory parameters and clinical symptoms. Conclusions The data from our study suggest that increased oxidative stress contributes significantly to the clinical manifestation of WD; since a lower TAC is associated with neurological symptoms in patients with WD.

1616,Zinc and human health: an update,"The importance of micronutrients in health and nutrition is indisputable, and among them, zinc is an essential element whose importance for health is increasingly appreciated and whose deficiency can play an important role in the appearance of diseases. Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the body, with three main biological functions, as a catalytic, structural and regulatory ion. Zinc-binding motifs are found in many physiologically encoded proteins throughout the human genome, and free zinc is primarily regulated at the single-cell level. Zinc has a critical effect on homeostasis, immune function, oxidative stress, apoptosis and aging, and significant disorders of great public health interest are associated with zinc deficiency. In many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, various malignancies, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, aging, age-related degenerative diseases, and Wilson's disease, simultaneous zinc deficiency can complicate clinical features, adversely affect immune status, increase oxidative stress and cause the generation of inflammatory cytokines. In these diseases, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causal roles. Therefore, it is important that zinc status be assessed in any case and zinc deficiency corrected, as the unique properties of zinc may have important therapeutic benefits in these diseases. In this paper we review zinc as a multipurpose trace element, its biological role in homeostasis, proliferation, and apoptosis, and its role in immunity and chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, depression, Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and others. age-related diseases.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Recognize Wilson's disease in young patients with parkinsonian features. CASE: A previously healthy 24-year-old woman was hospitalized with numbness and recurrent headaches accompanied by parkinsonian symptoms (tremors, slurred speech, and drooling with difficulty swallowing). He had a significant family history of psychiatric illness in his mother and sister. Physical examination was notable only for mild dysarthria and subjective weakness on the left side. Initial laboratory data, including a CBC, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function, ESR, CRP, Lyme PCR, HIV, and RPR/VDRL, were all negative. He presented a normal CSF examination with a paraneoplastic panel, IgG index, negative viral studies and cryptococcal antigen. Urinalysis was normal and urine drug screen was unrevealing. The autoimmune study that included ANA and rheumatoid factor was negative. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed diffuse, symmetric, abnormal hypodensities of the bilateral basal ganglia. An MRI to further evaluate soft tissue abnormalities showed increased T2 signal within the right and left lentiform nucleus. A heavy metal screen was ordered. The levels of arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium and copper were all low. Given the high index of suspicion, an extremely low ceruloplasmin level of 3.1 mg/dL (normal: 14 - 78 mg/dL) was requested. A liver biopsy showed grade 2 mild chronic active hepatitis, stage 3 septal fibrosis, and copper retained within hepatocytes, confirming the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. A slit-lamp ophthalmologic examination showed clear Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. He was started on trientine and zinc, and during subsequent follow-up his KF rings disappeared and neurological symptoms showed modest improvement. DISCUSSION: Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is an autosomal recessive defect in copper export with a prevalence rate of one in 30,000 live births. It is caused by reduced biliary excretion of copper leading to its accumulation in the liver and then progressing to other organs. Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation combined with physical, biochemical, and histological findings. Neurologic disease (present in 35 percent of patients) includes parkinsonian tremor, stiffness and clumsiness when walking, speech problems, and drooling. Ten percent of patients have psychiatric symptoms that range from subtle personality changes to overt depression, catatonia, and paranoia. Serum aminotransferases are often elevated, but their severity does not correlate with histologic liver injury. Total body copper levels are elevated, but serum levels may be low in patients with low ceruloplasmin levels. In the presence of only neurologic symptoms with normal liver function and low copper levels, a slit-lamp examination to look for KF rings should be considered. If it is positive, it strongly suggests Wilson's disease. A liver biopsy may be required for further confirmation of the diagnosis.",,"Gulati, G.;Gulati, S.;Nguyen, H. P.",2012,July,,0,0,
1618,"A riddle wrapped in an enigma, but perhaps there is a key!","LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Discuss the differential diagnosis of cirrhosis in a young adult LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Discuss the importance of Wilson's evaluation with diagnostic procedures, the importance of strong clinical suspicion, and the importance of continuity of care and communication between health care providers. CASE: A 26-year-old woman with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, diagnosed at age 22, presents in December 2011 with a 2-week history of abdominal pain and abdominal swelling. With the loss of insurance some 10 months prior, he was unable to maintain the proper dose of lactulose and lasix and became dependent on the many subsequent visits to the ER for acute care. The characteristics of the pain were: acute, oppressive, pressure sensation, diffusely located throughout the abdomen, with a severity of up to 10/10. He complained of nausea and vomiting, fever, and episodes of altered mental status. On examination, she was afebrile, normotensive, and without acute distress. He had significant scleral jaundice and no apparent change in mental status. Firm and distended abdomen, painful on palpation with positive fluid wave and mild splenomegaly. Abnormal labs: hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 32.1, hepatitis panel negative, alkaline phosphatase 532, AST 132, total bilirubin 24.8 (direct 13.6, indirect 11.2), MELD score 26, and Child Pugh score of 10, PTT 36, PT 29.7 and RIN 1.88. Review of his previous records from 2010 revealed a normal serum ceruloplasmin level, copper excretion of 34 in 24 hours, and a positive liver biopsy for copper but without any quantification. Antimitochondrial antibody, ANA, and hemochromatosis gene mutation were negative. She had been treated for depression and substance abuse (EtOH), which is why she did not qualify for the liver transplant. However, upon further questioning, we discovered that he only recently used alcohol to cope after he lost his insurance. Our study showed a weak Kayser-Fleischer ring, ceruloplasmin level of 20.1, 24-hour copper elevated to 86, and a copper/creatinine ratio of 78. At this point, we concluded that he met the criteria. diagnosis for Wilson's disease and started treatment with D-penicillamine. DISCUSSION: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder (ATP7B gene) of copper transport with a prevalence of approximately 1/30,000. The typical presentation includes neurological and hepatic dysfunction. Diagnosis generally requires a high index of clinical suspicion due to symptom overlap with other disorders. Late and misdiagnoses are not uncommon, as in our case, especially when there is a possible history of substance abuse and when lack of insurance becomes a limiting factor for proper follow-up and care. Therefore, the importance of continuity of care and communication between clinicians cannot be overemphasized. Diagnostic criteria include: presence of Kayser-Fleishcer rings in slit lamp, ceruloplasmin <0.20 g/l, 24-h urinary free copper excretion, penicillamine challenge test, hepatic copper measurement, and presence of genetic mutation abnormal. The mainstays of therapy include penicillamine, trientine, and zinc. For advanced disease, as in our patient, the long-term treatment is liver transplantation.",,"Sapkota, S.

1619,A case of acute copper toxicity,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is due to an autosomal recessive defect in copper transport. Ceruloplasmin represents circulating copper in plasma. Hepatic production of apoceruloplasmin, copper-free ceruloplasmin, causes the low serum ceruloplasmin level found in patients with Wilson's disease. Additionally, inappropriate function of the Wilson disease protein, ATP7B, leads to impaired biliary excretion of copper, allowing copper to accumulate and be deposited in the hepatic, neurological, renal, and ophthalmic systems. Important clinical features of the disease include cirrhosis, acute liver failure, movement disorders, psychosis, and premature osteoporosis. CASE: A 25-year-old male with a history of panhypopituitarism s/p removal of a suprasellar mass secondary to Langerhans histiocytosis who presented altered mental status, generalized weakness, and lethargy. Notably, he had stopped using his DDAVP for several weeks. On admission, she was found to have a serum sodium level of 172. She was immediately started on pituitary hormone replacement therapy including desmopressin, solucortef, and synthroid. In addition, he was found to have new elevated liver function tests, ammonia, and INR. Initially, it was assumed that his altered mentality was a combination of hypernatremia and liver dysfunction. For this, he received lactulose and rifaximin. His sodium level improved, however, he remained encephalopathic. His acute liver failure was further evaluated by gastroenterology and hepatology. Diagnostic laboratory tests revealed low ceruloplasmin, high serum copper, and an elevated urinary copper level. Subsequently, a liver biopsy was performed, which showed stage III-IV portal fibrosis and steatosis and stage II-IV portal and parenchymal infiltrates, both compatible with Wilson's disease. He was started on penylamine, which led to an immediate improvement in his mental status. The ATP7B gene was pending discharge. You will undergo a slit lamp examination on an outpatient basis. He was discharged home with close gastroenterology and hepatology follow-up. DISCUSSION: Wilson's disease should be considered in any individual between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause, and should be excluded in any patient with unexplained liver disease accompanied by rapid neurological deterioration. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease is made by slit-lamp examination to identify Kayser-Fleischer rings, which represent copper deposition in the Decemet's membrane of the cornea. Biochemical tests demonstrate elevated liver function tests, low levels of ceruloplasmin, and high levels of copper excretion in serum and urine. Increased copper content in liver parenchyma provides critical diagnostic information and should be obtained in cases where diagnosis is not straightforward. Histologic abnormalities found on liver biopsy include steatosis, hepatocellular necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. If the diagnosis remains elusive, molecular genetic studies such as the ATP7B mutation can be obtained. Treatment options include D-penicillamine, a chelator that promotes urinary excretion of copper, trientine (also a chelator) that is indicated in patients who cannot tolerate penicillamine, and zinc that interferes with copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.",,"Patel, P.;Andhavarapu, K.;Shah, P.;Menon, N.;Feldman, J.",2012,July,,0,0,

1621,Effect of Cuprenil on liver disease in Bulgarian patients with Wilson's disease (WD),"Cuprenil is the standard treatment of WD but its effect on liver disease progression has never been established in adult Bulgarian patients. We evaluated the effect of Cuprenil on liver disease progression in 65 Bulgarian patients with WD treated with Cuprenil at a mean dose of 1025 mg/d and followed for a mean period of 11.35 years. Adherence to therapy was observed in 72% of cases. In 70% of them, it was associated with the effective level of urinary copper excretion (8.34 +/- 11.2 mumol/24h). At the time of diagnosis, there was liver cirrhosis in 36 patients and acute/chronic hepatitis in 29. A normalized level of liver enzymes was observed in 58% of patients. Liver cirrhosis developed in 57% of patients with chronic hepatitis, but 73% of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis maintained Child A. In 86% of patients, liver disease did not progress. Esophageal varices did not develop in 63% of patients with liver cirrhosis. During treatment, reduction of the Kaiser-Fleischer ring was observed in 26% of patients.

1622,Wilson's Fulminant Crisis: Plasmapheresis vs Mars,"Wilson's disease (WD) presents with chronic hepatic and neurological dysfunction. In rare cases, it can present with fulminant hepatic failure and multi-organ dysfunction. Initial therapy is aimed at lowering the high serum copper levels characteristic of Wilson's disease. Since copper binds to albumin, we evaluated the efficacy of 2 modalities of extracorporeal copper removal: molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) and plasmapheresis (PP). A 25-year-old woman with WD in Trientine presented with fulminant WD (hemolytic anemia, hepatic failure, AKI) due to medication noncompliance for 1 year. Blood levels of copper (Cu), haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin were monitored. Treatments alternated between MARS and PP. MARS sessions consisted of 8 hours of albumin dialysis, each followed by CVVHDF. PP sessions replaced 1.2 times the volume of plasma with FFP. The copper reduction ratios (CRR) for each modality are shown in the table. The patient went on to liver transplant after a total of 5 sessions (3 MARS and 2 PP). In this case, the average CRR for MARS and PP were similar (18.6% vs. 26.9%, p=0.5). Side effects of FFP replacement in pharesis are not seen with MARS. Both MARS and PP can be used to remove copper in Wilson's crisis and as a bridge to liver transplantation.

1624,Wilson's disease: abnormal methionine metabolism and the role of inflammation and steatosis in early liver disease,"Study Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport that presents with hepatic accumulation of copper and development of hepatic steatosis. Copper has been shown to inhibit the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), which is central in methionine metabolism and in the regulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels. The SAM/SAH ratio is an indicator of methylation capacity and regulates gene expression. This study examines the effects of copper-induced SAHH inhibition and copper-chelating penicillamine (PCA) treatment on the pathogenesis of inflammation and steatosis in an animal model of WD to establish a link between methionine metabolism and the regulation of gene expression. Methods used: Livers and blood were collected from 7 toxic milk (tx-j) mice and 7 C3H control mice in each age group at 12 and 24 weeks, and 7 PCA-treated tx-j mice at 24 weeks. . We measured SAM and SAH methionine metabolism metabolites (HPLC) and SAHH activity. Lipid metabolism genes glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP 1c), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha (CPT-1 alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ( PPAR alpha) and proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were measured by Real Time-PCR. Summary of results: Hepatic copper levels in tx-j mice were 35-40 times higher than controls (p<0.0001), while PCA tx-j mice accumulated half as much copper as tx-j mice. untreated (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, SAHH activity was reduced in tx-j mice (p = 0.01), but restored similarly to controls in PCA tx-j mice. The SAM/SAH ratio was lower in untreated PCA and tx-j mice (p<0.05). Expressions of GRP78, SREBP 1c, CPT-1alpha, and PPARalpha were reduced in untreated tx-j mice at both ages and further reduced in PCA tx-j mice. TNFalpha expression was higher in untreated tx-j mice, but was reduced in PCA tx-j mice. Conclusions: Copper accumulation is associated with inhibition of SAHH activity in tx-j mice that was restored in PCA tx-j mice. The SAM/SAH ratio was reduced in untreated PCA and tx-j mice with changes in gene expression for inflammation and steatosis. These findings indicate that abnormal copper-induced methionine metabolism and subsequent inflammation and steatosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of early liver disease in WD.",,"Dolatshahi, M.;Shibata, N.;Liu, S.;Halsted, C.;Medici, V.",2012,January,http://dx.doi.org/10.231/JIM.0b013e318240c940,0,0,
1625,Usefulness of dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport due to defective hepatocyte-biliary copper excretion, resulting in pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues, primarily the liver and brain. Clinical manifestations related to the accumulation of copper in the liver include liver diseases ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy (DHBS) in the evaluation of liver dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease. Material and Methods: DHBS with 99mTc Mebrofenine was performed in 39 consecutive patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine (19 men and 20 women; mean age 39+/-4 years) with clinical evidence of liver disease. All patients underwent standard biochemical liver function tests including ALT, AST, GGT, AP, TOT BIL, ALB, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Liver biopsies were performed in all WD patients. Liver tissue was examined for routine liver histology (fibrosis grading and staging) and liver copper content. DHBS was performed after iv injection of 110 MBq99mTc mebrofenin by 30 second time/frame acquisition for 60 minutes. Time-activity curves of the regions of interest located on the liver parenchyma (H) and the main intrahepatic bile ducts (B) were recorded. Quantitative analysis of the curves was performed by deconvolutional analysis and nonlinear regression measuring the time to peak intraparenchymal (HTmax) and intraductal (B Tmax) counts and the time to T1/2 excretion (HT1/2; BT1/ two ) . Results: All patients had low serum ceruplasmin and copper levels, respectively (3.05+/-0.2mg/dl and 57+/-18mug/dl) and high 24-hour urinary copper excretion (201+/ -42mug/24h). Based on Metavir fibrosis staging, 16 patients (41%) were classified as F1, 7 as F2 (18%), 10 as F3 (25%), and the remaining 6 as F4 (16%). Analysis of quantitative DHBS data showed slow hepatic uptake (>HTmax) and hepatobiliary excretion (>HT1/2) in almost patients. A positive correlation was observed between the histological findings and the values of Htmax (p=0.001), HT1/2 (p=0.006) and BTmax (p=0.02). In addition, in the multivariate analysis, a significant correlation was found between HTmax, HT1/2 BT1/2 and high degree of fibrosis (F4) compared to the other degrees of fibrosis. No correlation was found between biochemical liver function tests, but bilirubin was; (p < 0.01) and DHBS parameters. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the clinical utility of DHBS as a non-invasive diagnostic modality to assess the degree of liver fibrosis, allowing to reduce the number of liver biopsies in long-term follow-up in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Serra, A.;Sorbello, O.;Loi, G.;Mighela, M.;Faa, G.;Demelia, L.;Piga, M.",2012,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-012-222-x,0,0,
1626,A precious metal: copper deficiency presenting as myeloneuropathy,"Background: Copper deficiency is a rare cause of hematologic and neurologic disease. We describe a case of copper deficiency that mimics subacute combined cord degeneration. Methods: A 65-year-old woman presented with weakness in the legs, poor balance, and paresthesia in the hands and legs. He was known to have celiac disease and B12 and folate deficiency, with erratic compliance to B12 injections. There were no features of inflammatory joint or muscle disease, or of an underlying autoimmune connective tissue disorder. Neurological examination revealed normal tone and power with rapid reflexes. He had a mid-thigh sensory level, with reduced proprioception to the ankles and absent vibration sense to the hips. Sensory ataxia and a positive Romberg test were demonstrated. His clinical picture suggested combined myeloneuropathy. In view of her medical history, actual or functional B12 deficiency was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and nerve conduction studies showed no specific changes. Blood tests, including B12, folate, inflammatory markers, and autoimmune profile, were normal. However, copper studies were abnormal, with a low serum copper level of 2.3 [normal range 11-20], ceruloplasmin 0.1 [NR 0.2-0.6], and zinc 6.1 [NR 11-24]. He was diagnosed with copper deficiency. With oral copper supplementation, her symptoms have improved. Results: Copper deficiency is recognized as a cause of myelopathy in humans and other animals, particularly ruminants. Copper chelators are used in animal models to model demyelination and neurodegenerative phenomena. In humans, it has been observed after gastric bypass surgery or after excessive use of zinc-containing denture adhesives, although many cases are idiopathic. The disease may mimic subacute combined spinal cord degeneration, optic neuropathy, or myelodysplasia with refractory anemia and other cytopenias. Copper deficiency myelopathy is more common among women, with a peak in the fifth and sixth decades. This picture is not seen in Wilson's disease, but in cases of clinical doubt, copper deficiency can be distinguished by demonstrating low urinary copper levels. Spinal MRI may show increased T2 signal in the thoracic and posterior cervical cord. It is not clear how copper deficiency causes neurodegeneration or why it appears similar to other deficiency-related neurodegenerative conditions. Dysfunction of cytochrome oxidase and of the methylation process involved in myelin protein synthesis may explain both the pathogenesis and the similarity between the phenotypes. Conclusions: Copper deficiency is a rare cause of neurodegenerative symptoms that can mimic other conditions. A combination of myelopathy and cytopenia is particularly suspicious. Physicians should be aware of this possibility, especially in patients with risk factors such as malabsorption, bariatric surgery, or megadoses of zinc. After treatment, cytopenias usually resolve, but neurologic recovery is often incomplete.",,"Hayes, F.;Coward, L.;Borg, F.",2012,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kes108,0,0,
1627,"Clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease and effect of treatment","Objectives: To study the clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease (WD) and the effect of treatment. Methods: This study was carried out in 31 patients who underwent a detailed clinical history, physical and neurological examination. A slit-lamp examination of the cornea for the Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring, biochemical studies (including serum ceruloplasmin, copper, and urinary copper), and neuroimaging were performed in all patients. Results: The mean age of onset was 12.41 years and the mean delay in diagnosis was 16.96 months. 24 (77.4%) patients were minors (age less than 18 years) and 7 (22.6%) were adults (age greater than 18 years). Dystonia was the most frequent initial neurological manifestation (64.5%), followed by dysarthria (41.9%), sialorrhea (38.7%) and parkinsonism (38.7%). Among the main neurological manifestations, the dystonic group (83.9%) predominated, followed by the parkinsonian group (64.5%), cerebellar group (22.6%) and choreoathetoid group (9.7%). While parkinsonism predominated in the juvenile group, cerebellar characteristics predominated in the adults. Psychiatric complaints (41.9%), seizures (19.4%), and headache (22.5%) were also noted. Bilateral KF ring was observed in all patients. Non-neuropsychiatric features (bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly, and joint pain) were seen predominantly in the young. Serum ceruloplasmin was low (<20 mg/dl) in 93.54% of patients, 24-h urinary copper (>100 micrograms/day) was elevated in all patients, and serum copper was low (<75 micrograms/dl) in 64.5% of patients. Brain MRI was performed in 27 patients, with changes in the signal of the basal ganglia being the most frequent finding (85.2%). Brain CT was performed on 4 patients, the most common finding being hypodensity of the basal ganglia (75%). All patients were treated with zinc and penicillamine. 23 (74.2%) patients took regular treatment with neurological worsening in 16 (51.6%) patients. 13 (41.9%) patients completely improved; 12 (38.7%) patients presented incomplete improvement with sequelae; 4 (12.9%) patients remained in the status quo and were lost to follow-up and 2 (6.45%) patients worsened and died. Conclusions: This series of WD from East India highlights that the disease is not that rare in India and has varied clinical presentations. Dystonia and parkinsonian features predominated in the juvenile patients, while cerebellar features predominated in the adult group. Screening of all asymptomatic siblings for WD should be performed.

The aim of this study was (1) to examine the effects of copper lactate injected intraperitoneally daily for 90 days, especially on copper levels in brain tissues, metallothionein-I (MT-I) expression, and the gene Atp7b in liver and MT-III and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene in brain (by reverse transcription-PCR) and neurobehavioral functions (by Morris water maze) of male Wistar rats. (2) evaluation of chitosan/alginate nanoparticles encapsulated in copper chelating trientine dihydrochloride administered orally for 90 days in copper-intoxicated Wistar rats. Animals administered copper showed a significant increase in ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper levels, decreased serum AChE activity, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression with impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. Autopsy studies of copper-intoxicated rats revealed a significant increase in liver and brain copper content (99.1% and 73% increase, respectively), decreased liver zinc (40% decrease), and interestingly, increased brain zinc content (77.1% increase) compared to control rats Copper deposition in liver and brain tissues and copper-associated proteins in liver tissues of rats test rats were corroborated by rhodanine and orcein staining, respectively. Nanoparticle-based therapy resulted in a significant reduction in liver copper content, serum ceruloplasmin level, and increased serum AChE activity. In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity can lead to increased liver and brain copper content, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, elevated serum Cu levels, ceruloplasmin levels, urinary copper and neurobehavioral disturbances that may interfere with acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission; however, trientine dihydrochloride-encapsulated nanoparticles can reverse deficiencies caused by chronic copper intoxication to a great extent in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Prasad, R.;Thapa, B.

1630,Presentation of Wilson's disease in Pakistan: a tertiary care hospital experience in Karachi Pakistan,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, with an average worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people. Data on WD from Pakistan are not available, therefore we aim to determine the pattern of WD in the Pakistani population and wish to compare it with the international literature. Methods: Cross-sectional study from 1985 to 2010, conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi. Results: 47 patients were attended, 32 (68.1%) male with a mean age (SD) of 26.6 (9.97) years. The most common mode of presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%) then neurological; 17 (36.2%) and the rest presented psychiatric symptoms 8 (17%). Patients with psychiatric symptoms had an earlier onset of WD at a mean age of 18.8 +/- 3.3 years. Mean ceruloplasmin levels were 0.17 (0.13) and were reduced (<0.25 g/dl) in 39 (86.6%). Serum (Cu) was reduced by 32 (68.1%). The 24-hour urinary Cu increased in only 22 (47.6%). Slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings was performed in 15 (31.9%) patients, and only 9 (60%) patients had KF rings. Of these 9 patients with a positive KF ring, 8 (88.8%) had neurological disease. The mean ratio (AST)/(ALT) was 1.92 and the median ALP/T. The bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05, 166.50). Thirty-one (65.4%) patients received a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc (Zn), 11 (23.1%) patients received D-penicillamine alone, and only 5 (11.5%) received Zn alone. Only one patient who presented decompensated liver disease underwent liver transplantation. Conclusion: Patients with WD present slightly later in adulthood in our population and hepatic presentation is the most common. The presentation of the disease and the biochemical parameters in Pakistan are not different from those in the rest of the world. WD should be suspected in patients who have unexplained abnormal liver function tests and who have a positive family history of liver disease.",,"Parkash, O.;Ayub, A.;Jafri, W.;Alishah, H.;Hamid, S.",2012,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12006,0,1,
1631,Common metabolic liver diseases in children: Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, was first described by a neurologist, Dr. Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson, in 1912. The estimated worldwide prevalence is 1 to 30,000-40,000 live births. Although the common age of onset is between childhood and young adulthood, there have been case reports of extreme WD in a 2-year-old girl and a 72-year-old woman with hepatomegaly and neurologic disability, respectively. Clinical manifestations are significantly variable and include liver disease, neurological disorders, and psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms are usually indistinguishable from other common illnesses. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to guide clinicians to begin appropriate investigation and timely treatment in this disease associated with a treatable fatal outcome. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to a reduction in hepatic copper excretion, associated with oxidative stress-induced cell damage in several organs. Numerous mutations have been discovered since 1993. Despite the definitive diagnosis made from genetic analysis, its routine application has not been widely used due to the length of the gene and numerous mutations. WD is therefore practically diagnosed by a typical clinical setting with/or without a Kaser-Fleischer ring and some supporting labs including low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.2 g/l), high 24-hour urinary copper (> 100 ug/day) and high hepatic copper content (>250 mug/g dry weight). Liver transplantation is the last treatment option in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. However, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent and reverse the fatal outcome. Copper chelating agents, penicillamine and/or trientine, have been used, with some limitations regarding their side effects. There is evidence that penicillamine can impair neurological function; where tetrathiomolybdate and zinc may be good alternatives. The efficacy and safety of zinc therapy has been proven not only in symptomatic patients, but also in presymptomatic and pregnant patients.",,"Ukarapol, N.",2012,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12005,0,0,
1632,Prospective pilot study of a single daily dose of trientine for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) requires lifelong medical treatment. Patients who frequently miss doses of their medications may develop liver failure, neurological or psychiatric disease. Current therapy for WD is with chelating agents or zinc salts given in divided doses. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine whether once-daily administration of trientine is an effective maintenance therapy for WD and improves patient adherence to treatment. Methods: The study group included seven male and 1 female patients aged 22 to 71 years with stable disease. Patients were treated for their WD from 4 to 50 years. Presentations of WD included asymptomatic detection by family screening (n=1), incidental Kayser-Fleischer rings (n=1), neuropsychiatric and then liver disease (n=1), and primary liver disease (n=5). Previous treatments were zinc acetate (n=2), d-penicillamine (n=1) and trientine (n=5). After monitoring their previous medications for 3 months, patients were treated with a single daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg) based on weight. Close treatment follow-up included clinical examination, blood counts, and biochemical tests. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, all patients were clinically well and their clinical examinations remained stable throughout the study period. There were no treatment interruptions due to elevated transaminases or side effects. There was no evidence of significant fluctuations in blood counts. Urinary copper excretion increased in patients taking zinc but was relatively unchanged in patients previously taking d-penicillamine or trientine. The mean 24-hour urine copper and zinc excretion at the end of treatment were 313.4 +/- 191.7 and 2214 +/- 1346 micrograms, respectively. The results of patient questionnaires at the end of the study reported by all individuals in the study group indicated that one of the main advantages of trientine administered in a daily dose was the convenience of not having to schedule the doses at the recommended dose. an hour before or two hours before. after meals throughout the day. These patients reported that this regimen had improved their adherence to treatment, two of whom were missing more than 5 doses one week prior to the study. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily trientine is an effective maintenance therapy for WD and improves lifelong adherence to medical therapy. Longer-term follow-up will establish the safety and treatment efficacy of this once-daily treatment regimen for WD.",,"Ala, A.;Aliu, E.;Schilsky, M.

1633,Long-term outcome of a large cohort of patients with Wilson's disease in Austria.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder due to impaired hepatic excretion of copper resulting in accumulation of copper in the liver and many other organs. Limited data are available on the long-term outcome of patients with WD. In Austria, 223 patients (2.77/100,000 population) were diagnosed with WD between 1961 and 2011. One patient moved abroad and could not be located. Methods: All 165 living patients or their treating physicians were contacted for information on their current status in 2011. No data were obtained in 56 patients. In these patients, information on their survival status was obtained from the Austrian Statistical Office (Statistik Austria, Vienna). The median observation period was 14.4 years (range: 0.5-49), total: 3028 patient-years. Results: The follow-up study included 222 patients (115 women/107 men; presentation: hepatic: 133; neurological: 57, asymptomatic 22; age at symptom onset 22.3+/-12.3 [range: 2-61] years). 16 patients (7.2%) died during the observation period (in 12 patients death was related to WD - 7 hepatic decompensation, 3 after liver transplantation (LTX), 1 accident with neurological deterioration, 1 suicide). 28 (12.6%) patients required LTX (8 fulminant WD, 19 end-stage liver disease, 1 neurological worsening). LTX was performed a few months after diagnosis; only 3 patients underwent LTX several years after diagnosis (despite good treatment compliance). Overall survival was 92% after 20 years, slightly worse than that of the age-adjusted Austrian population (97%). The survival of patients living 10 years after diagnosis was not different from the healthy cohort. 96 vs. 99%). 41 (18.4%) fully recovered and 38 (17.1%) patients improved after initiation of therapy (d-pecylamine or trientine). Most of the remaining patients were stable, only 7 worsened (3.2%) despite medical treatment. Clinical follow-up was not obtained in 45 patients. Conclusion: WD is associated with severe, often fatal, liver disease. 12.6% require liver transplant. If patients survive 10 years after initiation of treatment (medical or transplant), their long-term prognosis in terms of survival and clinical status is excellent. Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are mandatory to further improve survival and decrease the need for transplantation.",,"Beinhardt, S.;Leiss, W.;Graziadei, I.;Stauber, R.

1634,Wilson's disease: changes in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease,"Hepatic methionine metabolism may play an essential role in the regulation of methylation status and liver injury in Wilson's disease (WD) through the inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) by copper (Cu) and the consequent accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a potent inhibitor of methylation reactions. Methods: We studied the transcript levels of Sahh, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), SAH, DNA methyltransferase gene transcripts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b) and global hepatic DNA methylation in the toxic milk mouse (tx-j), an animal model. of WD and in control C3H mice. Tx-j mice (n=6-7/treatment group, male) received oral penicillamine in deionized water at 100 mg/kg bw/day from 12 to 24 weeks of age and, in separate experiments, tx-j mice j and C3H received methyl donor betaine supplemented at 1.5% in drinking water between 20 and 24 weeks of age to modulate inflammatory and methylation status, respectively. Global hepatic DNA methylation was assessed by dot blot analysis and immunostaining was used to detect and quantify 5-methylcytosine in hepatocyte nuclei. Results: In the untreated state, hepatic Sahh transcript and protein levels were reduced in 24-week-old tx-j mice (p<0.05) with a consequent increase in hepatic SAH levels (56.8+ /-13 vs. 33.4+/-8.5 nmol/g). ;p<0.05). Hepatic Cu accumulation in tx-j mice (259+/-104 vs. 7.2+/-1.5 ug/gdw, p<0.001) was associated with inflammation, as indicated by liver histology, elevated serum ALT (238+/-49 vs. 36 +/-14 U/L, p<0.001) and elevated levels of liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) transcript (changes of 2.9+/-1, 2 vs -0.56+/-1.4 fold, p<0.05). Dnmt3b was downregulated in tx-j mice along with global DNA hypomethylation (about 10% reduction compared to C3H mice). Cu chelation treatment of tx-j mice with penicillamine reduced Tnf-alpha and ALT levels, betaine treatment increased SAM, downregulated Dnmt3b levels, and both treatments elevated DNA methylation in tx-j to levels. of control. Immunostaining for 5-methylcytosine showed a diffuse and less intense nuclear pattern of staining in nuclei of hepatocytes from tx-j mice (p<0.01). Conclusion: Reduced hepatic Sahh expression was associated with increased hepatic SAH levels in the tx-j model of WD, with consequent global DNA hypomethylation. Higher overall DNA methylation was achieved by ameliorating inflammation by Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We propose that increased SAH levels and inflammation affect the widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD.",,"Medici, V.;Kharbanda, K. K.;Woods, R.;LaSalle, J.

1635,Controversies in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease in children - Results of an international survey,"Introduction: In rare pediatric metabolic diseases, insufficient evidence to guide management can lead to variations in care. The goal of this study is to determine the consensus and variation in the way that pediatric hepatologists (PH) diagnose and treat patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: PH, either members of the AASLD Pediatric Liver Special Interest Group or ESPGHAN, were invited to participate in this international web-based survey. Results: Participation was 43% (108 respondents, 253 invitations). The majority (64%) regularly see 1 to 10 patients with ED and 30% see >=11. Publications by Roberts and Schilsky (Hepatology 2008) and Ferenci et al. (Liver Int. 2003) were preferentially used as guides (65% and 21%, respectively). Interpretation and use of laboratory data were variable. While for 90%, baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) >0.6 mumol (40 Âµg)/24 h indicated the need for further investigation, the definition of normal liver copper content (LCC) varied (25% interpreted 50 Âµg/g and 56% 250mug/g as pathological). Genetic testing is performed on all patients in 48% and not performed at all in 13% of suspected WD cases, although tests are commercially available. Regardless of disease severity, in patients from previously unaffected families, serum ceruloplasmin (CER), CSU, and LCC were the diagnostic tools of choice. However, once the genotype of an index patient was known, DNA analysis was one of the three preferred methods (80%). Although not preferred, penicillamine (PEN) challenge was applied similarly in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (20% and 26%). The screening of a child of a person with WD, according to CER, CSU and genetic tests, was chosen by 76%. The use of a low-copper diet was judged variously: 45% recommend indefinitely, 33% temporary, and 12% recommend no diet at all. The drug of choice for primary therapy varied significantly. Zinc monotherapy was preferred in an affected 4-year-old brother of a WD patient with elevated aminotransferases (43%). In older patients, PEN and trientine were equally preferred, but PEN was rejected by 51% of North Americans versus 7% of respondents from other countries. The concepts about the management of a patient with WD with acute liver failure (ALF) varied. Binding agents were chosen by 52% and transplantation by 15% as primary treatment. Follow-up by disease severity score while medical therapy is applied is the most accepted approach. However, 23% reported monitoring alone, not choosing chelation therapy or an alternative. Conclusions: The approach to diagnosing and treating WD in children due to PH is clearly variable. The reasons for these differences in clinical practice are not entirely clear, but are likely to include regional variations.",,"Piersma, F. E.;Tanner, S.;Socha, P.;Roberts, E. A.;Shneider, B.

1636,Wilson's disease in Oman: a study of neurological manifestations and delay in diagnosis in a University Teaching Hospital,"Background: There are no comprehensive clinical descriptions of Wilson's disease [WD, an autosomal recessive disorder (OMIM 277900) of copper transport] in Oman, where there is a high frequency of consanguineous marriages. Objective: To study the neurological, demographic and imaging profiles of WD cases in Oman and determine the time delay in diagnosis. Design and methods: The clinical features and MRI findings of WD cases (attending the Neurology service, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman) were retrieved from electronic patient records. Patients were also contacted by telephone to find out their family history and the time it took to diagnose. Results: We studied a total of 22 cases (13 men and 9 women) from 4 different Omani families. 9 subjects from these families had neurological manifestations, with a mean age of onset of symptoms of 18 years (range: 12-24). These subjects demonstrated various combinations and severity of dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, pyramidal signs, and affective disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in basal ganglia signal in those with persistent neurological deficits (n=4). The median delay in diagnosis was 3 months (range: 0-16 months). Maintenance treatment included penicillamine (n= 3), trientine (n= 4), and zinc sulfate (n= 2). A recent genetic study of one of the 4 families revealed a novel homozygous splice site mutation (C.2866-2A>G) upstream of exon 13 in the ATP 7B copper transporter gene. Conclusions: Dystonia is the prominent neurological phenotype of WD in Oman.

1637,"A novel and unexpected antioxidant activity for penicillamine, a classic copper chelating agent for the treatment of Wilson's disease","Penicillamine (beta, beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been widely used clinically as a copper-chelating aminothiol drug for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provided marked protection against cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a major toxic metabolite of pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative, whereas other classical copper chelating agents, such as batocuproin disulfonate, they do not. The autoxidation process of TCHQ producing the reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone radical (TCSQ*<sup>-</sup>) was studied by ESR and UV-visible spectral methods. We found, unexpectedly, that the formation of the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical was significantly inhibited and that the autoxidation process of TCHQ was markedly delayed by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no such effects were seen with the classical copper chelating agent or with penicillamine disulfide, the oxidized form of penicillamine. ESR and HPLC-MS studies showed that the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical was mainly reduced to TCHQ by penicillamine, which was at the same time oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that the protective effects of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity were not due to its binding to copper, but to its effective inhibition of TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> reactive radical formation through a unusual redox pathway. This is the first report demonstrating an unexpected new antioxidant activity for this copper-chelating drug, which could be highly relevant to the biological activities of penicillamine.",,"Zhu, B.

1638,Wilson's disease in France: follow-up of a cohort of 395 patients,"Background: One of the priorities of the French National Reference Center (FNRC) for Wilson's Disease (WD), labeled at the end of 2005, is to improve the epidemiological knowledge of this rare disease. The goal of the database for WD is to better define the different profiles that may evoke the diagnosis and to learn more about the course of the disease. Methods: Demographic, clinical, biological, radiological and therapeutic data of the 395 patients (1 to 77 years old) in the two reference centers (AP-HP and Lyon) and the 6 centers of competence (Besanon, Lille, Aix/Marseille). , Toulouse, Bordeaux and Rennes) of the FNRC for WD at the time of diagnosis and/or during follow-up. Results: The diagnosis has been established most of the time after neurological symptoms (33%), mean age of 23 years, or liver symptoms (34%) or with family screening (20%). Genetic research was not significant for 16% of the families. D-penicillamine has been the initial treatment for 85% of patients and is still prescribed after 15 years of follow-up for 44% of cases. The median causes of death are liver failure, infections, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of patients with WD. However, it covers only around 1/3 of French patients. To improve the registration of patients with WD in the database, either at the time of diagnosis or during follow-up, the coordination of all health professionals with a multidisciplinary approach should be encouraged. The French registry contributes greatly to the Eurowilson database due to the number of patients included and followed up.",,"Girardot-Tinant, N.;Trocello, J.

1639,Negative Coomb hemolytic anemia and liver disease: a case of Wilson's disease,"Purpose: A 45-year-old black woman presented with yellow eyes, epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting, and dark urine that began after undergoing a dilation and curettage with hysteroscopy 3 weeks earlier. He was found to have stable vital signs. There was scleral jaundice and conjunctival pallor. He had mild epigastric tenderness without rebound or protection. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, macrocytic anemia, coagulopathy, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia, and a markedly low alkaline phosphatase. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or dilatation of the common bile duct. Empirical antibiotics were administered and a transjugular liver biopsy was performed. Additional labs sent showed a cerruloplasmin of 6.7 g/dL and verified Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia. She was evaluated for a liver transplant, but was put on hold due to a possible pelvic infection. A 24-hour urine sample was sent for suspected Wilson's disease. However, his condition rapidly deteriorated before the diagnosis was confirmed and he was started empirically on penicillamine 250 mg PO Q6h, vitamin B6 25 mg PO daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg PO TID, and N-acetylcysteine IV. Pretreatment 24-hour urine copper was found to be 4056 cups. Based on his acute liver failure, markedly low alkaline phosphatase, low cerruloplasmin, negative Coomb hemolytic anemia, elevated urinary copper, and positive rubeanic acid stain, a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. As no pelvic infection was found, she was listed for liver transplantation. Bottom Line: Wilson's disease leads to copper buildup that affects multiple organ systems, including the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. Diagnosis can be made by the presence of 2 of the following: positive family history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, negative Coombs hemolytic anemia, low levels of total serum copper and ceruloplasmin, elevated liver copper, and elevated 24-hour urine copper . When Wilson's disease presents as acute liver failure, the goal of therapy is to induce negative copper balance through promotion of urinary copper excretion and removal of tissue copper using copper chelators. Liver transplantation is indicated in cases of acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease when medical treatment options fail.

1641,Altered copper homeostasis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Purpose: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common monogenetic inherited heart disorder, characterized by increased ventricular wall thickness, myocyte disorder, and myocardial fibrosis. Recently, HCM has been associated with increased oxidative stress, which in turn has the potential to perpetuate myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Myocardial copper and zinc imbalance is a major source of oxidative stress and has been shown to cause hypertrophic forms of cardiomyopathy in animal models. Furthermore, excess copper plays a key role in Wilson's disease, an important differential diagnosis for HCM. Copper chelation therapy in Wilson's disease has recently been shown to reverse LVH and organ fibrosis in several animal and human disease models with type 2 diabetes. Surprisingly, there are no published data on copper homeostasis in patients with HCM. We investigated whether HCM patients have overt abnormalities in copper and zinc homeostasis. Methods: With ethical approval, we compared 20 randomly selected HCM patients from our local database with 18 matched healthy volunteers. Each participant provided 24-hour fasting urine and serum samples that were analyzed for copper/ceruloplasmin/zinc using the highly sensitive and extensively validated technique of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: HCM patients exhibited significantly higher levels of serum copper and serum ceruloplasmin (Table 1). Serum zinc showed a higher trend in healthy volunteers compared to HCM patients. There were no significant differences in urinary zinc or copper between the two groups. (Table presented) Conclusion: HCM patients exhibit overtly impaired copper homeostasis. Together with the previous observation of LVH and regression of fibrosis induced by copper chelation therapy, these findings provide a mechanistic basis for testing copper chelation therapy in HCM.",,"Potluri, R.;Roberts, N.;Miller, C.;Brooks, N.;Ray, S.;Cooper, G.;Schmitt, M.",2012,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehs283,0,0,

On admission, he presented hyperthermia of up to 39 rms; C. After seizure control with diazepam and levetiracetam infusions, the patient presented with severe episodes of dystonia in the face and left arm and leg. An elevated serum creatine phosphokinase level was documented. The symptoms were resistant to conventional medication.

1643,A case of fulminant Wilson's disease: effect of plasmapheresis,"Background/Case Studies: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of dysfunctional copper transport that results in copper deposition in tissues, including the liver, kidneys, brain, and cornea. Rarely, patients present with fulminant Wilson's disease (fWD) in which fulminant hepatic failure, DAT-negative hemolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) lead to rapid clinical deterioration and are almost always fatal without liver transplantation. liver. Although therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been recommended for fWD, the level of evidence is very low with only a few case reports available to address the efficacy of TPE. Here we report a case of fWD with successful liver transplantation after daily TPE. Study Design/Methods: A 21-year-old woman presented with a 1-day history of dark-colored urine, jaundice, and fatigue. Physical examination and laboratory values showed liver failure, DAT-negative hemolysis, Keyser-Fleischer rings, ceruloplasmin <4 mg/dL, AST greater than ALT (123 and 40 IU/L, respectively), and urinary copper level of 24 hours of 4703 mug . fWD was diagnosed and trientine and zinc acetate were started on day 1 of hospital admission. The patient also received 6 units of plasma for coagulopathy. Beginning on day 2, the patient received a daily plasma volume exchange with plasma as replacement fluid. No additional plasma was required after starting daily TPE except on day 4. Renal function began to deteriorate from day 2 and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started on day 4 after TPE # 3. Patient received daily red blood cell transfusions on days 1 through 4 (a total of 7 units) for anemia due to intravascular hemolysis. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed on day 6. Serum copper levels were measured in blood samples drawn on admission and after final TPE. Medical records were reviewed to assess clinical response to treatment. Results/Findings: The serum copper level at admission and after 4 consecutive daily TPE and 29 hours CRRT in addition to medications was 200 and 140 Âµg/dl, respectively. Hemoglobin was 7.3 g/dl on admission, 7.7 to 9.1 g/dl on days 2 to 4 with daily red blood cell transfusions, then 8.5 to 9.0 g/dl on on day 5. INR was maintained between 2.0 and 3.5 with TPE. Histology of the explanted liver showed cirrhosis with a very small amount of stainable copper in the periseptal hepatocytes, and genetic analysis showed a heterozygous mutation of ATP7B (p.Q111X). Conclusion: Hemolysis continued during treatment with TPE alone, but improved with the addition of CRRT. However, TPE was an effective method of stabilizing coagulopathy without increasing blood volume. Although serum copper was decreased, it is unclear how much copper was removed by TPE versus CRRT. Our case suggests that TPE alone is effective in stabilizing coagulopathy, but a combination of TPE with CRRT may be more effective in stabilizing intravascular hemolysis in fWD.",,"Choi, E.

1644,Altered Expression of Metabolic Nuclear Receptor Target Genes in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> Mice (Wilson's Disease Mouse),"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7b) and results in excessive accumulation of hepatic copper and often leads to liver failure. The Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse animal model has increased liver copper levels similar to those in Wilson's disease patients, as well as increased nuclear copper concentrations. Previous studies have shown that copper has a high affinity for the estrogen receptor DNA-binding domain (ER-DBD), and incubation of ER-DBD with copper results in loss of ER binding to ER-DBD elements. response. We hypothesize that elevated liver copper concentrations result in decreased nuclear receptor activation due to disruption of zinc binding to DNA-DBD of nuclear receptors. In vitro translation of RXR with 4-40 ÂµM copper (CuSO4) resulted in complete loss of FXR:RXR binding to short heterodimeric associated protein (SHP) and bile salt export pump promoters ( Bsep, canalicular bile acid transporter), and the addition of 40 ÂµM zinc (ZnSO4) to the reaction restored binding to the SHP and BSEP promoters. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 5 mM CuSO4 decreased chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated activation of BSEP mRNA expression. In Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6, 12, and 16-20 weeks, Bsep and SHP mRNA expression decreased by 40% and 40-20% along with decreased FXR binding to the mouse Bsep and SHP promoters in EMSA analysis. The mRNA expression of other nuclear receptor target genes was also decreased in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 6, 12 and 16-20 weeks: HNF4a (Na<sup>+</sup>- taurocholate carrier protein, basolateral bile salt transporter, decreased by 20%), LRH-1 (Cyp8b, required for cholic acid synthesis, decreased by 40%; Abcg8, canalicular cholesterol transporter, decreased by 20%) and TR ( Spot14, regulation of triglyceride stores, decreased 40 - 20%). HNF4a mRNA expression and RXR protein expression did not change in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Basal mRNA expression of the phase I enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10 was increased 2-fold (P = 0.057) in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but activation with the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) agonist ) TCPOBOP was higher. attenuated in knockout mice (20% Cyp3a11 and 10% Cyp2b10) relative to wild-type littermates.

1645,Immunological study of a child with generalized myasthenia gravis induced by D-penicillamine,"Objective: D-penicillamine (D-Pen) is known to be a cause of drug-induced myasthenia gravis (MG), but its etiology remains unclear. Recently, a reduction in regulatory T cells (Treg) has been reported in cases of non-drug-induced MG. We studied the immunological findings of a case with D-Pen-induced MG to clarify the pathogenesis of this disease. Design: Case report. A 12-year-old girl had been diagnosed with Wilson's disease when she was one year old and put on the D-Pen. He developed blepharoptosis and muscle weakness that varied daily, but not bulbar palsy. His anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab) antibody titer was extremely high (1520 nmol/L; normal range <0.04 nmol/L). A Harvey-Masland test showed a decrease, which improved with edrophonium administration. Therefore, he was diagnosed with D-Pen-induced generalized MG. D-Pen was discontinued and zinc acetate and pyridostigmine started to be used to treat Wilson's disease and MG, respectively. Although the patient's MG symptoms had disappeared 6 months later, her abnormally high anti-AChR-Ab titer persisted. She was treated with immunoadsorption therapy to reduce autoantibodies, followed by administration of immunosuppressants. We analyzed various immunological findings in our patient, including peripheral blood Treg count by flow cytometry based on intracellular CD4, CD25, and Foxp3 expression. There was no correlation between the anti-AChR-Ab titer and the patient's MG symptoms. Their mean CD4+/Treg lymphocyte expression levels (5.28+/-1.01%) were not significantly different from those of healthy controls.

Data on WD from Pakistan are not available, therefore we aim to determine the pattern of WD in the Pakistani population and wish to compare it with the international literature. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi. Results: A total of 47 patients attended, 32 (68.1%) were men. The mean age (SD) was 26.6 (9.97) years. The most common presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%), neurological; 17 (36.2%) and the rest 8 (17%) presented psychiatric symptoms. Ceruloplasmin levels were reduced (<0.25 g/dl) in 39 (86.6%), serum Cu was reduced in 32 (68.1%). The 24-h urinary Cu increased in only 22 (47.6%). Slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings was performed in 15 (31.9%) patients and only 9 (60%) had KF rings. Of these 9 patients with a positive KF ring, 8 (88.8%) had neurological disease. The mean AST/ALT ratio was 1.92 and the median Alkaline Phosphatase/Total Bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05, 166.50). 31 (65.4%) patients received a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc (Zn), 11 (23.1%) received D-penicillamine alone, and only 5 (11.5%) received Zn alone. Only one patient with decompensated liver disease underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Patients with WD present a little later in adulthood in our population and hepatic presentation is the most frequent. The presentation of the disease and the biochemical parameters in Pakistan are not different from those in the rest of the world.",,"Parkash, O.;Ayub, A.;Jafri, W.;Alsihah, S.

1647,Lesions in the cerebral cortex and white matter in Wilson's disease,"Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and imaging findings in Wilson's disease (WD) with lesions in the cerebral cortex and white matter. Background: The cerebral cortex and white matter eventually become involved in WD patients during the long course of the disease. Occasionally, however, brain symptoms such as seizures are the initial symptoms with prominent brain lesions. In those cases, the diagnosis of WD is difficult and the clinical course may be different from that of usual cases of WD. Methods: We selected patients with WD who initially presented brain lesions in our department from 1964 to 2011, two patients presented cortico-subcortical lesions. We analyze the clinical characteristics and evolution of these patients. Results: Two patients out of 17 WD patients in our department had brain lesions. case 1: a 22-year-old man) initially presented with a progressive gait disturbance, hand tremor, and psychiatric disturbances. Brain MRI showed high T2-weighted signal in the white matter of bilateral frontal lobes (Rt > Lt) and basal ganglia, and the cortex of the frontal lobes is enhanced with gadolinium. FDG-PET showed accumulation in the cortico-subcortical lesions of the right frontal lobe, which first led to suspicion of a tumor diagnosis. However, the possibility of WE was considered based on high echoic abnormalities in the liver. The mutation in ATB7B (c.2304insC) provided a definitive diagnosis of WD. He was treated with trientine. However, her clinical symptoms and MR imaging exacerbated within 2 months. Therefore, zinc acetate was given second. After that, her clinical symptoms did not change. Case 2: A 20-year-old man initially complained of stuttering, hand tremor, and euphoric mood for 6 years. Brain CT revealed areas of low density in the left frontal lobe. He was treated with D-penicillamine. After 3 months, he developed seizures, and CT showed the left frontal lesion to be more extensive. Conclusions: Previously, brain injury was reported to occur in 25% of WD patients during the clinical course. In our department, around 10% of the patients initially presented brain lesions. In such patients, the diagnosis of WD was difficult and chelate treatment is ineffective. We must take into account the possibility of WE in patients with tremor and psychiatric disorders, or even with a prominent brain lesion that affects the basal ganglia.",,"Tanaka, N.;Hanajima, R.;Terao, Y.;Goto, J.;Tsuji, S.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1648,Myeloneuropathy secondary to excessive copper removal in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Case report. Background: Treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) focuses on removing excess copper from the body and preventing it from accumulating again. Paradoxically, there have been reports of neuropathy and myeloneuropathy secondary to copper deficiency induced by excessive removal. Methods: Case report. Results: 36-year-old male patient with WD diagnosed at 20 years of age. The main clinical picture was characterized by generalized dystonia, bradykinesia, hyperreflexia, bilateral Babinski's sign, and frozen gait. He was admitted to our department due to worsening of gait instability, with frequent falls and numbness of the hands and feet, with a 6-month history. She presented hypoaesthesia in pain with distribution of socks and gloves, postural and vibratory hypoaesthesia of the lower limbs, gait ataxia and frostbite. Neuroaxis MRI detected a bilateral T2 WI hyperintensity with no corresponding abnormal signal on T1, involving a long segment of the posterior dorsal column. There was no contrast enhancement on post-gadolinium images and no spinal cord expansion. Lenticulocaudate copper deposits and putamengliosis were also observed. Electromyography showed a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Analytical studies revealed serum copper 10.2 mg/dL (69.9-152.5), urinary copper 0.64 mumol/24h (0.78), serum zinc 14.7 mumol/L (12-20), Hb 8.2 g/dL, Leukocytes 10.63x109/L, Platelets 624x109/L. Alternative causes of myelopathy and polyneuropathy were excluded. A causal relationship between copper deficiency and myeloneuropathy was classified as probable. Trientine (500 mg/d) and zinc sulfate (330 mg/d) were discontinued, and zinc acetate 100 mg/d was started. After 3 months of follow-up, a slight clinical recovery was documented. Conclusions: This case warns about the neurological consequences of excessive copper spoliation during prolonged WD treatment. Symptoms of myeloneuropathy can mimic the manifestations of progressive WD, with worsening postural instability and impaired gait. Knowledge of the risks associated with removing excess copper associated with more frequent monitoring of copper levels can prevent this complication.",,"Teodoro, T.;Neutel, D.;Geraldo, F.;Rosa, M.

1649,Restless legs syndrome induced by chelation therapy in Wilson's disease: a new complication after liver transplantation,"Objective: To describe a novel side effect of copper chelation therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease after liver transplantation. Background: A 52-year-old man with genetically confirmed Wilson's disease began D-penicillamine therapy as an adolescent. He tolerated copper chelation well, but developed decompensated liver disease and required a transplant. After liver transplant surgery, chelation therapy was discontinued. Ten months after transplantation, he presented with progressive dysarthria, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity. D-penicillamine therapy was resumed. Methods: Serial biochemical results were collected from various hospitals attended by the patient. The stoichiometry of penicillamine-transition metal reactions and the dissociation constants of these reactions were reviewed. Results: After liver transplantation, the biochemical abnormalities associated with Wilson's disease normalize. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms have a variable outcome. In this case, chelation was resumed due to progressive neurological symptoms, but in a patient with essentially normal copper biochemistry. Copper is preferentially excreted by D-penicillamine in Wilson's disease, as these patients are copper-laden. As the mass of copper decreases, other transition metals that have a lower affinity constant but are in relatively higher abundance than copper will be excreted. In this patient, iron deficiency developed in concert with reintroduction of D-penicillamine treatment, resulting in disabling restless legs syndrome. Conclusions: The use of chelating agents in Wilson's patients after liver transplantation may lead to transition metal deficiencies. This arises when copper levels normalize and the reaction dissociation constant is unchanged. This is the first report of penicillamine-induced restless legs syndrome in a patient with Wilson's disease.",,"O'Brien, M.;Counihan, T.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1650,Epilepsy in Wilson's disease (WD),"Objective: To evaluate WD patients with epilepsy. Background: WD is a treatable autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation and copper toxicity that has protein manifestations primarily involving the brain and liver. Neurologically it manifests as a movement disorder, with speech abnormalities, tremors, incoordination and dystonia as common features. Epilepsy is not a common presentation of WD. Methods: 31 patients with WD were evaluated and 6 of them were found to have epilepsy. These patients underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG), in addition to a detailed history, general and neurological examination, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea, biochemical and routine copper studies (serum ceruloplasmin, urinary copper of 24 hours and serum copper) and neuroimaging. Results: Of the 6 (19.4%) patients with epilepsy, 4 (66.7%) were male and the rest were female. 4 (66.7%) patients were in the juvenile group (<=18 years) while another 2 (33.3%) were in the adult group (>=18 years). The 4 juvenile patients had predominantly dystonic features and the 2 adult patients had both neurological and psychiatric features. 4 (66.7%) patients had complex partial seizures with secondary generalization while 2 (33.3%) had generalized seizures. 1 (16.7%) patient also had occasional myoclonic spasms. EEG was abnormal in all 6 patients with theta background, and both focal and generalized discharges were observed. In 4 (66.7%) patients the seizures started before starting decoppering therapy while in 2 patients they started later. All patients responded well to antiepileptics. The response of WD itself to treatment was more variable with 2 (33.3%) patients showing improvement, 3 (50%) patients showing initial deterioration with slight improvement, and 1 (16.7%) patient deteriorating and dying. . Conclusions: The prevalence of epilepsy in our study is 19.4%. It is about 30 times higher than the prevalence of epilepsy in the general population and therefore unlikely to represent a chance relationship. It may result from direct copper toxicity (probably from membrane ATPase inhibition) or from pyridoxine deficiency during penicillamine use or from a metabolic encephalopathy-like state. Although the prognosis of epilepsy in WD is comparable to that of the general population, it is necessary to assess how much it affects the prognosis of WD in a larger series of such patients.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,1,
1651,Spectrum of movement disorders in Wilson's disease and their response to penicillamine treatment,"Objective: To report the spectrum of movement disorders in Wilson's disease (WD) and the predictors of response to penicillamine therapy. Background: Movement disorder is, although a dominant feature in neurological WD, there is a paucity of studies regarding its spectrum and response to penicillamine. Methods: Patients with consecutive neurological WD underwent a detailed medical history and clinical examination. The type, extent, and severity of movement disorders were recorded. A complete blood count, serum chemistry, ceruloplasmin, copper, urinary copper, abdominal ultrasound, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging were performed. WD severity assessed on a scale of 0-3. After penicillamine, patients were followed up at 3 months follow-up and were considered worse if there was > 1 degree of deterioration. Results: 67 patients with neurological WD were included whose median age was 13 (4-41) years and 14 were female. 63 patients had movement disorders; dystonia in 17, tremor in 2, and the rest dystonia associated with tremor in 21, myoclonus in 7, choreoathetosis in 11, and chorea and tremor in 5 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was abnormal in 79%; Eighty-seven percent had striatum involvement, and 56% had brainstem, thalamus, and globus pallidus involvement. At 3 months of treatment, 22 (32.8%) patients had neurological deterioration related to a family history of WD (p= 0.03), low leukocyte count (p= 0.03), chronic liver disease (CLD) in ultrasound (p= 0.008). of 38 patients with CLD, 19 (86.4%) patients had deterioration while 90% (26/29) patients without CLD had no deterioration. Disease duration (p=0.47), movement disorder severity (p=90), serum creatinine (P=0.97), albumin (p=0.87), bilirubin (p = 0.40), transaminase (p= 0.78), copper (p= 0.93), urinary copper (p= 0.70) and the number of lesions in MRI (p= 0.60) were not related to deterioration. Urinary copper excretion was significantly increased at 3 months compared to baseline in the impaired group than in those without impairment (mean 53.3 Vs - 3.2, p=0.005). Conclusions: Movement disorder is the presenting feature in 94% of patients with neurologic WD and 34% of patients deteriorate after penicillamine, especially those with a family history of WD, low white blood cell count, and liver disease. chronicle.",,"Kalita, J.;Chandra, S.;Kumar, V.;Misra, U.

1652,Speech behavior in Wilson's disease,"Objective: This study has analyzed the speech behavior of patients with Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease is described as autosomal recessive and is characterized by copper deposition mainly in the liver and central nervous system. Among the neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease, speech problems may occur, but they are poorly understood and described, which makes it difficult to develop efficient intervention procedures. Methods: Thirty patients who are diagnosed and treated at the Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 16 men and 14 women aged between 19 and 58 years, all under medical treatment (D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate) in varying doses. They were also subjected to speech therapy evaluation consisting of qualified auditory analysis of speech behavior perception. Results: The analysis showed 7 (seven) patients (23.2%) without speech alterations, 9 patients (30%) with anarthria and 14 patients (46.67%) with dysarthria. In this last group, 1 patient (3.33%) in low level, 8 patients (26.66%) in moderate level and 5 patients (16.66%) in accentuated level. Conclusions: These results suggest that there is no standard in the manifestation of the disease and that the clinical expression of speech is variable. Therefore, to improve the understanding of the various clinical forms, treatment and rehabilitation of Wilson's disease, systematic studies correlating clinical signs and symptoms with functional tests and laboratory and imaging tests are necessary.",,"Estevo, A.

1653,Analysis of smell in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Analysis of smell in patients with Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease, described by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease of copper metabolism. Affected individuals have excessive copper deposition in the liver which can be fatal if unrecognized due to faulty excretion of copper in the bile. Methods: The Sniffin' Sticks test (with 16 pens) was used to assess smell. The study analyzed 60 controls (24 women and 36 men, mean age 33.81 years) and 64 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease (29 women and 35 men, mean age 31.28 years). All patients with Wilson's disease are under medical treatment (Trientine, D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), 26 patients (13 women and 13 men) present only hepatic manifestation and 38 patients (16 women and 22 men) present hepatic manifestation and neurological. In the statistical analysis, the Right Fisher and Mann-Whitney tests were used. Results: Patients with Wilson's disease with only hepatic manifestation and patients with neurological manifestation are statistically similar, but there are differences for five variants (mint, banana, lemon, anise and fish) and for the variable Sniffin' Sticks Total between patients. with Wilson's disease and control. group. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the difference between patients with Wilson's disease and the control group in the identification of specific odors (mint, banana, lemon, anise and fish).",,"Carvalho, M.

1654,Wilson's disease: Follow-up studies in a cohort of 135 Wilson's neuropatients over more than a decade,"Objective: To characterize the presentation characteristics of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) and the response to treatment. Background: WD is an inherited metabolic disorder that mainly causes neuropsychiatric and liver dysfunction. Without treatment, it causes severe morbidity and fatal cases. Long-term clinical follow-up data is limited in the literature. Methods: 135 consecutive patients diagnosed as Neuro-WD in the Movement Disorders Clinic of an Indian tertiary care center (Bangur Institute of Neurology) were included. The study period was from June 1996 to December 2011. This is both a retrospective (28) and a prospective (107) study. The diagnosis of WD was made by the Sternlieb criteria. The KF ring was positive in all. Data were compiled in semi-structured pro forma. The treatment was with D-penicillamine and zinc salts. In addition, other medications were administered as required. The patients were followed up at regular intervals. Results: The mean age of appearance was 11.79 years; (men: women 584:51). The mean duration of the disease before diagnosis was 15.30 months. Family history of WD was present in 22.96%; consanguinity in 10.37%. The history of jaundice was present in 47.41%; liver disease in 44.44%. The presentation characteristics were: dysarthria- 90.44%, parkinsonism- 81.62%, dystonia- 90.4%, tremors- 51.11%, choreo-athetosis in 11.85%, ataxia- 11.76%, sialorrhea- 77.21%, dysphagia- 55.88%, seizures- 17.16%, psychiatric- 62.31%; arthralgia/arthritis- 3.7%, myopathy- 7.5%, amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea- 7.5%, darkening of skin color- 11.6%, bleeding disorders- 7%. The mean time to improvement was 7.11 months. 14.58% of the patients worsened initially with D-penicillamine that did not recur when restarting the drug at lower doses. Dysarthria and residual dystonia were the most common residual deficits (86% and 90.4%, respectively). Behavioral abnormalities often worsened even though physical symptoms improved. The KF ring disappeared in 7.40% and urine copper levels normalized in 11.11%. 33.33% of the patients were fraudsters, at least once. 7,407% were free of symptoms; 15.55% had residual symptoms but had significant employment; 25.92%- had symptoms but could do ADLs; 24.44%- partially dependent; and 16.30%-severely dependent. Mortality was 10.37%. Conclusions: Dystonia and dysarthria were the most frequent characteristics. Early treatment leads to better results. Treatment must be individualized. The lack of drug use quickly worsened.",,"Bagchi, M.;Das, S. K.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,1,
1655,Patients with free copper toxicosis in Wilson's disease should be treated with zinc early.,"Objective: To make known that (1) Wilson's disease (WD) is not a suitable name for free copper toxicosis that is treatable (2) zinc is a suitable option for the treatment of copper toxicosis. Background: Patients with WD have been treated abusively with chelators, whose objective is the excretion of accumulated copper. It has taken 50 years for it to be generally accepted that chelators are unscientific and irrational. On the contrary, zinc reduces the intestinal absorption of copper, which reduces copper poisoning. Fundamentally, it is impossible to conduct comparative clinical trials for a rare disease. Accordingly, it must be learned from case reports and proven theories based on expert opinion. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study as the best available method in three cases with free copper intoxication in WD treated with zinc monotherapy: (1) a 12-year-old boy with hypokinesia, dysarthria, tremor, dystonia, and involuntary movements, (2) ) a 24-year-old girl with progressive tremor, gait disturbance and torticollis and (3) a seriously ill 10-year-old girl suddenly presented with hemolytic anemia indicated for liver transplantation. Although the second patient, initially presented with a decompensated hepatitis, had been treated with penicillamine for about 15 years, he recently worsened with neurological symptoms. Clinical status and biochemical parameters such as urine copper and liver function tests along with physical examination were frequently evaluated. Results: The first patient with neurological and degenerative symptoms improved significantly biochemically within a few months and also clinically within approximately 12 months with 150 mg zinc. The symptoms of the second patient particularly disappeared in about a month with 100 mg of zinc. The most surprising result was the third patient who needed an urgent liver transplant and was left off the list with only 2 weeks of zinc 125mg monotherapy with impressive clinical improvement. All were symptom free. Conclusions: The objective in the management of WD should be the prevention of free copper intoxication. Zinc is the treatment of choice to treat free copper poisoning in WD from the beginning, which should have an educational value for doctors to treat patients through proven evidence and not based on pseudoscientific theses based on experts .",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.;Kianifar, H.;Hoogenraad, T.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1656,Atypical and generalized elastosis perforans serpiginosa,"Introduction and objectives. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare skin disease in which there is a transepithelial elimination of connective tissue elements such as the elastic fibers of the papillary dermis. There are three different types of this disease: idiopathic, reactive, and drug-induced. Reactive forms are associated with other diseases such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, scleroderma, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The drug-induced form is seen in about 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. This drug is used in conditions such as Wilson's disease and homocystinuria. The most common clinical presentation is small keratotic papules that usually affect the face, neck, trunk, and upper limbs. For the treatment of this disease, topical retinoids, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors and different types of lasers have been used with variable response rates. (Featured Figure) We present the case of a 16-year-old male with Down syndrome who presented an atypical and generalized case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa. Case report. A 16-year-old male with Down syndrome referred to our Department for presenting large plaques on the anterior face of both thighs. The plaques were erythematous with a depressed center and raised hyperkeratotic borders. No other skin lesions were observed. Skin biopsy of one of the edges showed acanthosis and transepithelial elimination of elastic fibers that stained positively with Orcein. These histological characteristics were compatible with the diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa. The patient was treated with topical betamethasone and calcipotriol without good response. Conclusions. We present a case of perforating elastosis serpiginosa in a 16-year-old male with Down syndrome. EPS usually affects children and young people, from 6 to 20 years old, and the lesions are located on the face, neck and arms. The clinical presentation in this child was generalized and atypical, with large erythematous plaques affecting the anterior part of both thighs, with no other lesions on the face or arms. The incidence of EPS in patients with Down syndrome is higher than in the general population. A possible explanation for this could be that patients with Down syndrome present an alteration in the connective tissue and elastic fibers such as premature aging of the skin and post-folliculitis anetoderma.

1657,Successful pregnancy outcome in a woman with Wilson's disease complicated by liver cirrhosis: a case report,"Objective: To report on the successful outcome of pregnancy in a woman with Wilson's disease, managed at a UK District General Hospital. Along with the case, a review of the literature is presented. Methods: Prospective follow-up of the index case throughout her pregnancy, delivery and puerperium. A retrospective review of the current evidence was performed using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Results: A 28-year-old primigravida with Wilson's disease diagnosed in her late teens presented to us at 14 weeks' gestation. He suffered from liver cirrhosis. Prior to conception, her disease was stable on zinc therapy, necessitating a switch to trientine at 20 weeks' gestation due to her iron deficiency, attributed in part to zinc therapy. A close multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, hematologists and hepatologists was carried out. Her pregnancy was initially complicated by several episodes of self-terminating epistaxis, which subsided by the third trimester. She had induction of labor for suspected obstetric cholestasis at 38 weeks' gestation and delivered a healthy male infant weighing 3014 g. The delivery was complicated by a major postpartum haemorrhage of 1500 ml, which was successfully managed. She recovered to her stable pre-pregnancy condition. Conclusions: This case serves to highlight the importance of appropriate use of the multidisciplinary team approach and utilization of limited resources in the management of a challenging medical disorder in pregnancy. It illustrates the difficulty of treatment during pregnancy and the fine line between overtreatment and undertreatment.

1658,Children with Wilson's disease: proton magnetic spectroscopy findings,"Background and objective: Neurological involvement is less common in pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) than in adults. Therefore, subclinical neurological involvement cannot be excluded. Brain spectroscopy (MRS) has been used as a tool to provide clinically useful metabolic information on neurological impairment in WD. The aim of our study was to determine brain metabolic changes due to WD using MRS in patients with mild liver disease, treated since childhood. Material and methods: Twenty-two patients (15 men) with an established diagnosis of WD (mean age at diagnosis 6.6 years, range 1.8-14.4) were recruited. The diagnosis of WD was established in the presence of at least two of the following characteristics: ceruloplasmin level <20 mg/dl, baseline urine copper level >100 mcg/24 hours, urine copper level after provocation test with penicillamine >1575 mcg/24 hours, copper level >250 mcg/g dry weight. All patients had mild liver disease at baseline, with subtle neurological signs in 8 cases (36.4%). All twenty-two patients were examined with MRS in the basal ganglia (BG), occipital cortex (POC), and frontal white matter (FWM). The ratio of the following metabolites relative to creatine (Cr) was calculated: N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and myo-inositol (mI). The mean width of the peak line in each spectrum was measured. At the time of the MRS evaluation, the mean duration of the disease was 13.7 years (range 2.1-24.1) and the mean age was 19.6 years (range 9.8-34.4). ). Results: The metabolic rates in MRS in our cohort were in the normal range. Compared with the group of patients with liver symptoms, the group with concomitant subtle neurological symptoms had not significantly decreased NAA/Cr ratio (GB: 82.7% vs. 89.6%; POC: 101.2% vs. 116 .6%; FWM: 89.1% vs. 86.2%) and increased mI/Cr ratio (GB: 26.9% vs. 22.7%; POC: 34.8% vs. 34.9 %; FWM: 46.4% vs. 42.9%) in the three areas studied. Conclusions: It is known that in adult patients with WD with neurological signs, changes in MRS are unequivocally associated with a reduction in the NAA/Cr ratio assigned to neuronal loss and an increase in the level of the mI/Cr ratio related to neuronal loss. gliosis and inflammation. The absence of reduced NAA/Cr levels and increased mI/Cr levels in our cohort seems to indicate that early therapy can prevent neuronal loss, gliosis, and inflammation in brain areas, also in children with subtle neurological signs at baseline. .",,"Ranucci, G.;Liccardo, D.;Puoti, G.;Di Dato, F.;Tufano, M.;Venturino, D.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960532-5,0,0,
1659,Pancreatic involvement in children with Wilson's disease on prolonged zinc therapy,"Background and objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder characterized by an accumulation of copper in various organs, especially the liver. The treatment is based on the use of copper and zinc chelators. In adult patients with WD treated with zinc, a frequent increase in serum amylase and lipase, without symptoms of pancreatitis, has been reported. The aim of our study was to evaluate pancreatic enzymes in children with WD on long-term zinc therapy. Material and methods: Forty-three patients with WD (28 men; mean age at diagnosis 6.1 years, range 1.1-20.9) were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were free of symptoms. The diagnosis of WD was established in the presence of at least two of the following characteristics: ceruloplasmin level <20 mg/dL, baseline urinary copper level (UCu) >100 mcg/24 hours, UCu after penicillamine challenge test >1575 mcg/24 hours, liver copper level >250 mcg/g dry weight. Thirty-two patients (24 men) on long-term (median duration 12 years, range 3-25) zinc therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc two or three times daily depending on body weight and age) were investigated. . Treatment compliance was assessed based on clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. In all patients, serum amylase and lipase levels were analyzed during the course of zinc therapy. Results: Twenty-seven patients (84%) maintained a normal ALT level with zinc therapy. Based on UCu excretion (37+/-2mcg/24h) at the end of follow-up, all patients had good adherence to therapy. Pancreatic serum levels were normal before the start of zinc therapy in all. Nine patients (28%) presented hyperamylasemia (219+/-44IU/L) and 7 (22%) hyperlipasemia (110+/-30IU/L) under treatment with zinc, without clinical and radiological signs of pancreatitis. Only one 24-year-old adolescent (3%) presented with an attack of symptomatic acute pancreatitis, with elevated levels of amylase and lipase (300IU/L and 220IU/L, respectively) after 78 months of zinc treatment. Other common causes of pancreatitis besides zinc were ruled out. Conclusions: This study confirms that also in childhood most patients with WD treated chronically with zinc have benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia. Contrary to previous reports, acute pancreatitis can occur.",,"Ranucci, G.;Tufano, M.;Liccardo, D.;Di Dato, F.;Puoti, G.;Salvatori, M.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960410-1,0,0,
1660,Long-term zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease with mild liver disease,"Background and objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism. In the pediatric age, most cases have a hepatic presentation. It is widely accepted that penicillamine is the first-choice therapy for children with liver disease, while zinc is indicated in presymptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of exclusive zinc monotherapy in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Material and methods: All patients with WD referred to our Pediatric Service for diagnostic investigation of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. The diagnosis of WD was established in the presence of at least two of the following characteristics: a low ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL), an increased urinary copper level (>100 mcg/24 hours), a urinary copper level increased after penicillamine challenge test (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), an increased liver copper level (>250 mcg/g dry weight). Among the 43 WD patients enrolled, 29 were treated with zinc for a median period of 12 years (range 3-25). Zinc was the initial therapy of choice in 12 cases. Normalization of serum ALT was the main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study. Treatment compliance was assessed based on clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Of 17 (58%) children treated with penicillamine as first option, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range, 4 to 48) and started zinc maintenance therapy. The remaining 13 patients (76%) with persistent hyper-ALT during penicillamine administration switched to zinc; nine of these (70%) normalized ALT with zinc within a median period of 9.5 months (range, 5 to 151). Eleven (92%) of 12 patients who received zinc alone as first option had ALT normalization over a median period of 14 months (range, 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT in zinc showed poor adherence to treatment. According to 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56+4 vs 37+2 mcg) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy in terms of decopperization was comparable in two groups. Conclusions: Although penicillamine therapy is generally used for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, the present study has shown that zinc monotherapy can be used, as first-line therapy, in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation. .",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Puoti, G.;Liccardo, D.;Tufano, M.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960278-3,0,1,
1661,Concomitant immune-mediated phenomenon in Wilson's disease: implications for monitoring chelation therapy,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first-line therapy for symptomatic patients. The development of chelator-induced immunological adverse events leading to impaired renal function or bone marrow depression is a concern, especially under d-pencylamine therapy. Based on some case reports, a predictive value for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) has been suggested in this setting. Objective: The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of coexisting or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in WD patients and to assess the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy control in a retrospective cohort study. Patients and Methods: A total of 222 WD patients in a European tertiary care center were retrospectively analyzed. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed for adverse events and course of antinuclear antibodies. Results: Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 153/222 (69.0%) and 71/222 (32.0%) patients, respectively. Confirmed coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 28/222 (12.6%) patients. Data on the course of ANA under treatment and conclusive data on adverse events were available for 91 treatments with D-penicillamine, 58 treatments with trientine, and 58 treatments with zinc salts. Within these treatments, an increase in ANA titers was observed in 16/91 (17.6%) patients in the d-penicillamine group, in 12/58 (20.7%) patients in the trientine group and in 7/58 (12.1%) patients in the zinc group (p=ns). Analysis of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation showed no correlation with a prior rise in ANA titers in all groups. Conclusion: In our cohort, ANA elevation was a frequent finding, but not related to the presentation of the disease and independent of the applied medical regimen. We did not observe a correlation between an increase in ANA and the development of related immune-mediated adverse events in all treatments. and especially in the d-penicillamine group. Therefore, the value of this parameter for monitoring adverse events appears to be clearly limited.",,"Seesle, J.;Gotthardt, D. N.;Merle, U.;Gohdes, A.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1662,Blisters from my surgery: Clinical history helped by photographs from the internet,"84 years old WF admitted in a subacute rehabilitation. to recover from a complication of a total knee arthroplasty. PMHx. consists of DM, HTN, anemia, HLD, CAD, COPD, CKD, anxiety, and hypothyroidism. After two weeks of successful rehabilitation, he developed blisters on his limbs and torso, with no other symptoms. When the blisters burst, they expel a clear fluid, then scab over and new blisters appear on other parts of your body. The patient was started on Prednisone while in the hospital, but no documentation was found as to why. With further questioning, he stated that he had blisters before and that the steroids usually made them better. Until then, since no documentation was found on his blisters, COPD exacerbations were the presumptive cause of his steroid treatments. After reviewing and taking into consideration that the patient is a woman over 60 years of age, with previous episodes of uncomplicated blisters, also that these blisters have responded to steroid treatment, and especially after comparing her lesions with those published online at Multiple Sites Our patient was diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and started on a prolonged taper of prednisone, after which she improved and was successfully discharged home. Discussion: Bullous pemphigoid is a fairly uncommon disease, but when it usually occurs in elderly women, it is a differential diagnosis to think about when blisters are present in the elderly, followed by pemphigus (a similar but less frequent bullous disease). common). The difference between the two is autoantibodies against intradermal epitopes in the latter versus subdermal autoantibodies in the former. Both have been linked to an increased risk of death, and that is why primary care geriatricians and anyone who cares for the elderly should be vigilant in diagnosing and treating bullous pemphigoid, treatment is primarily wound care (treating as a burn) and oral steroids. Recurrence is common and even longer steroid taper may be required. The etiology is not well understood, but an autoimmune response is known. The diagnosis is clinical.

1663,"Copper deficiency myeloneuropathy with hypozincemia due to zinc excess, gastrectomy, and low serum ceruloplasmin","Objective: We describe low serum zinc level in copper deficiency myeloneuropathy (CuDM) associated with excessive zinc intake and previous gastrectomy. Background Copper malabsorption occurs after gastrectomy or bariatric surgeries and can cause CuDM. The antagonistic relationship between copper and zinc is the basis for treating states of copper excess (eg Wilson's disease) with zinc supplementation. Excess zinc due to prolonged use of denture creams may be the cause of CuDM. Design/Methods: Case Report: An 83-year-old man developed progressive triple flexor spasms, severe sensory loss, and absent/decreased reflexes with Babinski's signs for 5 years after a gastrectomy 38 years earlier, using tin-based toothpaste. zinc (three weekly tubes) for 30 years and with hypoceruloplasminemia. Serum copper was 0.12 ug/mL (RI 0.75-1.45 mcg/mL), ceruloplasmin 4.0 mg/dL (RI 15-30 mg/dL), and serum zinc 0.58 ug. /mL (IR 0.66-1.0 mcg/mL). Results: Our patient had three causes of CuDM-hypocupremia, excessive zinc intake, and hypoceruloplasminemia. CuDM patients due to excessive zinc intake may have normal or elevated serum zinc levels (Nations 2008). Kumar et al. (Kumar 2004) noted hypozincemia in a patient after gastrectomy and poor absorption of copper. Gastrectomy, in addition to lowering serum copper levels, will also lower serum zinc. Our patient demonstrated low serum zinc levels from excessive zinc intake and was probably the result of his previous gastrectomy. Conclusions: Excessive zinc intake interferes with copper absorption and can result in CuDM. Our CuDM patient, related to previous gastrectomy, excessive zinc intake, and hypoceruloplasminemia, had a low serum zinc level. This likely reflected decreased zinc absorption due to his previous gastrectomy. Low serum zinc does not exclude CuDM.",,"Josiah, A.;Salomon, A.;Tacker, D.;Gutmann, L.",2012,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.78.1,0,0,
1664,Certain questions and our suggestions in the pharmacological treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of excessive accumulation of copper in the body. It is a very rare condition in Caucasian populations, but appears to be more common in the Chinese. Here we summarize our experience in the pharmacological treatment of the disease: (1) we selected different drugs of initial treatment for patients with different presentations. In general, we choose penicillamine for patients with mainly hepatic symptoms. Penicillamine should be avoided, or used with great caution, in patients with significant rigidity, drooling, dysarthria, and dysphagia. (2) Treatment of WD should be started as soon as possible. Zinc agents alone may be sufficient for asymptomatic children with WD who only have abnormal liver function tests. Penicillamine should be added once they become symptomatic or have abnormal liver ultrasound. (3) The 24-hour urine copper content is a good reference for adjusting medication dosages. A target of 200-500 ug of 24 UCC is usually an indicator of a good chelation dosage. (4) lifelong treatment with good compliance should be emphasized. (5) zinc can be used during pregnancy. A small dose of penicillamine (250 mg/d) can be added if necessary. (6) Chinese herbal medicine should be carefully selected and used as complementary treatment.",,"Liang, X. L.;Li, X.

1665,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder of copper metabolism that leads to the accumulation of this metal in different organs and tissues. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the main clinical features of the disease. Objective: The objective of the study is to analyze the clinical presentation, the epidemiological characteristics, the course of the disease and the response to therapy in a historical cohort of 36 Brazilian patients with WD. Patients and Methods: We reviewed 36 patients with WD, diagnosed between 1971 and 2010, and followed up in southern Brazil. Diagnosis of WD was based on clinical presentation, family history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin, increased 24-hour urine copper excretion, liver biopsy, genetic testing, and/or response to provocation test. with D-penicillamine. Results: There were 16 (44.4%) male and 20 female (56.6%) patients, with a mean age of 34.6+/-10.8 years, with a high predominance of exclusively European continental origin (74, 5%). The mean age at the time of initial symptom presentation was 23.2+/-9.3 years. The time from the first clinical symptom to the definitive diagnosis was 27.5+/-41.9 months. At presentation, 9 patients (25%) showed exclusively neuropsychiatric symptoms, 14 (38.9%) exclusively hepatic symptoms, 11 (30.6%) demonstrated both hepatic and neuropsychiatric features (mixed presentation), and 2 (5. 5%) were asymptomatic. The treatment used included D-penicillamine (94.2%) and zinc acetate (5.8%).

1667,Distinct clinical courses according to presenting phenotypes and their correlations with ATP7B mutations in a large cohort of Wilson's disease.,"Wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneities have been reported in Wilson's disease (WD), which makes it difficult to study their correlations. The objective of this study was to identify the factors related to these diversities. Methods: Clinical courses and molecular genetic characteristics were analyzed in 237 unrelated Korean families of WD. The mean follow-up period was 8.2 +/- 5.8 years. Results: The phenotypes they presented were classified as H1 (12.2%), H2 (42.4%), N1 (21.6%), N2 (0.4%), NX (0.4%), presymptomatic (22.4%) and others (0.4%), modifying the guidelines of Ferenci and colleagues. The age at presentation was younger and cirrhosis rarer in the presymptomatic group. Decompensated cirrhosis was the highest in the H1 group. Favorable outcome was rarer in the N1 group. Forty-seven (11 new) ATP7B mutations were identified in 85% of the 474 alleles. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assays on ATP7B and analyzes of the ATOX1 and COMMD1 genes did not identify additional mutations. Yeast complementation assays demonstrated functional disruption of all seven new missense mutants. Five major mutations, p.Arg778Leu, p.Ala874Val, p.Asn1270Ser, p.Lys838SerfsX35, and p.Leu1083Phe, accounted for 63% of alleles. H1 was more common, age at presentation was younger, and N1+N2+NX tended to be less common in patients with missense, frameshift, or splicing than in those with missense mutations alone. Patients with both mutations in the transduction (Td) or in the ATP hinge domain showed presymptomatic or hepatic manifestations but no neurological manifestations. Conclusions: The phenotype at presentation strongly affects the clinical outcome of WD and is related to the type and location of the ATP7B mutation, providing evidence for genotype-phenotype correlations in WD.

[French],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper excretion that leads to toxic accumulation of copper in the liver, as well as in the brain, cornea, and other organs. The defect is due to mutations in the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B. Clinical manifestations are highly variable and include acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, as well as neurological or psychiatric symptoms. The Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring is pathognomonic but is absent in about 50% of patients with hepatic manifestations alone. A high index of suspicion in clinically compatible situations is key, with a combination of laboratory tests that allow the diagnosis of WD. Treatment is based on the use of chelating agents, D-penicillamine or trientine.

1669,Serum copper and serum free copper values in the diagnosis and follow-up of Wilson's disease and its carriers. [Chinese],"Objective: To explore the values of serum copper and serum free copper in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD), its carrier, and viral hepatitis, and to explore the guiding importance of monitoring serum copper in the treatment of WD. Methods: A total of 80 patients with WD (liver type, n=60; encephalic type, n=20), 30 carriers, 20 patients with viral hepatitis were enrolled and their serum copper levels were determined. Neural symptoms were scored using modified Young's grade. Complete blood count, liver functions, blood coagulation functions, serum copper, and urinary copper were analyzed throughout the 8 courses of sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) treatment. The patients were treated with zinc after discharge. All data were analyzed. Results: Free serum copper increased in patients with WD (0.17 mg/L +/- 0.04 mg/L), carriers (0.13 mg/L +/- 0.03 mg/L) and hepatitis severe viral (0.12 mg/L) . A slight increase in WD carriers was also observed. Serum copper level correlated with liver functions but not with severity of neural symptoms. Serum copper increased in patients without improvement in neural symptoms. However, serum copper decreased in WD patients with improvement of neural symptoms. Serum copper stabilized at approximately 0.2 mg/l during the long-term treatment period. Conclusion: There is an auxiliary diagnostic importance of serum copper in the determination of WD. Liver functions in hepatic-type WD affect the serum copper level. WD brain-type copper serum cannot indicate the severity of neural symptoms. Elevated serum copper level indicates a poor prognosis. Serum copper is an effective marker in monitoring the development and therapeutic efficacy of the disease. Copyright Â© 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.",,"Zhou, X. X.;Li, X. H.;Huang, H.

[German],"We present the case of a 13-year-old boy, who was asymptomatic, but showed elevated transaminases and gamma-GT in a routine blood test. Extremely increased liver copper concentration resulted in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease; D-penicillamine therapy was started. A few weeks later, the child presented with weight loss and signs of colitis and pancreatitis. Discontinuation of therapy resulted in improvement of colitis. After recurrence of symptoms during rechallenge, penicillamine therapy was discontinued due to suspected drug-induced colitis and pancreatitis. Under alternative zinc therapy, liver enzymes increased again, accompanied by elevated autoantibodies and persistently high fecal lactoferrin. The following reevaluation led to the final diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis. The previous case demonstrates the diagnostic difficulties in cases of elevated transaminases without specific clinical symptoms. Despite the high specificity of liver copper content for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, any cholestatic liver disease should be excluded, as it can lead to secondary hepatic storage of copper. Based on the case presented, the characteristics of ulcerative colitis and PSC are presented, in particular their association, diagnosis and treatment.",,"Tesch, N.;Lange, L.;Vorndamme, I.;Buderus, S.",2011,December,,0,0,
1671,Musculoskeletal conditions associated with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disease, defined as an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the release of free copper and a dramatic accumulation of hepatic intracellular copper with subsequent hepatic and central nervous system abnormalities. Mutations of the ATP7B gene are responsible for metabolic dysfunction. Small open-label studies have reported radiological abnormalities of the spine, such as scoliosis, diffuse bone demineralization, osteochondritis, and sometimes fractures. The prevalence of osteoporosis in young adult patients is debated, ranging from 10%, with normal mean Z-score values, to 43% in adults. A history of spinal or peripheral fractures may be present in 50% of patients. Joint disorders include large joint arthralgias such as knee pain, rare effusions, early onset of radiological features of osteoarthritis, and associated osteochondritis of the knee joint. Radiologic chondrocalcinosis, an unusual feature in young adults, should be confirmed. Few patients may develop drug-induced lupus with arthralgia, positive antinuclear and antihistone antibodies, secondary to D-penicillamine, the main copper chelator used in WD. In this orphan disease, small retrospective studies do not allow us to determine joint and bone manifestations related to WD. However, such clinical and radiological abnormalities are sometimes the first symptoms that lead to diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware that unexplained joint pain and effusion, or even radiologic features of osteoarthritis, of large joints in adolescents could suggest WD and lead to copper survey.

1672,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data on clinical follow-up and treatment effectiveness of Wilson's disease are limited due to the low frequency of the disease. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of patients with Wilson's disease from southern Brazil during a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with Wilson's disease, diagnosed between 1971 and 2010, were retrospectively evaluated for clinical presentation, epidemiologic and social characteristics, response to therapy, and outcome. RESULTS: Examination of the continental origins of the patients showed that 74.5% had a European ancestor. The mean age of presentation of the initial symptoms was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months until the definitive diagnosis. At presentation, hepatic symptoms predominated (38.9%), followed by mixed (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) symptoms (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were identified in 55.6% of the patients, more frequently among those patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%). Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was detected in 68% of patients with liver symptoms. 94.2% of all patients were treated with D-penicillamine for a mean time of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combination therapy, and liver transplantation. After starting therapy, 78.8% of patients had a stable or improved outcome, and the overall survival rate was 90.1%.

1674,Medical Management of Chronic Liver Diseases (CLD) in Children (Part II): Focus on Complications of CLD and CLD Requiring Special Considerations,"Treating the causes of many chronic liver diseases (CLD) may not be possible. In this case, complications must be anticipated, prevented or at least controlled by the best available therapeutic modalities. There are three main goals for the treatment of portal hypertension: (i) prevention of the first episode of variceal bleeding largely by non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, which are generally not recommended in children; (ii) bleeding control using a stepwise approach from least invasive to most invasive strategies; (iii) and prevention of rebleeding by bypass operations, with particular enthusiasm for the use of the meso-Rex bypass in the pediatric population. Management of hepatic encephalopathy also consists of three main aspects: (i) ruling out other causes of encephalopathy; (ii) identify and treat precipitating factors; and (iii) start empirical treatment with drugs such as lactulose, rifaximin, sodium benzoate, and flumazenil. Treatment of mild ascites and peripheral edema should begin with sodium and water restriction, followed by careful diuresis, then large-volume paracentesis associated with colloid volume expansion in severe cases. Broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should be used for the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacterial and fungal sepsis, and cholangitis, after taking appropriate cultures, with appropriate changes in therapy following susceptibility testing. Empirical therapies continue to be standard practice for pruritus; these consist of bile acid binding agents, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines, rifampin (rifampin), and carbamazepine. Partial external biliary diversion can be used in refractory cases. When hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, treatment should be started early to prevent progression of kidney failure; approaches consist of general supportive measures, management of concomitant complications, screening for sepsis, antibiotic treatment, use of vasopressin analogs (terlipressin), and renal replacement therapy if necessary. Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are best treated by liver transplantation. Provision of adequate caloric supply, nutrition, and vitamin and mineral supplementation for management of growth failure, required vaccinations, and special care to ensure psychological well-being must be ensured. Anticoagulation may be attempted in acute portal vein thrombosis. Some CLDs, such as extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and Indian childhood cirrhosis, require special considerations. For EHBA, Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy is the current standard surgical approach in combination with nutritional therapy and supplementation of fat- and water-soluble vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. In type 1 Crigler-Najjar syndrome, extensive phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment, in association with adjuvant photobilirubin-binding therapy such as calcium phosphate, cholestyramine, or agar, until liver transplantation can be performed. Treatment of Indian childhood cirrhosis with penicillamine early in the course of the disease and at doses similar to those used to treat Wilson's disease cuts the mortality rate in half. ), hepatocyte transplantation, liver-targeted gene therapy, genetically modified enzymes, and therapeutic modalities targeting fibrogenesis.

1675,Medical management of chronic liver diseases in children (Part I): focus on curable or potentially curable diseases,"The management of children with chronic liver disease (CLD) requires a multidisciplinary approach. CLDs can be classified into ""potentially"" curable, treatable non-curable, and end-stage diseases. The goals related to the management of CLD can be divided into prevention or minimization of progressive liver damage in curable CLD by treating the underlying cause; prevention or control of complications in treatable CLD; and predicting end-stage CLD outcome to deliver definitive therapy through surgical procedures, including liver transplantation. Specific and curative therapies directed at the main causes of CLD are, if possible, best considered by a pediatric hepatologist. The medical management of CLD in children will be reviewed in two parts, with Part I (this article) focusing specifically on 'potentially' curable CLD. as well as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. It is also essential in tyrosinemia, in addition to nitisinone 2-(nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione therapy, as well as in Wilson's disease in conjunction with copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Zinc and antioxidants are adjuvant drugs in Wilson's disease. New advances have been made in chronic viral hepatitis with the advent of oral antivirals. In children, the drugs currently available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection are standard interferon (IFN)-alpha-2, pegylated IFN-alpha-2 (PG-IFN), and lamivudine. In adults, adefovir and entecavir have also been licensed, while telbivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, clevudine, and thymosin alfa-1 are currently undergoing clinical trials. For chronic hepatitis C virus infection, the most accepted treatment is PG-IFN plus ribavirin. Corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine, remain the basic strategy for inducing remission in autoimmune hepatitis. Cyclosporine (cyclosporine) and other immunosuppressants may be used for patients who do not achieve remission or who have significant side effects with azathioprine corticosteroid therapy. The above therapies can prevent, or at least minimize, the progression of liver damage, particularly if started early. , leading to near-normal quality of life in affected children.

1677,Resolved psychosis after liver transplant in a patient with Wilson's disease,"psychiatric involvement is frequently present in Wilson's disease. Psychiatric symptoms are sometimes the first and only manifestation of Wilson's disease. More often, a psychiatric involvement is present alongside neurological or liver disease. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient who presented a clinical and laboratory picture of cirrhosis and a history of subchronic hallucinatory psychosis, behavioral symptoms and mood disorders with depressed mood. He had no family history of liver or psychiatric disease. Laboratory and imaging tests confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease with psychiatric involvement. After liver transplantation, copper metabolism and liver function normalized and we noted no recurrence of psychiatric illness. To date, very few cases of psychiatric improvement after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have been described.

The objective of this study is to review the genetic aspects, diagnosis and treatment of Neuro-Wilson. Methods We present seven cases collected in the Department of Neurology and Pediatrics CHU Hassan II of Fez. Results All patients had neurological signs with or without extraneurological symptoms. A complete blood count, liver function, renal balance, copper balance, brain imaging, abdominal ultrasound, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on clinical, biological, and radiological findings. Three patients were treated with D-penicillamine and the others received zinc. The family survey in search of similar cases was carried out through a clinical examination of siblings of four patients. Conclusion When left untreated, the course of Wilson's disease is always fatal. The treatment is based on copper chelators, zinc salts and liver transplantation [7].

A 23-year-old female patient was admitted with decompensated liver cirrhosis (originally of unknown etiology) with signs of liver failure (Child-Pugh C, 12 points). The suspicion of Wilson's disease was based on a patient history and high urine copper. The diagnosis was confirmed by liver biopsy and later by genetic testing. As the patient was obese with a BMI of 60, liver transplantation was ruled out. The patient stabilized and liver function improved on maximal conservative treatment with concomitant treatment with chelating agents. The first choice penicillamine had to be changed to trientine due to an allergic reaction and bone marrow suppression. Eighteen months after the start of treatment, the patient is well, fully compensated with a Child-Pugh A classification (5 points).",,"Petraskova, H.;Novak, F.;Humlova, R.;Bruha, R.",2011,,,0,0,

1683,Metal attenuating therapies in neurodegenerative diseases,"The clinical and pathological spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases is diverse, although common to many of these disorders is the accumulation of misfolded proteins, and oxidative stress is believed to be an important mechanism contributing to neuronal damage. As a corollary, transition metal ion dyshomeostasis appears to play a key pathogenic role in several of these diseases, including the most common of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, studies covering a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders involving transition metals are compared and contrasted, including a more detailed treatment in relation to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases. For each of these diseases, a discussion of the evolving scientific rationale for developing therapies to ameliorate the deleterious effects of transition metal dysregulation is provided, including the results of several human trials.

1685,Transition metal homeostasis: from yeast to human disease,"Transition metal ions are essential nutrients for all forms of life. Iron, copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt, and nickel have unique chemical and physical properties that make them attractive molecules for use in biological systems. Many of these same properties that allow these metals to provide essential biochemical activities and structural motifs to a multitude of proteins, including enzymes and other cellular constituents, also lead to potential cytotoxicity. Organisms have been required to develop a number of systems for the efficient uptake, intracellular transport, protein loading, and storage of metal ions to ensure that the needs of cells can be met while the associated toxic effects are minimized. Alterations in cellular systems for handling transition metals are seen as a number of diseases ranging from hemochromatosis and anemias to neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven useful as a model organism for investigation of these processes, and many of the genes and biological systems that function in yeast metal homeostasis are conserved from eukaryotes to humans. This review focuses on the biological functions of iron, copper, zinc, manganese, nickel, and cobalt, the homeostatic mechanisms that function in S. cerevisiae, and the human diseases in which these metals have been implicated.

1687,Research Tools and Techniques for Mammalian Copper Metabolism,"Copper (Cu) is an essential component of biological redox reactions and its deficiency is fatal for the organism. At the same time, Cu is extremely toxic when present in excess. In this regard, various groups of Cu regulatory proteins in the body act to regulate the concentration of Cu within a certain range. However, the general mechanism underlying the maintenance of Cu homeostasis in the body and cells remains poorly understood.

1688,Zinc monotherapy is not as effective as chelating agents in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper storage, leading to liver failure and neurological impairment. Patients are treated with copper chelators and zinc salts, but the optimal approach is unclear because few large cohort studies have been performed. The long-term results of different treatments were evaluated. Methods: Patients in tertiary care centers were analyzed retrospectively (n = 288; median follow-up time, 17.1 years) for adherence to therapy, survival, treatment failure, and adverse events of different types. treatment regimens (chelators, zinc or a combination). Hepatic treatment failure was defined as an increase in hepatic enzyme activity (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase) > 2 times the upper limit of normal or > 100% of baseline with an increase in urinary excretion of copper. Results: The median age of onset of Wilson's disease was 17.5 years. Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred in 196 (68.1%) and 99 (34.4%) patients, respectively. Hepatic treatment failure occurred more often with zinc therapy (14/88 treatments) than with chelation therapy (4/313 treatments; P < 0.001). Actuarial survival, without transplant, showed an advantage for chelating agents (p < 0.001 vs. zinc). Changes in treatment were mainly due to adverse events, but the frequency did not differ between groups. Patients who did not respond to zinc therapy showed hepatic improvement after reintroduction of a chelating agent. Conclusions: Treatments with chelators or zinc salts are effective in most patients with Wilson's disease; chelating agents are better at preventing liver damage. It is important to identify patients who do not respond to zinc therapy and have increased liver enzyme activities, indicating that a chelating agent should be added to the therapeutic regimen.

1689,Metal rearrangement: the use of chelating compounds as potential therapies for metal-related neurodegenerative diseases,"Metal ions, particularly copper, zinc, and iron, are implicated in several amyloidogenic neurodegenerative disorders. In the brain, as in other parts of the body, excess or deficiency of metal ions can potentially inhibit protein function, interfere with proper protein folding, or, in the case of iron or copper, promote stress. oxidative. The involvement of metal ions in neurodegenerative disorders has made them an emerging target for therapeutic interventions. One approach has been to chelate and sequester the ions and thus limit their potential to interfere with protein folding or render them unable to undergo redox processes. Newer approaches suggest that metal ion redistribution has therapeutic benefits, and recent studies indicate that alleviating cellular copper deficiency may be a plausible way to limit neurodegeneration. In this review, we discuss the role of metals in amyloidogenic neurodegenerative disorders and highlight some mechanisms and compounds used in various therapeutic approaches.

1690,Atypical presentation of Wilson's disease,"15-year-old Caucasian female on a human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) diet developed fever, cholestasis, coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia, and acute renal dysfunction. Images of the biliary system and liver were normal. He responded to intravenous antibiotics, vitamin K, and blood transfusions, but relapsed on discontinuation of antibiotics. He had remission with replacement of antibiotics. Liver biopsy revealed a pronounced bile duct reaction, bridging fibrosis, and hepatocyte anisocytosis and anisonucleosis with degenerative enlarged eosinophilic hepatocytes, suggestive of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was further established based on low serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary and hepatic copper, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Multisystem involvement of the liver, kidneys, blood, and brain is consistent with Wilson's disease; however, the clinical presentation of reversible cholangitis and coagulopathy is uncommon and may be due to concurrent acute cholangitis and/or the HCG diet regimen the patient was following.

1691,Critical appraisal of Belgian orphan drug reimbursement files,"Background: Orphan medicinal products are designed to diagnose or treat rare diseases that are serious, life-threatening or chronically debilitating and affect 50 or fewer out of 100,000 people in the EU. In Belgium, the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC) assesses orphan drug reimbursement applications based on multiple criteria: therapeutic value, price and proposed reimbursement rate; the importance of the drug in clinical practice; and the budgetary impact of the drug. Objectives: This study aimed to assess orphan drug reimbursement files in Belgium and compare them with clinical evidence submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: A qualitative analysis examined all orphan drug reimbursement files that were submitted in Belgium between January 2002 and June 2008. The following information was extracted from each file: description of the orphan drug; indication; refund status; value and therapeutic needs; budget impact; and number of registered indications. For selected orphan medicinal products, an in-depth analysis extracted and compared information on clinical trials, their primary endpoints, and results from EMA documents (i.e. marketing authorization application dossier, public assessment report and the summary of product characteristics) and the Belgian reimbursement files. . Results: Reimbursement was granted for the majority of orphan drugs. In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments, work incentives, patient population restrictions, and company funding of diagnostic tests, appeared to influence the reimbursement decision. Despite the low number of patients, randomized controlled trials have been conducted for many orphan drugs. Budget impact analyzes were simplistic and did not consider impact across multiple indications. Some differences were also noted between the clinical evidence submitted to the EMA and that submitted to the Belgian DRC. Conclusions: In addition to official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments and work incentives, may play a role in Belgian orphan drug reimbursement decisions. Some differences have also been observed between the clinical evidence reported in the EMA documents and the evidence included in the Belgian orphan drug reimbursement files. There seems to be a need for further standardization of Belgian claims and for European cooperation to share clinical evidence for orphan drugs. Â© 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

1692,Wilson's disease: pathogenesis and clinical considerations in diagnosis and treatment,"Nearly a century after Dr. Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson wrote his doctoral thesis on the pathologic findings of lenticular degeneration in the brain associated with liver cirrhosis, we know that the underlying molecular basis for this autosomal recessive inherited disorder that now bears his name is mutation. of a copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B, an intracellular copper transporter expressed mainly in hepatocytes. Loss of ATP7B function is the basis for reduced hepatic biliary excretion of copper and reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. During the intervening years, the clinical signs, histological, biochemical features, and ATP7B mutation analysis that characterize and allow diagnosis of this disorder were recognized. These include the presence of signs of hepatic or neurological disease and detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings, low ceruloplasmin, elevated urinary and hepatic copper, and associated histological changes in the liver. Medical therapies and liver transplantation can effectively treat patients with this previously uniformly fatal disorder. Earlier detection of the disease led to initiation of treatment to prevent disease progression and reverse pathologic findings if present, and familial screening is warranted to detect the disorder in first-degree relatives. Gene therapy and hepatocyte cell transplantation for Wilson's disease have only been tested in animal models but represent future areas of study. Despite all the advances, we still need to consider the diagnosis of Wilson's disease to screen patients for this disorder and properly establish the diagnosis before committing to lifelong treatment.

1694,Lingual dyskinesia and tics: a new presentation of copper metabolism disorder,"Copper is a trace element necessary for cellular respiration, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, pigment formation, antioxidant defense, peptide amidation, and connective tissue formation. Abnormalities of copper metabolism have been linked to neurological disorders that affect movement, such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease; however, diagnosis of non-Wilson-type and non-Menkes-type copper metabolism disorders has been more elusive, especially in cases with atypical features. We present the case of an adolescent with a novel presentation of copper metabolism disorder who presented with acute severe hemilingual dyskinesia and prominent tics, with ballismus of the upper limbs, but with normal brain and spinal MRI and no signs of dysarthria. or dysphagia. His serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were low, but his urinary copper level was elevated after penicillamine challenge. We conclude that copper metabolism disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis of movement disorders, even in cases with very unusual presentations, because many of them are treatable. Furthermore, a connection between copper metabolism disorders and tics is presented, to our knowledge, for the first time in humans; More research is needed to better establish this connection and understand its underlying pathophysiology.

We present the case of a 21-year-old patient who had been on dialysis for 5 years. Due to high blood pressure (230/160 mmHg) and thrill in the lower back detected on physical examination, a Doppler was performed and a renal AVF was detected. Because the patient had a history of kidney biopsy 5 years earlier, the fistula was thought to be secondary to the biopsy.

To date, approximately 520 mutations have been described that cause Wilson's disease. In this study we report the use of DNA and RNA analysis for the molecular characterization of a macroscopic deletion of the ATP7B gene detected in homozygosity in a patient with Wilson's disease. The c.51+384_1708-953del mutation spans a 8798 bp region of the ATP7B gene from exon 2 to intron 4.

1698,Rheumatic manifestations associated with Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disease, defined as an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the release of free copper and a dramatic accumulation of hepatic intracellular copper with subsequent hepatic and central nervous system abnormalities. Mutations of the ATP7B gene are responsible for metabolic disease. A limited number of small studies allow radiological abnormalities of the spine to include diffuse bone demineralization, osteochondritis, and occasionally fractures. In a prospective study, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 10%, with normal mean Z-score values, and the prevalence of a history of fracture was 50%. Joint disorders include arthralgias of large joints, such as knee pain, rare effusions, early-onset radiological features of osteoarthritis, and associated osteochondritis. Some patients may develop drug-induced lupus with arthralgia, positive antinuclear and antihistone antibodies, secondary to D-penicillamine, the main copper chelator used in WD. In this rare disease, small retrospective studies do not allow us to determine joint and bone manifestations related to WD. These clinical and radiological abnormalities are sometimes the first symptoms that lead to diagnosis. However, unexplained joint pain and large joint effusion in adolescents could suggest WD and lead to a copper survey. The management of bone diseases and fractures are common to those applied in the general population. Â© 2011 French Society of Rhumatologie.",,"Quemeneur, A. S.;Trocello, J. M.;de Vernejoul, M.

1704,Alzheimer's disease and metals: therapeutic opportunities,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Currently, there are no disease-modifying drugs, existing therapies only offer short-term symptomatic relief. Two of the pathognomonic indicators of AD are the presence of extracellular protein aggregates composed mainly of Abeta peptide and oxidative stress. Both phenomena can potentially be explained by interactions of Abeta with metal ions. Furthermore, metal ions play a critical role in synaptic function and their homeostasis is tightly regulated. It is likely that a disruption in the homeostasis of this metal and the generation of toxic Abeta oligomers are responsible for the synaptic dysfunction associated with AD. Therefore, approaches that are designed to prevent Abeta metal interactions, inhibit the formation of toxic Abeta species, and restore metal homeostasis may have potential as disease-modifying strategies to treat AD. This review summarizes the physiological and pathological interactions that metal ions play in synaptic function, with special emphasis on interactions with Abeta. A variety of therapeutic strategies designed to address these disease processes are also described. The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called 'metal protein attenuating compound' approach, with the lead molecule PBT2 having successfully completed early phase clinical trials. The success of these various strategies suggests that manipulation of metal ion interactions offers multiple opportunities to develop disease-modifying therapies for AD. Â© 2011 The authors.

1708,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper disposal caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), known as Wilson ATPase, which functions within of hepatocytes to move copper. across intracellular membranes. The transport action of copper directly supports the production of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase, in which copper is incorporated, as well as the excretion of copper in the bile. Consequently, in Wilson's disease, serum copper concentrations are low and hepatic retention of copper develops, leading to liver damage. Wilson's disease can present as liver, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; The clinical phenotypes are very varied. Other organ systems may also be involved. Although the usual age range for clinical presentation is 5 to 45 years, younger children and older adults can also develop this disease. Clinical investigations include liver function tests, brain imaging, serum ceruloplasmin and copper, baseline 24-hour urinary copper measurement, and liver parenchymal copper concentration. Genetic diagnosis is complex but definitive, and is best used for family studies. Treatment is usually very effective and consists of lifelong administration of a chelating agent (D-penicillamine or trientine) or zinc in pharmacological doses. Liver transplantation is almost always required for patients with fulminant hepatic failure (coagulopathy, encephalopathy, massive intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, elevated aminotransferases, below normal alkaline phosphatase) or for those whose liver disease does not respond to medical treatment. Liver cancer is extremely rare in patients with Wilson's disease, but screening tests may be appropriate for older patients. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Roberts, E.

1710,Access to orphan drugs despite the poor quality of clinical evidence,"OBJECTIVE We analyze Belgian reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs in comparison with those for innovative drugs for more common but equally serious diseases, with particular emphasis on the quality of clinical evidence. METHODS Using the administrative database of the National Health Insurance Agency, we evaluated all orphan drug files submitted between 2002 and 2007. A quality analysis of clinical evidence was performed on orphan drug reimbursement files. Assessment reports from the French 'Haute Autorite de Sante', including the 'Service Medical Rendu (SMR) five-point scale parameter, were examined to compare disease severity. Chi-square tests (with a significance level of P < 0.05) were used to compare the outcome of reimbursement decisions between innovative orphan and non-orphan medicinal products. RESULTS Twenty-five orphan drug files and 117 non-orphan drug files were evaluated. Twenty-two of 25 (88%) orphan drug submissions received reimbursement versus 74 of 117 (63%) innovative non-orphan drugs (P=0.02). Only 52% of the 25 orphan drug filings included a randomized controlled trial compared to 84% in a random control sample of 25 non-orphan breakthrough presentations (P < 0.01). The duration of drug exposure was in most cases too short in relation to the natural history of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Orphan drug designation predicts reimbursement despite poor quality clinical evidence. The evidence gap in marketing authorization should be reduced by post-marketing programs, in which centralized regulatory authorities and local reimbursement authorities collaborate efficiently in all member states of the European Union.

1712,Late-diagnosed Wilson's disease with hepatic and neurologic manifestations,"50-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for liver dysfunction and progressive neurological symptoms. She had previously been diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) had effectively normalized her serum aminotransferase levels, however, she had loss of balance, dysarthria, and difficulty with handwriting. Autoantibodies and hepatitis virus markers were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were found to be 9 mg/dL and 32 Âµg/dL, respectively. The 24-h urine copper excretion was 331.8 ug/day. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was demonstrated. Histological examination of the liver revealed inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis, and hepatic copper concentration was 444.4 Âµg/g dry weight. We diagnosed Wilson's disease and started treatment with trientine. Immunohistochemistry for keratin 8 and p62 revealed Mallory-Denk bodies. Many of the cells expressing p62 were positive for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). There were few Ki-67 positive hepatocytes in the liver. Wilson's disease is one of the causes of NASH and UDCA may be a supportive therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease. Cell proliferation is suppressed under copper-loaded conditions and this phenomenon may be associated with the clinical course of Wilson's disease.

1713,Wilson's disease in the adult. [French],"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, characterized by accumulation of copper in the body due to defective biliary excretion of copper by hepatocytes. We present a series of 19 patients with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, descriptive case series of patients with WD followed up in two hospitals in northeastern France. Results: Eight men and 11 women were studied. The median follow-up time was 16 years, the median age at diagnosis was 18 years (range: 5-71 years). The median age at first symptom was 16 years. In addition to four cases diagnosed by family screening, the clinical manifestations at diagnosis were fatigue (n= 5), jaundice (n= 5), bleeding (n= 1), abnormal movement disorders (n= 2) and fortuitous (n= two). ). Cirrhosis was identified in 14 patients, neurological compromise occurred in seven patients, and four patients had psychiatric disorders. D-penicillamine was the first treatment in 18 patients, discontinued due to serious adverse events in seven patients. Trientine or zinc salts were then prescribed. Medical treatment was successful in 13 patients, but five patients underwent liver transplantation. In one case hemochromatosis was associated and one patient developed cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion: WD is serious. Medical treatment allows control of the disease if observed correctly. Conversely, worsening with irreversible damage may occur if treatment is discontinued.

1714,"Pathology, clinical features and treatments of inborn copper metabolic disorders - Focus on neurological aspects","Genetic disorders of copper metabolism, including Menkes curly hair disease (MD), occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and Wilson's disease (WD), are reviewed with a focus on neurological aspects. MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency of copper. Typical features of MD, such as neurological disorders, connective tissue disorders, and hair abnormalities, can be explained by abnormally low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard of care for the treatment of MD is the parenteral administration of copper-histidine. When treatment is started in neonates, neurological degeneration can be prevented, but late treatment is considerably less effective. Furthermore, copper-histidine treatment does not improve connective tissue disorders. New treatments targeting neurological and connective tissue disorders need to be developed. OHS is the mildest form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. Although no formal trials have been conducted for OHS, patients with OHS are generally treated similarly to MD. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. Although the liver and nervous systems are usually the most severely affected, initial symptoms are variable, making early diagnosis difficult. Because early treatments are often critical, especially in patients with neurological disorders, medical education efforts for early diagnosis should be directed at primary care physicians. Chelating agents and zinc are effective for the treatment of WD, but neurological symptoms temporarily worsen immediately after treatment with chelating agents. Neurological worsening in patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate has been reported to be lower than rates of neurological worsening when treated with other chelating agents.

Corpus callosum (CC) lesions have not been studied in a large population of WD patients. Objective: Evaluation of the frequency of CC lesions in patients with neurological symptoms related to WD. Method: The authors included all patients with neurological expression of WD, followed up at the French national center for WD who underwent brain MRI between March 2006 and December 2008. Location of brain lesions and the frequency of lesions in CC was evaluated. All patients were evaluated using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale. For patients with localized CC abnormalities, a clinical disconnection syndrome was investigated. Results: Among 81 patients (45 men, mean age: 34.8 years, 12 to 74 years) with neurological expression, 42% had white matter lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. 23.4% of the patients presented CC lesions, limited to the posterior part (splenium). The severity of disability estimated by the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale correlated with the presence of CC lesions on MRI. Conclusion: CC abnormalities are not unusual (23.4%).

1720,clinical evaluation of Wilson's disease in patients with concurrent liver disease,"Objectives: To investigate variations in the clinical epidemiology of Wilson's disease in patients with concurrent liver disease and the effect of coexisting disease on current diagnostic algorithms. Background: Wilson's disease is a rare disorder and there are few studies on its diagnosis and natural history. Currently available tools have limited efficacy in complex patients, and the presence of coexisting diseases may further limit their use. Deeper analyzes of Wilson's disease among complex patients with concurrent illnesses will help improve algorithms for earlier diagnosis and treatment. STUDY: A retrospective cohort study using data from a large tertiary care center to conduct a clinical evaluation of Wilson's disease among patients with coexisting liver disease. Results: 42 patients with Wilson's disease were identified; 9 had comorbid liver diseases. The mean age at diagnosis was significantly older in patients with concurrent liver disease compared with those without underlying disease (49.1 years vs. 26.8 years, P < 0.0001). Patients with concurrent liver disease had more evidence of cirrhosis at presentation (9/9, 100% vs. 15/33, 45.5%) and showed higher mortality (4/8, 50% vs. 4 /29, 13.8%, P = 0.0222). Without data from mutation analysis, a definitive diagnosis of Wilson's disease using the Leipzig criteria was made in 44% of patients with concurrent liver disease. Conclusions: Patients with concurrent liver disease were diagnosed with Wilson's disease at significantly older ages, presented more liver cirrhosis and higher mortality. Mutation analysis is crucial for definitive diagnosis among complex cohorts and those with intermediate Leipzig scores. Copyright Â© 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,"Wong, R.

1721,Recurrent hemorrhage and symptoms similar to bulbar myasthenia as the initial presentation of Wilson's disease: a case report,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, is often associated with hepatic or neuropsychiatric manifestations. This is to describe a case of Wilson's disease that presented with recurrent bleeding and symptoms similar to myasthenia bulbare. A 12-year-old Indian girl initially presented with recurrent bleeding manifestations such as epistaxis, hematemesis, and melena followed by difficulty swallowing with fatigability after 2 years. Initially, the bleeding was attributed to thrombocytopenia and the difficulty swallowing remained undiagnosed as tests for myasthenia gravis were negative. Four years later, the patient developed nasal intonation of the voice with fatigability followed by a decline in school performance. The patient was evaluated at our institute and subtle extrapyramidal signs in the form of asymmetric appendiceal dystonia and bradykinesia were observed. Clinical evaluation, laboratory and radiological investigations led to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Most likely, the cause of the bleeding was a platelet function defect. No other cause of his bulbar myasthenia-like symptoms was apparent. This case illustrates that in all Wilson's disease patients with bleeding, a platelet function defect should also be considered. In cases of symptoms similar to myasthenia bulbar where the diagnosis is unclear, Wilson's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis if hepatosplenomegaly is present.",,"Prasun, N.;Bagchi, M.;Joseph, A.;Pal, S.;Ghosh, S.;Mukherjee, S.;Senapati, A.

1723,Therapeutic potential of copper chelation with triethylenetetramine in the management of diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease,"This article reviews recent evidence, much of which has been generated by my group's research program, which first identified a previously unknown state of copper overload that is central to the pathogenesis of diabetic organ damage. This state causes damage to the tissues of the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina, and nerves through copper-mediated oxidative stress. This author now believes that this state of copper overload provides an important new target for therapeutic intervention, the goal of which is to prevent or reverse diabetic complications. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) has recently been identified as the first of a new class of diabetic molecules through the original work reviewed here, thus providing a new use for this molecule, which was previously approved by the US FDA in 1985. as second-line treatment for Wilson's disease. TETA acts as a highly selective divalent copper (CuII) chelator that prevents or reverses diabetic copper overload, thus suppressing oxidative stress. TETA treatment of diabetic animals and patients has identified and quantified the interrelated defects in copper metabolism that characterize this state of systemic copper overload. Copper overload in diabetes mellitus differs from that in Wilson's disease through differences in their respective causal molecular mechanisms and resulting differences in the tissue localization and behavior of excess copper. It may well be mediated by advanced glycation end product (AGE) modification of susceptible amino acid residues in long-lived fibrous proteins, eg, connective tissue collagens in places such as blood vessel walls. These AGE modifications may act as localized fixed endogenous chelators that increase the chelatable copper content of organs such as the heart and kidneys by binding excessive amounts of catalytically active CuII in specific vascular beds, thus targeting related copper-mediated oxidative stress in susceptibles. . tissues. In this review, we use summary evidence from our clinical studies in healthy volunteers and diabetic patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and from nonclinical models of diabetic heart, artery, kidney, and neural disease to construct descriptions of the mechanisms by which treatment with TETA prevents injuries and regenerates damaged organs. Our recent phase II proof-of-principle studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and in nonclinical models of diabetes have helped define pathogenic defects in copper regulation and shown that they are reversible by TETA. The drug strongly binds and removes excess systemic CuII in the urine while neutralizing its catalytic activity, but does not cause systemic copper deficiency, even after prolonged use. Its physicochemical properties, which are critical to its safety and efficacy, clearly differentiate it from all other clinically available transition metal chelators, including D-penicillamine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, and clioquinol. The studies reviewed here show that TETA treatment is generally effective in preventing or reversing diabetic organ damage, and support its continued development as a new diabetes drug. Trientine (TETA dihydrochloride) has been used since the mid-1980s as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease, and our recent clinical studies have reinforced the impression that it is likely safe for long-term use in patients with diabetes and related diseases. metabolic disorders. There is substantial evidence to support the view that diabetes shares many pathogenic mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Indeed, the close epidemiological and molecular links between them point to the vascular dementia of Alzheimer's disease as an additional therapeutic target where experimental TETA pharmacotherapy might well find further clinical application.

1724,Brain Metal Mapping to Evaluate Therapies for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"The brain is rich in metals and has a high metabolic rate, making it highly vulnerable to the toxic effects of endogenously produced free radicals.

Even redox inert zinc, if present in excess, can trigger ROS production indirectly by altering mitochondrial function. Although metal chelators appear to improve the clinical outcome of several neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanisms of action remain obscure and the effects of long-term use are largely unknown. Most chelators are not specific to a single metal and could alter the distribution of multiple metals in the brain, which could have unexpected long-term consequences. We show here how X-ray fluorescence will be a valuable tool to examine the effect of chelators on the distribution and quantity of metals in the brain.

1725,Sleep disturbances in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease with copper accumulation; neurodegeneration is associated with dopaminergic deficit. The objective of the study is to verify sleep comorbidity through questionnaires and objective sleep tests (polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test). Methods: Fifty-five WD patients (22 hepatic, 28 neurological, 5 asymptomatic) and 55 sex-matched control subjects completed a questionnaire about their sleep habits, sleep comorbidity, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS) and answered screening questions for rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD-SQ). Twenty-four WD patients and control subjects underwent polysomnographic examination. Results: Unlike controls, WD patients were more likely to have daytime naps accompanied by excessive daytime tiredness and sleepiness, cataplexy-like episodes, and poor nighttime sleep. Their mean ESS as well as RBD-SQ was higher than that of controls. Total sleep time was lower, accompanied by decreased sleep efficiency and increased wakefulness. WD patients had lower latency of stage 1 and stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and less amount of stage 2 NREM sleep. One-third of WD patients were found to have a multiple short or borderline sleep latency test (MSLT) independent of nocturnal pathology (sleep apnea, periodic leg movements, and/or restless legs syndrome). Conclusions: Patients with WD often suffer from sleep disturbances (regardless of the clinical form). The spectrum of sleep/wake symptoms raises the suspicion that impaired REM sleep function may also be involved. Â© 2010 The author(s).

1730,Mowat Wilson syndrome; first case in Qatar identified by array comparative genomic hybridization (ACGH),"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a newly defined mental retardation syndrome that is usually associated with multiple health defects and is characterized by a typical facial gestalt. Approximately 200 cases have been reported worldwide, predominantly in Europe and North America. The syndrome occurs as a result of heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, formerly named ZFHX1B (SIP1), located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at 2q22. The spectrum of mutations includes point mutations (81%), intermediate and large mutations (17%), or large-scale rearrangements (2%). We report the first case of MWS in Qatar. The 2-year-old patient has features of MWS. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis was performed using a 44k ISCA design oligonucleotide platform. The patient was found to have a ~500 kb de novo deletion at 2q22. Routine chromosome analysis was normal. aCGH is a relatively new technology, which has revolutionized the field of clinical genetic diagnosis. aCGH can detect unbalanced chromosomal aberrations, including microdeletions, microduplications, aneuploidies, unbalanced translocations, and subtelomeric and pericentromeric copy number alterations throughout the genome. Unlike conventional cytogenetics, aCGH can detect deletions and duplications of less than 5 megabases and, unlike single-color FISH, can search for multiple aberrations simultaneously. This case emphasizes the value of array CGH to detect or characterize chromosomal rearrangements in patients with mental retardation without/without dysmorphic features and multiple congenital anomalies.",,"Zafar, N.;Khitam, A.

1731,Treatment of patients with neurological Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder related to copper metabolism. The key treatment strategy is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering copper and/or zinc chelating agents. D-penicillamine is considered the first drug of choice for patients with Wilson's disease in Japan. The chelating effect of this drug is excellent. However, 30-50% of patients with neurological symptoms may show a worsening of their symptoms in the early stages of treatment. Trientine is the second drug of choice in Japan. This agent has shown good results in response to the neurological symptoms of this disease. Zinc blocks the intestinal absorption of copper by inducing metallothionein synthesis in mucosal cells. Zinc is primarily used as first-line therapy in presymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease. The author proposes a treatment strategy for patients with Wilson's disease with neurological symptoms as follows: mild cases should be treated with trientine monotherapy, while moderate and severe cases require combination therapy with trientine and zinc.",,"Shimizu, N.",2011,October,,0,0,
1732,zinc deficiency,"The essentiality of zinc for humans and its deficiency was recognized in 1963. During the last 50 years, it has become apparent that zinc deficiency is prevalent in humans. Nutritional zinc deficiency may affect nearly 2 billion people in the developing world. The consumption of cereal proteins with a high phytate content decreases the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditional zinc deficiency is also very common. Growth retardation, hypogonadism in men, rough skin, impaired immunity, sensorineural disorder, and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. More than 300 enzymes require zinc for their activation and almost 2000 transcription factors require zinc for the control of gene expression. Zinc is also essential for cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In therapeutic doses, zinc has been used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in infants and children, the common cold, Wilson's disease, sickle cell disease, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with macular degeneration related to macular degeneration. age.",,"Prasad, A.

1733,Zinc therapy for Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,"Zinc is effective in all phases of Wilson's disease treatment and is the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy. It works by blocking the absorption of copper in the intestine and lacks the side effects of the other two anti-copper drugs. Zinc is approved in the US, Europe, and Japan for maintenance therapy of Wilson's disease. We will discuss the proper dosage, management, and follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc. Because we found that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were zinc deficient, and zinc is so important for neuronal function, we conducted a double-blind clinical trial of a new once-daily 150-mg zinc gastroretentive tablet developed by Adeona Pharmaceuticals, for 6 months in patients with AD. Patients older than 70 years treated with zinc had statistically significantly better scores than the placebo group in two cognitive scoring systems (ADAS-Cog, p= 0.037 and CDR-SOB, p= 0.03), indicating that the therapy with zinc is effective in older patients with AD.",,"Brewer, G.

1734,The role of Sip1 in cranial neural crest development,"Smad-interacting protein 1 (Sip1/Zeb2/Zfhx1b) is a highly conserved member of the two-handed zinc finger homeodomain family of transcriptional repressors that have been shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during tumor progression. Furthermore, Sip1 is involved in neural and anterior-posterior patterning during embryonic development. Truncation of Sip1 proteins is also implicated in neural crest-related disorders; Mowat-Wilson syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease. We have begun to investigate the spatiotemporal expression pattern and function of Sip1 in the neural crest during chick embryonic development. Loss-of-function experiments were performed using translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides, which were injected after the onset of neural development, to assess the role of Sip1 during cranial neural crest development. With this approach, we can determine whether Sip1 functions similarly in cancer cells and neural crest EMT and whether it has additional functions during embryonic development. Our results show that loss of Sip1 has no effect on cranial crest specification, but prevents or delays crest migration out of the dorsal neural tube. Future studies will identify the mechanism by which Sip1 regulates migration initiation in these cells.",,"Rogers, C.;Bronner-Fraser, M.",2011,2022-08-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.05.416,0,0,
1735,Lingual dyskinesia and tics: a new presentation of copper metabolism disorder,"Background: Abnormalities of copper metabolism have been associated with neurological disorders affecting movement; however, its diagnosis is difficult to achieve, especially in cases with atypical features. Methods: Case report. Results: A previously healthy 16-year-old man presented with an acute onset of abnormal hemilingual waveform movements, with his tongue deviated to the left in a crooked manner. The movements were suppressed when the patient was asked to stick out the tongue; they did not interfere with swallowing or speech, and did not persist during sleep. Upon examination, sudden, tic-like ballistic movements were observed in all extremities, which could be voluntarily suppressed. Otherwise normal neurological evaluation. Extensive metabolic, hematologic, and serologic investigations were normal. Serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper were low; The 24-hour urine collection revealed normal copper excretion, but the penicillamine challenge showed an increase in urinary copper. These increased values were higher than the norm, but still significantly lower than the diagnostic value for Wilson's disease. Brain MRI was normal. Screening for Wilson's and Huntington's disease was negative. The patient was started on a zinc gluconate supplement. At 8 weeks, movements disappeared, although copper and ceruloplasmin levels did not return to normal. Conclusions: This is the first case that presents an association between copper metabolism disorders, tics and hemilingual dyskinesia in humans.",,"Goez, H. R.;Jacob, F. D.;Yager, J.",2011,May,,0,0,
1736,A young woman presenting with fulminant hepatic failure and severe hemolysis,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 1. Recognize the key clinical features of WilsonaTM disease, including physical examination findings. 2. Manage the treatment of fulminant acute liver failure in WilsonaTM disease. CASE INFORMATION: A 22-year-old female presents with a yellowish discoloration of her eyes for 3 days. and skin. She also noted that her urine was dark and her stools had been light green for 3 weeks, accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. He had never consumed alcohol and took no prescription or over-the-counter medications. He had no previous sexual contact and no significant family medical history. Notably, he had been told he had ""abnormal liver function"" based on a routine blood test done 8 months earlier. He was afebrile with normal hemodynamics. On examination, jaundice with intensely icteric sclera and mild right upper quadrant tenderness were noted with no appreciable hepatomegaly. She was neurologically intact and stool guaiac was negative. His initial labs included creatinine 1.5, hematocrit 20%, platelets 135, bilirubin 59, direct bilirubin 34, AST 195, ALT 27, alkaline phosphatase 14, LDH 1588, albumin 3.1, and INR 3.3. The paracetamol level was 30.5 (upper normal 30). Ophthalmological examination with a slit lamp revealed golden deposits at the level of the descemetaTMs membrane. His serum copper level rose to 220. Although an emergent plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma replacement was started to ameliorate severe intravascular hemolysis and consequent acute renal failure (ARF), he was listed in status 1A for liver transplantation. liver with a presumptive diagnosis of WilsonaTM disease. . Continuous renal replacement therapy was started on day 2 due to worsening AKI (creatinine 2.4) which raised the MELD score from 39 to 48. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation on day 4 and was subsequently discharged. to his home on the 18th day of hospitalization. Rhodanine-stained liver histology revealed cirrhosis with occasional nodules in which all scattered hepatocytes and macrophages contained granular intracytoplasmic copper. IMPLICATIONS/DISCUSSION: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with mutations in the ATP7B gene that affects copper transport from hepatocytes to bile, leading to accumulation of copper in tissues including the liver, brain , the kidneys and the cornea. The disease was first described clinically in 1912 by K. Wilson as progressive hepatolenticular degeneration, reflecting that the primary manifestations of the disease are related to copper deposits in the liver and lenticular nuclei of the brain. Hepatic presentation is highly variable, from asymptomatic to fulminant acute liver failure. Approximately half of the patients are asymptomatic or have chronic liver disease. These patients typically have low ceruloplasmin levels and often (50%) have pathognomonic Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit-lamp examination; they are generally managed as outpatients with chronic chelation and/or zinc therapy. However, fulminant hepatic presentations, more frequent in women than in men (4:1), occur in up to 25% of cases. Key clinical features include rapidly progressive renal tubular disease, Coombs-negative acute intravascular hemolysis, and laboratory inconsistency manifesting only as mildly elevated serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, but extremely elevated bilirubin levels. Acute hepatocellular necrosis leads to the release of copper ions into the circulation with toxic oxidative effects on red blood cell metabolic pathways and consequent hemolysis, as well as renal failure. In cases of fulminant hepatic failure, acute plasmapheresis is the preferred bridge to liver transplantation, as it can rapidly remove relatively large amounts of copper and relieve hemolysis and further kidney damage. Due to the high mortality and curative potential of transplantation, patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to Wilson's disease have the highest priority category for liver transplantation.",,"Zahiruddin, A.;Leung, S.;LeFrancois, D.",2011,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-011-1814-6,0,0,
1737,"Improvement of oncolytic virus therapy by an angiogenesis inhibitor, ATN-224","Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are genetically modified viruses specifically designed to kill only cancer cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, post-OV inoculation angiogenic and inflammatory responses have significantly limited the efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) in clinical trials. Physiologic levels of copper support angiogenesis and can inhibit replication of wild-type HSV. Here, we tested whether the efficacy of OV could be enhanced with ATN-224, a second-generation analog of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a copper chelating agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Wilson's disease and currently under investigation. as an antiangiogenic and antineoplastic agent in clinical trials. Under serum copper concentration, both OV replication and glioma cell killing were significantly inhibited (P < 0.001). ATN-224 treatment rescued this copper-mediated inhibition of OV replication and cytotoxicity in vitro (P < 0.01). Antitumor efficacy was evaluated in vivo using two xenograft glioma models. First, mice implanted with subcutaneous U251T3 gliomas were treated with PBS, ATN-224, OV, or OV + ATN224 (n = 10). Mean tumor size in the OV + ATN224 group was significantly smaller than in the OV alone group (21.51 vs. 153.93 mm < P = 0.0383). Mice implanted with intracranial U87deltaEGFR gliomas were then treated as described above (n=8). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a longer median survival in the OV + ATN224 group than in the group treated with OV alone (43,875 days vs. 24,000 days). To test a biological explanation for this enhanced efficacy, we evaluated U251T3 tumors from OV-treated mice that received co-treatment with ATN-224 or PBS. Analysis revealed that ATN-224-treated tumors had significantly increased viral presence in vivo compared to PBS-treated tumors. This result was observed when OV was administered both intratumorally (P < 0.05) and intravenously. Therefore, the reduction in tumor growth and increased survival previously shown in vivo could be associated with increased viral replication. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that co-treatment of ATN-224 with OV can significantly improve the poor efficacy profile of conventional clinical oncolytic virotherapy.",,"Pradarelli, J.;Yoo, J.

1738,Clinical Case: Catatonia as a presenting symptom of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. The clinical manifestations are caused by the deposition of copper in different parts of the body. Psychiatric symptoms (mood and psychotic) may be presenting symptoms in 25% of patients with Wilson's disease. Case description: 19-year-old male patient who presented with refusal to eat, sleep disorders, posture maintenance, excitement, echopraxia, perseverance, decreased self-care, minimal speech, distrust that people are against him and argue on it for 2 months. He had no past or family history of mental illness. On mental status examination, the patient had decreased psychomotor activity with occasional arousal, negativism, posturing, echoprexia, perseveration, and delusions of reference and persecution. General physical examination and systemic examination were normal. He was diagnosed as catatonic schizophrenia and treated with trifluperazine and 4 ECTs. At subsequent follow-up, the dose of trifluperazine was increased, and within 4 days she developed severe EPS and catatonic symptoms. The Bush-Francis Catatonia rating scale score was 30 at admission. Antipsychotics were discontinued, there was a slow improvement in her EPS, but catatonic symptoms persisted, quetiapine, which has a low propensity for EPS, was started, and ECT was continued. Since he was a young child and was born into a second-degree consanguineous marriage and was sensitive to EPS, we thought in terms of Wilson's disease and did some research. Investigations: Routine investigations were normal and brain MRI revealed no copper deposits in the basal ganglia. The 24-hour urine copper excretion was 2165 mg/l, serum ceruloplasmin 45 u/l, and serum copper 160 Âµg/dl. Slit-lamp examination of the eye and radiographs of the hand were within normal limits. After starting zinc 50 mg tid and ECT, he showed significant improvement in symptoms and was discharged. Conclusion: Catatonia is rarely associated with Wilson's disease. Because effective treatment exists, it is important to make this diagnosis early.",,"Shetageri, V. N.;Bhogale, G. S.;Patil, N. M.;Nayak, R. B.;Chate, S. S.",2011,April,,0,0,
1739,Metabolism of triethylenetetramine and its implication in cancer chemotherapy,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper II chelator and polyamine analog traditionally used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, is currently in phase I clinical trials for cancer in combination with carboplatin. However, the metabolism of TETA has never been thoroughly investigated, which is crucial for its further development in cancer treatment1. The two main TETA metabolites found in humans are N<sup>1</sup>-acetyl-TETA (MAT) and N<sup>1</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-diacetyl -TETA (DAT)<sup>2</sup>. Traditionally, drug acetylation is thought to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The FDA requires that the pharmacological properties of any drug metabolized through the acetylation pathway be investigated in populations with different NAT2 phenotypes. However, our recent clinical study showed that there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic and metabolite profiles of healthy volunteers with fast or slow<sup>3</sup> NAT2 acetylation phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that the enzyme responsible for TETA acetylation is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT). We carried out in vitro drug metabolism assays to identify the enzyme responsible for TETA metabolism. TETA (as substrate) and acetyl-coenzyme A were incubated with human liver microsome and cytosol from 7 individuals in the presence or absence of pentamidine or acetaminophen separately. MAT formation from TETA was detected and measured using our previously published LC-MS method<sup>2</sup>. Both the liver microsome and the cytosol could catalyze the biotransformation of TETA. There is a large difference between individuals in the rate of metabolism in the microsome and cytosol (K<inf>m</inf> range 181 - 12,457 muM, V<inf>max</inf> range 110 - 3,068 pg/min/ mg of protein). Pentamidine, a specific inhibitor of SSAT, could inhibit the reaction and increase Km by more than 30%. While paracetamol, a specific inhibitor of NAT2, did not show any inhibition effect. The same experiments had been performed in rat liver microsomes and cytosol, and similar results were obtained apart from the K<inf>m</inf> and V<inf>max</inf> values. Two other polyamine analogs, diethylnorspermine and diethylspermine, all of which are under investigation for cancer treatment, were also tested with similar results. The identification of SSAT, never before considered as a xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme, as an enzyme to catalyze the acylation of polyamine analogs is of significant importance in combination cancer chemotherapy. Finding SSAT (rather than NAT2) as the metabolic enzyme for TETA suggests that TETA may be an ideal candidate for combination cancer chemotherapy, since anticancer drugs are rarely metabolized by this pathway; therefore, competition for the drug-metabolizing enzyme is less likely to occur. However, it appears that individuals have different SSAT phenotypes and this must be taken into account when using TETA as a chemotherapeutic agent.",,"Lu, J.;Li, M.;Tingle, M.;Xu, H.;Cooper, G. J.

1740,Abdominal pain and gastritis as side effects of zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease,"Objectives and study: Zinc compounds are commonly used for the treatment of Wilson's disease and are considered safe and well tolerated. However, occasionally patients report abdominal pain and nausea and require a change in drug therapy. Except for reported abdominal pain, these side effects have not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence and characterize the side effects of zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a group of 37 patients (20 women, 17 men, mean age 12 years (6'18 years)) with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease (according to Ferenci score and mutation analysis). They were treated with zinc sulfate for 83.3 (8'344) weeks [median (range)]. All patient complaints were considered as possible adverse drug reactions. Results: Side effects were observed in 12 children (9 women, 3 men, mean age 10.7 years) and all were of gastrointestinal origin: abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. They occurred after 67.1 (8'344) weeks of treatment with zinc sulfate. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 4 patients with severe and persistent abdominal pain and revealed gastritis with mucosal ulceration and negative H. pylori test in all investigated subjects. In 2 children the symptoms resolved with proton pump inhibitors, in another 2 cases an additional conversion to penicillamine was necessary. 2 patients with abdominal pain did not consent to EGD. In the remaining patients, clinical improvement was observed after switching to zinc acetate (2 patients), D-penicillamine (4 patients), or introduction of the alternative zinc sulfate dosage regimen (2 patients). Conclusion: It seems that adverse reactions such as abdominal pain, nausea and even gastritis are relatively frequent in patients treated with zinc sulfate. They can occur at different stages of therapy. In selected patients, an EGD should be performed to detect and treat inflammation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Discontinuation of zinc sulfate is often unavoidable, and conversion to penicillamine or zinc acetate may be a safer option for these patients.",,"Janowska, A.;Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2011,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e318224e326,0,0,
1741,Long-term zinc treatment in children with Wilson's disease and mild liver disease,"Objectives and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder. In pediatric age, most cases have a hepatic presentation: the percentage of children with WD who present isolated elevated aminotransferases ranges between 14% and 88%. It is widely accepted that penicillamine is the first-choice therapy for children with liver disease, while zinc is indicated in presymptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. Optimal medical therapy in patients with isolated elevated serum aminotransferases remains to be established. This reflects the lack of agreement on the classification of WD patients with isolated hypertransaminasemia as presymptomatic cases requiring zinc or liver-onset cases requiring chelating agents. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of exclusive zinc monotherapy in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Methods: All patients with WD referred to our Department of Pediatrics for diagnostic investigation of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. The diagnosis of WD was established in the presence of at least 2 of the following characteristics: a low level of ceruloplasmin (<20 mg/dl), an elevated basal level of copper in the urine (>100 mcg/24 hours), an elevated level urinary copper level after penicillamine challenge test (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), an increased level of hepatic copper (>250 mg/g dry weight). Among the 43 WD patients enrolled, 29 were treated with zinc for a median period of 12 years (range 3.25). Zinc was the initial therapy of choice in 12 cases. Normalization of serum ALT was the main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study. Treatment compliance was assessed on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Of 17 (58%) children treated with penicillamine as first option, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range, 4 to 48) and started zinc maintenance therapy. The remaining 13 (76%) patients with persistent hyper-ALT during penicillamine administration switched to zinc; nine of these (70%) normalized ALT with zinc within a median period of 9.5 months (range, 5 to 151). Eleven (92%) of 12 patients who received zinc alone as a first option had ALT normalization in a median of 14 months (range, 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT in zinc showed poor adherence to treatment. Based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56+/-4 vs. 37+/-2 mg) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy in terms of decopperization was comparable in 2 groups. Conclusion: Although penicillamine therapy is generally used for the initial treatment of WD, the present study has shown that zinc monotherapy can be used as first-line therapy in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation. .",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Della Corte, C.;Vajro, P.;Iorio, R.",2011,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e318224e326,0,1,
1742,Wilson's Disease: Treatment with Integrated Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine and Western Medicine,"Objective: To analyze the results of patients with Wilson's disease, treated with simple Western medicines that integrate traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT). Background: Wilson's disease (WD), or hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation of the ATP7B gene. As WD is an inherited disease of the nervous system that is treatable, early diagnosis and early, lifelong treatment lead to better prognosis. Currently, the best recommended treatment for Wilson's disease is to integrate traditional Chinese and Western medicine. See Wang XP, etc. Neurology in the People's Republic of China: an update. Eur Neurol 2010;64:320-324. Methods: More than 10,000 hospitalized WD patients have been treated by neurologists in China at four WD centers (Hefei, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Changsha), and about 100 WD patients have been surgically treated by OLT. Results: The decision to opt for transplantation is complex and more than a purely medical judgment, and there are even contradictions between the different LD centers, especially the differences between doctors and surgeons. In general, within four years, neurologically affected patients can improve while receiving medical therapy, it showed that for years and even decades, more than 80% of patients treated with WD live basically normal lives with integrated medical treatment. Conclusions: Treatment integrating traditional Chinese medicine and western medicines: penicillamine and sodium dimercaptosuccinate have more significant effects on copper excretion and relatively more side effects. These features make Western medicine more applicable to moderate to severe patients. Although the effect of Gandou Decoction is not as good as that of Penicillamine or Sodium Dimercaptosuccinate, these elements make TCM especially suitable for mild and moderate patients or taking in combination with Western medicine. Also, the TCM herbs contained in Gandou decoction are mostly rich in zinc. In this case, the Gandou Decoction can be taken simultaneously with the Zinc preparation, as they can reciprocally reinforce the expelling effects of copper. Therefore, before choosing a drug, we should know the decoppering amount of each type of drug, and then select the drugs with better effects and less side effects.",,"Wang, X. P.;Li, W.;Wang, J.

1743,Wilson's disease: a Canadian perspective on presentation and clinical outcomes in an adult outpatient setting.,"Objective: To review the clinical experience with Wilson's disease followed in a single-centre liver and movement disorders clinic (LC) (MDC) in Toronto, Canada. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is rare in Western countries. Therefore, long-term follow-up and experience are rare. Methods: Retrospective review of medical records of patients diagnosed with WD who attend a LC and MDC. Results: Forty-eight patients were included based on the Leipzig criteria. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 26.8 years in the LC and from 0 to 19.8 years in the MDC. Fourteen patients presented asymptomatic, 13 with hepatic symptoms, 15 with neurological symptoms, and 6 with dual hepatic/neurological symptoms. The median age of presentation was >40 years in 12.5%. Initial ceruloplasmin was low in 94% of cases, while 24-h urinary copper was high in 95%. Neurological patients presented a median of 4 symptoms (tremor, dysarthria, and gait abnormalities were the most common), while three patients developed neurological symptoms after diagnosis. Additional psychiatric symptoms were present in 26%. All patients with neurological presentation had KF rings. When MRI was performed, abnormalities were reported in all patients with neurological symptoms, but were normal in patients with pure or asymptomatic liver symptoms. Abnormalities included basal ganglia (62%) and brainstem (50%) lesions, atrophy (50%), and white matter changes (51%). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial treatment (48%), with zinc being the most common at the time of the review (65%). One patient had a successful liver transplant. Side effects were more prominent with DP (41%). Neurological deterioration occurred in 11 subjects due to PD or noncompliance, but 9 showed recovery. With neurological presentation, 14/21 had improved at the time of review. In total there was one death. Conclusions: WD remains a diverse disease with generally favorable outcomes for those who respond to initial therapy. However, evidence of compensated liver damage and structural brain damage are common and emphasize the need for close follow-up and adherence to therapy in liver and movement disorder clinics.",,"Moores, A.;Hirschfield, G.;Lang, T.;Fox, S.

1744,Gait disturbance in a patient with Wilson's disease 18 years after disease onset,"Objective: To describe the gait disturbances in a patient who has presented clinical signs of Wilson's disease for 18 years. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that leads to excessive accumulation of copper inside and outside the liver. A wide spectrum of neurological symptoms including dystonia, parkinsonian features, cerebellar and medullary signs is very common and can severely affect a patient's quality of life. Although gait disturbance is a fairly prominent neurological sign in Wilson's disease, the characteristics of gait abnormalities have not been described in detail in the literature. Methods: This 51-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 33 after a 2-year history of severe arm and head tremor that resulted in significant impairment of his ability to work. . Irritable and aggressive behavior was present at disease onset and worsened in the first few years after diagnosis. He reported a marked deterioration in symptoms after changing treatment from D-penicillamine to zinc sulfate in the late 1990s. Despite D-penicillamine being reintroduced, the ability to walk has remained difficult since then and the patient has been strapped into a walker to overcome his gait disorder in an appropriate way. A recent urinalysis showed that copper was effectively removed by D-penicillamine. Results: On neurological examination, the patient showed a complex gait disorder that included features of severe (gait-specific) dystonia, as well as gait apraxia and gait block (FOG), respectively. As he walked sideways along the wall, he used a simple cue to improve his gait impairment. Otherwise, no significant impairment of leg motility and marked dystonia could be observed when sitting or lying down. Some frontal signs were positive in this patient, however, pyramidal signs were missing. Conclusions: This is an illustrative case showing a particular pattern of gait disturbances with a combination of FOG and dystonia. Although dystonia is well known in patients with Wilson's disease, FOG is unusual and could reflect the involvement of different neuroanatomical structures beyond the pathology of the basal ganglia.",,"Brugger, F.;Felbecker, A.;Haegele-Link, S.;Tettenborn, B.;Kaegi, G.",2011,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23764,0,0,
1745,Pale dystonia surgery in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease is a disease characterized by an increased copper content in the liver and brain. Surgical intervention has been limited in Wilson's disease, as most symptoms can be reversed with medical treatment. However, certain symptoms such as disabling tremors are resistant to drug therapy and may require surgical intervention. Clinical case: A 20-year-old female patient with Wilson's disease since she was four years old, presented with jaundice. She was treated for the next nine years with penicillamine, trientine, and zinc for various time intervals. At age thirteen it worsened to the point of developing a tremor, with difficulty writing. Treatment with trihexyphenidyl, tetrabenazine, and injectable botulinum toxin was started, and the dose of penicillamine was increased. At the age of fifteen, she was admitted to the emergency room due to lack of response, hypotension, papilledema, suspicion of hepatic encephalopathy. CSF revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein, viral serology in serum CSF was negative, serum mycoplasma IgM was positive. He received treatment with intravenous Acyclovir, Azithromycin and pulses of Methyl prednisolone, Dopa was added. The patient was unable to eat or swallow. She was bedridden and unable to walk. [Video 1]. She was treated with high-dose penicillamine at 3 g/day for a period of two years. He partially recovered and had significant residual dystonia, akinesia, and rigidity. She was unable to speak clearly and was confined to a wheelchair. His bradykinesia would partially respond to dopa replacement with worsening of the dyskinesia of the mouth. [Video 2] He underwent DBS - Globus pallidal internal electrode placement with IPG placement under general anesthesia. After surgery in serial follow-ups her tone, mobility has improved, with minimal assistance in mobility. She is on penicillamine tablets 1500 mg per day with zinc [Video 3]. Conclusions: This girl with Wilson's disease had persistent dystonia, parkinsonism, mutism causing significant disability despite adequate medical treatment, and thereafter improved with deep brain stimulation (DBS) which had never been attempted in the past in dystonia due to Wilson's disease.

1746,Outcome and management of 207 pregnancies in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Lifelong medical treatment is necessary to maintain copper homeostasis. Optimal treatment regimens in pregnant women are under debate with respect to abortion rate, teratogenicity, and therapeutic efficacy. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients and methods: A total of 207 pregnancies in 100 WD patients in European tertiary care centers were retrospectively analyzed. Medical regimens (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc salts, or a combination of a chelator and zinc) were classified, and charts were reviewed for maternal neurological or hepatic impairment during pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes and abortion rate were analyzed with respect to maternal treatment and disease presentation. Results: Worsening of liver function tests was evident in 10 cases and occurred in all treatments to a similar degree. Hepatic function resolved after delivery in all cases. Neurological deterioration in pregnancy was rare and was seen in only 2 cases (one with zinc, one with D-penicillamine therapy), but resulted in permanent worsening of neurological symptoms. The overall abortion rate was 48/207 (23.2%) in the study group. Of these, 46 abortions were recorded within the first three months; two stillbirths were associated with placental insufficiency. The abortion rate with treatment with trientine (8/20; 40%; p=0.04) was higher than with D-penicillamine (14/96; 14.7%) or zinc (2/19; 10.5 %). We observed birth defects in 2/159 newborns: one child had partial esophageal atresia (under D-penicillamine therapy from the mother), another child was diagnosed with a Glu-6-P-DH deficiency (under zinc therapy). Conclusion: In most cases, liver function control was maintained during pregnancy regardless of the chosen medical regimen. Neurological deterioration was rare but resulted in severe disability in two cases. Therefore, careful follow-up of patients with WD during pregnancy is recommended. Contrary to previous reports, we observed a higher rate of spontaneous abortions under trientine treatment. Potential teratogenicity remains a concern, especially under D-penicillamine therapy.",,"Weiss, K.

1747,A new and unexpected antioxidant-like activity for the classic copper-chelating drug penicillamine,"Penicillamine (beta, beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been widely used clinically as a copper chelating agent for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provided marked protection against the cytotoxicity induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a major toxic metabolite of pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative, in human fibroblasts, whereas other classical copper chelating agents, like batocuproin disulfonate, they do not. the autoxidation process of TCHQ producing the reactive radical tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ<sup>-</sup>) was studied by ESR and UV-visible spectral methods. We found, unexpectedly, that the autoxidation process of TCHQ and the time course of TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical formation were markedly delayed by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. in contrast, no retarding effect on the autoxidation of TCHQ was observed with the classic copper chelating agent, batocuproin disulfonate. HPLC-MS and ESR studies showed that the TCSQ<sup>-</sup> moiety was reduced to TCHQ by penicillamine, which was at the same time oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that the protective effects of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity were not due to its binding to copper, but rather to its reduction of the reactive TCSQ<sup>-</sup> moiety to much less reactive TCHQ. This is the first report demonstrating a novel unexpected antioxidant-like activity for this copper-chelating aminothiol drug, which could be highly relevant to the biological activities of penicillamine.",,"Zhu, B.

1748,Triple liver transplantation for recurrent autoimmune hepatitis initially masked as fulminant Wilson's disease,"In 2006, a 15-year-old patient presented with symptoms of acute decompensated liver failure that required a list for liver transplantation (LTx). Other laboratory tests suggested Wilson's disease, as serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were significantly reduced and copper excretion was markedly increased by penicillamine intake. Genetic analysis confirmed compound heterozygosis for Wilson's disease presenting two heterozygous mutations in exon 14 and 20 of the ATP7B gene, respectively. In addition to apparently confirming Wilson's diagnosis, post-LTx histology was consistent with a decompensated course of Wilson's disease resulting in liver cirrhosis. Over the next 28 months, he developed numerous episodes of acute rejection that were responsive to high-dose steroids but recurred despite high-dose CNI and mTOR-based immunosuppressive regimens, ultimately resulting in chronic allograft failure requiring a new list of LTx. Upon return to LTx, her clinical course was again characterized by recurrent rejection episodes resistant to conventional treatment regimens leading once again to allograft failure with cirrhosis and the requirement to return to LTx via living donation from her mother at 21 months. after the second LTx. Before the third LTx, she was preconditioned with plasmapheresis and Rituximab to prevent recurrence of allograft failure due to potentially antibody-mediated damage. However, despite this and maximal immunosuppression including alemtuzumab, photopheresis, and plasmapheresis after re-re-LTx, our patient developed recurrent rejection episodes and signs of early-onset graft failure and cirrhosis. Throughout its entire clinical course, representative liver biopsy histologies repeatedly showed infiltrates of cellular rejection combined with signs of interface hepatitis, cholangitis, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and progressive fibrosis. Careful reassessment of his case revealed that Wilson's diagnosis was not entirely accurate, but that the culprit was recurrent LKM-positive autoimmune hepatitis initially masked by Wilson's disease. Subsequently, our patient received steroids and azathioprine with results yet to be determined.",,"Kroemer, A.;Doenecke, A.;Schnitzbauer, A.;Kirchner, G.;Farkas, S.;Loss, M.;Geissler, E.

1749,Ten Chinese pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD, MIM #277900) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to systemic accumulation of copper and multi-organ damage. In pediatric patients, hepatic manifestations predominate. Untreated WD causes progressive hepatic and neurological deterioration. Early treatment is the most effective way to prevent these serious results. Objective and Methods: We present our experience in the management of 10 pediatric patients with WD. Data on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, ultrasound findings, liver biopsies, genetic studies, treatment and evolution were studied. Results: Our patients were between 2 and 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis. 1 patient presented with liver failure. 7 had incidentally detected abnormal liver functions. 2 were diagnosed through sibling screening. The most consistent abnormal liver function was elevated alanine transaminase ranging from 60 to 419 IU/L (<58). Ceruloplasmin levels were all <0.1 g/l (0.21-0.59). Mean urinary copper excretion was 4 Âµmol/day (<1.0). 1 patient was initially treated with penicillamine and another with trientine. 7 patients started treatment with zinc. Everything remained fine at follow-up. Conclusion: Our patients represent a group of asymptomatic patients with WD diagnosed and treated very early. With good adherence to treatment, a favorable outcome can be anticipated. One way to diagnose these presymptomatic patients is by monitoring for abnormal liver functions.",,"Hui, J.;Chiang, G. P.

1750,Hypersomnia in Wilson's disease,"Background and significance: Wilson's disease (WD) shows wide heterogeneity in symptoms. In this case report we present hypersomnia as an unusual symptom in an unusual case of WD. Case: 48-year-old woman admitted for cognitive impairment for 2 years. His complaints such as fatigue, decreased level of concentration and depression began 3 years ago. There was no family history of psychiatric or other neurological diseases. No abnormality was found on neurological examination. A moderate elevation in liver function tests was found, but viral hepatitis markers were negative. Diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin level, increased urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum copper level. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was not detectable. Brain MRI revealed increased T1 signal lesions in both globus pallidus. The electroencephalogram showed diffuse slow waves in the bilateral hemisphere without epileptiform discharge. Liver biopsy showed the presence of nuclear glycogen, a brownish cytoplasmic pigment in hepatocytes, and a minimal degree of periportal fibrosis. At 8-10 months after the start of D-penicillamine therapy, her complaints gradually resolved. Within a year of resolution, she became more sleepy and hypersomnolent. He spent more than 2/3 of the day sleeping. After administration of 20 mg of methylphenidate, he became almost alert and negativism gradually improved. Conclusions or comments: Hypersomnia was the main symptom in this patient. Although neurological presentations of WD without Kayser-Fleischer rings have already been reported, the lack of Kayser-Fleischer rings and the unusual clinical symptom demonstrate that this patient is a highly exceptional WD patient.",,"Kim, S.",2011,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000327701,0,0,

His complaints such as fatigue, decreased level of concentration and depression began 3 years ago. He developed behavioral changes, emotional lability, restlessness and agitation. There was no specific family history. No abnormality was found on physical and neurological examination. A moderate elevation in liver function tests was found, but all markers for viral hepatitis and VDRL were negative. No toxic or infectious diseases were detected. The initial diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin level, increased urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum copper. The Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring was not detected. Brain MRI revealed increased T1 signal in both globus pallidus. EEG showed diffuse slow waves without epileptiform discharge. Liver biopsy was performed 3 years after the onset of symptoms and showed the presence of nuclear glycogen with cytoplasmic brownish pigment in hepatocytes and a minimal degree of periportal fibrosis, but no signs of hepatitis or other liver disease were detected. Changes in EM included mitochondrial swelling and cristae defragmentation. No evidence of hepatic encephalopathy was found. The blood ammonia level was normal. At 8-10 months after the start of D-penicillamine therapy, her complaints gradually resolved. Within a year of resolution, she became episodically more drowsy and more hypersomnolent.

1752,IPS technology and its implications for cell and gene therapy,"The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells by exogenous factors opens a new era of possibilities for regenerative medicine. Potentially, once safety concerns are overcome, differentiated lineages derived from patient-specific iPSCs could be used for transplant purposes and this would change the way we perceive medicine today. However, for patients with genetic diseases, it will be necessary to correct the mutation, otherwise the functional defect will remain. And the same can be said for other acquired diseases in which viruses can access cells through a specific receptor, for example AIDS. To overcome these problems, there is growing interest in applying zinc finger technology to correct mutations or delete genes. But this technology has limitations and is long. In this regard, gene therapy of iPSCs or their differentiated progeny using clinically approved vectors could be a valuable possibility. Here we describe the generation of iPSCs from a Chinese patient with Wilson's disease carrying the Chinese hotspot mutation R778L in the ATP7B gene, the product of which is a liver enzyme responsible for the export of copper to bile and blood. These iPSCs were pluripotent and could be readily differentiated into functional hepatocytes showing abnormal cytoplasmic localization of mutated ATP7B and defective copper transport. Importantly, gene correction using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector expressing codon-optimized ATP7B could reverse the functional defect. In the future, similarly genetically corrected iPSC hepatocytes may also be an option for autologous transplantation in Wilson's disease. Notably, we also provide a proof-of-principle that our iPSC-based experimental model can be used to screen compounds aimed at correcting the anomaly.",,"Pei, D.",2011,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mt.2011.85,0,0,
1753,Zinc therapy in neurological Wilson's disease during pregnancy: a case report and review of the literature,"Objective: To report our experience in the management of zinc therapy during pregnancy in a patient affected by neurological Wilson's disease, in parallel with a review of the literature on this topic. Methods: We treated a patient affected by neurological Wilson's disease with decreased doses of zinc during pregnancy, due to her poor adherence to the full dose while in this condition. Throughout the pregnancy, the patient underwent clinical and laboratory evaluations every two months, including a comprehensive evaluation of copper balance. Results: Urinary copper excretion and serum zinc levels were below the proposed effective therapeutic ranges in all determinations. However, serum free copper levels were always within therapeutic ranges, and both liver and neurological function remained fairly stable throughout pregnancy, confirming good compliance with the reduced therapeutic program and supporting its efficacy. Fetal development, periodically monitored by ultrasound studies, was normal and the patient finally gave birth to a healthy, full-term baby. Conclusions: Based on the literature, we confirm that zinc therapy is safe and effective during pregnancy. Furthermore, our data provide additional evidence that serum ""free copper"" levels would be more sensitive than urinary copper excretion for monitoring adherence to zinc therapy and evaluating the efficacy of such treatment.",,"Bianchi, M.

1754,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder of copper metabolism secondary to mutations in the ATP7B gene. This gene encodes a protein ATPase, which is responsible for the excretion of copper from billiards. This results in the accumulation of copper in the liver and then in other organs, such as the brain. Since the first reports in the 1990s, more than 400 mutations have been identified in various populations around the world. Neurological manifestations, which appear in the second or third decade, are the initial presentation in approximately half of the patients and can be highly variable. Most cases have a neurological clinical picture with a wide range of combinations of dysarthria, tremor, gait disturbances, dystonia, and parkinsonism. The diagnosis of WD can be suspected in all patients with chronic progressive movement disorder of unknown aetiology, especially if the onset is in the second or third decade of life. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of people with WD is important as early treatment stops disease progression and can reverse established liver and brain damage to some extent. The first diagnostic step for the diagnosis of WD is a sound clinical suspicion. No single test is definitive and there is no universally accepted biochemical ""gold standard"" here. The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and the combination of the results of several tests. The main diagnostic procedures in WD are: slit-lamp examination, serum ceruloplasmin level, urinary copper excretion (UCE), UCE penicillamine challenge, hepatic copper concentration, MRI imaging, and genetic testing to detect ATP7B gene mutations . In this presentation, the diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease will be discussed. The goal of pharmacological treatment of Wilson's disease is to restore copper balance. The main drugs used are chelating agents such as d-penicillamine and trientine or zinc salts to limit the gastrointestinal absorption of copper. Orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated for patients with fulminant hepatic failure and for those with severe and chronic hepatic failure who do not respond to drug therapy.",,"Barbosa, E.

1755,Efficacy and safety of D-penicillamine and trientine for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that leads to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first-line therapy of symptomatic patients, but optimal regimens have yet to be established. Clinical data on larger cohorts comparing these binders are limited. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of d-penicillamine and trientine in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients and Methods: A total of 350 patients with WD in European tertiary care centers and patients contributed by the EUROWILSON database research group were retrospectively analysed. Binding-based medical regimens were analyzed for efficacy, adverse events, and reasons for discontinuation using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Treatments lasting less than 6 months were censored. Results: Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 221 (63.1%) and 119 (34%) patients, respectively. Patients were initially treated with d-penicillamine (n = 309) or trientine (n = 41). Medication changes were common in both groups, resulting in a total of 514 treatments analyzed (d-penicillamine n = 350, trientine n = 164). Actuarial transplant-free survival (median follow-up: 16.5 years) was similar (death: d-penicillamine n = 7/350, trientine n = 3/164; progression to liver transplant: d-penicillamine 12/350, trientine 2/ 164). In the d-penicillamine group, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were more frequent (p = 0.045) and occurred even after decades of treatment. For the latest available time point of a 48-month follow-up, liver impairment occurred in only 8/514 treatments (d-penicillamine n = 3, trientine n = 5, p = ns). However, neurological deterioration was less frequent in the d-penicillamine group (7/350 treatments) compared to trientine (12/164, p = 0.005) while improvement in symptomatic neurological patients was recorded to a similar degree. (d-penicillamine 84/139; trientine 42/79, p = ns). Interestingly, liver improvement in symptomatic patients was seen more frequently with d-penicillamine (211/235) than with trientine (64/86, p < 0.05). Conclusion: In most patients, treatment with chelating agents was effective, leading to comparable and favorable actuarial transplant-free survival. The main limitation in treatment with d-penicillamine was the higher rate of adverse events. Neurological deterioration under chelation therapy was rare and contrary to our expectation more frequent in patients treated with trientine.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Schots, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1756,Wilson's disease with coexisting autoimmune hepatitis. case report,"Wilson's disease [WD], an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in individuals with mutant ATP7B genes, occurs in all ethnic and geographic populations, with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 30 million. WD can present clinically as liver disease, as a progressive neurological disorder, or as a psychiatric illness. The spectrum of liver disease found in patients with WD can be highly variable, from asymptomatic with only biochemical abnormalities to acute liver failure. Because de novo genetic diagnosis is currently expensive and not universally available, a combination of clinical findings and biochemical tests is usually needed to establish the diagnosis of WD. We describe a 19-year-old woman who presented with classic features of WD and several features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The patient was initially diagnosed with AIH and treated with standard corticosteroids [60 mg prednisolone daily] with initial clinical improvement elicited, but subsequent deterioration. The diagnosis of WD was made 4 moons after the initial diagnosis of HAI. Subsequent diagnosis of WD and introduction of penicillamine [1 g daily] gave excellent improvement and normalization of liver function tests. We assume that concurrent WD and AIH cannot be excluded in this case. Therefore, in patients with AIH, a thorough evaluation of WD is necessary, particularly when the response to steroid therapy is poor. Conversely, in patients suffering from WD with overlapping features of AIH, a combination of steroids and penicillamine may be beneficial.",,"Vashakidze, E.;Gegeshidze, T.;Buachidze, T.",2011,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-010-9241-z,0,0,

Objective To review the aetiology of acute liver failure, discuss the evidence behind intensive care management strategies, and examine possible treatment alternatives to OLT. Methods Literature review using Ovid, PubMed, and recent conference abstracts. Results Paracetamol remains the most common aetiology of acute liver failure in developed countries, while acute viral aetiologies predominate elsewhere. Cerebral edema is a leading cause of death, and its prevention and prompt recognition are vital components of intensive care support, which strives to provide multi-organ support and ""buy time"" to allow for organ regeneration or psychological evaluation and physical prior to acquisition from a donor. Organ. Artificial liver support systems do not improve mortality in acute liver failure, whereas most other interventions have limited evidence bases to support their use. Conclusion Acute liver failure remains a truly difficult condition to manage and requires early recognition and transfer of patients to specialized centers that provide intensive, multidisciplinary support and, in some cases, OLT.

1767,Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) in children with Wilson's disease: experience at King's College Hospital and review of the literature,"Our objective was to review our experience with trientine as chelation therapy in children with Wilson's disease (WD) and compare it with that reported in the literature. We did a retrospective review of the medical notes of 16 of 96 (17%) children diagnosed with WD between 1981 and 2006. The children were between 6.6 and 15 years old. Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parental choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine (one) during penicillamine challenge], 13 of 16 switched from penicillamine to trientine due to penicillamine reactions: hematuria in four, bone marrow suppression in three, neutropenia in three. Trientine was discontinued in three due to allergic rash, low copper excretion, and one with compliance problems requiring transplantation. Seventy-five percent of the children had chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen in eight of 16, the Wilson Ferenci score ranged from 4 to 10 (nl < 4). Laboratory indices remained relatively stable. Consistent with previous reports, trientine was mainly used as a secondary treatment when there were serious side effects with penicillamine. Although the current evidence is of low quality, it appears that trientine is as effective as penicillamine, and small population studies show a lower side effect profile.",,"Taylor, R.

1768,Copper complexing agents as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"The notion that copper dysfunction is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on a number of observations from clinical and in vitro studies, as well as in animal models. However, there is still great controversy about whether copper excess or deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that excess copper contributes to AD, but experimental evidence in transgenic mouse models seems to suggest otherwise, and at least one clinical study shows that cognitive decline is positively correlated with low copper levels. We have recently reported on a deregulation of the ceruloplasmin-copper ratio, specific to AD patients, which consists of an increase in the pool of copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, that is, 'free' copper. This phenomenon could explain the contrasting results obtained in clinical studies. Several clinical trials have been attempted in search of an anti-metal effect that counteracts the progression of AD. Some of them have produced encouraging results indicating that ""metal protein attenuating compounds"" can positively alter disease progression. This review summarizes these clinical trials and provides an overview of those that are ongoing and in preparation.

1769,Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as markers of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disease (Review),"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, due to the hemodynamic and metabolic complications of liver cirrhosis. During CLD, the extracellular matrix undergoes a remodeling process, leading to the formation and deposition of new collagen. Tissue remodeling is regulated by fine molecular mechanisms, involving proteases, inhibitors, and growth factors. The major role in matrix degradation is played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a class of zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes, and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). Along with the progress of diagnostic techniques, leading to more accurate and less invasive methods, the concept of monitoring has gained importance for the clinical management of CLD. In the current state of our knowledge, liver biopsy continues to represent an essential procedure for the staging of liver disease. However, despite its importance, liver biopsy has some limitations: the risk of underestimation of a disease is the most significant, since liver lesions are often irregularly located within the liver. In parallel with the limitations of liver biopsy, the clinical needs for early identification of progressive fibrosis require the development of additional non-invasive techniques. In this review we discuss the main issues related to this important clinical need. In addition, we focus on the role of MMPs and TIMPs in the pathogenesis of CLD, as well as their possible use as non-invasive serum markers of inflammation and fibrosis in this pathology.",,"Consolo, M.;Amoroso, A.;Spandidos, D.

1770,Screening of copper-thiomolybdate complexes in a prospective treatment for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a human genetic disorder that causes a buildup of copper in the liver and brain. Treatments such as copper chelation therapy or dietary zinc supplementation can ameliorate the effects of the disease, but left untreated, they lead to hepatitis, neurological complications, and death. Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising new treatment for Wilson's disease that has been demonstrated both in an animal model and in clinical trials. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that TTM acts as a new copper chelator, forming a complex with copper accumulated in the liver. We have used X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence imaging to trace the molecular shape and distribution of the complex in the liver and kidney of an animal model of human Wilson's disease.

1773,New developments in the regulation of intestinal copper absorption,"Copper, a transition metal, is an essential trace element involved in many enzymatic processes that require redox chemistry. The redox activity of copper is potentially harmful. Serious imbalance of copper homeostasis can occur with some inherited disorders of copper metabolism. Copper is acquired from the diet by intestinal absorption and is subsequently distributed throughout the body. The regulation of intestinal copper absorption to maintain copper homeostasis throughout the body is currently poorly understood. This review evaluates novel findings regarding the molecular mechanism of intestinal copper absorption. The role of newly identified transporters in copper uptake and excretion by enterocytes in the portal circulation is described, and the regulation of dietary copper uptake during physiological and pathophysiological conditions is discussed.

1774,Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder that leads to the accumulation of copper in tissues, primarily the liver and brain. The genetic defect is in the gene that encodes P-type ATPase (ATP7B). Inheritance is autosomal recessive. To date, more than 500 mutations have been described that cause Wilson's disease. The most frequent mutation in Central Europe is the H1069Q mutation. The manifestation of Wilson's disease is usually hepatic or neurological. The hepatic form is manifested by acute or chronic hepatitis, steatosis, or cirrhosis. Neurological involvement usually manifests after 20 years of age by motor disturbances (tremor, speech disturbances, writing problems), which can evolve into a severe extrapyramidal syndrome with tremor, rigidity, dysarthria, dysphagia and muscle contracture. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory tests (neurological symptoms, liver disease, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high serum free copper concentration, high urine copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by liver copper concentration in a liver biopsy or by genetic testing. Untreated disease leads to the death of a patient. Treatment is based on chelating agents that decrease the copper content by excretion in the urine (D-penicillamine, trientine) or agents that prevent the absorption of copper from food (zinc, ammonium-tetrahyomolybdenum). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease should also be treated. In the Czech Republic penicillamine or zinc are used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. Detection in the families of affected patients (all siblings) is obvious.",,"Bruha, R.;Marecek, Z.;Martasek, P.;Nevsimalova, S.;Petrtyl, J.;Urbanek, P.;Kalistova, H.;Pospisilova, L.",2009,,,0,0,

[Chinese],"Objective To investigate the clinical character and therapeutic effect of late-onset Wilson's disease and to provide some evidence for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods The clinical character, changes in copper metabolism, and therapeutic effect were analyzed in 8 patients with late-onset Wilson's disease. Ceruloplasmin level was measured by nephelometry, and serum, urine, and liver copper contents were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Initial treatment was sodium dimercaptosulfonate, followed by D-penicillamine and/or zinc. Results Patients with late-onset Wilson's disease accounted for 7.0% of all patients, who presented with symptoms of liver disease such as loss of appetite or nausea in the early stage and were easily misdiagnosed. His blood routine and aminotransferase levels were normal in most patients with late-onset Wilson's disease, and all patients had Kayser-Fleisher rings. There was a significant difference between liver function and copper metabolite testing. The mean urinary copper content was 4072 mg/24 h on the first day after administration of sodium dimercaptosulfonate, which was 18.1 times higher than before treatment and 2.5 times higher than that of D-penicillamine. No obvious adverse reactions were observed. The prognosis used to be good. Conclusion Sufficient attention should be given to late-onset Wilson's disease, which is not rare and easy to misdiagnose.

1778,Liver disease in pregnancy,"Liver diseases in pregnancy can be classified into liver disorders that occur only in the context of pregnancy and liver diseases that occur in conjunction with pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia/eclampsia, hemolysis syndrome, elevated liver tests and low platelets (HELLP), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are specific disorders of pregnancy that can cause elevated liver tests and liver dysfunction. Chronic liver diseases including cholestatic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and viral hepatitis can also be seen during pregnancy. Management of liver disease in pregnancy requires collaboration between obstetricians and gastroenterologists/hepatologists. Treatment of pregnancy-specific liver disorders generally involves delivery of the fetus and supportive care, whereas treatment of chronic liver disease in pregnancy is directed at optimizing control of the liver disorder.

1779,Chelation in metal poisoning,"Chelation therapy is the preferred medical treatment to reduce the toxic effects of metals. Chelating agents are capable of binding toxic metal ions to form complex structures that are easily excreted from the body by removing them from intracellular or extracellular spaces. 2,3-Dimercaprol has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning; however, its serious side effects have led researchers to develop less toxic analogs. Hydrophilic chelators such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid effectively promote renal excretion of metals, but their ability to access intracellular metals is weak. Newer strategies have recently been reported to address these drawbacks, such as combination therapy (use of structurally different chelating agents) or co-administration of antioxidants. In this review we provide an update on existing chelating agents and the various strategies available for the treatment of metalloid and heavy metal poisoning. Â© 2010 by the authors.",,"Flora, S. J.

1780,Cognitive profile and structural findings in Wilson's disease: a neuropsychological and MRI-based study.,"Background: Systematic studies on the neuropsychological profile in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) are few and far between. Objective: To examine the profile of cognitive deficits and their findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with WD. Patients and Methods: Twelve confirmed WD patients (age at onset and evaluation, 13.7+/-11.2 and 21.7+/-5.3 years, respectively; MF ratio, 7:5) on copper therapy. constituted the study sample. A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered that measured mental speed, motor speed, sustained attention, focused attention, verbal category fluency, verbal working memory, response inhibition, planning, concepts, the ability to change sets, verbal and visual learning and memory. Phenotypic details and observations on brain MRI performed within six months of neuropsychological evaluation were documented. Results: Neuropsychological evaluation elicited cognitive deficits in multiple domains in all but one patient, who had a normal MRI. Percentage of patients in the deficit range in various domains included: motor speed: 73%; verbal working memory, sustained and focused attention: 50%; verbal learning: 42%; visual-constructive ability, verbal memory, mental speed: 33%-34%; verbal fluency, ability to change scenery, visual memory, verbal memory: 25%-27%; and verbal recognition: 17%. Magnetic resonance imaging was normal in three patients and revealed variable abnormalities in the rest: cerebral atrophy in 3; brainstem atrophy in 2; signal changes in the basal ganglia in 9; and brainstem signal changes in 5. None had subcortical white matter changes. Two patients with normal MRI showed cognitive deficits. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the complex cognitive and brain changes seen on MRI in WD.

1783,Clinical application of liver magnetic resonance imaging in Wilson's disease,"Objective: to determine if there is a correlation between liver MRI findings and clinical manifestations and severity of liver dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease. Materials and Methods: Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated MR images of the liver in 50 patients with Wilson's disease. The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was waived. MR images were evaluated with a focus on liver contour abnormalities and the presence of intrahepatic nodules. Using Fisher's exact test, MRI findings were compared with clinical presentations (neurological and non-neurological) and liver dysfunction, which was classified according to the Child-Pugh classification system (A, B and C ). Follow-up MR images were available for 17 patients. Results: Liver contour abnormalities and intrahepatic nodules were observed in 31 patients (62%) and 25 patients (50%), respectively. Each MRI finding showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the three groups of Child-Pugh classifications (A, n = 36; B, n = 5; C, n = 9), except for the splenomegaly (p = 0.243). The mean age of patients with positive MRI was higher than that of patients with negative MRI. For patients with Child-Pugh class A (n = 36) with neurological presentation, intrahepatic nodules, surface nodularity, and widening of the gallbladder fossa were more common. Intrahepatic nodules improved (n=8, 47%), stagnated (n=5, 29%), or worsened (n=4, 24%) on follow-up MR imaging. Conclusion: MRI demonstrates liver contour abnormalities and parenchymal nodules in more than half of patients with Wilson's disease, which correlates with the severity of liver dysfunction and clinical manifestations.",,"Cheon, J.

1787,Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. [German],"Hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are autosomal recessive inherited metabolic diseases that can lead to liver cirrhosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload due to increased duodenal iron absorption, whereas copper overload in Wilson's disease results from poor excretion of copper into the bile. Especially in hemochromatosis but also in Wilson's disease, the last decade has seen extraordinary growth in our understanding of the pathophysiology of both diseases. Hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms may occur in hemochromatosis. Extrahepatic symptoms include cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and endocrine dysfunction. In Wilson's disease, hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms are typical. Although genetic testing for a homozygous HFE C282Y mutation (or a heterozygous compound C282Y/H63D mutation) is very useful in hemochromatosis, genetic analysis of the Wilson gene, ATP7B, is limited by the existence of a plethora of individual mutations. Hemochromatosis is effectively treated with phlebotomies, while Wilson's disease is treated medically with chelators (D-penicillamine and triethylenetetramine) or zinc salts. Liver transplantation is a therapeutic option for both diseases and shows excellent long-term results in Wilson's disease, but less favorable results in hemochromatosis. The prognosis of a sufficiently treated disease is very good for both diseases, especially when the diagnosis is made early in the course of the disease.

1788,The role of garlic in hepatopulmonary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Increased nitric oxide production in cirrhosis has been commonly implicated in the genesis of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Initial studies suggested that garlic, a component of the daily diet, may have a role in treating HPS by altering nitric oxide production. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of oral garlic supplementation on arterial blood gas parameters and overall morbidity and mortality in patients with HPS. METHODS: Twenty-one and 20 patients with HPS were randomly assigned to receive oral garlic supplementation or placebo, respectively, and were evaluated monthly for a period of nine to 18 months. RESULTS: After nine months, garlic supplementation was associated with a 24.66% increase in baseline arterial oxygen levels (83.05 mmHg vs. 66.62 mmHg; P<0.001), compared with only a 7.37% increase (68.75 mmHg vs. 64.05 mmHg; P=0.02) among subjects in the placebo group. There was also a 28.35% decrease in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (21.35 mmHg vs. 29.77 mmHg; P<0.001) among HPS patients receiving garlic, in contrast to a decrease in only the 10.73% (29.11 mmHg vs. 32.61 mmHg; P=0.12). ) among those in the placebo group. After nine months, the arterial oxygen level was significantly higher (83.05 vs. 68.75 mmHg; P<0.001) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was significantly lower (21.35 vs. 29.11 mmHg). mmHg; P<0.001) among patients receiving garlic compared to those receiving placebo. Reversal of HPS was observed in 14 of 21 patients (66.67%) with garlic supplementation (intention-to-treat analysis) and in 1 of 20 patients (5%) with placebo. Two of the 21 patients who received garlic supplements died during follow-up, in contrast to seven of the 20 patients who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Garlic supplementation may be beneficial in HPS patients to reverse intrapulmonary shunts, as well as reduce hypoxemia and mortality. Â©2010 Pulsus Group Inc.

1789,Current status of patients with Wilson's disease in central Japan,"Objective This study evaluated the current status of patients with Wilson's disease in central Japan. Patients and methods Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients were diagnosed with Wilson's disease with an international diagnostic score of 4 or more. The phenotypes, genotypes and post-diagnosis evolution of these patients were analyzed. Results Twenty-six patients had ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson's disease. Four patients had a single mutant chromosome. There were 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871 delC (40%) and 6 new mutations (13%) in our patients. The first clinical manifestation was the hepatic form in 22, the neurological form in 5, and hemolysis in 3 patients. The hepatic form was diagnosed around the age of 13, followed by a neurological complication with a time lag of 9 years. Therefore, some patients, especially patients with the neurological form, did not undergo early diagnostic tests, including analysis of ATP7B. During the post-diagnosis period, 3 patients were hospitalized for recurrent liver disease and 2 patients committed suicide. One female patient died of encephalopathy-associated acute liver failure after fertilization therapy, while 2 male patients recovered from prolonged liver failure without encephalopathy after noncompliance with drug therapy. The King's Scores for liver transplantation were below the cut-off point in both cases. Conclusion To minimize the delay in diagnosis, ceruloplasmin determination and ATP7B analysis can be recommended in patients with liver damage of unknown aetiology. At the time of genetic diagnosis, appropriate management of patients, including compliance education and emotional care to prevent suicide, may be important. 2010 Japan Society of Internal Medicine.

1792,Electroencephalography in stable therapeutic phase of Wilson's disease. [German],"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. In addition to clinical extrapyramidal and hepatic motor symptoms, patients with Wilson's disease also present with subclinical disturbances of other central nerve pathways. Reports of abnormalities detected on EEG recordings are inconsistent and infrequent. Methods: In this study, electroencephalography was performed in 49 patients with Wilson's disease (32 patients with the neurological form, 17 patients with the non-neurological form) undergoing long-term drug therapy. Attention was paid to general slowing, focal abnormalities, and epileptiform activity. EEG results were correlated with clinical manifestations using an established neurological score for Wilson's disease. Results: EEG recordings presented normal results in almost 80% of all investigated patients who presented with the long-term course of the disease. Mild and continuous slow activity occurred in six patients and intermittent rhythmic delta activity was observed in two patients with the neurological form of Wilson's disease. The difference in median alpha rhythm frequency between the neurological and non-neurological forms (9.27/s and 9.63/s, respectively) was negligible. Epileptiform activity was only detected in one patient with coincident epilepsy. Conclusions: Patients with Wilson's disease present normalized electroencephalographic tracings in the course of the disease. Abnormal changes appear to be due to additional abnormalities or secondary complications. In this sense, electroencephalography has demonstrated its usefulness mainly in the differential diagnosis carried out throughout the evolution of the disease.

Methods: This is a descriptive and retrospective study of a series of 17 children and adolescents with Wilson's disease, treated at the Pediatric Hepatology Ambulatory of the Hospital das Clinicas de la Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 1985 to 2008. Data they were collected by review of medical records and during clinical follow-up. Results: The patients were between 2.8 and 15.1 years old, with a mean age of 8.8+/-0.9 years. The main presentation of the disease was hepatic (53%), followed by the asymptomatic form, diagnosed by family screening. Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 41% of patients. Ceruloplasmin was altered in 15 of 17 patients, and urinary copper ranged from 24 to 1000mcg/24h (median: 184mcg/24h). Treatment with D-penicillamine was started in all cases. Mild side effects were observed in five children, with no need to stop or change medication. Clinical and laboratory responses to treatment, with normalization of aminotransferase levels, were shown in 14 patients after a median of 10.7 months. Although treated, three patients died (one due to fulminant hepatitis and two due to severe liver failure). Conclusions: Wilson's disease is rare in the pediatric group. In children, the main presentation is liver disease. Diagnosis can be made by low ceruloplasmin levels and elevated 24-hour urine copper excretion, but requires a high level of suspicion. There is good tolerance and response to medical treatment.",,"Socio, S. D. A.;Ferreira, A. R.;Fagundes, E. D. T.;Roquete, M. L. V.;Pimenta, J. R.;Campos, L. D. F.;Penna, F. J.",2010,June,,0,0,
1794,Current status and new advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper accumulation and toxicity that affects about 30 people per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper transporter P-type ATPase, which is important for excretion of copper into bile, leading to accumulation of copper in the liver. Toxic concentrations of copper can also be found in the brain and kidneys, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical characteristics and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high copper concentrations in liver tissues and Kayser-Fleischer rings, biochemical and immunological markers, neuropathological study by magnetic resonance imaging. magnetic. Genetic studies are also available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited.",,"Kiranmayi, G. V. N.;Ravi Shankar, K.;Chandrasekhar Nainala, V.",2010,December,,0,0,
1795,Wilson's disease: Current concepts in diagnosis and management. [Croatian],"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport that causes accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and cornea. The incidence is estimated at 1:30,000-80,000 in most populations. The Wilson disease gene, now designated ATP7B, located on chromosome 13 (13q14.3), was cloned in 1993. Clinical phenotypes include liver, neurological, and psychiatric diseases, or a combination of these. A combination of clinical features, various laboratory parameters, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are necessary to make the diagnosis. Mutation analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis and is becoming part of the diagnostic algorithm, especially in patients with indeterminate clinical and biochemical characteristics. A family assessment of first degree relatives should be performed. Recognition of the disease at an early stage is crucial because treatment prevents severe liver damage and/or lifelong neurological disabilities. The goal of treatment is to reduce the tissue concentration of copper, either by increasing its urinary excretion or by decreasing its intestinal absorption. Treatment includes copper chelators, such as penicillamine and trientine, as well as zinc salts. Liver transplantation is a treatment option in cases of acute liver failure or severe and refractory advanced liver disease. It is not indicated in patients with mainly neuropsychiatric presentation.",,"Kalauz, M.;Telarovic, S.;Ljubic, H.",2010,,,0,0,

1797,Mutations of the HFE gene and Wilson's disease in Sardinia,"Background: Hypoceruloplasminemia can lead to tissue iron storage in Wilson's disease and the possibility of iron overload should be considered in long-term overtreated patients. The HFE gene encodes a protein that is intimately involved in the intestinal absorption of iron. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of the HFE gene mutation, its role in iron metabolism in patients with Wilson's disease, and the interaction of therapy in copper and iron homeostasis. Methods: Records of 32 patients with Wilson's disease were reviewed for iron and copper indices, HFE gene mutations, and liver biopsy. Results: Twenty-six patients were negative for HFE gene mutations and did not present significant alterations in iron metabolism. The HFE mutation was significantly associated with higher liver iron content (P < 0.02) and transferrin saturation index (P < 0.03). After the treatment period, iron indices were significantly reduced only in the wild-type HFE gene. Conclusions: HFE gene mutations may be an addictive factor in iron overload in Wilson's disease. Our results showed that drug dose adjustment could prevent further overtreatment-induced iron overload only in patients with wild-type HFE.

1798,Risks of copper and iron toxicity during aging in humans,"Copper and iron are essential metals but also toxic. Its essentiality is known, but its toxicity, except for genetic overload diseases, Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis, is not as well known. However, their toxicities are so pervasive in the population that they are an imminent public health problem in the diseases of aging and in the aging process itself. Both metals are transition elements and their resulting redox properties have been utilized during evolution in the development of oxidative power generation. But both contribute to the production of harmful oxidizing radicals in excess. Evolution has maintained excess copper and iron reserves during the reproductive years because they are vital to life. But oxidative damage from these excess metal stores accumulates as we age, and natural selection stops acting after age 50, since later diseases do not contribute to reproductive fitness. Diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and others, can contribute to excess copper and iron. A very disturbing study has found that in the general population those in the top fifth of copper intake, if they are also eating a relatively high-fat diet, lose cognition at three times the normal rate. Inorganic copper in drinking water and supplements is handled differently from copper in food and is therefore more toxic. Trace amounts of copper in drinking water, less than a tenth of what is allowed in human drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency, greatly ameliorated an Alzheimer-like disease in an animal model. In the last part of this review, I will provide tips on how to reduce the risks of copper and iron toxicity. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Brewer, G.

1809,The transition metals copper and iron in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases are a global health problem. Metals such as iron and copper are essential for life, but they are also involved in several neurodegenerative mechanisms such as protein aggregation, free radical generation and oxidative stress. The role of Fe and Cu, their pathogenic mechanisms and their possible therapeutic relevance in four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are discussed. Metal-mediated oxidation by Fenton chemistry is a common feature of all these disorders and is part of a damaging self-amplifying mechanism that leads to neurodegeneration. The interaction between metals and proteins in the nervous system seems to be a crucial factor for the development or absence of neurodegeneration. This review also addresses the proven therapeutic strategies, mainly with metal chelating drugs. The accumulation of metals within the nervous system observed in these diseases could be the result of compensatory mechanisms to improve the availability of metals for physiological processes.

1811,Research Approaches to Therapies for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Importance of the field: In fibrosing diseases, scar tissue begins to replace normal tissue, causing tissue dysfunction. For example, in pulmonary fibrosis, pockets of what resembles scar tissue form in the lungs, impeding patients' ability to breathe. These conditions represent a major source of morbidity and mortality. More than 150,000 people in the US have some type of fibrotic lung disease, and the 5-year mortality rate from these diseases can be as high as 80%. Despite this great unmet medical need, there are no FDA-approved therapies. Although our understanding of the causes and biology of fibrosing diseases remains relatively poor, we have made impressive strides in identifying the major cell populations and many biochemical mediators that may drive this process. As a result, new therapies based on these discoveries are being developed. Areas covered in this review: This review examines experimental therapies currently under investigation at the end of 2009 for an important class of pulmonary fibrosis called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). What the reader will gain: The reader will gain an overview of current experimental therapies for IPF.

1812,Influence of copper on early development: prenatal and postnatal considerations,"Copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient whose requirement increases during pregnancy and lactation. These represent critical times of growth and development, and the fetus and newborn are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies of this nutrient. Genetic mutations that predispose offspring to inadequate Cu stores can be life-threatening, as seen in children with Menkes disease. During the last decade, severe Cu deficiency, once thought to be a rare condition, has been reported in the literature with increasing frequency. Secondary Cu deficiencies can be induced by a variety of ways, such as excessive zinc or iron intake, certain medications, and bariatric surgery. Premature and low birth weight babies can be born with low Cu stores. Several mechanisms may contribute to Cu teratogenicity, including decreased activity of selected cuproenzymes, increased oxidative stress, decreased availability of nitric oxide, altered iron metabolism, abnormal cross-linking of matrix proteins extracellular, decreased angiogenesis and altered cell signaling, among others. The brain, heart, and vessels, as well as tissues such as the lungs, skin, and hair, and systems, including the skeletal, immune, and blood systems, are negatively affected by suboptimal Cu during development. Furthermore, persistent structural, biochemical, and functional adverse effects are observed in the offspring even when Cu supplementation is started after birth, supporting the concept that adequate Cu nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is critical for development. normal. Although Cu-containing IUDs are an effective method of increasing intrauterine Cu concentrations and reducing the risk of pregnancy, high amounts of Cu in the diet are not thought to pose a direct developmental risk.

Objective: To report the clinical data and mutation analysis of two Thai brothers suspected of WD. Subject and methods: A 13-year-old boy who presented cirrhosis, arthralgia, hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy, and his asymptomatic 11-year-old sister with hepatomegaly with elevated transaminases were studied. ATP7B gene mutation analysis and mRNA analysis were performed on both patients and their parents. Results: The investigations were consistent with WD, and their liver diseases improved after standard treatment for WD. DNA analysis in these two patients revealed two novel mutations, which were a deletion of the first 2 bp of exon 6 (c.1870-1871delGA) and a single base substitution from A to G at nucleotide 4075 (c.1870-1871delGA). 4075A>G) in exon 20 (p.M1359V). Restriction digestion by PCR with the restriction enzyme NcoI was used as a second method to confirm the c.4075A>G mutation and for rapid detection in 100 chromosomes of unrelated healthy controls, and this variant was not present in the controls. The c.1870-1871delGA deletion caused a frameshift effect, resulting in a premature stop codon (p.E624fsX753), and the p.M1359V mutation is a substitution of methionine with valine, which may have effects on their orientation and interaction with other adjacent amino acids.

But it was another metal that rose above the Jerusalem landscape during the meeting of the International Society for Zinc Biology (ISZB; http://www.iszb.org/), held in Mishkenot Sha'ananim, at a whisper. of the Old City. walls More than 100 scientists met from December 1 to 5, 2009 to discuss their research on the biology of this metal. Zinc is a double-edged sword. Zinc supplementation accelerates wound healing and growth and promotes an effective immune response. On the other hand, zinc deficiency leads to stunted growth and impaired learning and memory function, and has been linked to mood disorders. However, at the cellular level, uncontrolled increases in zinc concentrations can lead to neuronal cell death and may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Through regulation of various intracellular signaling pathways, zinc may accelerate cell growth and possibly contribute to cancer. However, despite the physiological and clinical importance of this metal, research on the molecular basis of these effects is still in its infancy. The 2009 ISZB meeting provided a venue for researchers working on various zinc-related topics to share their thoughts and ideas and promote the growth of this field.

1822,"Clinical Features of Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, and Low Platelet Count Syndrome in Undiagnosed Wilson's Disease: Report of Two Cases","Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the toxic accumulation of copper mainly in the liver and brain. The hepatic manifestation of WD is diverse and may include asymptomatic aminotransferase elevation, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or acute/fulminant hepatic failure. The characteristic of acute liver failure in WD is the concomitance of acute intravascular hemolytic anemia, which in some patients may represent the first clinical symptom of WD. Diagnosis of acute Wilsonian liver failure is difficult, as similar signs can be seen in other clinical conditions. In pregnant patients with unrecognized WD, liver failure with hemolysis can be interpreted as the syndrome of low platelet counts (HELLP). Patients: We describe two women who developed the clinical features of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and HELLP syndrome. In both, subsequent diagnoses confirmed WD. Conclusion: WD must be remembered in the differential diagnosis of HELLP syndrome.

1824,"Wilson's disease: clinical correlation, brain MRI and Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT","Background: Brain damage secondary to Wilson's disease leads to various psychiatric and neurological manifestations. However, little research has been published on the role of anatomical-functional diagnostic modalities in evaluating the course of the disease. Objective: To evaluate and compare the role of brain MRI and Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in the evaluation of brain involvement in Wilson's disease and the correlation of these findings with clinical presentations. Methods: Eighteen patients with established Wilson's disease were included. The clinical picture was neurological (nWD) in 11 patients (61.1%) and hepatic (hWD) in 7 patients (38.9%). All patients underwent clinical evaluation, cognitive evaluation, slit-lamp ophthalmic examination, biochemical tests including urinary copper levels and serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy (only in 5 patients), brain MRI and Tc-99m Brain HMPAO. Results: Brain MRI was abnormal in 11/18 patients (sensitivity 61.1%). It was abnormal in 9/11 nWD patients (81.8% sensitivity) and 2/7 hWD patients (28.6% sensitivity). Brain Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT was abnormal in 15 of 18 patients (sensitivity 83.3%). The scan was abnormal in 10/11 nWD patients (90.9% sensitivity) and 5/7 hWD patients (71.4% sensitivity). There was a good correlation between the clinical presentation of the disease and the radiological and SPECT findings. Conclusion: In Wilson's disease, brain SPECT has a higher sensitivity than brain MRI to detect brain damage. There was also a good clinical-anatomical correlation but it was still not clear in explaining some clinical aspects in some cases.",,"El-Sayed, M. A.;Salem, S.;Taha, A. E. H.;Kassem, A. E.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with cell collision/reaction capability that eliminates isobaric and polyatomic interferences has improved sensitivity and specificity in the analysis.

Methods: Fresh gravimetric standard preparations (3-5 points; 20X dilution of PE multi-element calibration standard) were analyzed for ICP-MS calibration in each batch with analyzes performed in standard or DRC (NH3) mode. Imprecisions (within assay, total laboratory CV) were evaluated from daily triplicate analyzes of quality control reagents (urine: Bio-Rad; serum: Seronorm) over a 5-day period. Detection limits were evaluated with replicates (n=10) of blank samples. Linearity was assessed by Tmuo, serial dilutions (5 points) were analyzed and recoveries were calculated. A comparison of serum/urine copper and zinc levels measured by ICP-MS and current laboratory atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was performed. Results: The calibration curves were linear to zero; accessories typically reached r2 0.990 - 0.999. The imprecision of the intra-run results gave <10% CV for all elements in both serum and urine. The total CVs calculated in the lab were low, except that Al, Mn, and Se had CVs >15%, indicating a plausible wider variation of the daily calibration of these elements in each run. In standard mode, sensitivities were generally <0.1 ug/L and improved further with DRC mode. Linearity was checked for each element - up to 5 orders of magnitude from 0.01-200 mug/L. Comparative data with a limited sample size (n=30) showed reasonably similar serum/urine copper levels (serum y=1.05x + 1.14, rs 0.88; urine y=1.07x - 0, 08, rs 0.96) and serum zinc (y= 1.31x - 1.45, rs=0.85) levels by ICP-MS and ASA. Conclusions: ICP-MS with DRC mode showed promising multi-element analysis performance.

1830,Factors predicting neurological deterioration after chelation therapy in patients with Wilson's disease.,"Background: There is a paucity of information on the proportion of patients with Wilson's liver disease who deteriorate on chelation therapy. There is also little information on the factors that predict neurological deterioration. In this cohort study, we tried to study what percentage of patients with hepatic Wilson's disease develop neurological deterioration with penicillamine. Our objective was to identify the prognostic factors that could predict neurological deterioration after the initiation of chelation therapy. Methods: We included patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease in the age group between 3 and 18 years who had hepatic or combined hepatic and neurological manifestations. Fulminant Wilson's disease and other causes of chronic liver disease were excluded. Liver status assessment was performed using Child, the MELD score, and the New Wilson score index. We studied putative predictive factors such as age, gender, and mode of presentation, ie hepatic versus a combination of hepatic and neurological. All patients were followed up to 2 years while receiving d-penicillamine therapy. Results: One patient presented neurological symptoms combined with hepatic manifestations (10%). four of 10 patients (40%) had CNS lesions on brain MRI at baseline. 3 of 10 (30%) patients deteriorated neurologically during the follow-up period. Factors such as MELD score and INR are significantly abnormal (p=0.032 and 0.01, respectively) in those patients who deteriorated neurologically and started chelation therapy. Conclusions: One-third of patients with Wilson's disease presenting with hepatic or combined hepatic and neurological manifestations deteriorate with d-penicillamine therapy.

1831,Effect of D-penicillamine on hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a copper metabolism disorder characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of the ATP7B protein and reduced excretion of copper into the bile in hepatocytes. Excessive accumulation of copper leads to liver injury. D-penicillamine can mainly inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the occurrence of cicatricial lesions in the liver. We study this phenomenon in our patients. METHODS: Pathology slides from livers explanted from 26 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease with hepatoneurological manifestations between 2000 and 2008 who had undergone liver transplantation were investigated retrospectively. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their history of D-penicillamine use prior to transplantation. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation was classified as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3), and was reviewed by an impartial hepatopathologist. RESULTS: Of 26 patients (20 men, 6 women) who had Wilson's disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years, 69% (18/26) had a history of prior D-penicillamine use. of liver transplant from 6 months to 9 years (mean, 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis were observed in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18), grade 2 in 44% (8/18), and grade 1 in 11% of patients (2/18) . In the group without D-penicillamine (8 patients), the degrees of fibrosis were grade 3 (62%), grade 2 (25%), and grade 1 (12%); 87% of the patients had grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The grade of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than in the no D-penicillamine group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine can reduce the rate of hepatic fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Kazemi, K.;Geramizadeh, B.;Kakaei, F.;Nikeghbalian, S.;Malekhosseini, S.

1832,Spermidine/spermine actyltransferase is responsible for the metabolism of triethylenetetramine and other polyamine analogs in humans.,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper II chelator traditionally used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, and several structural analogs are currently in clinical trials for cancer. However, the metabolism of TETA has never been thoroughly investigated, which is crucial for its further development in cancer treatment. The two main metabolites of TETA found in humans are N1-acetyl-TETA (MAT) and N<sup>1</sup>, N<sup>10</sup>-diacetyl-TETA (DAT). Traditionally, drug acetylation is thought to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The FDA requires that the pharmacological properties of any drug metabolized through the acetylation pathway be investigated in populations with different NAT2 phenotypes. However, our recent clinical study showed that there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and metabolite profiles of healthy volunteers with fast or slow NAT2 acetylation phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesize that the enzyme responsible for TETA acetylation is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT), which has never before been considered a drug-metabolizing enzyme, rather than NAT2. We carried out in vitro drug metabolism assays to identify the enzyme responsible for TETA metabolism. TETA and MAT (as substrate) and acetyl-coenzyme A were incubated with human liver microsome and cytosol from 5 individuals in the presence or absence of pentamidine or paracetamol separately. The formation of MAT from TETA and DAT from MAT was detected and measured using our previously published LC-MS method. Both the liver microsome and the cytosol could catalyze the biotransformation of TETA and MAT. The rate of metabolism in the microsome and cytosol within each individual varies. Metabolism rates in the microsome and cytosol also varied between individuals (Km range 223 - 909 M, V<inf>max</inf> range 96 - 482 pg/min/mg protein). Pentamidine, a specific inhibitor of x SSAT, could inhibit the reaction and increase Km by more than 30%. While paracetamol, a specific inhibitor of NAT2, did not show any inhibition effect. The same experiments had been performed in rat liver microsomes and cytosol, and similar results were obtained apart from the Km and V<inf>max</inf> values. TETA and two other polyamine analogs, diethylnorspermine and diethylspermine, all of which are under investigation for cancer treatment, were incubated with pure recombinant human SSAT protein and found to form acetylated metabolites. The identification of SSAT, which has never before been considered as a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, as an enzyme to catalyze the acylation of polyamine analogs, is of significant importance in the clinic, especially in clinical trial situations. Many polyamine analogs have been developed as potential anticancer drugs and many of them, including TETA, are being investigated in clinical trials. Finding the right enzyme (ie, SSAT instead of traditional NAT2) to study its biotransformation is crucial to understanding its pharmacology, which is essential for overall drug study.",,"Lu, J.;Li, M.;Xu, H.;Tingle, M.;Cooper, G.

1833,Wilson France: a national database for Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare hereditary disease with an effective treatment if it is started early. Improving knowledge of this disease is a priority of the French National Center of Expertise for better access to diagnosis and treatment. This national organization created a database. Objective: To improve knowledge of WD through an epidemiological study in the French cohort. Methods: We registered all the patients followed by all the French centers that work with the National Center of Expertise. Results: Since 2006, 281 patients (1-73 years) were included in the Wilson France database (sex ratio: 1). The mean age at diagnosis was 19 years. The first symptoms were neurological for 36% of the patients, hepatic for 38%, renal, psychiatric or hematological for 11%. Fifteen percent were diagnosed after family screening. At the time of diagnosis, a Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms, in 55% of hepatic presentations, and in 26% of presymptomatic forms. Mean coeruloplasminemia was low (0.08 g/L) but 5% of patients had normal values (>0.2 g/L). Mean urinary copper increased in 96% of patients. Genetic investigation was inconclusive in 15.9% of families (only one or no mutation found). The first treatment was D-Penicillamine in 85% of the cases and after a mean follow-up of 15 years, the treatment was D-Penicillamine in 44.4% of the patients, Trientine in 14.4%, Zinc in 26 0.7%, association of chelator and zinc for 5.6%; 5.6% of the patients had a liver transplant. Discussion: The database included approximately 1/3 of patients with Wilson's disease in France.

1834,Elevated liver enzymes in a 6-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A leading to presymptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"We present the case of a 6-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A (intron 22 inversion of the FVIII gene) in whom moderately elevated levels of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) were repeatedly found in the routine control. No common cause for the hepatitis (hepatitis B or C, CMV, EBV) was found, but further evaluation revealed a decreased serum ceruloplasmin concentration. 24-hour urine copper excretion was significantly increased. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed by demonstrating compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ATP7B gene (R1041W and N1270S); the parents were heterozygous. Apart from elevated transaminases, no signs of hepatic dysfunction, no neurological signs, and no Kayser-Fleischer ring were detected; ultrasound showed liver enlargement but normal parenchymal structure. Therapy with D-penicillamine and vitamin B6 was initiated and monitored by 24-hour urine copper excretion and transaminase measurement. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea and can lead to hepatic and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. Even a mild but constant elevation of transaminases can indicate Wilson's disease. Presymptomatic diagnosis offers the opportunity for early therapy with D-penicillamine or zinc acetate. Therefore, plasma ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion should be investigated in cases of chronic elevation of liver enzymes.",,"Hainmann, I.;Woltering, T.;Greiner, P.;Superti-Furga, A.;Zieger, B.",2010,,,0,0,
1835,Wilson's disease disguised as hepatic hydrothorax in a young woman,"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism with a hepatic or neurological presentation. Histopathologic findings of liver involvement range from steatosis to end-stage cirrhosis. WD presenting as acute or fulminant liver failure, hemolytic crisis, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and rarely decompensated cirrhosis have been described. This is the first case of WE presenting as worsening dyspnea secondary to right hepatic hydrothorax. Clinical Case: A 20-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted with progressive dyspnea for six months. He had no history of significant alcohol abuse or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination revealed mild jaundice, right pleural effusion, ascites, and peripheral edema. No Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen on slit-lamp examination. Laboratory results revealed mildly elevated transaminases and bilirubin, low albumin, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. Computed tomography showed massive right-sided hydrothorax with mediastinal shift, ascites, and liver cirrhosis. The echocardiogram was normal. A chest tube was placed on the right side, resulting in high drainage (>15 L) of transudative fluid and relief of symptoms. Further evaluation was highlighted by a low serum ceruloplasmin level of <10 mg/dL and a high 24-hour urine copper (Cu) level of 270 Âµg. Liver biopsy showed micro and macro vesicular steatosis with active cirrhosis, but could not quantitatively measure Cu due to lack of sufficient sample. Rhodanine staining for Cu was positive in one of the nodules. While awaiting biopsy results, the patient developed tremors and worsening liver function. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed increased signal intensity in the globus pallidus consistent with lenticular Cu deposition. The diagnosis of WD was made. She was started on Trientene and Zinc and was transferred to a liver transplant center where she successfully underwent a liver transplant. Discussion: Of the 50% of patients with WD who have liver disease, only 3% have liver decompensation at the time of presentation. Hepatic hydrothorax is an even rarer complication and is defined as a significant pleural effusion, usually >500 mL, in a cirrhotic patient in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease. The pathophysiology involves leakage of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural space through embryological defects, which are more common in the right hemidiaphragm. Decompensated cirrhosis due to WD can be controlled with medical treatment. Patients who fail treatment and those with hepatic hydrothorax will require a liver transplant. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed for early diagnosis and medical management.",,"Ghayam, S.;Ponugoti, S.;Pawa, S.",2010,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2010.320-7,0,0,
1836,Late-onset neurological Wilson's disease without KF rings or characteristic MRI findings,"Objective: To report an unusual case of genetically confirmed Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as late-onset parkinsonism without KF rings or characteristic brain MRI abnormalities. Background: The age of onset of WD is variable but generally occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade. A neurological presentation is rare beyond the age of 40 years and has not been reported without KF rings or characteristic brain MRI findings. As a result, screening for WD in patients presenting with a movement disorder is not routine after this age and the upper limit for the age of neurological phenoconversion remains unclear. Methods: Case Report. Results: A 50-year-old man presented with a 15-month history of left hand tremor, left arm stiffness, insomnia, and anxiety. Examination showed left-predominant parkinsonism with resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. KF rings were absent. Quetiapine and olanzapine were used briefly to treat anxiety after the onset of motor symptoms but were discontinued at least 2 months before presentation. Subsequently, parkinsonism did not respond to ropinirole, pramipexole, and only minimally responded to levodopa up to 200 mg TID. The investigation included a normal brain MRI and a normal EEG. Two years later, a low serum ceruloplasmin of 4.1 was unexpectedly found as part of a research project. Repeated studies in a commercial laboratory were ceruloplasmin 7.4 mg/dL (25-63), serum copper 28 g/dL (70-150), urinary copper 65 g/24 hours (3-35). Iron and LFT studies were normal. Formal ophthalmologic examination revealed no KF rings. Sequencing of the ATP7B gene (Mayo Clinic) revealed 2 known pathogenic mutations of WD (compound heterozygous). The patient was treated with zinc for 6 months without improvement. A liver biopsy revealed increased copper without cirrhosis, and a repeat slit-lamp examination at an academic medical center revealed no KF rings. The current treatment is Trientino. Conclusions: The diagnosis of WD was made by chance after low serum ceruloplasmin was found as part of a research project. This case suggests that late-onset WD is more common than previously thought and broadens the range of phenotypic expression to include parkinsonism presenting in late adulthood without the presence of KF rings or MRI abnormalities. Screening for WD with serum ceruloplasmin should be routine in patients presenting with parkinsonism, tremor, or dystonia in adulthood.",,"Molho, E.

1837,Novel Tetrathiomolybdate Angiogenesis Inhibitor Enhances Efficacy of Oncolytic Virus to Kill Tumor Cells,"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are modified viruses specifically designed to lyse cancer cells while leaving surrounding tissue intact. Although effective in killing tumors, OV therapy has shown limited efficacy against glioma in clinical trials. The tumor microenvironment potentially hampers the spread and propagation of OVs; in particular, the angiogenic and inflammatory responses following OV inoculation have been shown to significantly limit the efficacy of OV. Copper supports angiogenesis and its physiological level has been shown to inhibit infection and replication of wild-type HSV. The goal of our current project is to determine if the copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate can be used to improve the overall efficacy of OV in malignant glioma. Tetrathiomolybdate is already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Wilson's disease and is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy. Previous findings indicate that the anticancer effects of OV can be significantly increased by pretreatment with an angiostatic agent. The angiostatic and immunosuppressive properties of tetrathiomolybdate make it an ideal candidate to enhance OV therapy. To confirm this, we tested whether copper inhibits OV-mediated glioma cell killing and whether tetrathiomolybdate may be counterproductive. We found that copper at physiological concentration in serum could significantly inhibit glioma cell death and virus replication. This inhibition of cell death by copper-incubated OV was observed in multiple different OVs tested. Viral replication and cytotoxicity assay data showed that tetrathiomolybdate-mediated copper chelation could rescue copper-inhibited viral replication, leading to better tumor cell killing effect. Based on these results, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of combining tetrathiomolybdate with OV against a U251T3 subcutaneous glioma model. We found a significant increase in the antitumor response of animals treated with tetrathiomolybdate plus OV compared to animals treated with OV alone. Collectively, our results indicate that the combination of tetrathiomolybdate and OV increases the efficacy profile compared to OV alone, suggesting that concomitant administration of tetrathiomolybdate to patients may improve the efficacy of OV.",,"Yoo, J.

1838,Wilson's diseases: overall 1-year experience from a single center,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper transporter P-type ATPase, which is important for excretion of copper into bile, leading to accumulation of copper in the liver. Toxic concentrations of copper can also be found in the brain and kidneys, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. WD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Affected children may be completely asymptomatic and diagnosis problematic. The aim of this study is to present our one-year, single center experience with WD, underlying its different presentations. Patients and methods: In the last 12 months (from April 2009 to April 2010), 5 patients (3 men) met the criteria for the diagnosis of WD. Evaluation included a detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory tests (urinary copper excretion, serum ceruloplasmin levels), genetic analysis, and liver biopsy. 3 patients had isolated liver disease, 1 mixed neurological and liver involvement, and 1 acute liver failure. All 3 patients with cirrhotic liver underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Results: The median age at diagnosis of WD was 10.8 (range, 7-16). All patients had hepatic manifestations of the disease at the time of diagnosis: cirrhosis (2), chronic hepatitis (2), and fulminant hepatic failure (1). Two patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 1 of the symptomatic patients presented the typical neurological symptoms, first with changes in behavior and deterioration in school work, evolving to lack of motor coordination, drooling, dysarthria, dystonia and spasticity with the deepening of the disease. At diagnosis, only the patient with neurological manifestations had a positive Kayser Fleischer ring. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were reduced in all patients, mean value 9.2 mg/dl (range 2-16), with lower levels in cirrhotic patients. 24-h urinary copper excretion increased in all patients, >75 Âµg/24 hours before (mean value 360 Âµg/24) or >1400 Âµg/24 hours after penicillamine challenge. Genetic analysis showed double heterozygosis in 3/5, the other 2 patients had only 1 recognized mutation. As shown to be diagnostically important, all patients had a copper content of more than 250 Âµg/g liver dry weight. We started therapy with zinc (zinc acetate) in all patients at the time of diagnosis, only in the one with neurological symptoms with the addition of a copper chelating drug such as Trientine. None of the 3 cirrhotic patients recovered with therapy and avoided liver transplantation. Treatment with zinc acetate was started in the 2 asymptomatic patients and was well tolerated. In these 2 patients, liver function tests showed an improvement after 3 weeks of therapy, reaching normal values in 2 months for both. The indication for liver transplantation was acute-on-chronic (2/3) or fulminant (1/3) liver failure. Median follow-up after liver transplantation was 1 year, 1 patient died of perioperative complications (66% patient survival). Copper metabolism returned to normal in all patients. None of the transplant patients with exclusive liver disease required chelation therapy after liver transplantation and none developed neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease. Conclusion: The detection of WD in children remains very difficult also due to the low frequency of cases, however, our 1-year experience shows a higher frequency than that reported in the literature. The most important investigation is liver biopsy with evaluation of liver copper. Genetic analysis can help in doubtful cases. Ceruloplasmin, hemoglobin, ALT, ALP, and plasma albumin were significantly different between fulminant and nonfulminant WE and could be used as surrogate markers in the evaluation of urgent OLT.

1839,Hepatocellular cancer in neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in Wilson's disease with cirrhosis is extremely rare. Hepatic copper is supposed to be a protective factor against carcinogenesis. Patients with neurologic Wilson's disease are rarely monitored for tumors. Case report: A 30-year-old male was diagnosed 4 years earlier with neurologic Wilson's disease on the basis of clinical features, the presence of a KF ring, elevated urine copper levels, and a positive penicillamine challenge test. His liver function tests were normal. He was aggressively treated with D-penicillamine and Zinc with significant improvement in neurology and lightening of the KF ring. Six months earlier he had been investigated for discomfort in the right hypochondrium. A 10cm hepatocellular cancer was detected in the right posterior sector of the liver. HCV RNA, HBsAg, Anti HBc, HBV DNA, ANA were all negative. We performed a resection of segment VII/VIII from which the patient recovered without incident. Histologically, a moderately differentiated HCC was confirmed in the context of cirrhosis. Interestingly, liver copper levels were very low, presumably due to aggressive chelation therapy. Discussion: Hepatic copper is protective in Wilson's disease. Reports of HCC in Wilson's disease are extremely rare, especially in those with neurologic Wilson's disease and no hepatic manifestations. In previous reports, hepatitis may coexist or it has not been ruled out. Hepatitis B and C were ruled out in the present case. We postulate that aggressive chelation therapy cleared the liver of protective copper that leads to carcinogenesis.",,"Shah, S.",2010,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-2574.2010.00165.x,0,0,
1840,CD8 T-Cell Lymphopenia and Functional Asplenia in an Infant With ZEB2 Mutation-Associated Neural Crest Developmental Disorder and Mowat Wilson Syndrome (MWS),"Introduction: We present abnormal immune findings in a patient with zinc finger protein deficiency and MWS. Case description: A 2.5-year-old male with Hirschsprung's disease and MWS presented for evaluation of asplenia. MWS was diagnosed at birth with genetic testing demonstrating chromosome 2q22.3 mutation and ZEB2 deficiency. At 2 days of life a small spleen was noted and NPC prophylaxis was started. No history of serious infections was reported, except for enterocolitis at the age of 1 year. Dead childhood vaccinations were up to date; the patient never received live viral vaccines. Immunological evaluation revealed BCC with slightly elevated eosinophil count. Peripheral smear confirmed asplenia. Serum immunoglobulins revealed low levels of IgA and IgM but normal levels of IgG and IgE. The oxidative burst test was normal. Serological responses to the vaccine showed 2 of 7 protective antibody levels against Prevnar vaccine and an indeterminate response against tetanus. Lymphocyte phenotyping revealed low CD3+ T cells, low levels of CD3+CD8+ T cells (3.9%; lower limit of normal 16.0%) but normal levels of CD3+CD4+ T cells. Measurements of B cells, natural killer cells, and HLA-DR were appropriate. T cells showed an adequate response to stimulation with mitogens and antigens. Four weeks after revaccination (Prevnar 13, DTaP), protective antibody levels against all 13 pneumococcal serotypes, tetanus, diphtheria, and haemophilus were demonstrated. Repeat lymphocyte phenotyping again showed a low level of CD3+ T cells and a low level of CD3+CD8+ T cells. The evaluation of latent viral infection was negative. Discussion: ZEB2 is the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene responsible for embryonic development of neural crest cells. CD8 homeostasis is not defined, but abnormalities in CD8 cell expression have been reported in MHC class I deficiency, ZAP 70 deficiency, and IL-7 deficiency. Our patient does not appear to have IL-7 disturbances since CD3+CD4+ cells are present in normal numbers; there is no evidence of MHC Class I deficiency. ZAP 70 deficiency, another zinc finger deficiency, presents with T-cell dysfunction not seen in this patient. Neurological disorders have been linked to immunodeficiency, eg ataxia telangiectasia, ADA deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Patients with MWS (impaired neural crest development) should be evaluated for immunologic abnormalities, including asplenia.",,"Shroff, P.;Potocki, L.;Chinen, J.;Hanson, I. C.",2010,November,,0,0,
1841,A new and unexpected antioxidant-like activity for the classic copper-chelating drug penicillamine,"Penicillamine (beta, beta'-dimethylcysteine) has been widely used clinically as a copper chelating agent for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provided marked protection against tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ, an important toxic metabolite of pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative)-induced cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts, while other copper chelators such as BCS (disulfonate of bathocuproine) and trientine do not. . The autoxidation process of TCHQ producing the reactive radical tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ) was studied using ESR and UV-visible spectral methods. Interestingly and surprisingly, penicillamine was found to dramatically delay TCSQ moiety formation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, penicillamine disulfide (the oxidized form of penicillamine), N-acetylpenicillamine, BCS, and trientine had no detectable effect on TCHQ autoxidation. HPLC-MS studies showed that the TCSQ moiety was reduced to TCHQ by penicillamine, which was simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data indicate that the protective effects of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity were not due to its binding to copper, but rather to its reduction of the reactive TCSQ moiety to much less reactive TCHQ. This is the first report demonstrating novel antioxidant-like activity for this classic copper-chelating aminothiol drug, which could be highly relevant to the biological activities of penicillamine.",,"Zhu, B.

1842,Copper disrupts nuclear receptor function in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7b) that results in excessive hepatic copper accumulation and is associated with steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The animal model of Wilson's disease (Atp7b-/-) has downregulated expression of several hepatic nuclear receptor signaling pathways, including downregulation of the FXR:RXR target gene. Methods: DNA binding was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with the following: in vitro translated FXR and RXR proteins synthesized with copper (CuSO4) and/or zinc (ZnSO4) (1-40 muM); nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells treated for 16 hours with 75 muM CDCA, +/- metals (5 muM CuSO4 and/or 40 muM ZnSO4); and nuclear extracts from control and Atp7b-/- mice. Total RNA was collected from HepG2 cells (as above) and gene expression [bile salt export pump (BSEP, Abcb11), metallothionein (Met) 2, FXR and TNFalpha] was measured by real-time PCR. Results: In vitro translation of RXR with 4-40 mM CuSO4 resulted in complete loss of FXR:RXR binding to SHP and BSEP promoters, and addition of 40 muM ZnSO4 to the reaction restored binding to SHP promoters. and BSEP. Protein expression of FXR and RXR was not decreased by the metal in vitro translation reaction (measured by Western blot and 35S-methion incorporation). FXR binding to BSEP and SHP promoters in liver nuclear extracts was decreased in Atp7b-/- mice; however, the binding of the NFkappaB (non-zinc finger transcription factor) or SP1 (non-nuclear receptor zinc finger transcription factor) complex was not different between control and Atp7b-/- mice. In HepG2 cells, CuSO4 treatment decreased CDCA induction of BSEP mRNA expression by 80% (P < 0.05), which was restored to 40% (P < 0.05) by CDCA treatment alone, by adding ZnSO4 to cultures containing CuSO4 and CDCA. Met2 mRNA expression was significantly increased 2- (P<0.05, CDCA treatment), 7- (P<0.05, CuSO4 treatment) and 50-fold (P<0.01, CDCA+CuSO4 treatment +ZnSO4) in HepG2 cells. FXR and TNFalpha mRNA expression did not change with CuSO4 treatment. In addition, CuSO4 treatment of HepG2 cells abolished nuclear extract binding to the BSEP promoter. Conclusions: Copper interrupts nuclear receptor binding activity and decreases hepatic target gene expression. DNA-binding experiments in models of excess copper suggest that displacement of zinc by copper in the zinc finger of nuclear receptors promotes Wilson's disease pathology, and the addition of excess zinc may ameliorate the negative effects. of copper on nuclear receptor activity.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

1843,Iron and the HFE gene in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, which leads to liver failure and progressive neurological deterioration in untreated patients. Animal studies and several case reports have suggested hepatic iron overload or alterations in iron processing in WD. Consistent with these findings, a significantly higher HFE mutation frequency was reported in small series of WD patients. The aim of the current study was the evaluation of iron metabolism and HFE gene frequencies in WD patients, as well as the analysis of treatment effects due to chelation therapy. Patients and methods: Data from 143 WD patients treated at Heidelberg University Hospital between 1968 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. Parameters of clinical presentation, liver function, and iron metabolism were recorded. EDTA blood samples from the patients were analyzed for alterations in the HFE gene (H63D; C282Y) using standard RT-PCR techniques. Results: Contrary to previous reports in our large cohort of WD patients, allele frequencies of HFE gene mutations (HFE mutation in 143 patients: 120 wild-type, 3 heterozygous C282Y, 1 homozygous C282Y, 16 heterozygous H63D, 2 H63D homozygotes and 1 H63D/C282Y-composite-heterozygous) were 2.1% for C282Y and 7.3% for H63D, although in line with the frequencies obtained for the general population. HFE gene mutations did not predict an early clinical manifestation or a fulminant clinical course of Wilson's disease. To further elucidate the role of reduced coeruloplasmin (CP) levels and deficiency of its ferrooxidase activity, patients were subgrouped according to their CP levels. Patients with marked hypoceruloplasminemia (CP <0.1 g/l) showed elevated ferritin and reduced transfer (p<0.05). In our cohort, different treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or combined therapy with a chelating agent and zinc) did not alter iron metabolism parameters. Discussion: Hypoceruloplasminemia seems to have only a slight impact on iron metabolism parameters. , despite decreased ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity. HFE gene mutations may be additional risk factors for clinically significant iron overload in individual cases, but allele frequencies do not indicate an association between WD and HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis. The effects of WD chelation therapy on iron metabolism appear to be minor and in most cases of no clinical relevance.",,"Pfeiffenberger, J.;Gotthardt, D.;Seessle, J.;Herrmann, T.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1844,Alterations of lipid metabolism in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that leads to the accumulation of toxic copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. The development of hepatic steatosis is a common symptom in early stages. Animal models (ATP7b-/- and LEC rats) show changes in lipid metabolism as serum triglycerides and cholesterol decrease. Up to now, alterations of lipid metabolism in humans have not been intensively investigated in WD, but previous studies suggested an influence of specific treatment of WD. Under zinc therapy, a decrease in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol raises the question of whether this treatment might be atherogenic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 251 patients with WD treated at Heidelberg University Hospital between 1990 and 2009. Patients were subgrouped by sex, treatment (APD, trientine, or zinc), or manifestation (hepatic, neurological, mixed, and asymptomatic) to analysis of the course of the disease and laboratory values (including serum lipid profile, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, lipoproteins). a), serum bile acids, adiponectin and leptin). The occurrence of vascular events under treatment and the prevalence of coronary heart disease were recorded. Results: Serum lipids were not statistically different between men and women, neither in treated nor in untreated patients. Interestingly, in naÃ¯ve patients, cholesterol levels were reduced in hepatic patients with a median of 158 (66-319) mg/dl vs neurological patients 194 (123-243) mg/dl or mixed 186 (145-244) mg/dl or asymptomatic patients 195 (173-294) mg/dl. Under treatment of at least 12 months these differences diminished. Contrary to previous studies, we did not observe a decrease in total or HDL cholesterol under zinc treatment or chelator-based therapy. Vascular events were rare and did not differ statistically between treatment groups or between patients with different manifestations. However, serum lipoprotein(a) was markedly higher in patients with neurological involvement than in patients with predominant liver disease. CONCLUSION: Only minor changes were found in the serum lipid profile of WD patients, which decreased with treatment. In contrast to animal models of the disease, the amount of triglycerides and cholesterol did not decrease. Our data do not suggest significant atherogenic effects of medical treatments for WD.",,"Seessle, J.;Gohdes, A. M.;Gotthardt, D.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1845,Toronto Western Hospital Wilson's Disease Study: Perspectives from an Urban Adult Outpatient Center,"Objective: To review the clinical experience of adult patients with Wilson's disease (WD) followed up in an urban outpatient setting. Methods: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with WD was performed. Results: 59 letters were identified; according to the Leipzig scores, 44 met the criteria for probable (score >= 4) and 10 for probable WD (score 2-3). In the review, 6 cases (1 probable, 5 probable) were excluded. The presentation characteristics of the 48 included patients are shown in Table 1. In the review, the median time in treatment was 11.5 years (range 0.1-42 years). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial therapy (48%), followed by zinc (23%), trientine (15%), DP and zinc (6%), and 8% unknown (started treatment as part of a double-blind study). In the review, zinc was the most common regimen (65%), followed by PD (17%), trientine (12%), and dual therapy (6%). Side effects were more notable for DP (41%) compared to zinc (19%) or trientine (10%). Overall, liver biopsy and/or imaging demonstrated the presence of portal hypertension in 63% and cirrhosis in 53% of patients. Liver biopsy (n=31) also identified fibrosis in 94% of patients, inflammatory activity in 68%, and steatosis in 65%. When tested, 10 patients had EM mitochondrial changes and 13 glycogenated nuclei. The median concentration of copper in the liver was 4.11 muM/g (range 0.22-20.43). During follow-up, 3 patients developed hepatic encephalopathy and 2 jaundice. 2 patients developed ascites (one of whom was initially asymptomatic) and 1 variceal bleeding was documented. At the time of review, there was one death and one transplant. Neurologic patients with WD (n = 21) had a median of 4 neurologic signs consistent with WD. At review, 14 patients had fewer neurological signs, 2 the same number, 4 more signs (1 patient lost to follow-up). Three patients with non-neurological presentation developed neurological signs, of which 1 recovered initially. Eleven patients had at least one episode of documented neurological deterioration during treatment. Of the patients who underwent MRI (n = 26), signal abnormalities were seen in the basal ganglia (62%), brainstem (50%), white matter tracts (38%), and the thalamus (28%). Eight patients (31%) had normal brain MRIs. Of the patients with a second MRI (n = 11), 36% experienced almost complete improvement. Conclusion: Wilson's disease is a diverse disease, but long-term outcomes are generally good for patients who respond to initial therapy. (Chart presented).",,"Moores, A.;Fox, S.;Hirschfield, G.

1846,Symptomatic Wilson's disease during long-term maintenance zinc monotherapy after initial copper removal with penicillamine: experience in 30 patients.,"The outcome of zinc-only monotherapy for symptomatic Wilson's disease may be poor, particularly in advanced liver disease (Hepatol 2009;50:1442-52). Initial removal of copper with penicillamine might improve outcome, but available data are limited and long-term follow-up is not available. Here we report our experience with such an approach in 30 symptomatic patients during (median) 29 (range 0.5-48) years of follow-up (FU). The presentation was exclusively hepatic, exclusively neurological or combined in 14, 3 and 13 cases resp. The mean age at diagnosis was 14 (range 7-37) years. The duration and initial penicillamine dose were 2 (0.5-21) years and 873 (162-2000) mg resp. and later zinc 23 (0.5-42) years and 175 (68-279) mg resp. Of the 27 pts with hepatic or combined presentation, 3 had initial decompensated cirrhosis, 11 compensated cirrhosis, and 13 less severe disease. Of the 3 pts with initial decompensated cirrhosis, one improved to compensated cirrhosis and remained so for 23 years FU, 1 was transplanted after 0.5 years, and one improved initially but died 12 years later from complications of cirrhosis. Of the 11 patients with initial compensated cirrhosis (median FU 31 years), 1 died after 2 years from penicillamine-induced myelinolysis, 3 died from complications of liver disease after 17, 20, and 30 years of therapy, and 7 remained stable after a median of 29 years of FU. Of 13 patients with less severe liver disease, 9 deteriorated, including 5 with compensated cirrhosis and 1 with decompensated cirrhosis (the latter rewarded after the addition of trientine). Progressive liver disease was associated with longer follow-up (median 31 vs. 26 years, P = 0.03), but could not be clearly explained by dose or duration of therapy or efficacy of copper removal ( based on 24-hour urine copper excretion and no serum ceruloplasmin). copper concentration bound at the end of FU). Of the 16 pts with initial or combined neurological presentation, neurological symptoms improved in 7, remained stable in 4, and worsened in 5 (including 1 with subsequent death from pneumonia). 3 pts with exclusively hepatic presentation developed neurological symptoms and one pt with exclusively neurological presentation developed liver disease during follow-up. The main side effects occurred exclusively during penicillamine: glomerulonephritis (n=2) and death due to myelinolysis (n=1). In conclusion, although the short-term clinical outcome is usually satisfactory, hepatic Wilson's disease tends to progress during long-term zinc monotherapy, even after initial removal of copper with penicillamine.",,"Ras, J.;Houwen, R.;Linn, F.

1847,Therapeutic plasma exchange as a bridge to liver transplantation in a pediatric patient with Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of impaired copper metabolism with a resulting accumulation of copper primarily in the liver, but eventually in many organs and tissues. A small number of patients with WD initially present with fulminant hepatic failure, hypercupremia, and intravascular hemolysis. Therapeutic goals for these patients include rapid copper removal via hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and preparing the patient for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Here we report on a pediatric patient treated with TPE as a bridge to OLT. Case Report: The patient was a 6-year-old boy with WD who presented with fulminant hepatic failure. He had recently been diagnosed based on a urinary copper excretion of 1480 Î¼g/day and was receiving trientine chelation therapy. The patient was jaundiced with elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy, and moderate anemia with a negative direct antiglobulin test. TPE was started as a means of stabilization until OLT was possible. A total of 5 single-volume TPEs (1500 mL) were performed over the course of eleven days using the Cobe Spectra Cell Separator (CaridianBCT, Lakewood, CO) with fresh frozen plasma as replacement fluid. Due to transfusion and chelation therapy, serum and urine copper levels were not reliable markers of copper stores. Additionally, the patient, who has a diagnosis of autism, had an unexpected temporary improvement in mental status after the first TPE. The TOO was performed 15 days after his last admission and 12 days after starting TPE. The post-transplant course was uneventful. Currently, 5 months after the transplant, the patient continues with chelation therapy and is doing well. Conclusions: TPE was a successful adjuvant therapy to save this patient with WD and fulminant liver failure from OLT. Clinical trials to investigate the role of TPE in WD are needed to further determine whether this therapy should be widely implemented.",,"Morgan, S. M.;Zantek, N.

1848,New dermatological manifestations of Mowat-Wilson syndrome including photosensitivity and depigmentation,"The authors update on a previously reported patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) with unusual dermatologic features including photosensitivity and skin depigmentation.<sup>1</sup> An 18-month-old Afro-Caribbean boy with Hirschsprung disease, hypospadias , Delayed visual maturation, microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and dysmorphic facial features was referred to the dermatology service. Since birth, she presented persistent skin depigmentation with patchy macular hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation on the face and neck, upper limbs, trunk, perineum, and right ankle. There was no history of previous inflammation or eczema. Following the original report, her parents described photosensitivity from the age of 2 years, with sunburn-like erythema occurring within minutes of sun exposure despite the application of high-factor sunscreen. Investigations, including lupus serology and porphyria screening, were normal. The patient is currently awaiting a formal phototest. Genetic analysis previously identified a heterozygous truncated mutation in exon 8 of the ZEB2 gene (formerly ZFHXIB; zinc finger homeobox 1B), confirming MWS. MWS was first described in 1998 and comprises characteristic facial dysmorphism, profound learning difficulties, epilepsy, Hirschsprung's disease, and other congenital anomalies, assigned to a locus on chromosome 2q21-q23.<sup>2</sup> In 2001, the causative gene, ZEB2, was identified.<sup>3</sup> Subsequently, more than 100 pathogenic heterozygous mutations or deletions were described.<sup>4</sup> The evolving facial signature ZEB2 encodes the protein that interacts with Smad (SIP1), a ubiquitous transcription factor with an important role in embryological development, including the neural crest. ""Raindrop"" pigmentation was previously reported in a 9-year-old patient with MWS.<sup>6</sup> This indicates that MWS should be added to the spectrum of neurocutaneous disorders comprising depigmentation and Hirschsprung syndrome. We can speculate that the depigmentation results from ZEB2 haploinsufficiency that disrupts the development or migration of neural crest melanocytes. Our case is the first record of photosensitivity in MWS, which raises the possibility of an additional role for ZEB2 in the regulation of the skin response to ultraviolet radiation.",,"Kaur, B.;Taibjee, S.;Abdullah, A.;Shannon, N.",2010,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/adc.2010.186338.36,0,0,
1849,Efficacy and tolerability of zinc in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Objectives and Study: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of zinc acetate in the treatment of Wilson's Disease (WD) in children. Methods: Twenty-six patients with WD treated with zinc acetate were included in this multicenter study. Clinical and biological data were collected through a questionnaire: age and symptoms at the time of diagnosis of WD, age at the start of zinc therapy, efficacy on biological parameters, side effects. Results: At presentation, 23 patients (88%) were asymptomatic, mostly diagnosed during a family clinical study; 23 patients (88%) had liver disease and one (4%) had neurological symptoms. A Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 15% of cases. The diagnosis of WD was made at a median age of 8 years (0.8 - 16.1). Depending on the center, the percentage of WD patients treated with zinc ranged from 8.5% to 61.5%. D-penicillamine was associated in 18 patients (69%), trientine in 4 (15%) and 3 patients (11%) received the 3 drugs. Zinc therapy was started at the time of diagnosis in 12 patients (46%), as the only drug in 8 cases. The median age at the start of zinc therapy was 10.8 years (2.3-12.3) and 2.6 years after diagnosis of WD. In children who received zinc alone, it started at age 7 years (2.3 - 11.1), 5 months after diagnosis of WD. Zinc was started at the recommended dose in 11 children and was progressively increased in 15 patients. A higher dose than recommended was used in 5/6 patients under 5 years of age, 10/19 in patients between 6 and 15 years of age, and 1/1 patient over 16 years of age. After initiation of treatment, median urinary ALT and copper values normalized within 5 months. Thereafter, urine copper values remained below 50 mg/24 h in all patients except one poorly compliant patient. Epigastric pain (n = 4), vomiting and diarrhea (n = 1), leukopenia (n = 1), and transient increase in serum lipase (n = 1) were observed.

We evaluated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 114 children with WD to determine the clinical presentation, diagnostic course, and outcome. Methods: The medical records of 114 children (63 children) who were diagnosed with WD between 1991 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Physical examination, laboratory tests, and liver biopsies of the patients were evaluated. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.5+/- 3.2 years (1.5-16 years). There was consanguinity in most of the parents (81, 71.1%). Eighty-seven (76, 3%) patients were diagnosed as symptomatic cases, including 12 patients who presented with acute liver failure. Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed by family screening. Overall, 80 patients presented with hepatic, 5 neurological, and 17 both hepatic and neurological features. Hepatomegaly was the most common clinical finding, in 41 patients, while splenomegaly, jaundice and ascites in 26, 25 and 24 patients respectively, Kayser-Fleischer rings in 63 of 109 patients (57.8%) and serum ceruloplasmin less than 20 mg /dl in 97 of 114 patients evaluated (85.1%), copper excretion was greater than 80 mg/24 hours in 85 of 102 patients (83.3%).Hepatic copper greater than 250 mg/g of body weight dry was found in 53 (67.0%) of 79 patients. Cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis ica were the most common liver biopsy findings (23/79, 29.1% for each). All patients with acute liver failure died except one who received a liver transplant. Ninety-seven patients with non-fulminant WD were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate, 5 with trientine and zinc sulfate at the time of diagnosis. A total of 6 children were converted to trientine due to adverse reactions to penicillamine (nephrotic syndrome in 2, impaired liver functions in 2, Stevens-Johnson reaction in 1, allergic rash in 1 patient). Five patients underwent liver transplantation during follow-up. Seventy-six patients with non-fulminant WD had been followed up for 5.0+/- 3.7 years (3 months-14 years). Five patients died during follow-up due to end-stage liver disease. Eighteen patients who were noncompliant with chelation therapy had a poor outcome.

1851,Reassessment of diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease in children with mild liver disease,"Objectives and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a challenging diagnosis, especially in children. Early diagnosis is desirable to prevent disease progression. The objective of our study was to reassess the conventional diagnostic criteria and the Ferenci diagnostic score (1) in children with WD with mild liver disease. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 43 consecutive children with WD (28 children, age range: 1.1-20.9 years) and 58 age- and sex-matched patients with liver disease other than WD. Both groups were symptom-free with hypertransaminasemia as the prevalent sign of liver disease. In all patients with WD, the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis and/or hepatic copper content. Results: The ROC analysis for ceruloplasmin at the cut-off point of <20 mg/dl showed a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI, 84.5-99.4%) and a specificity of 84.4% (95% CI). %CI, 72.5-92.6%). The optimal baseline urinary copper diagnostic cutoff point was found to be >40 mcg/24 h (78% sensitivity [95% CI, 62.4%-89.4%] and 87.9% specificity [95% CI, 95%, 76.7-95%]). Urinary copper after penicillamine challenge had a sensitivity of only 15.4%. Liver copper >250 mcg/g dry weight had a sensitivity of 96.7% [95% CI, 82.8-99.9%] and a specificity of 95.8% [95% CI, 78, 9-99.9%]). The Ferenci diagnostic score showed a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 91.6%, respectively. Conclusion: Urinary copper excretion is suggestive of WD when it is above 40 mcg/24 h, rather than 100 mcg/24 h, as suggested by recent AASLD guidelines (2). In contrast, the penicillamine challenge test should not be performed in asymptomatic patients. The Ferenci diagnostic score shows good diagnostic accuracy. The diagnosis of WD requires multiple tests and a high index of suspicion.

1852,Extracorporeal liver support therapy,"INTRODUCTION. Extracorporeal liver support therapy is in its infancy, but is being valued as a detoxification treatment option for patients with cirrhosis who have rapidly worsening liver function. We present the use of Prometheus, a novel extracorporeal liver support system that enables removal of water-soluble and protein-bound toxins by fractionated plasma separation and absorption (FPSA) in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) who developed a rapid worsening of your liver function. METHODS. A 26-year-old patient, diagnosed with WD since she was 17 years old, was initially treated irregularly with penicillamine. Therapy was discontinued. Now, 2 years later, she developed acute decompensated liver failure with MELD 29 hepatic encephalopathy. Liver transplantation (LT) was the treatment option for this patient. But, in this case, the rapid and adverse evolution of liver failure with renal failure and the unknown waiting time for an emergency liver donor in our country led us to use extracorporeal liver support therapy. RESULTS. At 5 h 30 min of therapy, we reduced the amount of bilirubin to less than half, increased diuresis, and the following day the patient underwent a liver transplant, stable, with improved kidney function. CONCLUSIONS. Acute liver failure due to WD is most often fatal without emergency LT. This case report highlights discontinuation of chelation therapy in a patient with WD. As the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy, LT was the only treatment option, but as long as we don't get a donor, we can use, for a short period of time, extracorporeal liver support therapy as a very Useful. The results of two studies presented at the recent EASL 2010 Congress have shown that treatment with extracorporeal devices may not confer a survival advantage for patients with severe liver failure, despite the positive effects of dialysis. However, the results among a small subgroup of patients are promising, such as critically ill patients with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 or a MELD score greater than 30.",,"Marinho, A. D.;Pais, T.

1853,"Anesthetic management of a pediatric patient with Wilson's disease, is spinal anesthesia safe-report of a case","Wilson's disease, characterized by cirrhosis, extrapyramidal symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, is a rare hereditary disease of human copper metabolism. Wilson's disease involves loss of the ability to export copper from the liver to bile and to incorporate copper into hepatic ceruloplasmin. Accumulation of copper occurs in various organs and tissues, especially the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea. The clinical findings in Wilson's disease are complex, and neurological symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, rigid dystonia, seizures, disorders psychiatric, acute liver failure, chronic disease can develop hepatitis or cirrhosis. A 6-year-old female patient underwent surgery for hip joint contractures. she was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 2.5 years and treated with zinc sulfate and D-penicillamine. Spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine was administered at the L3-L4 level. This patient was sedated with midazolam to provide spinal anesthesia. No complications were found during the operation or in the postoperative period. We conclude that spinal anesthesia can be successfully administered to patients with Wilson's disease and spinal anesthesia is preferred over general anesthesia as most anesthetic agents are metabolized in the liver and may aggravate toxicity. hepatic.

1854,Elevated plasma copper/zinc ratios in patients with schizophrenia,"Introduction: Copper and zinc are neuroactive substances that can be synaptically released during neuronal activity. These metals have been implicated in diseases with neuropsychopathological components, such as Alzheimer's disease, Menkes disease, Wilson's disease, Pick's disease, strokes, seizures, and schizophrenia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the plasma levels of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in schizophrenic patients and to compare the Cu/Zn ratios with those of matched healthy subjects. Materials and methods: 40 patients with schizophrenia (35 men and 5 women; mean age 32.77 years) were sampled together with 50 (41 men and 9 women; mean age 31.44 years) healthy controls. Exclusion criteria included another concurrent psychiatric disorder, pregnancy, and medical conditions or medications known to affect trace element metabolism. Fasting blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein between 07:00 and 09:00 h. Plasma copper and zinc levels were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Two-tailed t-test was used to determine statistical differences. Differences were considered significant at the p<0.05 level. Results: The mean levels of Cu or Zn and the Cu/Zn ratios for each of the two groups are shown below: Cu (mug/dl) =65+/-3 or 145+/-28, control or patients, respectively, p<0.005. Zn (mug/dl)=81+/-4 or 67+/-2, control or patients, respectively, p<0.05. Cu/Zn ratio=0.87+/-0.04 or 2.07+/-0.38, control or patients, respectively, p<0.05. Conclusion: There was a significantly higher Cu/Zn ratio in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects. These results suggest that Cu and Zn may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",,"Mansouri, N.;Farzin, D.",2010,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03233.x,0,0,
1855,Gait disturbance in a patient with Wilson's disease 18 years after disease onset,"Objective: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that leads to excessive accumulation of copper inside and outside the liver. A wide spectrum of neurological symptoms including dystonia, parkinsonian features, cerebellar and medullary signs is very common and can severely affect a patient's quality of life. Although gait disturbance is a fairly prominent neurological sign in Wilson's disease, the characteristics of gait abnormalities have not been described in detail in the literature. We describe the gait disturbances in a patient who has presented clinical signs of Wilson's disease for 18 years and has been treated with different anti-copper agents since the first diagnosis in 1992. Methods: This 51-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. . illness at the age of 33 years after a 2-year history of severe arm and head tremor that resulted in significant impairment of his ability to work. Irritable and aggressive behavior was present at disease onset and worsened in the first few years after diagnosis. He reported a marked progression of symptoms after changing treatment from D-penicillamine to zinc sulfate in the late 1990s. Despite D-penicillamine being reintroduced, since then the ability to walk has remained difficult and the patient has been strapped into a walker to overcome his gait disorder in an appropriate way. A recent urinalysis showed that copper was effectively removed by D-penicillamine. Results: On neurological examination, the patient revealed a complex gait disorder comprising features of severe (gait-specific) dystonia, gait apraxia, and frozen gait (FOG), respectively. As he walked sideways along the wall, he used a simple cue to improve his gait impairment. Otherwise, no significant impairment of leg motility or marked dystonic features could be observed when sitting or lying down. Some frontal signs were positive in this patient, however, pyramidal signs were missing. Conclusion: This is an illustrative case showing a particular pattern of gait abnormalities with a combination of FOG and dystonia. Although dystonia is well known in patients with Wilson's disease, FOG is unusual and could reflect the involvement of different neuroanatomical structures beyond the pathology of the basal ganglia.",,"Brugger, F.;Felbecker, A.;Kagi, G.;Hagele-Link, S.;Tettenborn, B.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5575-7,0,0,
1856,Persistence of anti-copper treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease is a genetically determined failure of copper metabolism. If left untreated, it usually leads to death within several years from the development of clinical symptoms. Medications that deplete copper should be continued for the life of the patient after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson's disease frequently discontinue treatment. The aim of the study was to assess drug compliance (defined by us as persistence with treatment) among patients with Wilson's disease prescribed different anti-copper drugs, and to assess how this translates into clinical and clinical improvement. the total well-being. Methods: Our study was based on a retrospective analysis of information received from self-completed questionnaires given to patients attending the Wilson's disease clinic. The following data were obtained from each patient: medication prescribed, duration of treatment, persistence with treatment, subjective assessment of health status. The EQ-5D questionnaire with visual analog scale (VAS) of well-being was also used. Results: Responses were obtained from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires could be used for further processing. 55% of the patients were treated with d-penicillamine and the rest with zinc sulfate. The mean duration of treatment was 10.3 (SD +/- 4.4) years. Our analysis revealed no difference in persistence with d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate treatment (75.0% vs. 73.0%, respectively), or in the efficacy of the above medications. We have found, however, that regardless of medication used, persistence with drug therapy resulted in significantly better self-assessed outcomes: ""total improvement"": 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the persistent group vs. non-persistent, respectively, p=0.003; ""partial improvement"": 53.8% vs 30.8%, respectively, p=0.045; ""deterioration"": 0.0% vs. 42.3%, respectively, p<0.0001. Treatment-persistent patients obtained higher VAS scores than non-persistent patients (76 vs. 67, p=0.05).

1857,Complex neuropsychiatric symptoms in adolescent Wilson's disease: the need for multidisciplinary care,"Objective: To describe the case of a young adult with Wilson's disease (WD) with severe neuropsychiatric disease that significantly affects his quality of life. Advocate early detection of these symptoms and multidisciplinary care. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport and metabolism that affects 1 in 30,000 people. Children and young adults predominantly present to pediatric services due to liver dysfunction. A large number of these patients will have unrecognized and unreported comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our center has developed a multidisciplinary team to manage WD. This is a case that highlights the importance of this approach. Methods: Description of the case history, MR images, course of treatment and clinical outcome. Results: A 19-year-old woman with a 9-year history of genetically proven WD treated with penicillamine was seen at our WD multidisciplinary clinic. Although he had stable liver disease on penicillamine, direct questioning revealed a significant two-year history of social anxiety and moodiness. Psychiatric evaluation detected paranoia. He had a slight tremor. Worsening depression led to hospital admission for psychiatric symptoms and antidepressant therapy with venlafaxine was started. During her inpatient stay, she developed Parkinsonism and was started on levo-dopa. This has improved his movement disorder, but he continues to require intensive psychiatric support. A multidisciplinary ED team, made up of hepatologists, neurologists, and psychiatrists, has enabled the detection, proper diagnosis, and timely management of the patient's marked neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Neuropsychiatric symptoms in children and young adults with WD are not rare. All clinicians caring for children or youth with liver disease diagnosed with WD should assess for neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of diagnosis and during ongoing treatment. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we are better able to identify previously undiagnosed comorbidity that requires urgent intervention.",,"Hedderly, T.;Hinnell, C.;Moriarty, J.;Jarosz, J.;Hindley, P.;Dhawan, A.;Sherwood, R.;Samuel, M.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1858,A retrospective study on the characteristics of Wilson's disease in the tertiary care institute of North India.,"Objective: To study the clinical profiles, laboratory findings, brain imaging of Wilson's disease and response to treatment. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive systemic disorder of copper metabolism due to a defect in copper transport by hepatic lysosomes with secondary pathology resulting from copper overload in the liver, brain, kidneys, and circulatory system. skeletal. Methods: Cases of Wilson's disease were taken from hospital records from December 2004 to December 2009. A total of 32 cases were diagnosed. A study was performed to see clinical characteristics, presence of KF ring, laboratory parameters, biochemical levels and brain imaging. Results: A total of 32 cases of Wilson's disease were diagnosed. 22 were men and 10 women. 28 cases were under 15 years of age and 4 were adults. The youngest patient was 6.5 years old and the oldest patient was 32 years old at the time of diagnosis. The median duration of disease before diagnosis was 6 months in children (<15 years) and 2 years in adults (>15 years). In children dystonia was the most frequent presentation (90%), parkinsonism (82.5%), both in 73.4% and tremor in 60%, and in adults parkinsonism was the most frequent presentation (75%), dystonia (50 %) and tremor in 60%. 50% of the adult patient. Sialorrhea was present in 60% of children and 25% of adult patients. Unclear voice was present in 80% of cases. Dysphagia was present in 44% of children and 25% of adult patients. The KF ring was absent in 3 children. Brain computed tomography was performed in all cases, the most common abnormality observed was bilateral symmetrical hyperlucency of the basal ganglia in 13 (40.6%). Brain MRI performed in 24 cases. 4 had normal MRI brain. Abnormalities were observed in 20 cases, the most frequent being basal ganglia hyperintensities (62.5%), thalamus in 45%, and brainstem in 31.5%. 4 patients were taking only zinc and 28 were taking both zinc and D-penicillamine. Of 28 cases, 10 have left D-penicillamine (2 due to adverse effects and 8 due to lack of affordability). All have excellent response to treatment except one child. Conclusions: Wilson's disease was more frequent in children. The most common features were dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor, hypersalivation, and unclear voice. The KF ring was present in 91% of cases. Bilateral symmetric hyperintensities of the basal ganglia were the most frequent abnormalities on MRI. Zinc is safer to start with. Wilson's disease has an excellent response to D-penicillamine.",,"Kumar, A.;Kumar, R.;Kumar, U.;Sharan, A.;Shahi, S. K.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,1,
1859,Successful treatment of Wilson's disease dystonia with botulinum toxin,"Objective: To report a case of WD dystonia that was successfully treated with botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections. Background: Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration or Wilson's disease (PD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Neurological signs mainly include akinetic-rigid and dystonic syndromes, tremor and ataxia. Originally described as a lethal familial neurological and hepatic disease, it currently has different pharmacological therapies. However, the treatment of WD with neurological symptoms is currently a problem. Methods: A 38-year-old woman was diagnosed with WD in 1985. She was initially treated with penicillamine, which was changed to trientine in 1988 due to a lupus-like syndrome. In 2007, he developed progressive parkinsonian syndrome and dystonia that required treatment with ammonium zinc tetrathiomolybdate. He improved clinically but due to the persistence of bilateral leg dystonia, botulinum toxin was tried, with a dose of 1000 U BTA (Dysport) in the extensor hallucis longus, flexor hallucis brevis, abductor hallucis and abductor muscles. Bilateral digiti quinti with EMG guidance. Results: After two weeks, he noticed a functional improvement that allowed him to wear comfortable shoes and a reduction in symptoms, with a decrease in spasms, pain relief and improvement in contractures. Two additional injections of 500 U BTA were given at four-month intervals with good results. No adverse events were reported. He is now neurologically stable. Conclusions: BTA injections into affected muscles should be considered as a treatment option in the management of WD dystonia that may be followed by marked functional improvement and reduction of systemic drugs. In our patient, the significant improvement started 2 weeks after the injections and lasted about 4 months.",,"De Fabregues, O.;Palasi, A.;Callen, A.;Hernandez-Vara, J.;Alvarez-Sabin, J.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1860,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate: Experience in 3 cases with neurological symptoms,"Objective: To report our experience with TTMo at WD. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Originally described as a lethal familial neurological and hepatic disease, it currently has different pharmacological therapies. However, neurological deterioration and serious adverse reactions have been reported with penicillamine and trientine requiring the use of other drugs such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTMo). Methods: These 3 patients with WD with neurological deterioration were treated with TTMo 120 mg/day for 8 weeks. All patients were clinically evaluated with the neurological subscale UWDRS and GAS for WD, video and neuroimaging, before and 6 months after treatment. Adverse drug events were assessed by hematologic and biochemical measures and clinical follow-up. Results: Different reasons for treatment with TTMo: neurological deterioration with penicillamine, intolerance to conventional treatment and neurological presentation of WD. Efficacy: no patient presented neurological deterioration. All patients had clinical improvement with a mean drop for UWDRS of 34 points (64% improvement) and GAS of 14 points for WD (47% improvement). Well tolerated in 2 cases, treatment lasted an additional 8 weeks in 1 case, 1 case had elevated transaminases causing dose reduction and transient suppression. Improved neuroimaging in 2 cases. Subsequent clinical course: moderate neurological sequelae in 2 and mild in 1 case, 1 death unrelated to treatment. Conclusions: The treatment of WD with neurological symptoms is challenging. There is concern about penicillamine and trientine as first-line treatment choices. TTMo is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic alternative, although its contraindications need to be clarified.",,"De Fabregues, O.;Palasi, A.;Gamez, J.;Callen, A.;Hernandez-Vara, J.;Duero, M.;Auge, C.;Alvarez-Sabin, J.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1861,"Copper Metabolism and Inherited Disorders of Copper Transport: Molecular Mechanisms, Detection, and Treatment","In this review, we discuss genetic disorders involving impaired copper metabolism, particularly in relation to Menkes disease (MD), occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and Wilson's disease (WD). The genes responsible for MD and WD are ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Both proteins encoded by these genes are responsible for transporting copper from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus. However, the pathology of MD is completely different from that of WD, that is, MD is characterized by a deficiency of copper while WD is caused by a toxic excess of copper. The reason for this difference is related to the particular cell types in which the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins are expressed. ATP7A is expressed in almost all cell types except hepatocytes, whereas ATP7B is expressed mainly in hepatocytes. MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of MD, such as neurological disorders, connective tissue disorders, and hair abnormalities, can be explained by abnormally low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard treatment for MD is the parenteral administration of copper-histidine. When treatment is started in newborns before two months of age, neurological degeneration can be prevented, but later treatment is considerably less effective. Furthermore, treatment with copper-histidine does not improve symptoms of connective tissue disorders. As such, systems for mass newborn screening for MD should be implemented. At the same time, new treatments targeting connective tissue disorders need to be developed. OHS is a milder form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. Although no formal trials have been conducted for OHS, patients with OHS are generally treated similarly to those with MD. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. The liver and nervous systems are usually the most severely affected. However, many other symptoms can also be seen, making early diagnosis difficult. Chelating agents and zinc are effective for the treatment of WD but are ineffective for patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Some patients with neurological diseases show a poor response to chelating agents; here again, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Screening for WD in newborns or infants can help achieve timely diagnosis and treatment. WD patients may be at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma despite receiving treatment. Understanding the relationship between WD and hepatocellular carcinoma will provide clues to help prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in WD patients.

Objective To systematically assess the available literature on the treatment of new patients with presymptomatic, hepatic or neurological presentation of Wilson's disease. Methods A systematic bibliographic search was carried out in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE databases. Original studies on the clinical efficacy of monotherapy with d-penicillamine, trientine, tetrathiomolybdate or zinc as initial treatment in Wilson's disease were included. A descriptive analysis of the relevant published data was performed. Results One randomized trial and 12 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were quite heterogeneous and generally of low validity. However, based on currently available data, patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease are probably more effectively treated with d-penicillamine. Zinc appears to be preferred over d-penicillamine for the treatment of presymptomatic and neurological patients, as the tolerance profile is favorable to zinc in these subgroups, with no apparent difference in clinical efficacy. Conclusions High-quality evidence is lacking to estimate the relative treatment effects of available drugs in Wilson's disease. Therefore, multicentre prospective randomized controlled comparative trials are needed. Â© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Wiggelinkhuizen, M.;Tilanus, M. E. C.;Bollen, C. W.;Houwen, R. H.

1868,Pregnancy and Wilson's disease. [Portuguese],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder, with an affected gene (ATP7B) located on chromosome 13. It has been shown to affect copper transport, leading to hepatic accumulation and deposition in other organs, especially the liver. brain, kidneys and cornea. The worldwide prevalence of Wilson's disease is about 30 per million. About 60-70% of all cases are diagnosed between the ages of 8 to 20 years. Clinically, the condition may present with liver, neurological, or psychiatric disease. Diagnosis is based on a high level of suspicion and a combination of clinical and laboratory findings. The gold standard test for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease is liver biopsy with determination of hepatic copper levels. Treatment is lifelong drug therapy or liver transplantation. There are currently three drugs available, penicillamine and trientine (chelating agents) and zinc. Tetrathiomolybdate is another chelating agent that is still under evaluation. The reproductive capacity of women with Wilson's disease has improved with the increasing efficacy of these therapies, and therefore pregnancy is becoming more common. It does not seem that the course of the disease is affected by pregnancy, but the problem of which is the most appropriate therapy during pregnancy remains, since the safety of these drugs cannot be assured during this period.

1870,Fulminant and subfulminant hepatitis: causes and treatment. [French],"Fulminant hepatitis is an emergency because in a few hours the doctor must find the cause of the hepatitis (unidentified in 15 to 20% of cases), rule out any contraindication for liver transplantation, verify that it is indicated and prevent and/or treat complications associated with liver failure. Viruses (especially hepatitis A and B viruses), drugs, and toxic agents are the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis, with proportions varying between countries. Hepatitis viruses, the leading cause during 1995-1996, have lagged behind drugs and, in particular, paracetamol, which is now the leading cause of this disease in Europe and the United States. There are also other rarer causes: other viruses (eg, herpes viruses HSV1 or 2, hepatitis E virus, parvovirus B19, and varicella-herpes zoster), Wilson's disease, acute Budd-Chiari and Reyes syndromes, autoimmune hepatitis, neoplastic infiltration of the liver, hypoxic hepatitis, heat stroke, pregnancy-related acute steatosis, and HELLP syndrome. The prognosis is essentially determined by the neurological status, but is also very rapidly affected by damage to other organs. Liver transplantation has revolutionized the prognosis of fulminant hepatitis, increasing survival from 10-20% (all causes combined) to 75-80% at one year and 70% at 5 years. These patients can only be treated in specialized centers with access to liver transplantation and different modern means of liver resuscitation (hypothermia, artificial liver support, albumin dialysis, monitoring of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion, etc.), all from the disease onset. .

1875,Genetics and Treatment of Dystonia,"Torsional dystonias encompass a broad collection of etiologic subtypes, often divided into primary and secondary classes. Tremendous progress has been made in uncovering the genetic basis of dystonia, including the discovery of a gene that causes early-onset primary torsion dystonia: a GAG deletion in exon 5 of the DYT1 gene encoding torsinA. Although the exact function of torsinA remains elusive, evidence suggests abnormal localization and interaction of the mutated protein; this may result in an abnormal stress response or interference with cytoskeletal events and the development of neural brain pathways. Advances include the discovery of a genetic modifier that protects against clinical expression in DYT1 dystonia and the identification of the gene that causes DYT6, THAP1. The authors review genetic etiologies and discuss phenotypes, as well as counseling patients on prognosis and disease progression. They also address pharmacological and surgical treatment options for various forms of dystonia. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Schwarz, C. S.;Bressman, S.

1878,Reduced expression of ATP7B affected by mutations causing Wilson's disease is rescued by pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes ATP7B, a protein located in the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic excretion of copper. Current treatment involves reduction of circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients have neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that defects resulting from some WD mutations are ameliorated by pharmacological treatment aimed at improving protein folding and restoring protein function. This required a systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of distinct ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V, and p.S1363F) resulted in reduced protein expression. ATP7B, while the messenger RNA abundance was not affected. Retention of mutant ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression and normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30 Â°C, and homology modeling suggested that these proteins were misfolded. Four distinct mutations exhibited residual copper export capability, while other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression in most ATP7B mutants. Conclusion: These findings could enable new treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity.

1884,Copper compounds in anticancer strategies,"The chemical properties of copper allow it to participate in many biological functions, such as electron transfer, catalysis, and structural conformation. The ability to alternate between the +1 and +2 oxidation state is one of the characteristics that organisms have exploited throughout the evolutionary process. Since copper is potentially toxic to cells, a finely controlled mechanism for copper handling has also been developed. On the other hand, many copper complexes were synthesized and tested for their anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Its ability to kill cancer cells is mainly related to the induction of oxidative stress, but its ability to inhibit the proteasome, a protein complex whose proteolytic activity is necessary for various cellular processes, has recently emerged. In general, it has been described that the toxic effects of copper complexes lead to cell death by necrosis or by activation of the apoptotic process. Evidence is emerging on the ability of some copper compounds to induce an alternative non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death. Since copper is essential for the formation of new blood vessels, angiogenesis, a different antitumor approach based on the administration of copper-sequestering agents has been tried and its efficacy is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The proven essentiality of copper for angiogenesis, together with the marked sensitivity shown by various cancer cell lines to copper toxicity, opens a new perspective in anticancer strategy: exploiting the tumor's need for copper to accumulate toxic amounts of the metal within its cells. cells.

1888,Wilson's disease: two treatment modalities. Correlations with Pretreatment and Posttreatment Brain MRI,"Introduction: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in Wilson's disease (WD) show a lack of correlation between neurological and neuroimaging characteristics. Reports of long-term follow-up with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different treatment modalities are scarce. Methods: Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent brain MRI before and after treatment to assess the range of abnormalities and the evolution over these different time periods. All patients underwent at least two MRIs at different intervals, up to 11 years after the start of treatment. MRI findings correlated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and treatment with two different drugs. Patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: d-penicillamine (DP), zinc (Zn) and Zn after the appearance of severe intolerance to DP. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging before treatment showed, in all patients, lesions of hypersignal intensity on T2-weighted images and proton density bilaterally and symmetrically in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and white matter of the brain. The most frequent neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disorders, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea and athetosis. Conclusions: From the neurological point of view, there was no difference in the evolution between the group treated exclusively with PD and the one treated with Zn. Analysis of MRIs with longer intervals after the start of treatment showed a trend of worsening neuroimaging, without neurological correspondence, among Zn-treated patients. The pattern of evolution of the neuroimaging was more favorable for the group that received exclusively PD. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,"Leiros Da Costa, M. D. D.;Spitz, M.;Bacheschi, L. A.;Leite, C.

1889,Carlecortemcel-l: an ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood cell graft for allogeneic transplantation,"Background: The success of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is mainly affected by the cell dose infused and its application is limited by the size of the recipient. For most adults and older children, it is not possible to find a single UCB unit large enough for a reliable graft. One strategy to increase the number of available progenitor cells is ex vivo unit expansion. The main challenge of ex vivo expansion systems is how not to deplete the population of self-renewing cells leading them to differentiate into committed progenitors. Purpose: Copper modulates basic cellular functions, such as survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Cellular copper reduction under ex vivo culture conditions allowed preferential proliferation of early progenitors and increased engraftment capabilities. The result of a phase I study of carlecortemcel-l, a product derived from ex vivo expansion of UCB progenitors in the presence of a copper chelator and early-acting cytokines, and the design of the current pivotal study are presented. Methods: A review of the literature using PubMed and the manufacturer's investigator's brochure. Conclusions: Early results suggest that carlecortemcel-I infusion is safe and may be associated with favorable non-relapse mortality rates. A pivotal global study is currently underway to assess the safety and efficacy of this product in centralized manufacturing facilities. Â© 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

1891,Anti-copper therapies in Alzheimer's disease: New concepts,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The recent Metal Hypothesis establishes that the interaction of amyloid beta (Abeta, the main component of senile plaques) with transition metals is the basis of AD neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is based on in vitro studies showing that metals (copper, zinc) accelerate aggregation and precipitation at Abeta plaques, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction and accelerated amyloidogenesis. We have recently identified a specific marker of 'copper disease' in AD patients, which consists of an increase in serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, called 'free' copper. Several patents have been issued in recent years and many clinical trials have been attempted in search of an anti-metal effect that counteracts the progression of AD. Some of them have shown very encouraging results. However, these antimetal agents have also shown adverse effects. This work aims to review 'old' and 'new' attitudes towards the use of anti-copper complexing agents or biological molecules that induce or maintain a state of copper malabsorption, such as zinc compounds, paying particular attention to how such rethinking de 'Old' clinical trials could chart new paths in planning for 'modern' ones.

1892,Pharmacological therapies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia,"Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, seen primarily in neonates, can cause kernicterus and death. Conventional treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia consists of phototherapy and exchange transfusion. Phototherapy, however, has several known drawbacks, while exchange transfusion is associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. These deleterious effects indicate the need to develop alternative drug treatment strategies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Generally, these strategies aim to lower the plasma concentration of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) by inhibiting production, stimulating hepatic clearance, or interrupting enterohepatic circulation of the pigment. To be considered for routine clinical use, an alternative treatment strategy must be less invasive and at least as effective and safe as phototherapy. Several drug therapies such as metalloporhyrins, clofibrate, bile salts, laxatives, and bilirubin oxidase may meet these criteria in the future, but none have been sufficiently evaluated to allow routine application. This review aims to discuss the state of the art and future perspectives in the pharmacological treatment of neonatal jaundice. Â© 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Cuperus, F. J.

1893,Development of drugs for orphan diseases in the context of personalized medicine,"Orphan diseases are diseases found in fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, which is the cut-off point in the number of patients for a drug to be profitable. Because there are many thousands of orphan diseases altogether (about 20 to 30 million Americans have orphan diseases), the pharmaceutical industry deprives these patients of drug development. Orphan drugs are a big part of personalized medicine. Orphan diseases are often so rare that a doctor may see only 1 case per year or less. Therefore, an adequate treatment is a personalized meeting between doctor and patient. Academic medical scientists have tried to fill this therapeutic gap by working on the development of orphan drugs. But there are many disincentives involved, including professional disincentives, lack of funds, and the multiple areas of expertise that are required. Positive developments include the formation of the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the Orphan Drug Act, the development of a grant program to fund the development of orphan drugs, the formation of the Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and the passage of orphan drug legislation by other countries Progress has increased, but the 300 orphan drugs and devices approved in the last 25 years are still just a drop in the ocean compared to the many thousands of orphan diseases. I think we should do better. I present my own 2 examples of the positives and negatives of orphan drug development, and end this article by giving recommendations on how we could be successful in both developing more orphan drugs and rescuing the pharmaceutical industry from its impending economic collapse.

1894,Nanoparticle-Coupled Metal Chelators as Potential Therapeutic Agents for Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive and irreversible memory loss followed by complete dementia. Despite the high prevalence of the disease and the great economic and social burden, there is no explanatory etiology or viable cure. A great effort has been made to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to develop more effective therapeutic agents. However, success is greatly hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which limits a large number of potential treatments from entering the brain. Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is one of the few valuable tools to overcome this impediment, and its application as a potential treatment for AD is promising. In this review, current studies on the delivery of chelating agent nanoparticles as potential treatments for AD are discussed because several metals are found in excess in the AD brain and may play a role in the development of the disease. Specifically, a novel approach involving the transport of iron chelating agents into and out of the brain by nanoparticles is highlighted. This approach may provide a safer and more effective means of simultaneously reducing several toxic metals in the AD brain. It may also provide insight into the mechanisms of AD pathophysiology and be useful in the treatment of other iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. . It is important to note that the use of nanoparticle-mediated transport to facilitate the excretion of toxicants from diseased sites in the body may advance nanoparticle technology, which is currently focused on targeted drug delivery for the prevention and treatment of disease. diseases. The application of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in the treatment of AD is in its early stages of development, and therefore further study is warranted.

1897,Hypoglycemia and endocrine effects of inborn errors of metabolism in adults. [French],"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare diseases, most often inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. They may be associated with endocrine dysfunction, the most common being carbohydrate metabolism disorders (hypoglycemia, diabetes). The endocrinologist could be led to screen for these complications in a patient whose diagnosis was made during childhood. In some rare cases, it should evoke the diagnosis of an endocrine disorder more frequently associated with multisystem involvement. This field of expansion is new, not yet well known in adulthood. The long-term consequences of EMI on fertility and bone metabolism are still poorly understood. Diagnostic guidance is based on a few specific laboratory investigations covering blood lactate, free fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, carnitine and acylcarnitines, amino acids, and urine organic chromatography. Hyperinsulinism, glycogenosis, fatty acid s-oxidation, disorders of the carnitine cycle and glycosylation (CDG syndrome), fructose intolerance, tyrosinemia, and organic aciduria may explain hypoglycemia. These diagnoses must be evoked in the face of unexplained adult hypoglycemia. Diabetes is linked to iron overload, mitochondriopathy, and thiamine-responsive diabetes. Clinical spectrum of some forms of IEM change from hypoglycemia in childhood to diabetes in adulthood. Mitochondriopathies can be associated with all kinds of endocrine disorders, the most common being diabetes and dysthyroidism. Hypothyroidism is found in mitochondriopathies, cystinosis, and primary hyperoxaluria. Hypogonadism is almost constant in galactosemia, frequent in CDG syndromes, cystinosis, and iron overload.

1902,Chelation therapy for neurodegenerative diseases,"Increasing evidence suggests a central role for transition biometals in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). In fact, by studying the molecular basis of this heterogeneous group of diseases, it has become increasingly evident that biometals and non-physiological aluminum are often involved in the initiation and progression of the pathology, either by affecting the conformation of specific proteins or by exacerbating local oxidative stress. The apparently critical role that metal dyshomeostasis plays in DN makes chelation therapy an attractive pharmacological option. However, classical metal chelation approaches, which are based on potent metal ligands, were found to be successful only in those rare cases where exceptional metal accumulation occurs in the brain due to specific defects in metal metabolism. . In contrast, metal-targeted approaches using intermediate-strength ligands appear to be more appropriate for combating major ND, although their benefits are still in question. We present here a survey of recent evidence supporting the use of a variety of metal ligands, and even functionalized nanoparticles, for the treatment of the most common DN. The beneficial neuropharmacologic actions of metal-targeting agents likely arise from local metal redistribution rather than massive metal removal. Prospects for the development of new effective agents against EN are critically discussed.

Both patients with decompensated cirrhosis improved to a compensated state after initiation of therapy. Two of the five patients with initial compensated cirrhosis progressed to a decompensated state and three remain stable. Three of the five patients with moderate or mild liver disease remain stable and two have improved. Apart from decreased bilirubin levels, there were no significant changes in liver biochemistry or function during long-term follow-up. Nine of 10 neurological patients markedly improved and one deteriorated. Two patients with exclusively neurological presentation developed liver disease during zinc treatment. Two patients with exclusively hepatic presentation developed mild neurological symptoms. Based on 24-hour urinary copper excretions (213 +/- 38 vs. 91 +/- 23 +/- mug: P = 0.01) and serum ceruloplasmin-unbound copper concentrations (11 +/- 2 vs. 7 = 1 mug/dL: P = 0.1) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy of decoppering was lower in the hepatic-only group than in the neurological group. The prescribed zinc dose and 24-hour urinary zinc excretions tended to be lower in the hepatic-only group. Conclusion: The result of exclusive zinc therapy is generally good in cases of neurological disease. A less satisfactory outcome in liver disease may be related to less efficient copper clearance.

1904,Analysis of multiple elements in the urine of patients with Wilson's disease during penicillamine therapy. [Chinese],"Objective: To analyze the concentrations of 21 elements in the 24-hour urine of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) during penicillamine therapy. Methods: 40 patients with WD in treatment with penicillamine and hypocopper diets (WD group) were collected, and another 12 healthy people were served as a control group. The 21-element concentrations of Cr, Fe, Co, Se, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Be, Al, V, Ni, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ti, Th, U, Ca, and Mg in 24 h urine were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: For 7 essential trace elements (Cr, Fe, Co, Se, Mn, Cu and Zn), the concentrations of Mn, Cu and Zn in the 24-h urine of the WD group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.01). For 12 non-essential trace elements (As, Be, Al, V, Ni, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ti, Th, and U), the concentration of As in the 24-h urine of the WD group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). For 2 macroelements (Ca and Mg), the 24-h urine Ca concentration of the WD group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: For patients with WD treated with penicillamine and low-copper diets, the concentration of Cu in 24-h urine increases, and those of Mn, Zn, As and Ca also change.",,"Jiao, X. T.;Liu, X.

1905,Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Just Different,"Chiral substances possess a unique architecture such that, despite sharing identical molecular formulas, atom-to-atom bonding, and bond distances, they cannot overlap. Therefore, in the setting of living systems, where specific structure-activity relationships may be required for effect (eg, enzymes, receptors, transporters, and DNA), the physicochemical and biochemical properties of racemic mixtures and stereoisomers Individuals may differ significantly. In drug development, enantiomeric selection to maximize clinical effects or mitigate drug toxicity has been both successful and unsuccessful. To further complicate genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition, stereoselective metabolism of chiral compounds can further influence pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity. Optically pure pharmaceuticals can undergo racemization in vivo, negating the benefits of a single enantiomer or inducing unexpected effects. Appropriate chiral antidotes should be selected for therapeutic benefit and to minimize adverse events. The enantiomers may have different carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. Environmental toxicology provides several examples where the bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity of compounds show chiral dependence. In forensic toxicology, chiral analysis has been applied to illicit drug preparations and biological samples, with the potential to aid in the determination of cause of death and aid in the correct interpretation of substance abuse and ""doping"" screens. .

1906,Dermatological signs in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Since data on skin and mucosal findings in patients with Wilson's disease have not been published to date, the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of skin and mucosal findings in the childhood Wilson's disease and determine its specific dermatologic findings, if necessary. anyone exists. Methods: 37 children aged 4 to 17 years with Wilson's disease were included. A complete examination of skin, scalp, mucous membranes and nails was performed. Results: Of the children, 26 (70.3%) presented at least one dermatological finding. Twenty-five (67.6%), five (13.5%), nine (24.3%) had at least one finding in the skin, mucous membranes, and nails, respectively. The most prevalent dermatological diagnosis of patients with Wilson's disease was xerosis (45.7%). The presence of dermatological findings was not related to medication use, disease severity, or malnutrition. Disease duration did not differ in patients with or without dermatologic findings. However, the frequency of cutaneous findings alone was high in relatively recently diagnosed patients (<2 years). Conclusion The dermatologist should be aware of the various dermatological manifestations of Wilson's disease, since a careful and objective examination of the skin, mucous membranes, nails and hair may be indicative of a diagnosis of Wilson's disease, especially in cases early.

1908,Wilson's disease: Experience with 71 patients followed up for two decades in a Tertiary Center in Saudi Arabia,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare but treatable condition that often presents diagnostic dilemmas. Objectives: This study presents the experience of more than two decades of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center (a tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) with patients with WD to illustrate the various patterns, treatments, and outcomes. Patients and Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD; The mean age +/- SD at presentation was 16.8 +/- 10.7 (range: 2-49) years; 40 (56.3%) were male; referred to our center were reviewed and analyzed. Results: The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological and mixed in 39(54.9%), 14(19.7%) and 18(25.4%) patients, respectively, and of these 11(15.5% ) were asymptomatic cases detected by relatives. put on screen The family history of WD was positive in 41 (57.7%) patients and the consanguinity of the parents in 26 (36.6%) patients. Kayser Fleiser Ring (KFR) was absent, questionable, and present in 32 (45.1%), 3 (4.2%), and 36 (50.7%) respectively. The KFR was positive in 10 (71.4%), 11 (28.2%) and 15 (83.3%) of the patients who presented neurological, hepatic and mixed symptoms, respectively. The mean follow-up period of 92.2+/-72.9 (range: 1-320) months. The mean age at the end of follow-up was 25.3+/-12 (range: 4-62) years. Hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58 (81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientine were administered to 32 (45.1) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation. and one died (1.4%) on the waiting list. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, while 45 (63.4) and 16 (22.5%) are still in follow-up or have been lost, respectively. Liver condition remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%), and neurological status showed improvement in 11 (34.4%) of the 32 patients who had neurological compromise. Conclusions: This is the largest cohort reported from the Middle East. The presentation and the result of WD are very diverse. The diagnosis of WD still depends primarily on clinical, radiological, and laboratory evidence of abnormal copper metabolism.

1909,Long-term exclusive zinc monotherapy in symptomatic Wilson's disease: Experience in 17 patients,"Although zinc inhibits intestinal copper absorption in Wilson's disease, its use as sole treatment is controversial, particularly in symptomatic patients. We treated 17 symptomatic Wilson's patients with zinc alone. The presentation was exclusively hepatic, exclusively neurological and combined in 7, 5 and 5 pts resp. The median follow-up was 14 years (range 2-30). Liver disease was classified as: decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B/C), compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), moderate (abnormal liver biochemistry and radiology, no cirrhosis), or minor (abnormal liver biochemistry only). The mean dose of elemental zinc was 147 +/- 12 mg/day (range 67 -270) at baseline and 199 +/- 20 mg/day (90 - 360) at the end of follow-up (P=0.03), no difference between various display modes. Side effects were rare, except for gastrointestinal discomfort. One patient on concomitant antiepileptic drugs experienced reversible agranulocytosis. Of 12 patients with baseline liver disease, 2 had decompensated cirrhosis at baseline and both improved to a compensated state after zinc initiation. Two of 5 pts with initial compensated cirrhosis progressed to a decompensated state after 16 resp. 18 years, and 3 remain stable. Three of 5 pts with moderate or mild liver disease remain stable and 2 improved. Two of 5 pts with exclusively neurological presentation at baseline developed moderate liver disease resp. compensated cirrhosis after 4 resp. 5 years of treatment. In the liver group, apart from improved bilirubin levels, there were no significant changes in liver biochemistry or function. Neurological symptoms markedly improved in 9 of 10 pts in the neurological group and deteriorated in 1 pt. Brain MRI improved in 4, remained stable in 4, and deteriorated in 2 cases. Elevated serum free copper levels normalized (<0.15 mg/L) within a year of zinc in 15/17 pts, with no difference between hepatic or neurological pts. In contrast, adequate 24-hour urinary copper excretion was obtained more frequently in neurological than hepatic patients (<100 ug/24 hours at the end of follow-up in 5/5 neurological-only patients, 2/5 patients with combined presentation but only 1/2). 7 pts with exclusive hepatic presentation). Urinary copper excretion in 24 hours (mean+/-SEM) in neurological vs exclusively hepatic patients was 494+/-167 vs 1149+/-798 (median 390 vs 405) at baseline, 157+/-29 vs 256+/ -46 after 1 year and 100+/-25 vs 225+/- 37 mg/24 hrs (P<0.01) at the end of follow-up. Conclusions: The result of exclusive zinc therapy is generally satisfactory in cases of neurological disease. Although even decompensated cirrhosis may improve markedly with this treatment modality, liver disease may also worsen, possibly related to less efficient copper clearance in liver patients.",,"Linn, F.;Houwen, R.;Van Hattum, J.;Van Erpecum, K.

1910,Role of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and copper in cancer: effect on the COX-2 pathway,"Background and objective: Copper is a trace element that has been linked to cancer for several years; however, its exact role in cancer remains controversial. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a drug that was developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease and is currently being studied as it appears to have a significant effect on cancer. So far, due to clinical studies and animal models, TM is known to downregulate VEGF, IL-1alpha, and IL-8, but few in vitro studies have been conducted to try to clarify its effects and mechanisms of action. In this study, we determined the effects of TM and copper on the known cancer-related cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway. Methods: The gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN45 and the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma TTn; which correspond to two of the main causes of death from cancer in the world, were used in this study. These cells were treated with TM and copper, evaluating their viability and chemosensitivity with the non-radioactive MTS/PMS method. COX-2 mRNA expression was assessed by real-time RT and PCR and protein expression was assessed by Western Blot. PGE2 was evaluated by ELISA. Results and discussion: Increasing copper concentrations reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, which translates into stress and ultimately toxicity to cells. At the same time, there was an increase in the COX-2 pathway as determined by an increase in COX-2 mRNA (up to 4.5-fold) and protein (up to 2.5-fold), followed by an increase in PGE<inf>2</inf>. For the first time, we show that high concentrations of TM do not cause toxicity in cell lines other than breast cancer. In addition, TM importantly regulated the COX-2 pathway in TTn. Despite the opposite effects of copper and TM on COX-2, treatment with both showed greater regulation of COX-2 than that caused by copper alone. Conclusions: Excess copper could have a role (in addition to its need for angiogenesis) in cancer, as it induces stress, toxicity and upregulates the COX-2 pathway. Here we describe that TM is not toxic In Vitro, as previously described In Vivo. TM is able to downregulate the COX-2 pathway under standard cell culture conditions; however, TM was unable to decrease the upregulation of COX-2 caused by excess copper. This leads us to believe that a) TM might be useful in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal cancers, b) TM appears to have a different biochemical mechanism than simple copper chelation, and c) this mechanism is probably inhibited by excess copper. that binds to the TM, making it unavailable and biologically inactive.",,"Sanchez-Siles, A.

1911,Comparative study of the copper/zinc ratio in morning urine and 24-h urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children,"Background and objectives: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, accurate and timed collection presents practical difficulties. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic value of the copper to zinc ratio (copper/zinc) in the morning urine and the 24-hour urine copper excretion in children with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: From July 2005 to June 2007, morning urine and 24-hour urine were collected from 96 patients hospitalized for investigation of liver disease in a tertiary pediatric hospital. Each patient was reassessed according to the WD scoring system and assigned to one of three groups, WD, suspected WD, and non-WD. Thus, 24, 6, and 64 cases were assigned to each group, respectively. The concentration of copper and zinc in urine was determined simultaneously by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: The copper/zinc ratio in morning urine and 24-hour urine copper excretion correlated well (r=0.758, P<0.001). The copper/zinc ratio in morning urine was significantly higher in the WD group than in the non-WD group (median 0.370 vs. 0.051, Z-value -6.502, P = 0.000), as was copper excretion at 24 hours. hours (median 87.1). vs 24.2, Z value -6.208, P= 0.000).

1912,Comparison of urinary copper/zinc ratio with 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children: a prospective study,"Background: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD), accurate and timed collection presents practical difficulties. In a preliminary study, we found that the morning urinary copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) ratio appears to be a promising surrogate parameter. This study aims to compare its diagnostic value with 24-hour urine copper excretion for WD in children with hepatic manifestations. Methods: From July 2005 to June 2007, 24-hour urine samples and morning urine samples were collected from consecutive liver patients older than three years admitted to our unit. Each patient was scored by the WD scoring system that includes clinical data and routine laboratory results by two pediatricians independently. The ATP7B gene was sequenced in patients who had acute liver failure or a WD score between 2 and 3, and therefore each child was assigned to the WD or non-WD group. The concentration of copper and zinc was determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry by a technician with no knowledge of clinical diagnosis. SPSS was used for data analysis. Results: 94 patients were included, including 26 WD cases and 68 non-WD cases, of whom both morning urine sample and 24-hour urine sample were collected correctly. 14 of them were grouped by combining the clinical data and the genetic study. Morning urinary Cu/Zn ratio and 24-h urinary copper excretion correlated well (r = 0.758, P = 0.000). The Cu/Zn ratio in morning urine was significantly higher in the WD group (median 0.37, range 0.07-12.74) than in the non-WD group (median 0.05, range 0.01- 1.23, Z=-6.502, P=0.000); so were the Cu/Zn ratio at 24 hours (WD group, median 0.39, range 0.04-10.7; non-WD group, median 0.06, range 0.00-0.45; Z= -6.020, P=0.000) and urinary copper excretion at 24 hours (WD group, median 87.1ug, range 18.3-1180.5ug; non-WD group, median 24.2ug, range 1.4-357.9ug; Z=-6.208, P=0.000). There was no significant difference in 24-hour zinc excretion between two groups (WD group, median 399 ug, range 17-1641 ug; non-WD group, median 359 ug, range 6.4-7287 ug; Z = -2.100, P = 0.834). The area under the ROC curve was comparable between morning urine Cu/Zn ratio, 24h urine Cu/Zn ratio, and 24h copper excretion, with a median and 95% CI of 0.953 (0.909-0.998), 0.977 (0.834-0.897), and 0.934 (0.867-1,000), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Cu/Zn ratio in morning urine were 90.9%, 79.7%, 62.9%, and 96.2% with a value cutoff of 0.1, and 81.8%, 95.3%, 87% and 93.8%. by a cutoff of 0.2 respectively.

1914,Reassessment of Diagnostic Criteria for Wilson's Disease in a Cohort of Predominantly Asymptomatic Children,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a challenging diagnosis, especially in children. Rapid diagnosis is necessary to prevent disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To reassess conventional diagnostic criteria and the Ferenci diagnostic score [1] in children with WD. Patients and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 43 children with WD (28 children, median age 6.1 years, range 1.1-20.9) and 58 with liver disease other than WD (36 children, median age 7, 1 years, range 2-16). Among the children with WD, 35 (81%) were asymptomatic (30 with isolated hypertransaminasemia, 5 detected by familial screening). Cupruria was assessed before (baseline cupruria [BCu]) and after (penicillamine cupruria challenge [PCTCu]) penicillamine 500 mg orally every 12 hours x 2. Results: Ceruloplasmin, BCu, and PCTCu differed significantly between WD and controls (P<0.0001, P<0.0001 and P<0.03, respectively). ROC analysis for ceruloplasmin at the cutoff of <= 20 mg/dL showed a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.5-99.4%) and a specificity of 84.4% (95% CI, 72.5-92.6%). With a cut-off point <=10 mg/dL, the sensitivity and specificity were 65.9% (95% CI, 50-79.5%) and 96.5% (95% CI, 88-99, 6%), respectively. A BCu threshold of >=100 Âµg/24h showed a sensitivity of 65.8% (95% CI, 49.4-79.9%) and a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI, 90.7-79.9%). 99.9%), while a sensitivity >=40 mug/24h was 78% (95% CI, 62.4-89.4%) and the specificity was 87.9% (95% CI, 76.7 -95%). The ROC area for PCTCu was not significant (AUC 0.63, P = 0.051), and in our cohort this test showed a sensitivity of only 15.4% (95% CI, 4.3-34.8%) and a specificity of 94.8% (95% CI, 85.6-98.9%). Finally, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Ferenci score [1]: at the proposed score of >=4, the sensitivity was 96.7% (95% CI, 83.3-99.9%) and the specificity of the 93.3% (95% CI, 77.9-99.1%), with an ROC area of 0.95, P<0.0001. Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of ceruloplasmin and BCu, considered as single tests, is high in a cohort of predominantly asymptomatic children with WD. We have observed optimal sensitivity and specificity for BCu with a cut-off value of >=40 mug/24h as recommended by recent guidelines. In contrast, we do not recommend routinely measuring PCTCu in asymptomatic children due to its low sensitivity.

He presented a decrease in Hb values (up to 5.4 g/dL), bilirubin values of 10.2 mg/dl (direct 2.9 mg/dl), thrombocytopenia (125,000/mm<sup>3</sup> ), increased INR 1.64 (0.7 -1.1), decreased ATIII, AST/ALT 92/38 U/L, albumin 2.5 g/dL. Direct and indirect Coombs' tests were negative, and fragmented red blood cells were found on the peripheral blood smear. She was treated with transfusions. On admission to our Institute, the girl had moderate hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was confirmed: coagulation screening revealed a PT ratio of 1.63 (0.84-1.16) and a PTT ratio of 1.44 (0.80-1.21), as well as a decrease in coagulation factors (II, V, VII, X) and antithrombin compatible with liver disease. Infectious diseases were excluded and autoimmunity tests were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed increased liver volume with non-homogeneous echostructure. Cupraemia was 107 Âµg/dL (85-165), ceruloplasmin was 9.2 mg% (18-70), and the Kayser-Fleischer ring was present at 360Â°. Suspicion of WD was confirmed using the Ferenci diagnostic scoring system [1], which with a score of 5 suggested WD as highly probable. No liver biopsy was performed due to coagulation values. The patient received treatment with zinc acetate (25 mg 3 times a day). Follow-up after 11 months showed improvement in clinical and laboratory data (PT 80%; PTT 34 s (23-38), INR 1.16, ATIII 94.4% (80-120). Analysis planned for the mutation in ATP7B Most of the experience in Wilson Treatment of the disease in symptomatic patients is based on the use of chelating drugs In contrast, a gaining ground holds that the pathogenesis of Wilson's disease is related to free copper in plasma, rather than to the accumulation of the element in body tissues.Thus, the goal of treatment is to normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood.Zinc, by inducing the production of metallothionein which is selectively binds copper in the cells of the intestinal mucosa, preventing copper absorption. The therapy traditionally used is based on zinc sulfate, zinc acetate has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. In our patient the choice of therapy zinc acetate as initial treatment has so far achieved good results.

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of treatment with zinc versus d-penicillamine in a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease and hepatic presentation. Material and Methods: We analyzed 27 children with Wilson's disease before and after one year of treatment (14 pts aged 11.7+/-3.3 years receiving zinc and 13 pts aged 13.4+/-3.2 years receiving d-penicillamine) in whom the therapy was not changed during the observation period. Wilson's disease was diagnosed according to Ferenci et al. mutation analysis scoring and examination system. Patients with acute and fulminant liver failure were excluded from this study. Results: Before treatment, ALT levels were slightly lower in zinc patients than in penicillamine patients (114+/-105 IU/L vs. 197+/-120 IU/L, mean +/-SD). . We found no difference at baseline in AST, INR, and GGTP between groups. After one year of treatment there was no difference in ALT levels between the zinc and penicillamine groups (respectively 56+/-22 IU/L and 50+/-18 IU/L), however, the drop in ALT level of ALT was significant (p<0.05). ) in penicillamine patients but not in zinc patients. AST activity decreased significantly in both groups. Conclusions: Penicillamine induces a greater fall in ALT level than zinc therapy and, therefore, could be more effective in children with Wilson's disease and hepatic presentation.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Schmidt, H.;Houwen, R.;Socha, P.",2009,June,,0,1,
1917,Problems of diagnosis and management in myeloneuropathy associated with copper deficiency,"Background: Copper deficiency is a rare but poorly recognized cause of myelopolyneuropathy. We present a case with coexisting B<inf>12</inf> deficiency and discuss challenges in diagnosis and management Case report: A 59-year-old man presented with a 14-month history of progressive sensory ataxia and spastic paraparesis. . Initial blood tests showed low levels of B<inf>12</inf>/folate. The ataxia progressed despite monthly intramuscular replacement therapy. Further investigations confirmed hypocupremia and low ceruloplasmin with normal serum zinc. Brain MRI showed only minor ischemia. MRI of the spine was normal. Neurophysiology showed a sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Imaging, normal noninvasive liver studies, normal 24-hour urine copper, and absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings ruled out Wilson's disease. Treatment with oral copper picolinate did not produce significant clinical changes. The cause of copper deficiency remains unexplained. Discussion: The largest series (13 patients) on this topic describes typical clinical features and in these cases copper replacement stopped clinical deterioration. It is important to exclude Wilson's disease, which can manifest similar serum copper measurements. Supplementation should be administered with a preparation that does not contain zinc, since zinc hinders the absorption of copper. Copper deficiency should be considered in patients with myeloneuropathy, even in the presence of low B<inf>12</inf>. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent neurological deterioration.",,"Chowdhury, F. A.;Sherwood, R.;Moran, N.;Dhawan, A.;Samuel, M.",2009,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2008.167387,0,0,
1918,Obesity and Wilson's disease in childhood and adolescence,"Background and objective: Obesity during childhood and adolescence often leads to elevated levels of transferases and hepatic steatosis, and is believed to be associated with elevated levels of acute-phase proteins. However, steatosis is also found in a variety of metabolic diseases during childhood, including Wilson's disease. An algorithm for a detailed differential diagnosis would be valuable. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data from 291 obese children and adolescents (body mass index above the 97th percentile) who attended outpatient liver or obesity clinics during the last 6 years (2003-2008) was performed. Standard anthropometric and laboratory parameters, virology, haptoglobin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and serum ceruloplasmin were analyzed. Penicillamine challenge tests were performed in 22 patients and 14 liver biopsies in patients with elevated transferases despite a weight reduction trial (with the exception of emergency cases). Genetic analysis and slit lamp examination were performed. Results: 41 (14.08%) patients had elevated transferases. The average value of ceruloplasmin (normal range 0.220-0.605 g/L) was 0.263 g/L (0.139 - 0.388 g/L); 9/41 (22%) subjects had values below the reference range. 22 patients had a penicillamine challenge test, with mean values of 19mug, 698mug, 802mug, and 819mug on days 1-4. 13 children had values in the intermediate range of 800-1590 mg, 2 tests had values above 1590 mg. Liver histology showed steatosis in 8, steatohepatitis in 1, fibrous changes in 4, and cirrhosis in 2 patients, respectively. We discovered 2 cases of Wilson's disease in this group following a multistep approach. In addition, 3 other asymptomatic homozygous relatives with Wilson's disease and 4 heterozygous carriers were discovered. Realizing the problems in diagnosing Wilson's disease, we present an algorithm to screen for the disease systematically in obese children with elevated liver enzymes. Unlike the current pediatric literature, we cannot confirm the observation of elevated acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin) in obese children and adolescents. Conclusions: Currently, there are insufficient data to predict the incidence of Wilson's disease in obese children with liver disease. Our data suggest a higher incidence than currently estimated. All children or adolescents with liver disease should be investigated intensively for Wilson's disease. Early diagnosis should aim to provide early therapy before the development of irreversible organ damage.",,"Spindelbock, W.;Spindelboeck, W.;Deutschmann, A.;Lackner, K.;Weitzer, C.;Erwa, W.;Hauer, A.;Ferenci, P.;Deutsch, J.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1919,Evaluation of the efficacy of treatment with D-penicillamine in children with Wilson's disease,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of prolonged therapy with D-penicillamine in children with Wilson's disease. Methods: Fifty-three children with Wilson's disease aged 6 to 17 years (mean age 12 years) were examined. Boys 25 (47%), girls 28 (53%). The hepatic form of the disease was diagnosed in 41 (77%) children, the mixed form in 12 (27%) children. All children received treatment with D-penicillamine, the mean dose was 17.87 mg/kg/day. We evaluated changes in liver size, serum transaminase (ALT, AST) level, and urinary copper excretion during prolonged course of D-penicillamine (cuprenyl) therapy. Results: Before the start of treatment in 21 (39.6%) children liver size increased (0.5-2 cm from the costal arch), including 3 (14%) children with mixed form of Wilson's disease. During treatment, liver size shrank in all children, in 15 (28%) children liver size normalized. The mean serum ALT level before the start of therapy was 112.8 IU/L (normal 5-40), in 6 months of therapy 44 IU/L, during the following 5 years it ranged from minimum (23.7 IU/L) to maximum (76.6 IU/L), the mean level was 44.8 IU/L. The mean serum level of AST before the start of therapy was 79.74 IU/L (normal 5-42), at 6 months 42.14 IU/L, at 5 years 31 IU/L. Urinary copper excretion before the start of therapy was 286 ug/day (normal 50 ug/day), in the D-penicillamine loading test 1961 mg/day (normal 600-800). In 6 months of therapy this level was 971.5 ug/day, in 1 year 965 ug/day, in 2 years 685.4 mg/day, in 5 years 524 ug/day. Thus, in one year, the mean level of urinary copper excretion decreased to the upper limit of the norm, and after that, during an observation period of 5 years, it was not higher than 700 ug/day. Conclusions: In all children during therapy with D-penicillamine (cuprenil) positive changes were recorded: the size of the liver was reduced; the level of serum transaminases and the urinary excretion of copper were reduced.",,"Zubovich, A.;Strokova, T.;Kaganov, B.;Pavlovskaya, E.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1920,EuroWilson: The first prospective study of Wilson's disease in Europe,"Objectives and methods: to establish a European database of Wilson's disease and to assess the feasibility of pediatric clinical trials. Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2005, and November 30, 2008, were enrolled using a secure web-based protocol. A previously validated score was used to verify diagnoses. Results: 353 cases (176 women) from 0.25 to 56.1 years (mean 20.4, median 17.6) years from 321 families were admitted. The apparent incidence (as cases/million population/35 months) was higher in central Europe (eg, Poland 2.78, Austria 2.53) than in the west (eg, France 0.56, United Kingdom 0.48, Spain 0.32). Patients homozygous for the common H1069Q mutation were older (27.8+/-12.2 years, n = 65) than the others (19.3+/-12.5 years). Patients younger than 18 years (N = 181, women = 88) had a more homogeneous geographic distribution. Country-by-country variations in the percentage of pediatric cases likely demonstrate variable determination of adult cases, eg Poland 18%, UK 86%. 2 non-EU countries, Turkey and India, contributed 27 and 16 pediatric cases, respectively. The mean (median) BMI SDS in 81 cases whose height was measured was 1.8 (2.06). The median diagnostic score was 6 (range 4-10); KFrings was present at 50; ceruloplasmin was measured in 172 and was >0.18 g/L in 34; urine copper was measured in 161, and challenge with penicillamine was performed in 66; 105 had a liver biopsy, but only 78 had a liver copper test, of which 11 had a result <250 Âµg/g; Two mutations were identified in 82, of which 26 were homozygous (9 for H1069Q). The severity of liver disease varied: 5% had hepatic encephalopathy, 32% had severe and 18% mild liver disease, 38% had abnormal LFTs only, and only 7% had no liver abnormalities. Neurological abnormalities were present in 21% and severe in 5%, with no correlation with the severity of liver disease. There was a wide variety of initial treatments and doses. Conclusions: This first prospective study of WD demonstrates: (1) the highest incidence in Eastern Europe; (2) diagnosis remains difficult due to lack of sensitivity in each diagnostic parameter and selective use of tests, but is aided by a scoring system; (3) relatively high BMI SDS at diagnosis; (4) wide phenotypic and genotypic variation; (5) in patients <18 years of age, hepatic failure is rare, but 93% of cases show some hepatic abnormality and 21% have some neurological abnormality; (6) The inclusion of cases from non-EU countries will be necessary to set up pediatric RCTs.",,"Tanner, S.;Dhawan, A.;Socha, P.;Loudianos, G.;Lszl, S.;Parker, S.;Vegnente, A.;Houwen, R.;Sarles, J.;Deutsch, J.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1921,Successful treatment of fulminant Wilson's disease by plasmapheresis,"Background: Treatment of fulminant Wilson's disease still carries a high mortality without liver transplantation. There is no acceptable treatment other than liver transplantation. Few case reports have successfully treated fulminant Wilson's disease with plasmapheresis. Clinical Case: We present the case of a 14-year-old boy who came to our hospital with fulminant Wilson's disease, including low AST and AlT and alkaline phosphatase, high bilirubin 38 mg/dl, INR 3.1, creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, Encephalopathy grade. hepatic II, mild ascites, positive Kayser Fleischer ring, low ceruloplasmin, high serum copper and hematological picture compatible with hemolysis. He was treated with 5 sessions of plasmapheresis with improvised synthetic function, in addition to conservative treatment, and at the end of the last plasmapheresis session he was removed from the liver transplant list and treatment for Wilson's disease was started. He improved markedly over the past year and became asymptomatic with near normal synthetic function. Now it's just D-Penicillamine and Zinc. Conclusion: Successful treatment of WD using plasmapheresis and other supportive measures has been described. This case another example. This could be due to removal of excess copper as the crucial offending agent rather than removal of other agents, as this treatment is unsuccessful in other FHF aetiologies.",,"Jarrad, A.;Hammoudi, S.;Saed, R.;Obed, A.;Al Bashir, A.",2009,July,,0,0,
1922,"Wilson's disease in children; A six-year experience, 2001-2008","Objectives: To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children with Wilson's disease presenting to the Hospital for Sick Children, a large tertiary care pediatric center. Methods: Patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease between 2001 and 2008 were identified from clinical databases and a retrospective chart review was performed. Results: Eleven patients were identified, with a mean age of presentation of 12 years (range 7-17 years). Nine of 11 patients had a hepatic presentation that included jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, pale stools, or hematemesis. Of these patients, three had overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from encephalopathy to paresthesias. Five of the nine patients with hepatic decompensation also had negative Coombs hemolytic anemia. Eighteen percent (2/11) had isolated neurological complaints (developmental delay and ataxia in one, paresthesia in the other). These children presented at a younger age (mean 7 years) compared to the 12-year group mean. Five of 11 children (45%) had Kaiser Fleischer rings. Only one case had a positive family history of Wilson's disease; this family had a history of consanguinity. Through family evaluation, two separate children were identified as asymptomatic carriers. At presentation, the mean (range) laboratory values were as follows: ceruloplasmin 115 mg/L (27 - 253 mg/L), 24-hour urinary copper excretion 13.7 umol (0.290-60.5), INR 1.9 (0.9-4.3), total bilirubin 85 (4-361), albumin 29 (23-48), AST 238 (44-1083), alkaline phosphatase 251 (20-824), WBC 10 .7 (3.7-25.2), hemoglobin 101 g/l (54-134) and platelets 205 (88-460). The new Wilson disease severity index was calculated for each patient and ranged from 3 to 16 (on a possible scale of 0 to 20). Among the three patients who scored 11 or higher and were therefore predicted to need a liver transplant, one recovered with medical treatment. The children were treated with a combination of chelating agents including penicillamine, trientine, and/or zinc. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at a mean of 2.5 years (range 0.14-5.8) after diagnosis. None of the children died. Three patients underwent liver transplantation (two shortly after diagnosis and one patient five years later). A recently diagnosed patient is currently awaiting a transplant. Two patients developed neuropsychiatric symptoms despite chelation treatment. Conclusions: Children with Wilson's disease show a variety of clinical presentations, have a high probability of response to chelation therapy, and occasionally require liver transplantation. The new Wilson's disease index should be used with caution because it does not reliably indicate the need for transplantation.",,"Avinashi, V.;Ling, S.",2009,,,0,1,
1923,Prospective look at the use of triene in Wilson's disease: a safer alternative,"We report the progress of 5 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease ranging in age from 13 to 30 years, 3 women and 2 men who developed multiple side effects upon initiation of penicillamine therapy, including thrombocytopenia (3 patients), allergic skin reactions (3 patients), worsening of neuropsychiatric features (1 patient) and dystonic state (1 patient). These side effects developed within a month to 6 months after starting penicillamine. Discontinuation of penicillamine therapy and initiation of Trientene therapy resulted in improvement of neuropsychiatric features and improvement of features of the dystonic state, as well as resolution of thrombocytopenia. We would like to propose that patients with Wilson's disease, once started on penicillamine therapy, be followed closely for these side effects and suggest that possibly triene would be a safer alternative to penicillamine therapy in a subgroup of patients. with Wilson's disease and possibly even better as initial therapy.",,"Viswanathan, S.;Puvanarajah, S.

1924,"Clinical presentation, diagnosis and long-term evolution of 35 patients with Wilson's disease","Purpose: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. Subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues results in clinical manifestations of hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other disorders. We describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and follow-up of a cohort of 35 patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: We reviewed the medical records and brain images of 35 patients with Wilson's disease, followed up at the National Institute of Neurology in Tunisia. The diagnosis of the disease was based on the presence of abnormal biochemical tests: elevated urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin, and serum copper levels. Results: The median age of onset was 18.9 years (range 4 to 56 years). The observation time was up to 7.5 years. The most common presenting symptoms were tremor (42.8%), dysarthria (22.8%), and behavioral disturbances (17.1%). A Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 45.7%. Brain imaging was abnormal in 62.5% of patients. Brain atrophy with signal abnormalities in cerebral gray matter was observed in 25%. One patient had severe subcortical white matter abnormalities that are unusual features in Wilson's disease. The clinical symptoms of the patients remained stable with D-penicillamine or improved during the observation period in 65.7% of cases, while 6 patients out of 35 worsened. Conclusion: The diagnosis of Wilson's disease can be difficult in the absence of typical symptoms and in asymptomatic siblings. D-penicillamine is a safe and effective long-term treatment in patients with Wilson's disease. If treatment is started early enough, a normal quality of life can be expected.",,"Ellini, S.;Ammar, N.;Larnaout, A.;Hentati, F.;Zouari, M.",2009,October,,0,0,
1925,Essential tremor? Wilson's disease?,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that is associated with degenerative changes in the basal ganglia. The Wilson disease gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 and encodes a copper transporting P-type ATPase that is expressed in liver and kidney. Clinical symptoms are complex with neurological symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders, etc., predominant liver disease or mixed forms. Neurological abnormalities are present in 40-50% of patients, and resting or postural tremor is the first clinical sign in half of them. Case report: I had tremor in my hands for ten years and had used mysoline and propranolol for the tremor which were not effective. He had a family history of essential tremor in his father and uncle. His physical examination was normal except for postural tremor. His mental status and school performance were normal. Although there was no family history of Wilson's disease, the plasma ceruloplasmin level was low (16 mg/dl), the urine copper in the 24-hour urine collection was high (62 micrograms). Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral hyperintense lesions in the globus pallidus and putamen on T2-weighted images. He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and started therapy with penicillamine, zinc, vitamin B, and a low-copper diet. Conclusion: Wilson's disease should always be considered in all childhood movement disorders, even if there are long-term quiet neurological signs and no liver involvement.",,"Gokben, S.;Arikan, C.;Serdaroglu, G.;Yilmaz, S.;Tekgul, H.;Aydogdu, S.",2009,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1090-3798%2809%2970357-5,0,0,
1926,"Liver cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia and hypermanganesemia: a new metabolic disorder","We present a new constellation of clinical features consisting of hypermanganesemia, liver cirrhosis, an extrapyramidal motor disorder, and polycythemia in a 12-year-old girl born to consanguineous parents. Blood manganese levels were >3000 nmol/L (normal range <320 nmol/L), and MRI revealed basal ganglia signal abnormalities consistent with manganese deposition. An older brother with the same phenotype died at 18 years of age, suggesting a life-threatening autosomal recessive disease. This disorder is probably due to a defect in manganese metabolism with accumulation of manganese in the liver and basal ganglia similar to the accumulation of copper in Wilson's disease. In order to assess the genetic basis of this syndrome, we investigated two candidate genes: ATP2C2 and ATP2A3 encoding the manganese-transporting calcium ATPases, SPCA2 and SERCA3, respectively. Patient and family genotyping for microsatellite markers surrounding ATP2C2 and ATP2A3 excluded these genes. The patient was found to be heterozygous for both gene loci. Despite the unknown pathophysiology, we were able to develop a successful treatment regimen. Calcium disodium edetate chelation therapy combined with iron supplementation is the treatment of choice, as it significantly reduces blood manganese levels and improves clinical symptoms.

1927,Tetrathiomolybdate protects against cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a potent copper chelating drug, was initially developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Our working hypothesis is that the fibrotic pathway depends on copper. Because biliary excretion is the main pathway for copper elimination, a mouse model of bile duct ligation (BDL) was used to test the possible protective effects of MT. TM was administered at a daily dose of 0.9 mg/mouse by intragastric gavage 5 days prior to BDL. All animals were sacrificed 5 days after surgery. Plasma liver enzymes and total bilirubin were markedly reduced in TM-treated BDL mice. TM also inhibited the increase in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 observed in BDL mice. Cholestatic liver damage was markedly attenuated by TM treatment as shown by histology. Hepatic collagen deposition was significantly decreased, and was paralleled by a significant suppression of hepatic smooth muscle alpha-actin and fibrogenic gene expression in TM-treated BDL mice. Although endogenous antioxidant capacity was improved, oxidative stress, as shown by malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals, hepatic glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, was not attenuated by MT treatment, suggesting that the protective mechanism of MT may be independent of oxidative stress. In summary, TM attenuated BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis in mice, in part by inhibiting TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 secretion. The protective mechanism appears to be independent of oxidative stress. Our data provide additional evidence that TM could be a potential therapy for liver fibrosis.",,"Song, M.;Song, Z.;Barve, S.;Zhang, J.;Chen, T.;Liu, M.;Arteel, G. E.;Brewer, G. J.;McClain, C.

1928,"Wilson protein expression, copper excretion, and sweat production in sweat glands of patients and controls with Wilson disease","Background: In Wilson's disease, copper is insufficiently excreted into the bile due to the absence or malfunction of the Wilson protein copper ATPase in the hepatocyte excretory pathway. Copper is found in sweat. Whether Wilson's protein plays a role in sweat copper excretion is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate Wilson protein expression in sweat glands and to analyze its effects on sweat copper excretion in controls and patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: Immunofluorescent analysis of Wilson protein was performed on skin samples from normal rat, rat LEC, and human skin biopsies. Pilocarpine-induced sweat gland stimulation by iontophoretic transfer adapted from the methods used for the cystic fibrosis sweat test was used for sweat induction. Sweat volume, sweat copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin, and serum copper were analyzed in 28 Wilson patients and 21 controls. Results: Wilson's protein is expressed in the epithelium of human and rat sweat glands. Sweat copper concentration is not significantly different between controls and Wilson's patients. Wilson's patients produce significantly smaller sweat volumes compared to controls. Sweat production is partially reversible in Wilson's patients under medical treatment for Wilson's disease or after liver transplantation. Conclusion: Wilson's patients show reduced sweat production with unchanged sweat copper concentration. Wilson's protein could play an important role in the physiological production of sweat.

We propose that measurement of the proton spin lattice relaxation rate constants of water before and after chelation can be used as an alternative approach to monitor the presence of free copper ions in blood serum. This method can be used in the diagnosis of some diseases (leukemia, liver diseases and, in particular, Wilson's disease) because, unlike conventional methods such as spectrophotometry, which records the total number of free and bound ions, the proton relaxation technique is sensitive only to free paramagnetic ions dissolved in blood serum.

1932,Effect of D-penicillamine on hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of the ATP7B protein and reduced excretion of copper into the bile in hepatocytes. Excessive accumulation of copper leads to liver injury. D-penicillamine can mainly inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the occurrence of cicatricial lesions in the liver. We study this phenomenon in our patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathology slides of explanted livers from 26 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease with hepatoneurological manifestations between 2000 and 2008 who had undergone liver transplantation were retrospectively investigated. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their history of D-penicillamine use prior to transplantation. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation was classified as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3), and was reviewed by an impartial hepatopathologist. RESULTS: Of 26 patients (20 men, 6 women) who had Wilson's disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years, 69% (18/26) had a history of D-penicillamine use before liver transplant from 6 months to 9 years (mean, 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis were observed in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18), grade 2 in 44% (8/18), and grade 1 in 11% of patients (2/18) . In the group without D-penicillamine (8 patients), the degrees of fibrosis were grade 3 (62%), grade 2 (25%), and grade 1 (12%); 87% of the patients had grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The grade of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than in the no D-penicillamine group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine can reduce the rate of hepatic fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Kazemi, K.;Geramizadeh, B.;Nikeghbalian, S.;Salahi, H.;Bahador, A.;Reza Nejatollahi, S.

1933,Liver disease in pregnancy,"Abnormal liver tests occur in 3% to 5% of pregnancies, with many potential causes, including coincident liver disease (most commonly viral hepatitis or gallstones) and underlying chronic liver disease. However, most liver dysfunction in pregnancy is pregnancy-related and caused by 1 of 5 liver diseases unique to pregnancy: these fall into 2 main categories based on their association with or without pre-eclampsia. Liver diseases associated with preeclampsia include preeclampsia itself, hemolysis (H), elevated liver tests (EL) and low platelet count (LP) syndrome (HELLP), and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are unrelated to preeclampsia. Although still enigmatic, there have been exciting recent advances in understanding these unique pregnancy-related liver diseases. Hyperemesis gravidarum is intractable vomiting that dehydrates in the first trimester of pregnancy; 50% of patients with this condition have liver dysfunction. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy consists of itching and elevated bile acids in the second half of pregnancy, accompanied by elevated aminotransferase levels and mild jaundice. Maternal management is symptomatic with ursodeoxycholic acid; for the fetus, however, this is a high-risk pregnancy that requires close fetal surveillance and early delivery. Severe preeclampsia itself is the most common cause of liver tenderness and liver dysfunction in pregnancy, with 2% to 12% of cases further complicated by hemolysis (H), elevated liver tests (EL), and low platelet count (LP) - the HELLP syndrome. Immediate delivery is the only definitive treatment, but many maternal complications can occur, such as placental abruption, renal failure, subcapsular hematomas, and hepatic rupture. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a sudden catastrophic illness that occurs almost exclusively in the third trimester; microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes causes acute liver failure with coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis and immediate delivery are essential for maternal and fetal survival. Copyright Â© 2007 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"Hay, J.

1934,Hepatic ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion induce and transport the multispecific metal transporter Atp7b to the canaliculi of the bile ducts: possible preferential transport of iron to bile,"Both Atp7b (Wilson's disease gene) and Atp7a (Menkes' disease gene) have been reported to be trafficked by copper. Atp7b is transported to the canaliculi of the bile duct and Atp7a to the plasma membrane. Whether or not hepatic ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion modulates Atp7b expression and trafficking has not been reported. In this study, we report for the first time that the multispecific metal transporter Atp7b is significantly induced and transported by both hepatic ischemia alone and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion, as judged by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Although hepatocytes also stained for Atp7b, intense localized Atp7b staining was found in the canaliculi of the bile ducts. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of biliary copper, iron, zinc, and manganese found a corresponding significant increase in biliary iron. In our attempt to determine whether the observed increased biliary iron transport may be the result of impaired bile flow, lysosomal trafficking, or biliary glutathione transport, we measured bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione content. . No significant differences were found in bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione between control and ischemia-reperfusion livers. Therefore, we conclude that hepatic ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion induction and Atp7b trafficking to bile duct canaliculi may contribute to preferential transport of iron into bile.

1937,atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice as a model for studies of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a serious human disorder of copper homeostasis. The disease is associated with several mutations in the ATP7B gene encoding a copper transporting ATPase and a massive accumulation of copper in the liver and several other tissues. The most frequent manifestations of the disease include a wide spectrum of liver pathologies, as well as neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. A combination of copper chelators and zinc therapy has been used to prevent disease progression; however, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease remains a challenge. Similarly, side effects of treatments are common. To better understand the biochemical and cellular basis of Wilson's disease, several animal models have been developed. This review focuses on genetically modified Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice and describes the properties of these knockout animals, insights into disease progression generated using Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice , as well as advantages and limitations of Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice as an experimental model for Wilson's disease.

She was diagnosed with EbetaT at 2 years of age, but the coexistence of WD could only be established at 11 years of age. The diagnosis of the latter was based on the clinical presentation of hepatitis and severe Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia, along with laboratory evidence of WD. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the concurrence of EbetaT and WD. As both conditions are associated with varying degrees of hemolysis, WD in the context of EbetaT may remain masked and consequently remain undiagnosed for a long time. Severe and sudden hemolysis in a patient with thalassemia can be explained by the coexistence of additional pathology, in this case WD.

Similarly, it can regulate changes in iron, copper, and zinc concentrations during lactation. For iron, this regulation is achieved by the transferrin receptor, DMT1, and ferroportin, while mammary gland copper metabolism is regulated by Ctr1, ATP7A, and ATP7B. Zinc homeostasis is complex and involves both zinc importers (Zip3) and zinc exporters (ZnT-1, ZnT-2, and ZnT-4). Both transcriptional and post-translational regulation can affect the protein abundance and cellular localization of these transporters, finely orchestrating the uptake, intracellular trafficking, and secretion of iron, copper, and zinc. Control of the mammary gland absorption and secretion of iron, copper, and zinc in milk protects both the mammary gland and the infant against deficiency and excess of these nutrients.

1944,Mild zinc deficiency and dietary phytic acid accelerate the development of fulminant hepatitis in LEC rats.,"Background and objective: Restriction of copper intake delays hepatic accumulation of copper in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, which are animal models of Wilson's disease. The involvement of zinc in developing hepatitis in the disease is suggested; however, this has not been clarified. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of mild zinc deficiency on the development of hepatitis and to determine the relationship between absorption and hepatic levels of copper, zinc, and iron. Methods: Male LEC and F344 (atp7b wild-type) rats were fed a low-zinc, phytate-containing or control diet. The occurrence of hepatitis (Experiment 1), and the absorption rates of copper, zinc and iron and the indices of hepatitis at 4 weeks (Experiment 2) were observed. Results: The onset of fulminant hepatitis in LEC rats was much earlier in the low zinc and phytate groups (mean 94.6 +/- 2.74 days and 82.8 +/- 3.56 days, respectively) than in the low zinc and low phytate groups, respectively. the control group (136 +/- 2.11 days). days) with worse rates of hepatitis. Hepatic copper levels were much higher in LEC rats than in F344 rats, but were not significantly different between diet groups without significant changes in copper absorption. Liver levels and intestinal absorption of zinc and iron were lower in the phytate group than in the control group. Conclusion: Mild zinc deficiencies caused by a low zinc or phytate diet accelerate the onset of hepatitis in LEC rats without increasing copper absorption, and zinc and iron metabolism may be involved in the earlier onset of jaundice in LEC rats.

ATP7B genotyping and brain magnetic resonance imaging with proton spectroscopy were also performed. The patient became asymptomatic two years after starting penicillamine treatment and remained controlled asymptomatic during the eight years of follow-up, without any specific treatment for BAD.

1949,hereditary metabolic liver disease,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Elucidation of copper and iron metabolic pathways has improved our understanding of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis. Some inherited liver diseases are now characterized by protein folding mutations, including Gaucher disease, cystic fibrosis, and ZZ alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. Studies are now focusing on associations between glycogen storage disease, hepatic adenoma formation, and transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma. The subject of this review is the continuing progress in the study of diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of inherited liver diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: An increased understanding of iron and copper metabolic pathways has led to the search for factors that modify the phenotypic expression of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis. Hepcidin plays a key role in modulating iron absorption in iron overload disorders, and new studies clarify hepcidin regulation. For glycogen storage diseases, studies of natural history and hepatocellular transformation require tumor surveillance and possible early transplantation. A better understanding of genetic and non-genetic modifiers in ZZ alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and other protein misfolding disorders will improve our ability to manage these patients. ABSTRACT: Recent discoveries in iron, copper, and glycogen metabolism increase our ability to diagnose and treat inherited metabolic diseases of the liver.

1950,Consensus recommendations for the management of asymptomatic persistent elevation of aminotransferase levels not related to the virus or alcohol. Suggestions for diagnostic and follow-up procedures,"persistent increase in non-alcohol related and non-viral aminotransferase levels can have multiple causes, which differ in terms of prevalence and clinical significance. In the general population, the most common cause is non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, which can progress to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The treatment of steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis consists of modifying lifestyles, and the efficacy of pharmacological treatment remains to be determined. Other much less common (but not rare) causes of persistent nonviral and nonalcohol-related elevations in aminotransferase levels include celiac disease and hemochromatosis, while autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency are rare. Since some of these conditions are treatable, early diagnosis is important. There are no epidemiological data available to assess the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels correlated with toxicity of drugs or other xenobiotics, including herbal products. This document, prepared by a panel of experts based on a systematic review of the scientific evidence, is aimed primarily at physicians who work in General Medicine and Transfusion Centers, who usually represent the first contact of people with high levels of aminotransferases. The document includes suggestions for diagnosing causes of persistent increases in aminotransferase levels not related to the virus or alcohol, taking into account the frequency and response to treatment.

1954,hepatic fibrosis,"Liver injury leads to an inflammatory response and the activation and proliferation of mesenchymal cell populations within the liver that remodel the extracellular matrix as part of an orchestrated wound-healing response. Chronic damage results in a progressive accumulation of scar proteins (fibrosis) which, with increasing severity, alters tissue structure and function, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Efforts to modulate the process of fibrogenesis have focused on understanding the biology of heterogeneous populations of liver fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are derived from sources inside and outside the liver. Alpha-smooth muscle actin-expressing fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) may be derived from transdifferentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells. Other fibroblasts emerge from the portal spaces within the liver. At least a proportion of these cells in the diseased liver originate in the bone marrow. In addition, fibrogenic fibroblasts can also be generated through the liver epithelium (hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells)-mesenchyme transition. Whatever its origin, it is clear that fibrogenic fibroblast activity is sensitive to (and may be active in) the cytokine and chemokine profiles of liver-resident leukocytes, such as macrophages. They may also be a component that drives tissue regeneration. Understanding the complex intercellular interactions that regulate liver fibrogenesis is increasingly important in view of projected increases in chronic liver disease and the current dearth of effective therapies.

We present here the case of a 17-year-old woman who presented with fulminant Wilsonian liver failure and intravascular hemolysis. With subsequent development of encephalopathy and oliguria, single-step albumin dialysis (SPAD) was started for 5 days to increase copper removal. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed using the PRISMA equipment, with a blood flow of 100 mL/min and a dialysis fluid flow of 2 L/h for 8 h, then 1 L/h. A 5% albumin dialysate was prepared by exchanging 1 L of 25% albumin for 1 L of Hemosol BO in a 5 L bag. Single-step albumin dialysis resulted in reductions in serum copper (154 to 59 Âµg /dL), conjugated bilirubin (37 to 23 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1305 to 729 units/L), and creatinine (1.1 to 0.9 mg/dL). ), as well as reduced blood transfusion requirements. SPAD cessation was followed by three plasmapheresis treatments for further copper removal. We conclude that SPAD is potentially an effective treatment in fulminant Wilson's disease with hemolysis, but that it should be used in combination with chelation to optimize copper clearance.

1960,Liver transplant for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by reduced biliary excretion of copper, resulting in the accumulation of copper in damaged tissues and liver failure. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be life-saving in patients with Wilson's disease who present with fulminant liver failure and in patients who do not respond to medical therapy. The objective of this study was to review our experience with OLT in patients with Wilson's disease. Between September 2001 and April 2007, 25 OLTs were performed in 24 patients (7 women and 17 men) with Wilson's disease with a mean age of 15.6 +/- 9.9 years (range, 5-51 years). Six patients were transplanted for coexisting fulminant liver failure and 18 for advanced chronic liver disease with (n = 8) or without (n = 10) associated neurological manifestations. We performed 3 full-size deceased-donor OLTs and 22 living-related donor OLTs. Eight patients had a family history of Wilson's disease. We detected a Kayser-Fleischer ring in 18 patients. All patients had a low serum ceruloplasmin level (mean, 27.8 mg/dL) and a high urinary copper excretion level (mean, 4119 Âµg/d) before OLT. Following successful OLT, there was a significant reduction in urinary copper excretion (median, 37.1 ug/d) in all patients. Median follow-up was 21.7 +/- 19.8 months (range, 2-60 months). Retransplantation was required in 1 patient 12 days after the first OLT due to lack of primary graft function. Five of the 24 patients died within 4 months after surgery. The remaining 19 survivors (79%) have been doing well, with normal liver function and no disease recurrence. In conclusion, OLT was a curative procedure for Wilson's disease among patients with fulminant liver failure and those with end-stage liver failure. After OLT, the serum ceruloplasmin level increased to the normal range, urinary copper excretion decreased, and neurological manifestations improved. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1961,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Child Neurology: Current and Future Directions,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method for focal brain stimulation based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where small intracranial electrical currents are generated by a powerful, rapidly changing extracranial magnetic field. Over the last 2 decades, TMS has shown promise in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases in adults, but has been used to a lesser extent in children. We review the literature to identify possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications of TMS in child neurology and also its safety in pediatrics. Although TMS has not been associated with any serious side effects in children and appears to be well tolerated, general safety guidelines should be established.

1962,Biomarkers of copper status: a brief update,"The essentiality of copper (Cu) in humans is demonstrated by various clinical features associated with deficiency, such as anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and bone malformations. Despite significant effort over several decades, a sensitive and specific Cu status biomarker has yet to be identified. This article updates a recently published comprehensive review by the authors that assesses the reliability and robustness of current biomarkers and describes the ongoing search for new indicators of status. The essential features of this earlier review are reiterated when considering whether there are other, as yet unproven, approaches that may provide valuable information in the search for a suitable measure of copper status. Current biomarkers include a variety of cuproenzymes, such as the acute phase protein ceruloplasmin and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, all of which are influenced by a variety of other dietary and environmental factors. A recent development is the identification of the chaperone Cu, CCS as a potential biomarker; although its reliability has not yet been established. This appears to be the most promising potential biomarker, responding to both Cu deficiency and Cu excess. The potential to identify a 'set' of biomarkers using high-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics is only now being explored. A combination of these technologies along with a variety of innovative metal detection techniques is essential for the search for robust copper biomarkers to be successful.

1965,"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and long-term outcome of 29 patients with Wilson's disease. [Spanish]","Objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment and follow-up of a cohort of 29 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) from the Region of Murcia. Patients and method: We reviewed the medical records of 29 cases of WD (mean age, 20.3 +/- 13.4 years) diagnosed during the last 16 years. Results: the most frequent reason for consultation was the finding of elevated transaminases in almost half of the patients, followed by tremors or dystonia in 17% of the patients, respectively. Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 17/29 (58.6%) of the patients (100% of patients with pure neurological involvement and 35% of patients with pure clinical liver disease; p < 0.001). Blood copper levels not associated with ceruloplasmin, as well as cupruria, were markedly higher in patients with neurological symptoms and in those with liver cirrhosis at diagnosis. The clinical symptoms of the patients remained stable with D-penicillamine or trientine, or improved during the observation period, in 18 of 29 patients (62%), while 11 of 29 patients (38%) worsened. Conclusions: in our region, patients with WD are diagnosed at an earlier age, and in most cases due to liver disease. Patients with neurological disease or liver cirrhosis had elevated free copper levels not associated with ceruloplasmin and cupruria. The disease had a favorable evolution in all patients except those diagnosed with liver disease or advanced neurological disease. Copyright Â© 2008 Aran Editions, SL",,"Rodrigo Agudo, J.

1967,Epilepsy in hereditary metabolic disorders,"Introduction: The study of neurometabolic diseases is still in a prolonged preliminary stage. The catalog of these diseases continues to grow; some known clinical syndromes have been subdivided into a series of variants once the genes that cause them have been identified, and at the same time new metabolic disorders have been discovered that aggravate or contribute to forms of epilepsy not previously classified as cerebral metabolic disorders. Results: This review presents the basic principles that support the recognition and treatment of epilepsy caused by neurometabolic diseases. These disorders are divided (simply for convenience) into epilepsy presenting in neonates, children, adolescents, and adults, recognizing that there is a significant degree of overlap between these time stages. Current analytical methods and therapeutic approaches are summarized both from a general point of view and within the context of each clinical syndrome, recognizing that each patient presents specific peculiarities and that, in general, antiepileptic drugs provide little benefit compared to other types of therapy. more specific (eg, special diets or vitamins) when indicated. We also include therapeutic recommendations and a general approach to fulminant epilepsies of neurometabolic origin, emphasizing the importance of identifying all relatives of the proband who may be potential carriers of a genetic disorder during the process of diagnosis and genetic counseling. Special emphasis is placed on disorders for which there is a curative treatment and on the importance of follow-up by expert professionals. Conclusion: It is expected that in a few years it will be possible to know the metabolomic profile of these diseases (possibly by non-invasive methods), thus facilitating an accurate diagnosis and making it possible to establish the response to treatment and identify all the people who are carriers or remain minimally symptomatic in regarding their risk of manifesting or transmitting epilepsy.

1968,Efficacy of tetratiomolybdate in a mouse model with multiple sclerosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a potent anti-copper drug developed for Wilson's disease. We have found multiple effective results in lowering copper levels with TM in mouse models of disease, using serum Cp as a surrogate marker of copper status and targeting Cp values of 20% to 50% of baseline. We have found effective results of TM therapy in mouse models of fibrosis; inflammation; damage by exogenous agents, such as paracetamol and doxorubicin; and immunomodulated diseases, such as concanavalin A hepatitis, collagen II-induced arthritis, and the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes. In the current study, we examined the efficacy of TM in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). We found that clinical neurological damage scores are significantly inhibited by MT therapy, whether therapy is started before MS-inducing antigen administration or after symptoms of antigen administration develop. Furthermore, we found that treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) results in a marked increase in oxidative damage, as measured by urinary isoprostane levels, and TM strongly and significantly suppresses these isoprostane increases. Finally, we found marked increases in inflammation- and immune-related cytokines in this model, and found that TM strongly and significantly suppressed these increases. Â© 2008.",,"Hou, G.;Abrams, G.

1973,Medical Countermeasures Against Nuclear Threats: Radionuclide Decorporation Agents,"Exposure to radionuclides spread by a radiological dispersal device or deposited as radioactive fallout following a nuclear power plant accident or detonation of an improvised nuclear device could lead to internal contamination of a significant number of people. Internalized radionuclides can cause both acute and chronic radiation injury and increase a person's risk of developing cancer. This damage and risk can be mitigated through the use of decorporation agents that reduce internal contamination. Unfortunately, the most effective agents incorporate only a limited range of radionuclides, and some are formulated in ways that would make administration difficult in mass casualty situations. There is a need for new radionuclide decorporating agents, reformulations of existing agents, and/or expansion of labeled indications for existing treatments. Researchers developing novel or improved discorporation agents must also understand the regulatory pathway for these products. This workshop, the first in nearly half a century to focus exclusively on radionuclide decomposition, brought together researchers and scientific managers from academia, government, and industry, as well as senior regulatory affairs officials and Food and Drug Administration staff. Meeting participants reviewed recent progress in decorporation agent development and contemplated the future of the field. Â© 2008 by Radiation Research Society.",,"Cassatt, D. R.;Kaminski, J.

1974,Delusional disorder and alcohol abuse in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) or hepatolenticular degeneration is a rare disorder of copper metabolism that results in copper deposition in the brain, liver, kidneys, and cornea. Due to copper deposits in the brain, neurological and psychiatric symptoms may appear. Psychiatric manifestations can range from mood disorders, behavioral and personality disorders to cognitive impairment, while psychotic symptoms are rarely reported. The objective of this report was to present an unusual case of WD presenting with nonpersecutory delusional disorder and alcohol abuse in the absence of neurological signs. Case Summary: A 34-year-old male patient, with no history of psychiatric or alcohol abuse, presented with delusions of jealousy and alcohol abuse when he discontinued his treatment for WD. Although the patient had no previous symptoms or neurological signs, he had been receiving treatment for WD for 3 years, after being diagnosed with the disease during the preventive family examination, since his brother developed symptomatic WD. The patient started combined pharmacological treatment, and after 3 months of follow-up the psychiatric manifestations were sufficiently controlled. Conclusions: Although WD is rarely associated with alcohol abuse and delusions of jealousy, this disease should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of these psychiatric manifestations.

1981,A single center experience with liver transplantation for Wilson's disease.,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, presenting with prominent hepatic and neurological manifestations. There is an established place for liver transplantation in the presence of liver disease, while the indication for neurological manifestations is debated. Between 1993 and 2005, 11 patients underwent liver transplantation for Wilson's disease at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the patients. The pathology of the explanted livers was analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups based on the evolution of the disease. Postoperative data collected included patient and graft outcome, complications, neurologic status, and copper metabolism. Six males and five females were transplanted at a mean age of 29.7 years (range 15-48 years). Three patients had a fulminant presentation, two patients had decompensation of established disease, and six patients had chronic disease. Neurological features were prominent in five patients. Pathological analysis of the explanted graft showed cirrhosis in all patients. The five patients with fulminant and acute-on-chronic presentations also showed explant necrosis. The mean postoperative follow-up was 56.8 months (range 10-129 months). Two patients were retransplanted. One patient died of severe sepsis. Two patients with severe neurological dysfunction showed a significant remission of symptoms. Liver transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for acute and chronic presentations of Wilson's disease. The acute presentation correlates with the presence of necrosis in the explanted liver. In our series, there was a significant improvement in neurological characteristics after transplantation.

Methods: We compared Wilson's disease patients (n = 18) with age-matched healthy subjects (n = 15) as controls. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urinary and hepatic copper concentrations). P-wave dispersion, a measure of the heterogeneity of atrial depolarization, was measured as the difference between the duration of the longest and shortest P waves on 12-lead electrocardiography. Results: All patients were asymptomatic on cardiological examination and had sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram. Left ventricular and left atrial diameters, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass index were similar in both groups. Patients with Wilson's disease had significantly greater P-wave dispersion compared to controls (44.7 +/- 5.8 vs. 25.7 +/- 2.5, P < 0.01). Conclusion: There was an increase in P-wave dispersion in cardiologically asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease, which probably represents an early stage of cardiac compromise. Â© 2008 WJG.

1983,"Chelators that control metal metabolism and toxicity pathways: applications in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment","Chelating drugs and chelating metal complexes are used for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer cells and normal cells require essential metal ions such as iron, copper, and zinc for their growth and proliferation. Chelators can target cancer cell metabolic pathways through control of proteins involved in the regulation of these metals and also other molecules involved in cell cycle control, angiogenesis, and metastatic suppression. Other targets include inhibition of specific proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase involved in DNA synthesis, inhibition of free radical damage to DNA caused by iron and copper catalytic sites, inhibition of microbial growth in immunocompromised cancer patients and the decay of radioactive and other toxic metals that cause cancer. Chelating drugs and metal ions can affect the metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, mitozantrone, bleiomycin, and hydroxyurea (HU). Although many experimental chelators have been shown to be effective as anticancer agents, only a few, eg, dexrazoxane, deferoxamine (DFO), and triapine, have reached the stage of clinical testing or application. In many experimental models, deferiprone (L1) has been shown to be effective in the prevention and treatment of cancer and in the inhibition of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. New anticancer drugs could be developed using chelators and chelating complexes with platinum and other metals, as well as new protocols for combinations of chelators with known anticancer drugs.

1984,Tetrathiomolybdate versus trientine in the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Initial treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, used for years in most patients, causes neurological worsening in up to half of these patients, and half of those who worsen never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We have developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for these types of patients and it has worked well in open studies. Trientine, another anti-copper drug on the market approved for patients intolerant to penicillamine, had not been tested in this type of patient. Here, we report a double-blind trial of TM versus trientine in the neurologically presenting patient with Wilson's disease. Design and methods: The study was a double-blind design in which patients received TM plus zinc or trientine plus zinc for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they had neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease, if they had not been treated for more than 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed up in hospital throughout the 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semi-quantitative speech and neurological examinations to assess for possible neurological worsening. Weekly blood and urine studies were also performed. At hospital discharge, they continued zinc maintenance therapy and returned at yearly intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients entered the trientine arm and 6 met criteria for neurological deterioration, while 25 patients entered the TM arm and only 1 deteriorated (p < 0.05). One patient with trientine had an adverse event while 7 with TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 of whom showed initial neurological deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurological and speech recovery over 3 years was good. Interpretation: TM is a superior option to trientine for the initial therapy of neurologic Wilson's disease. Â© 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Askari, F.;Lorincz, M.

These metals can be toxic in excessive amounts, especially in certain genetic disorders. The homeostasis of these trace elements results from a closely coordinated regulation by different proteins involved in their absorption, excretion, and intracellular storage/traffic. Through the Fenton reaction, Cu and Fe under conditions of non-protein binding, they can generate various reactive oxygen species, damaging tissues or cells. The abnormal metabolism of Zn, Cu and Fe can lead to various chronic pathogenesis, such as diabetes or diabetic complications. These pathogenic conditions seem to prevail in Zn and Cu deficiency as well as Cu and Fe overload. In Fe and Cu overload conditions, Fe and Cu chelating drugs could be used to control diabetes and diabetic complications. .

1986,Herbal Medications in Acute Viral Hepatitis: A Ticket to More Trouble,"The rapid worsening of a patient with acute liver disease, including the development of acute liver failure, a life-threatening complication, may in some cases be due to recently administered drugs or other xeniobiotics. A previously healthy Indian man affected by acute hepatitis E developed acute liver failure after a 5-day treatment with herbal medications. Pressure on health authorities and education of the population in general should help avoid these preventable deaths. Physicians have a responsibility to convince their patients affected by acute liver disease not to take medications for symptomatic relief, especially herbal medications, until recovery. It is hypothesized that some of the fatal cases of acute hepatitis E in pregnant women, a common observation in India, might be due to earlier consumption of herbal medicine at the onset of acute hepatitis E symptoms.

1988,Copper transport systems are involved in multidrug resistance and drug transport.,"Copper is an essential trace element, and several copper-containing proteins are essential for processes such as oxidative respiration, neural development, and collagen remodeling. Copper metabolism is precisely regulated by various transporters and chaperone proteins. Copper transport protein 1 (CTR1) selectively takes up copper in cells. Subsequently, three chaperone proteins, HAH1 (human atx1 homolog 1), Cox17p, and CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase) transport copper to the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, respectively. Defects in the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B are responsible for Menkes disease and Wilson's disease, respectively. These proteins transport copper via HAH1 to the Golgi apparatus to deliver copper to cuproenzymes. They also prevent cell damage from excessive copper accumulation by mediating copper efflux from the cell. There is increasing evidence that copper transport mechanisms may play a role in drug resistance. We, and others, found that ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in drug resistance against the antitumor drug cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP). Clinical studies support a relationship between expression of ATP7A or ATP7B in tumors and resistance to CDDP. In addition, the copper uptake transporter CTR1 has also been reported to play a role in CDDP sensitivity. Furthermore, we have recently found that the effect of ATP7A on drug resistance is not limited to CDDP. Using an ex vivo drug sensitivity assay, the tissue culture drug response assay (HDRA), ATP7A expression in surgically resected human colon cancer cells correlated with sensitivity to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy- camptothecin (SN-38). Cells that overexpress ATP7A are resistant to many anticancer drugs, including SN-38, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11), vincristine, paclitaxel, etoposide , doxorubicin (Dox), and mitoxantron. The mechanism by which ATP7A and copper metabolism modulate drug transport appears to involve modulation of cellular drug localization through modulation of the vesicle transport system. In cells that overexpress ATP7A, Dox accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, in parental cells, Dox is localized to the nuclei, where Dox's target molecules, topoisomerase II, and DNA are found. Disruption of the intracellular vesicle transport system with monensin, a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ionophore, induced relocalization of Dox from the Golgi apparatus to nuclei in cells that overexpress ATP7A. These data suggested that ATP7A-related drug transport depends on the vesicle transport system. Therefore, copper transport systems play an important role in drug transport as well as in copper metabolism. Therefore, components of copper metabolism are likely to include target molecules for drug potency modulation of not only anticancer agents but also other drugs.

1991,Treatment of seizures in renal and hepatic insufficiency,"Introduction: Kidney and liver diseases cause seizures and patients with epilepsy can suffer from them that alter the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Objectives: To review how seizures can be caused by metabolic alterations due to kidney or liver diseases, by their treatment or by comorbidities and how the choice of AED can be influenced by these conditions. Results: Seizures arise in renal failure due to the accumulation of toxins and complications such as sepsis, hemorrhage, malignant hypertension, pH and hydroelectrolytic alterations. Hemodialysis leads to acute imbalance syndrome and dementia. Peritoneal dialysis can cause hyperosmolar nonketotic coma. Post-renal transplant immunosuppression is neurotoxic and causes posterior leukoencephalopathy, cerebral lymphoma, and infections. Some antibiotics lower seizure thresholds, with the risk of status epilepticus. The most commonly used AEDs in uremia are benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When treating epilepsy in renal failure, the choice of AED continues to be linked to the type of seizure, but doses must be adjusted, especially in the case of water-soluble AEDs with low molecular weight, low protein binding and low apparent volume of distribution. . Liver failure leads to encephalopathy and seizures treated with ammonia levels and reductions in intestinal bacterial activity, reversal of cerebral edema, and intracranial hypertension. Phenytoin and benzodiazepines are usually ineffective. Seizures caused by posthepatic immunosuppression can be treated with phenytoin or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may be due to D-penicillamine-dependent pyridoxine deficiency. Porphyria seizures can be treated with gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Liver disease modifies the pharmacokinetics of AEDs and requires dose readjustments. AEDs poorly metabolized by the liver, such as gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam, are theoretically more suitable. Conclusions: The effective treatment of seizures in kidney and liver diseases requires an adequate diagnosis of these alterations and their comorbidities, in addition to a good knowledge of the metabolism of AEDs, their pharmacokinetic changes in these diseases, the careful use of concomitant medications and monitoring of serum levels of AEDs.",,"De Lacerda, G.

1992,Hereditary liver disease. [German],"Elevated liver enzymes are common in clinical practice, and occult hereditary liver diseases may play an important role in explaining these abnormalities. In hereditary hemochromatosis, the C282Y mutation results in increased intestinal iron absorption despite elevated total body iron stores. Numerous genetic mutations corresponding to enzymes throughout hemobiosynthesis can lead to porphyrias, a heterogeneous group of inherited metabolic disorders. In Wilson's disease, different mutations cause a functional abnormal transport protein ATP7B responsible for impaired biliary excretion of copper. Heterogeneous mutations were found in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency resulting in variable clinical expression patterns. In patients with Dubin Johnson Syndrome, the altered sequences of the MRP gene correspond to an alteration of the biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin. Early and sufficient diagnosis can help improve the prognosis of affected patients since more and more therapeutic options have been established. The size of this overview is not large enough to cover all inherited liver diseases. For this reason, we select cases and diseases recently diagnosed and treated in our practice.

1993,Approach to Wilson's disease in children: Analysis of patients diagnosed and managed at the Department of Pediatric and Infectious Diseases of Wroclaw (Poland) in the last 10 years,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (degeneratio hepato-lenticulatis) is a rare genetic disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. The sequelae of altered elimination are the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, cornea and other organs with progressive deterioration of its function. Wilson's disease can take several clinical forms: hepatic, neurological or others. The hepatic form is the most common in children and adolescents and was the only one observed in our patients. The signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease are usually nonspecific: asthenia, anemia, dyspeptic symptoms, joint pain with abnormal liver function tests. Objective of the study: The objective of the study was the analysis of the patients (age, sex, symptoms and clinical and laboratory signs, mode of diagnosis) treated in our department in the last 10 years. Material and methods: Retrospective descriptive study; Eight children with Wilson's disease who attended the Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in Wroclaw, Poland, between 1997 and 2007 were enrolled. Results: We have managed 8 children (4 girls and 4 boys) with Wilson's disease aged: 7-17 years. , all liver-shaped. None of the children had a Kayser-Fleischer ring. The disease was diagnosed with reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary copper excretion during the differential diagnosis of chronic hepatitis in 6/8 or fulminant acute liver failure in 2/8 patients. Treatment with D-penicillamine in 7 patients or liver transplantation in one, respectively, was effective in all children. Conclusions: Wilson's disease should be considered in any child with liver abnormalities of an unexplained nature; in these children, serum ceruloplasmin level and urinary copper excretion should be measured. Urinary copper excretion after D-penicillamine administration may also be helpful. The absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings does not exclude the diagnosis of Wilson's disease and is typical of children. Screening of siblings of a patient with Wilson's disease is mandatory. Copyright Â© 2008 Cornetis.",,"Kuchar, E.;Szenborn, L.",2008,,,0,0,

1995,Use of the molecular adsorbent recirculation system as a treatment for acute decompensated Wilson's disease,"Acute decompensated Wilson's disease presenting as fulminant hepatic failure is a life-threatening condition for which liver transplantation is the definitive treatment. It is listed as a status 1 indication under the United Network for Organ Sharing classification. A massive amount of copper released during the attack induces hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. Conventional chelation therapy that attempts to remove copper from the patient is unsuccessful because there is not enough time for these drugs to work and patients are often oliguric. The molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) is a modified form of dialysis that removes putative albumin-bound toxins associated with liver failure. Extracorporeal albumin dialysate is believed to absorb circulating copper molecules that become trapped in the patient's circulation. We present 2 patients with acute decompensated Wilson's disease treated with MARS. In the first case, the patient started MARS when conventional treatment failed. A significant amount of copper was removed from his circulatory system and his condition stabilized afterwards. The treatment bought him extra time, and he eventually got a liver transplant. In the second case, the patient started MARS treatment early in the course of his illness and his condition soon stabilized after treatment. He was able to return to his home country for a liver transplant. In both cases, MARS was used as a means of preventing deterioration rather than saving devastation. In conclusion, MARS may confer benefits to patients with acute decompensated Wilson's disease if initiated early in the course of the disease. Â© 2008 AASLD.",,"Chiu, A.;Tsoi, N. S.;Fan, S.

However, to date, eye movements in WD patients have rarely been investigated and data on this topic are scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate reflex and voluntary eye movements in WD patients. We examined smooth-tracking and horizontal saccadic eye movements using infrared oculography in 50 WD patients, including 29 neurologically symptomatic (WDn) and 21 asymptomatic (WDa), and in 29 healthy controls. We found a statistically significant increase in mean antisaccade latency (378 ms) and mean antisaccade error rate (22.5) in the WDn group, compared to the WDa group (317 ms and 9.1, respectively) and the controls (318 ms and 9.7, respectively). In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean latency of prosaccades and in the size of the gap effect.

[Japanese]","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder and abnormal copper (Cu) metabolism also occurs due to dysfunction of the enzyme ATP7B, so that excessive Cu contents accumulate in the tissues. Ionic Cu binds to metallthionine, causing the cell to be damaged by oxidative oxygen. In fact, the tissues are injured due to their hereditary nature, unless the Cu deposits in the tissues must be removed. Among seven cases who were continuously administered D-penicillamine and zinc acetate alternately every week, at the time of initial symptoms such as dysarthria, athetosis, etc. in childhood, all cases improved after treatment with Cu chelating agents.

Despite decades of clinical use, knowledge of its pharmacology in humans remains incomplete. Here, we first used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect and identify the major metabolites of TETA in human plasma and urine, and then used this method to measure the concentrations of TETA and its metabolites in the urine of healthy subjects. and diabetics. who were given increasing doses (300, 600, 1200 and 2400 mg) of TETA orally. Twenty-four hour urine collections were performed before and after dosing of the participants. Two main metabolites of TETA were detected in human urine, N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N<inf>1</inf>,N<inf>10</inf>-diacetyltriethylenetetramine, the latter being new. Both metabolites were verified with synthetic standards by LC-MS. The proportion of unchanged TETA excreted as a fraction of total drug-derived molecules in urine was significantly higher in healthy subjects than in matched diabetic subjects, consistent with a higher rate of TETA metabolism in the latter. TETA-induced increases in urinary Cu excretion in non-diabetic subjects correlated more closely with parent drug concentrations than in diabetic subjects, whereas, conversely, urinary Cu was more closely associated with the sum of TETA and MAT. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MAT could play an important role in the molecular mechanism by which TETA extracts Cu<sup>II</sup> from the systemic compartment in diabetic subjects.

Pretreatment with iron chelators desferal, clioquinol, VK-28 and M30 are neuroprotective in both models. To determine the specificity of chelation neuroprotective activity, we have examined the effect of D-penicillamine, a relatively specific copper chelator, in the mouse model of MPTP-induced dopamine depletion. Our studies show that D-penicillamine, used to remove copper in Wilson's disease, is relatively weak in preventing MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, compared to previously studied iron chelators. The results indicate that for the prevention of MPTP-induced dopamine depletion and dopamine neurodegeneration, chelation of iron instead of copper may be more effective and specific.

Wilson's disease is the most common metabolic cause of fulminant liver failure in children older than 3 years. The aim of this study was to find out the main clinical and pathological findings of Wilson's disease in children in Tehran. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the mofid children's hospital. Thirty-five patients suffering from Wilson's disease were studied. Inclusion criteria were considered to be a ceruloplasmin level below 20 mg/dl and a urinary copper excretion level above 100 Âµg/24 h. Results: Of the patients, 20 cases were male and 15 female with an average age of 9 years. Most of the patients were in the age group of 8-9 and 10-11 years with 37% and 20%, respectively. Liver involvement was confirmed in 100% of patients. Jaundice was observed in 20 patients (57%), abdominal enlargement as a whole in 20 patients (57%), and encephalopathy in 9 patients (26%). Serum copper decreased by 100% and serum ceroluplasmin decreased by 100%, urinary copper excretion increased by 97%, AST and ALT increased by 100%, PT increased by 94% of patients, anemia was found in 100%, leukopenia in 14%, and thrombocytopenia was observed in 71% of patients. In this study, 37% of patients had neurological symptoms such as tremor, ataxia, slurred speech, and educational delay. 32 patients had undergone an ophthalmologic examination and 62% showed a KF ring on their ophthalmoscopy.

2007,Prospects for gene therapy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper overload disorder due to mutations in the Wilson's disease gene ATP7B. The disease typically manifests in late childhood or young adulthood with hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Being fatal without medical treatment or liver transplantation, the long-term outcome of Wilson's disease depends on adherence to effective treatment. Because current medical treatment options are not effective in all patients with Wilson's disease and adherence to therapy is a problem, gene therapy could represent a future alternative curative therapy. In the rat model of Wilson's disease, adenoviral and lentiviral gene transfer studies could show that viral gene transfer is therapeutically effective and can reverse clinical symptoms. However, both approaches were limited by more or less transient transgene expression. As various tactics can be used to overcome these current limitations, gene therapy approaches may become more efficient than standard medical treatment for Wilson's disease in the future. This review discusses both existing vectors and strategies and prospective developments towards liver-directed gene therapy, although there is still a long way to go until gene therapy can be used for the safe treatment of Wilson's disease in humans.

Zinc supplementation offers protection in experimental animal models of acute and chronic liver damage, but these hepatoprotective properties have not been fully elucidated. In this review, data on zinc homeostasis, its involvement in the pathogenesis of liver diseases, and its effect on acute and chronic liver diseases are presented.

Present in most organisms, they are key elements for metal homeostasis. P<inf>1B</inf>-type ATPases contain 6 to 8 transmembrane fragments that carry distinctive sequences in segments that flank the large cytoplasmic ATP-binding loop. These sequences made it possible to differentiate at least four subgroups of P<inf>1B</inf>-ATPase with different metal selectivity: P<inf>1B-1</inf>: Cu<sup>+</sup> , P <inf>1B-2</inf>: Zn <sup>2+</sup>, P<inf>1B-3</inf>: Cu<sup>2+</sup>, P<inf >1B -4</inf>: Co <sup>2+</sup>. Mutagenesis of the invariant transmembrane Cys at H6, Asn and Tyr at H7, and Met and Ser at H8 of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPase has revealed that its side chains likely coordinate metals during transport. and constitute a single central component of these enzymes. The structure of several cytoplasmic domains has been resolved. The general structure of those involved in enzyme phosphorylation (P domain), nucleotide binding (N domain), and energy transduction (A domain) appears similar to those described for SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup >- ATPase. However, they show different characteristics probably associated with unique functions of these proteins. Many, but not all, P<inf>1B</inf>-type ATPases also contain a diverse arrangement of cytoplasmic metal-binding domains (MBDs).

In addition, eukaryotic Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases have multiple N-MBD regions that participate in the metal-dependent targeting and localization of these proteins. Current knowledge of the structure-function relationships between the different P<inf>1B</inf>-ATPases allows us to describe the selectivity, regulation and transport mechanisms.

2011,"Reversible precipitation of bovine serum albumin by metal ions and synthesis, structure, and reactivity of novel tetrathiometalate chelating agents.","Independent research is an important component of any undergraduate chemistry program. This article reports the findings of two of the many undergraduate research projects led by Ed Stiefel in the hope that the results will be inspiring and useful to the scientific community. The neurological disorders associated with insufficient copper in Menkes disease and excess copper in Wilson's disease are well established; however, recent evidence suggests that copper may also be involved in other disorders, such as Alzheimer's, angiogenesis, and prion diseases. However, the exact role of copper is uncertain. This study examines the role of copper and zinc in the formation of protein deposits and the chelation and removal of metal ions to reverse the process. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein forms a precipitate after the addition of about 6 copper(II) atoms or 8 zinc(II) atoms. Other metal ions, such as Ca(II), Al(III), Ni(II), and Co(II), did not precipitate BSA even when the ratios of metal ions to BSA were greater than 1000. Copper and zinc precipitated protein returned to solution after addition of chelating agents, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or tetrathiometalates [(MS<inf>4</inf><sup>2 -</sup>), where M = Mo, W ]. Two new choline and acetylcholine chelating agents tetrathiomolybdate and tetrathiotungstate have been synthesized and characterized.

2015,"The role of thiols, dithiols, nutritional factors and interacting ligands in the toxicology of mercury","Mercury has been known as a toxic substance for centuries. While the clinical features of acute mercury poisoning have been well described, chronic low-dose mercury exposure remains poorly characterized and its potential role in various chronic disease states remains controversial. Low molecular weight thiols, i.e. sulfhydryl-containing molecules such as cysteine, are emerging as important factors in the transport and distribution of mercury throughout the body due to the phenomenon of ""molecular mimicry"" and their role in molecular transport of mercury. mercury. Chelating agents such as sodium dithiols 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are the treatments of choice for mercury toxicity. Alpha lipoic acid (ALA), a disulfide, and its metabolite dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, have also been shown to have chelating properties when used appropriately. Although N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) have been recommended in the past for the treatment of mercury toxicity, a review of the available evidence suggests that these agents may, in fact, be counterproductive. Zinc and selenium have also been shown to exert protective effects against mercury toxicity, most likely mediated by induction of the metal-binding proteins metallothionein and selenoprotein-P. However, evidence suggests that co-administration of selenium and dithiol chelating agents during treatment may also be counterproductive. Finally, the topic of diagnostic tests for chronic, historical, or low-dose mercury poisoning is considered, including a discussion of the influence of ligand interactions and nutritional factors on the accuracy of ""challenge"" tests. chelation"".

2021,Smad-interacting protein 1 (Zfhx1b) acts upstream of Wnt signaling in the mouse hippocampus and controls its formation,"Smad-interacting protein 1 (Sip1) [zinc finger homeobox (Zfhx1b)] is a transcription factor implicated in the genesis of Mowat-Wilson syndrome in humans. Sip1 expression in the dorsal telencephalon of mouse embryos was documented from E12.5. We inactivated the gene specifically in cortical precursors. This resulted in the lack of the entire hippocampal formation. Sip1 mutant mice exhibited death of differentiating cells and decreased proliferation in the region of the putative hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Expression of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 was ectopically activated, while the activity of the non-canonical Wnt effector, JNK, was downregulated in the embryonic hippocampus of mutant mice. In cortical cells, Sip1 protein was detected in the promoter of the Sfrp1 gene and both genes showed a mutually exclusive expression pattern suggesting that Sfrp1 expression is negatively regulated by Sip1. Therefore, Sip1 is essential for the development of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and is capable of modulating Wnt signaling in these regions.

2022,Unified Wilson's disease rating scale: a proposal for the neurological rating of patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and purpose: The clinical forms of the neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease (WD) can be divided into three movement disorder syndromes: a) dystonic, b) ataxic, c) parkinsonian syndrome. These syndromes in WD rarely occur in isolation. Clinical rating scales, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), and the Rating Scale for Dystonia (RSD), which focus on parkinsonism , ataxia, or dystonia alone are not sufficient to accurately reflect motor impairment in WD patients. The aim of the study was to develop a new grading scale for WD, because to the best of our knowledge, no scale for clinical grading in WD has been designed before. Material and methods: In 2004 the EuroWilson consortium was founded to create a European WD database. Consortium members from Poland, Germany, and France prepared a new scale using clinical rating scales such as UPDRS, ICARS, and RSD. The prepared drafts were discussed several times in detail at the first international EuroWilson neurology meeting in September 2004 in Paris and in November in Warsaw. Results and conclusions: The novel scale for WD consists of 3 parts, including: Awareness, a historical review based on the Barthel scale (2-11 items), and neurological examination (12-35 items). The maximum score for the first part is 3, for the second 39 points and for the last 143 points. The initial reliability of the scale was evaluated based on 6 patients (on DVD) and 8 investigators. Interrater agreement was high. Now the scale is used by the EuroWilson and GeNeMove consortia.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Tarnacka, B.;Moller, J. C.;Leinweber, B.;Bandmann, O.;Woimant, F.;Oertel, W.

Metal overload mainly in the liver and basal ganglia leads to hepatic clinical symptoms but also extrapyramidal motor, as well as psychiatric symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, copper metabolism parameters, ophthalmologic examination, and liver biopsy. A radiocopper test is capable of identifying patients even with inconsistent laboratory results. For initial evaluation and follow-up, neurophysiological investigation and magnetic resonance imaging are further recommended. Genetic analysis may be useful in detecting asymptomatic relatives of the index patient.

Our objective was to validate 3 published scoring systems to decide between chelation therapy and liver transplantation in patients with fulminant decompensated chronic WD. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score, as well as the WD Prognostic Index (WPI) and its recently revised version (RWPI) were evaluated as predictors of the safety of chelation therapy. A group of 14 adult patients with compensated chronic WD who improved on penicillamine treatment was compared with 21 patients with fulminant WD. Diagnosis of WD was based on increased urinary copper excretion and confirmed by elevated liver copper content and/or WD gene mutation analysis. MELD score, WPI, and RWPI were calculated for all WD patients. The accuracy of the MELD score, WPI, and RWPI in predicting response to chelation therapy in patients with chronic decompensated WD was 0.968, 0.980, and 0.993, respectively. None of the chronic decompensated WD patients had a MELD score > 30, RWPI > 11, or WPI > 7. RWPI showed the highest accuracy and lowest false negativity compared to WPI and MELD.

Hepatic adenoma must be a contraindication to pregnancy or be resected first; it can grow rapidly and rupture with life-threatening intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Obstetric cholestasis usually presents as itching of the extremities. Ursodeoxycholic acid, 10 mg/kg/day, improved maternal symptoms and biochemistry in some reported trials, and there have been no reports of adverse effects in the infant. The fetus is at increased risk of preterm delivery, fetal distress, and stillbirth, but elective delivery at 37-38 weeks prevents these in almost all cases.

Early delivery is helpful, although the condition can progress or even develop de novo after delivery, peaking about 48 hours after delivery. In full-blown eclampsia, liver rupture with massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage can occur, with high mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is serious but rare (1/15,000).

2036,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper disposal caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a P-type ATPase, known as Wilson's ATPase, that functions within hepatocytes to move copper across intracellular membranes. The transporting action of copper directly supports the production of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase, in which copper is incorporated, as well as the excretion of copper in the bile. Consequently, in Wilson's disease, serum copper concentrations are low and hepatic retention of copper develops, leading to liver damage. Wilson's disease can present as liver, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; The clinical phenotypes are very varied. Other organ systems may also be involved. Although the usual age range for clinical presentation is 5 to 45 years, younger children and older adults can develop this disease. Clinical investigations include liver function tests, brain imaging, serum ceruloplasmin and copper, baseline 24-hour urinary copper measurement, and liver parenchymal copper concentration. Genetic diagnosis is complex and is best used for family studies or in populations known to have a limited repertoire of mutations. Treatment is usually very effective and consists of lifelong administration of a chelating agent (D-penicillamine or trientine) or zinc in pharmacological doses. Liver transplantation is mandatory for patients with fulminant hepatic failure (coagulopathy, encephalopathy, massive intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, elevated aminotransferases, subnormal alkaline phosphatase) or for those whose liver disease does not respond to standard treatment.

2040,"Wilson's disease: a practical approach to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper accumulation and toxicity that affects about 30 people per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper transporter P-type ATPase, which is important for excretion of copper into bile, leading to accumulation of copper in the liver. Toxic concentrations of copper can also be found in the brain and kidneys, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical features and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high copper concentrations in liver tissues, and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Genetic studies are also available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited. Wilson's disease is treatable and early diagnosis is essential: the goal of therapy is to reduce copper accumulation, either by increasing its urinary excretion or by decreasing its intestinal absorption. Medical therapies include penicillamine, trientine, zinc, and tetrathiomolybdate. Liver transplantation is a relatively successful treatment option when medical therapy fails or in acute liver failure, although it is also characterized by short- and long-term complications.

However, an infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus induced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This disease first appeared in late 2002 and spread rapidly from its origin in southern China to more than 25 countries during the 2003 epidemic. It affected ~8000 patients and caused ~800 deaths, a high mortality rate. To combat the disease, scientists have carried out cell-based assays to find inhibitors of viral replication or have focused on specific targets to develop their inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents. A promising target for SARS drug development is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, a major protease responsible for maturation of functional proteins in the life cycle of the SARS coronavirus. Several groups of inhibitors have been identified through high-throughput screening and rational drug design. Inhibitors reported in the literature and described in patents are summarized in this review.

In particular, evidence collected in our laboratory over the last six years shows that copper distribution abnormalities originating from blood flow variations correlate with functional and structural brain deficits in AD. Although these works support a harmful role for copper, new studies hypothesize a protective role. In fact, some recent studies have shown that a decrease in serum copper in men correlates with poorer neuropsychological performance. However, this apparent discrepancy refers to absolute serum copper levels and can be overcome by considering the non-ceruloplasmin copper fraction (NCC).",,"Squitti, R.;Rossini, P. M.",2007,,,0,0,

Other complexing metals (Zn<sup>+2</sup> and Fe<sup>+2</sup>) did not interfere in the Cu-nitro-PAPS reaction. The analytical recovery of copper was between 90% and 107% (average 98%). Within-run and between-run CVs were <5% in normal and high-copper urine groups. Conclusions: We have developed a new sensitive and reliable automated colorimetric urine copper determination method.

2047,Wilson's disease: a case report and review of the literature. [Spanish],"case of Wilson's disease is reported in a 22-year-old woman. There is only a history of primary amenorrhea diagnosed at 17 years of polycystic ovary. The disease has 2 years of evolution with progressive intense tremor of the right hand, drooling, stiffness of the left arm and dysphagia. In the ophthalmological examination, the Kayser-Fleischer ring was found. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse hyperintensity of the basal ganglia and degeneration of the lentiform nucleus, consistent with Wilson's disease. Liver biopsy showed macronodular cirrhosis with regeneration nodules and minimal activity data. A genomic DNA sequence was performed that showed a homozygous mutation for the amino acid sequence H1069Q and c3207C>a in exon 14 of the ATP7B gene.

2048,Therapeutic profile of orphan drugs,"Purpose: To characterize the therapeutic profile of orphan drugs. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out for 2 months in a convenience sample of seven hospital pharmacy services in the Lisbon region. The data was collected from the records of the pharmaceutical service. Results: A total of 18 orphan drugs were dispensed to 355 patients with rare diseases. Most of the patients were adults (76.4%). Preterm infants and neonates represented 50.0% of pediatric patients. No differences were found between the proportion of male and female patients between age groups (p = 0.762). Only 18.3% were hospitalized patients. A higher proportion of hospitalized pediatric patients (58.3%) relative to hospitalized adults (5.9%) were seen (P = 0.001). In general, antineoplastic and immunomodulatory agents for rare cancers were the most frequently dispensed drugs (51.3%). In relation to pediatrics, Caffeine Citrate for primary apnea in the premature newborn had the highest frequency distribution (57.1%). Five (71.4%) medications dispensed for pediatrics do not have marketing authorization and the remaining (28.6%) were used off-label. For pulmonary arterial hypertension, 19 of 27 patients (70.3%) were treated with bosentan. According to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, bosentan has a good level of evidence and a substantial benefit: recommendation grade A. Conclusions: Most of the orphan drugs dispensed to pediatrics and adults were not authorized. A special pharmacovigilance program and a risk management plan must be implemented throughout the life cycle, towards the efficacy and safety of orphan drugs.

2049,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, with subsequent impairment of biliary copper excretion. Subsequent accumulation of copper, first in the liver but ultimately in the brain and other tissues, leads to proteinaceous clinical manifestations that may include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other disorders. Genetic testing is not practical due to the multitude of mutations that have been identified, so an accurate diagnosis relies on the judicious use of a battery of laboratory and other diagnostic tests. Lifelong palliative treatment with an ever-increasing group of drugs, or with a liver transplant if necessary, can successfully ameliorate or prevent the progressive deterioration and eventual death that would otherwise inevitably occur.

2050,hereditary metabolic liver disease,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The last decade has seen extraordinary growth in our understanding of the pathophysiology of Wilson's disease, genetic hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as we continue to elucidate the cellular and molecular machinery involved in their pathogenesis. . The continuing progress in elaborating the molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology, and management of these prototypical inherited metabolic diseases will be the focus of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis involve defects in metal transport with accumulation of copper and iron in hepatocytes, respectively. In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hepatocytes accumulate defective alpha-1 antitrypsin that misfolds. As a more complete picture of the molecular biology of the proteins and genes involved in transport has evolved, our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these disorders and the variety of phenotypes observed has also evolved. Ultimately, new insights regarding the clinical management of these disorders will emerge with elucidation of the cellular basis of these diseases. ABSTRACT: The recent developments detailed in this article have important implications for the future diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Recent discoveries link molecular defects with alterations in the functional machinery of the cell and provide new avenues to advance the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

Current Food and Drug Administration classifications do not necessarily reflect clinical experience or recent literature. Ideally, the lowest-risk drug possible should be used, paying attention to the appropriate level of efficacy for the patient's condition, stage of pregnancy, and dose adjustment. Each treatment decision should be discussed in detail with the patient and a multidisciplinary team that should include the obstetrician and, if appropriate, the pediatrician. This review will cover medications commonly used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Most medications can be classified as ""low risk"" or ""should be avoided.""

2053,"Copper and human health: biochemistry, genetics, and strategies for modeling dose-response relationships","Copper (Cu) and its alloys are widely used in domestic and industrial applications. Cu is also an essential element in mammalian nutrition. Since both copper deficiency and copper excess cause adverse health effects, the dose-response curve is U-shaped, although the precise shape has not yet been well characterized. Many animal and human studies on copper have been conducted to provide a rich database from which data suitable for modeling the dose-response relationship for copper can be extracted. Potential dose-response modeling strategies, including those based on reference dose and categorical regression, are considered in this review. The utility of biologically based dose-response modeling techniques for understanding copper toxicity was difficult to assess at this time, as the mechanisms underlying copper-induced toxicity have not yet been fully elucidated. A dose-response modeling strategy for copper toxicity associated with both deficiency and excess was proposed. This modeling strategy was applied to multiple copper-induced toxicity studies, standardized with respect to severity of adverse health outcomes, and selected on the basis of criteria reflecting the quality and relevance of the individual studies. The use of a comprehensive database on copper-induced toxicity is essential for dose-response modelling, as there is insufficient information in any individual study to adequately characterize copper dose-response relationships. The dose-response modeling strategy envisioned here is designed to determine whether existing toxicity data for copper excess or deficiency can be used effectively to define homeostatic range limits in humans and other species. By considering alternative techniques for determining a starting point and low-dose extrapolation (including categorical regression, reference dose, and identification of no-observed-effect levels), this strategy will identify which techniques are best suited for this purpose. This analysis also serves to identify areas where additional data is needed to better define the characteristics of dose-response relationships for copper-induced toxicity in relation to excess or deficiency.

2058,Three atypical cases of Wilson's disease: evaluation of the Leipzig scoring system to make a diagnosis,"Background/aims: The diagnosis of this condition in the absence of neurological findings can pose a dilemma. In 2001, experts at the 8th International Conference on Wilson's Disease (WD) and Menkes Disease in Leipzig, Germany, proposed a scoring system that may facilitate the diagnosis of WD. Methods/Results: Three patients were identified with an atypical presentation of WD as they all presented after the age of 40 years. Two of the three had established cirrhosis and none had neuropsychiatric manifestations. All three patients met the Leipzig diagnostic criteria proposed by the EASL before confirmatory mutation analysis. Patient A died of liver failure despite treatment. Patients B and C have remained with stable liver disease on chelation therapy. Conclusions: We believe that these patients represent a group that is more likely to be missed in the diagnosis of liver disease due to a combination of atypical features, such as older age of onset, the presence of other confounding factors for liver disease and sometimes the absence of Kayser. -Fleischer rings.

Here we show that Cu<sup>2+</sup> triggers hepatocyte apoptosis by activating acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and releasing ceramide. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of Asm prevented Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and protected rats, genetically prone to developing Wilson's disease, from acute hepatocyte death, liver failure, and death early. Cu<sup>2+</sup> induced secretion of activated Asm from leukocytes, leading to ceramide release and phosphatidylserine exposure in erythrocytes, events that were also prevented by Asm inhibition. Exposure to phosphatidylserine resulted in the immediate removal of affected erythrocytes from the blood in mice. Consequently, people with Wilson's disease showed elevated plasma levels of Asm and a constitutive increase in ceramide- and phosphatidylserine-positive erythrocytes.

2061,The emergence of psychiatric disorders and Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive pathology resulting from the loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B or WDNP), secondary to a change (currently more than 60 are described), insertion or deletion of the ATP7B gene located in the chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1, which implies a reduction or absence of copper transport in bile and its accumulation in the body, especially in the brain. Wilson's disease is transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13. The prevalence of the heterozygote is assessed at 1/90 and the homozygous at 1/30,000. Consanguinity, common in socially geographically isolated populations, increases the prevalence of the disease. Accumulating in the liver from early childhood and perhaps earlier, toxic amounts of copper remain concentrated in the body for years. Therefore, cytological and histological changes can be detected in biopsies, before the appearance of clinical or biological symptoms of liver damage. The accumulation of copper in the liver is due to a defect in the biliary excretion of the metal and is invariably accompanied by a deficiency of ceruloplasmin; Protein synthesized from a transferred ATP7B gene, which causes retention of copper ions in the liver. Detectable cellular abnormalities are of two types: hepatic lesions leading to acute liver failure, acute hepatitis and ultimately advanced cirrhosis, and central nervous system lesions responsible for neurological and psychiatric disorders. In approximately 40-50% of patients, the first manifestation of Wilson's disease affects the central nervous system. Although copper diffuses from the liver into the blood and then into other tissues, it has disastrous consequences only in the brain. Therefore, it can cause progressive neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. Wilson's disease begins as a liver, neurological, or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of patients. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric, which, according to the literature, represent only 10% of cases. The disease can be manifested by isolated behavioral problems, an irrational syndrome, a schizophrenic syndrome or a manic-depressive syndrome. Damage to the central nervous system may be more severe, so several differential diagnoses have been discussed: *a late-onset psychotic disorder *a depressive state *a mental confusion disorder. The clinical syndrome is complex. In fact, it is polymorphism that dominates in the description of the psychiatric manifestations of the disease. This can lead to detrimental diagnostic ambulation, especially as strong sedative treatment may be necessary to suppress behavior problems. Clinically, Wilson's disease usually appears between the ages of 10 and 20 years. It rarely remains masked until after the age of 40. The first manifestations are hepatic (40% of cases), neurological (35%) or psychiatric (10%). The inaugural disorder may ultimately take a hematologic, renal, or mixed form in approximately 15% of cases. We have detailed the main clinical elements. In approximately 40-50% of patients, the first manifestation of the disease affects the central nervous system, where it can cause progressive neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. The ophthalmologic disorder is dominated by the Kayser-Fleischer ring, which represents a green or bronze-colored ring on the periphery of the cornea. It occupies the upper pole of the cornea, then the lower pole and extends to the entire circumference. It is usually only visible when examined with a slit lamp. It disappears on average within 3 to 5 years after copper chelation therapy. The Kayser-Fleischer ring has been described outside of Wilson's disease, in rare cases of prolonged cholestasis. At the hematological level, hyperhemolysis is due to the toxicity of ionic copper, massively released into the plasma by hepatocellular necrosis. The other manifestations can be found in the following organs: renal, osteoarticular, cardiac, endocrine, cutaneous and integuments. Until 1952, the diagnosis was evoked only in clinical symptoms. It can now be marked unambiguously, even in the absence of any symptoms, by describing a plasma ceruloplasmin concentration of less than 200 ml/l and a Kayser-Fleischer ring. Liver copper in the sample increases steadily during disease (3 to 25 mumol/g dry weight). On the other hand, the absence of a reduction in plasma ceruloplasmin does not allow the diagnosis to be excluded. Conversely, there may be a reduction in ceruloplasmin other than Wilson's disease (nephritic syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, or severe hepatic insufficiency). The Kayser-Fleischer ring is almost constant among patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations (so its absence represents a very strong argument against the diagnosis). In contrast, it may be absent during hepatic forms and, in this case, its absence is not an argument against the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal abnormal signals from the gray nuclei. A genetic study is performed by linkage analysis in case of a family history of the disease. When left untreated, Wilson's disease induces tissue damage, the result of which is always fatal. Treatment is based on the regulation of copper chelation, which improves prognosis, and zinc, which captures copper in a non-toxic way. Severe psychiatric disorders seen during Wilson's disease may require tranquilizers, but care should be taken because of possible neurological or hepatic side effects. Lithium seems an interesting treatment and is still theoretically indicated, taking into account the scarcity of extrapyramidal symptoms and liver dysfunction among patients in the cirrhotic stage, since it is not metabolized in the liver. Although rare, it is important to address Wilson's disease in psychiatry because psychiatric manifestations may precede somatic disturbances and help make the diagnosis. We emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of the pathology, whose outcome is fatal in the absence of specific treatment. Â© 2007 L'Encephale, Paris, 2007.",,"Benhamla, T.;Tirouche, Y.

2062,Wilson's disease in childhood and adolescence. Diagnosis and treatment. [German],"The first essential to make the diagnosis of Wilson's disease is to think about it. Neurologists do a better job of this than pediatricians. The main clinical presentation in children refers to the liver, and acute hemolysis may also occur. Neurological manifestations can normally be seen only in adolescents. Diagnosis is based on low serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, elevated serum transaminases, elevated 24-hour urine copper excretion, and elevated liver tissue copper content. However, pitfalls can occur in this diagnostic puzzle. Haplotype analysis allows diagnosis in presymptomatic siblings of an index patient. Lifelong treatment with chelating agents such as penicillamine or trientine is mandatory, zinc is an alternative in presymptomatic cases and after several years of copper detoxification with penicillamine.

2063,The LEC rat: a useful model to study hepatic carcinogenesis related to oxidative stress and inflammation,"Increasing evidence indicates that oxidative stress is a mechanism of several diseases, including cancer. Oxidative stress can be defined as the imbalance between the production of cellular oxidant species and the antioxidant capacity shifted towards the former. Lipid peroxidation is one of the processes that takes place during oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), are closely related to carcinogenesis, as they are potent mutagens and have been suggested as modulators of related signaling pathways with proliferation and apoptosis, two processes involved in the development of cancer. The mechanisms by which oxidative stress leads to tumor formation are still under investigation. The need for suitable in vivo models that can reflect such inflammation-related human carcinogenesis is evident. In this sense, the Long Evans Cinnamon-like (LEC) mutant strain of rat provides a promising model for the investigation of the relationship between oxidative stress-induced hepatitis and hepatocarcinogenesis because it has been shown to develop spontaneous hepatic tumors related to oxidative stress. copper buildup and oxidation. stress. In this review, the findings regarding oxidative stress and its relationship with liver pathologies in LEC rats are discussed; we focus on the proposed mechanisms for HNE carcinogenesis. Â© W. S.

Certain metabolic diseases respond to specific treatments and must be identified early, particularly in emergency situations where rapid introduction of treatment may prevent a fatal outcome or irreversible neurological damage. The main diseases that lead to acute neurological syndrome in adults are urea cycle disorders, homocysteine metabolism disorders and porphyria. More rarely, Wilson's disease, amino acid diseases, organic aciduria or pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, beta-oxidation disorders, or biotin metabolism may be involved. Most emergency situations can be correctly detected with simple tests (serum ammonia, homocysteine, lactate, urinary prophyrins, acylcarnitine standard, amino acid and organic acid chromatography).

2065,Effect of penicillamine and zinc on iron metabolism in Wilson's disease,"Goal. The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown, and there is a paucity of data on the actual presence and progression of iron accumulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate parameters of iron metabolism, including liver iron concentration, in liver biopsies and follow-up serum, and urinary pro-hepcidin. Material and methods. Twenty-three patients with Wilson's disease undergoing long-term treatment were enrolled in the study. Results. Liver iron content was significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared with zinc-treated patients. Serum and urinary concentrations of prohepcidin were significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than in healthy volunteers, despite a normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism. Conclusions. Long-term treatment with penicillamine seems to be responsible for a more marked accumulation of iron in the liver. This observation may warrant a review of long-term treatment modalities for Wilson's disease with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary prohepcidin are significantly increased in Wilson's disease patients compared to healthy volunteers suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, but this needs to be confirmed by a hepatic expression study. of hepcidin in these patients.

Among the most frequent symptoms of this disorder are liver, neurological or psychiatric disorders, although other less frequent clinical manifestations may occasionally occur. Since the clinical presentation of the disease is very heterogeneous, it can mimic the symptoms of many different disorders. Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters, and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring. Early detection and treatment protect patients from devastating organ damage. We describe an atypical case of Wilson's disease in a 23-year-old woman whose clinical picture suggested the presence of an insulin-secreting tumor.

The result is an accumulation of copper in multiple organs. The resulting clinical syndrome is mainly characterized by hepatic dysfunction. However, neurological and psychiatric symptoms are common and may be the first clinical manifestations. Although Wilson's disease is rare, psychiatrists should be aware of this diagnosis because, if treated early, the prognosis is favorable and persistent organ damage or fatal outcomes can often be avoided. Wilson's disease appears to be an important differential diagnosis, particularly in younger patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time.

2071,Wilson's disease: an update. [Korean],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport that causes copper accumulation primarily in the liver, brain, and cornea. WD is the most common hereditary liver disease with a prevalence of 1:37,000 in the pediatric population in Korea. Mutations in the ATP7B gene cause failure of copper excretion into bile and defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. To date, more than 300 mutations in the ATP7B gene have been described. Mutations differ between ethnic groups. p.R778L (an allele frequency of 37%), p.A874V (13%), p.L1083F (8%), and p.N1270S (6%) are the main common mutations in Korea. Conflicting results on the genotype/phenotype correlations of the most common mutations have been reported in several countries. There appears to be no correlation between the R778L mutation and age of onset or clinical manifestations in Korean patients. None of the laboratory parameters alone allows for a definitive diagnosis of WD. In a national survey of WD, low serum ceruloplasmin (<20 mg/dL), high 24-hour urine copper (>100 micrograms), high liver copper content (>250 micrograms/g dry liver), and Kayser rings -Fleischer were found in 96%, 86%, 88%, and 73% of the 550 Korean patients, respectively. A combination of any two of the 4 laboratory findings above is strong support for a diagnosis of WD. During the last few years, genetic testing has played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of WD. Direct DNA sequencing confirmed WD in 98% of Korean patients. Two mutations were detected in 70% and one mutation in 28% of patients showing biochemical and clinical findings characteristic of WD. Genetic testing, either by haplotype analysis or by mutation analysis, is the only reliable tool to differentiate heterozygous carriers from affected asymptomatic patients. The agents of first choice between chelators and zinc in specific clinical situations of WD remain a matter of debate. Because of the frequent side effects and initial neurological deterioration of penicillamine therapy, the less toxic trientine or zinc has gradually replaced penicillamine in recent years. Trientine or tetrathiomolybdate have been increasingly recommended as first-line treatment for neurological WE. Currently, liver transplantation is not recommended as the primary treatment for neurological WD.

2072,Reversible dementias and treatable dementias. [Spanish],"Introduction. In the study of patients with dementia, the search for reversible or treatable entities plays a fundamental role. Many patients do not recover the previous cognitive level; however, that does not mean that the disease is not treatable with partial recovery or prevention of secondary progression. Developing. The prevalence of reversible dementias is around 15% in most series. Routine studies include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolyte and chemistry panel, liver function tests, serum vitamin B<inf>12</inf> and folate levels, urinalysis, and syphilis serology. Depending on the patient's clinical profile, special tests such as thyroid function tests, protein electrophoresis, human immunodeficiency virus serology, serum heavy metal levels, electrocardiography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and chest X-ray should be performed. Neuroimaging should be performed in all cases. A CT scan without contrast should be performed first. MRI is more useful for looking for more subtle structural abnormalities. Electroencephalogram, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography are not recommended as routine studies. Brain biopsy is indicated in few cases. Conclusion. The most common causes of reversible and treatable dementias include: medications, obstructive hydrocephalus, infectious, vascular, immunological, psychiatric, toxic and metabolic disorders, among others.

2073,Patient with Sanfilippo syndrome type B and Wilson's disease born to unrelated parents. [Japanese],"5-year-old boy presented to a hospital with macrocephaly, mental retardation, and liver dysfunction, and Wilson's disease was suspected since his father had Wilson's disease. Serum ceruloplasmin level was low, but urinary copper excretion was not markedly increased. He was treated with D-penicillamine. He was subsequently referred to our hospital for his facial features suggestive of mucopolysaccharidosis. Based on mucopolysacchariduria and N-acetylglucosaminidase deficiency, a diagnosis of Sanfilippo syndrome type B was made. Molecular analyzes identified it as compound heterozygous for the ATP7B (A844V/2659delG) and alpha -N-acetylglucosaminidase (V241M) genes. /R482W), responsible for Wilson's disease and Sanfilippo syndrome type B, respectively.

2076,B<inf>6</inf>-responsive disorders: a model of vitamin dependence,"Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor for more than 100 enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. There are several different mechanisms that lead to an increased need for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) inborn errors affecting B<inf>6</inf> vitamer metabolism pathways; (ii) inborn errors leading to accumulation of small molecules that react with pyridoxal phosphate and inactivate it; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) celiac disease, which is thought to lead to malabsorption of B<inf>6</inf> vitamers; (v) renal dialysis, which leads to increased losses of vitamin B<inf>6</inf> from the circulation; (vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of B<inf>6</inf> vitamers; and (vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. The latter show a highly variable degree of response to pyridoxine, from 90% in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (delta-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency) to 50% in homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency) to 5% in ornithinemia with gyrate atrophy (ornithine delta-aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during the folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High doses of pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can have deleterious side effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this should be taken into account in treatment regimens. However, in some patients, particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate may be life-saving, and in other infants with B<inf>6</inf> inborn errors of metabolism, treatment may be extremely beneficial.

2077,Zinc Requirements and the Risks and Benefits of Zinc Supplementation,"The adult human being contains 2-3 g of zinc, approximately 0.1% of which is replenished daily. On this basis and based on zinc bioavailability estimates, dietary recommendations are made for apparently healthy individuals. The absence of chemical, functional and/or physical signs of zinc deficiency is assumed to be indicative of sufficiency. More specific data are rarely available. Changes in food preferences and availability, and new food preparation, preservation, and processing technologies may require a re-evaluation of past data. Conservative estimates suggest that {greater than or biased equal to} 25% of the world's population is at risk of zinc deficiency. Most of those affected are poor and rarely consume foods rich in highly bioavailable zinc, subsisting on foods rich in zinc absorption inhibitors and/or containing relatively small amounts of bioavailable zinc. In contrast, among the relatively well-off, food choice is an important factor affecting the risk of zinc deficiency. An additional problem, especially among the relatively wealthy, is the risk of chronic zinc toxicity caused by excessive consumption of zinc supplements. High intakes of zinc relative to copper can cause copper deficiency. A major unresolved challenge to maximum health benefit is the proximity of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Reference Dose (RfD) for a safe intake of zinc. Current recommendations do not consider the many dietary factors that influence the bioavailability of zinc and copper, and the potential for toxicity of zinc supplements. Therefore, the current assumed range between safe and unsafe intakes of zinc is relatively narrow. Currently, the evaluation of zinc nutrition is complex and involves a series of chemical and functional measurements that have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This approach needs to be improved so that zinc deficiency or excess can be detected early. An increasing number of associations between disease and zinc status and apparently normal health states, in which additional zinc might be effective in preventing certain conditions, point to the pharmacology of zinc compounds as a promising area . For example, the links between zinc and diabetes mellitus are one area where research could bear fruit. In our opinion, a multidisciplinary approach is most likely to be successful in this fertile area for translational research. Â© 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",,"Maret, W.;Sandstead, H.

2079,Non-surgical potentially reversible dementias. [Spanish],"Goals. In this study, we review dementias that are potentially reversible. The work summarizes the causes that essentially require medical management, while the surgical causes will be treated in a second article. These works try to avoid wrong diagnoses and labels in patients with a high potential for improvement of their cognitive disorder and guide us towards a more appropriate management. Developing. Dementia is a public health problem, mainly in countries with a long life expectancy. It has an incidence of 3-11% in patients older than 65 years, and 20-50% in those older than 85 years. The majority (50-70%) have Alzheimer-type dementia, followed by the vascular type (20%); there is a lower percentage of cases of the so-called subcortical dementias and also those secondary to medical and/or surgical conditions that suggest a potential reversibility. These latter cases are not easy to recognize and their incidence, depending on the series, ranges between 0 and 37%. Once they have been diagnosed, it is still difficult to say whether they will in fact be reversible. Its most frequent causes, such as deficiencies, metabolic disorders, chronic diseases, toxins, etc., must be detected as soon as possible, which can be done through clinical observation and the use of the laboratory. Conclusions. Although the potential for improvement in patients diagnosed with reversible dementia is still under discussion, this brief review guides us in the search for its causes and its management, since it is very likely that late detection and management are the cause of a bad evolution. .

Here we evaluate the effect of copper accumulation in the tx mouse on zinc and iron metabolism. Concentrations of copper, zinc, and iron were determined in the liver, kidney, spleen, and brain of control and copper-loaded animals by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Copper concentration increased dramatically in the liver and was also significantly higher in the spleen, kidney, and brain of control tx mice in the first months of life compared to normal DL mice. Liver zinc increased with age in the tx mouse, but zinc concentrations in the other organs were normal. Liver and kidney iron concentrations were significantly lower at birth in tx mice, but increased rapidly to be comparable with control mice at 2 months of age. Iron concentration in the spleen was significantly higher in tx mice, but lower in 5-day-old tx pups. Copper loading studies showed that normal DL mice that ingested 300 mg/L of copper in their diet for 3 months maintained normal levels of copper, zinc, and iron in liver, kidney, and brain. Copper loading of tx mice did not increase the already high copper concentrations in the liver, but it did increase copper concentrations in the spleen and brain. Despite a significant elevation of copper in the brain of copper-loaded tx mice, no behavioral changes were observed. The livers of copper-loaded tx mice had a lower zinc concentration than control tx mice, while the kidney had twice the iron concentration, suggesting that there was greater erythrocyte hemolysis in the copper-loaded mutants. copper.

2084,Treatment of liver fibrosis: reversal of the underlying disease process,"Cirrhosis is considered an irreversible end stage of all liver diseases. Current knowledge indicates that fibrosis is part of the liver repair process, which is dynamic. Understanding this repair process will provide better approaches to stop, ameliorate, or reverse fibrosis. Currently, the diagnosis of cirrhosis is established by liver biopsy and, in most advanced cases, can be confirmed by imaging studies. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard, but it has several limitations: sampling error, biopsy size, and interobserver and intraobserver inconsistencies. Therefore, many patients may be misclassified by the degree of fibrosis on their initial biopsy as well as on subsequent reexamination. Although a decrease of 1 stage between consecutive biopsies may be the result of sampling error, the reduction of cirrhosis by at least 2 stages probably represents a reversal of cirrhosis. There are several cases of reversal of cirrhosis reported in association with different liver diseases. Resolution of fibrosis in most of these diseases is related to successful treatment of the underlying etiology (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, iron overload, Wilson's disease, alcohol withdrawal, metabolic syndrome in Alzheimer's disease). of fatty liver and decompression of biliary obstruction). The other important feature of cirrhosis reversal is successful control of inflammation (eg, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis B, C, and D).",,"Servin-Abad, L.;Schiff, E.

The most important part of the diagnostic process is often the act of considering metabolic liver disease as a possible cause of the symptoms. Chronic liver disease has several possible phenotypes, and a variety of metabolic diseases can explain them. A logical approach is to first define the phenotype and then consider indicators that might suggest metabolic disease. These could include family history, the relationship of symptoms to eating or fasting, and possible dietary precipitants. Specific diagnosis will generally depend on selecting laboratory tests logically, having defined the phenotype and considered possible metabolic causes.

2089,Wilson's disease: Forms of presentation in childhood. [Spanish],"Wilson's disease can manifest with symptoms of liver disease or neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adults. This autosomal recessive disorder is caused by a disorder of copper metabolism due to a mutation in the ATP7B transporter. Excessive amounts of copper accumulate in the body due to inhibition of copper release in the bile. Because effective treatment is available, it is very important to recognize this disease in presymptomatic or early stages, when it can be reversed. Diagnosis is usually easy, but the available tests (measurement of ceruloplasmin and copper levels in blood, urine, and liver) can be misleading. There is no single test that is 100% sensitive in detection and neither test, when used alone, provides 100% specificity. Currently, diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical findings and laboratory test results.

2091,Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper overload. A main characteristic of this disease is its wide phenotypic and genotypic variability. It is the result of mutations in the ATP 7B gene located on chromosome 13, which encodes a hepatic copper transport protein. More than 300 mutations of this gene have been identified. This protein ensures the transport of copper in the hepatocyte, its incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and its biliary excretion. The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous both in their presentation, dominated by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms, and in the age of the first symptoms. Early recognition and initiation of chelation or zinc therapy are essential for prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in cases of fulminant hepatitis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and should be considered in neurological forms resistant to therapy. Regular follow-up with monitoring of adverse effects of treatment and compliance is essential. Any suspension of the treatments will suppose, in a very variable time, but in a constant way, a reappearance or an aggravation of the symptoms. These relapses are often brutal and can be extremely serious, especially as the response to subsequent treatment is often poor.

The effect induced by the drug depends on the affinity of the drug molecule for its specific receptor. For chiral receptors such as receptor proteins, the chirality of the interacting molecule plays an important role in defining biological activity towards the molecule's affinity for the receptor and subsequent drug action. The biological activity of a racemate is in most cases the contribution of one active enantiomer while the other enantiomer may be an unwanted product. In some cases, different enantiomers may have different activities. Therefore, a recent trend in drug development is the use of the active enantiomer as a drug to avoid unnecessarily loading the body with the inactive or undesirable ingredient.

All LEC rats, regardless of treatment, exhibited greater locomotor activity, less habituation to the startle response, or lower PPI, compared with Wistar rats. The copper content of all brain regions examined, except the medulla oblongata of LEC rats, was significantly lower than that of Wistar rats. In addition, lower norepinephrine content and higher dopamine and serotonin content were observed in the striatum and nucleus accumbens region of LEC rats compared to Wistar rats. Although copper supplementation did not affect brain copper content, it reduced PPI in Wistar and LEC rats. In contrast, d-penicillamine supplementation decreased both brain copper content and locomotor activity and improved startle amplitude only in Wistar rats.

The antitumor activity of copper complexes was reported several decades ago, and many newer complexes have shown great antitumor potential. Copper complexes may have relatively fewer side effects than platinum-based drugs, and it is suggested that they may overcome inherited or acquired resistance to cisplatin. In this overview, the most recent advances in copper homeostasis, copper-related chelation therapy, and the design of copper-based antitumor complexes will be summarized.

2105,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate - IV. Comparison of Tetrathiomolybdate and Trientine in a Double-Blind Study of the Treatment of the Neurological Presentation of Wilson's Disease,"Objective: to compare tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in the treatment of patients with neurological presentation of Wilson's disease in terms of the frequency of neurological worsening, adverse effects and the degree of neurological recovery. Design: A randomized, double-blind, controlled, 2-arm study of 48 patients with the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease. Patients received trientine hydrochloride 500 mg 2 times daily or tetrathiomolybdate 20 mg 3 times daily with meals and 20 mg 3 times daily between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received 50 mg of zinc 2 times a day. The patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with weekly evaluation of neurological and speech function; discharged taking 50 mg zinc 3 times daily, returning annually for follow-up. Setting: reference setting of a university hospital. Patients: Mainly newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms who have not been treated for more than 4 weeks with an anti-copper drug. Intervention: Treatment with trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. Main outcome measures: Neurological function was assessed using semi-quantitative speech and neurological examinations. Adverse drug events were assessed using blood cell counts and biochemical measures. Results: Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm had neurological deterioration (P < 0.05). Three patients who received tetrathiomolybdate had side effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had more transaminase elevations. One patient who received trientine had an adverse effect of anemia. Four patients who received trientine died during follow-up, 3 of whom showed initial neurological deterioration. Neurological and speech recovery during a 3-year follow-up period was quite good. Conclusion: Tetrathiomolybdate is a better option than trientine to preserve neurological function in patients with neurological disease. Â©2006 American Medical Association.

2106,Genetic disorders of copper metabolism. [Japanese],"Genetic disorders of copper metabolism primarily in Menkes disease and Wilson disease were reviewed. Menkes disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7A gene and shows X-linked inheritance. In this disease, copper absorption in the intestine is impaired, resulting in copper deficiency. Clinical features, including neurological degeneration, connective tissue abnormalities, and hair abnormalities, appear at the age of 2 to 3 months. Serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin are significantly low, while the concentration of copper is very high in cultured fibroblasts. The accepted treatment so far is the parenteral administration of copper. When treatment is started during the neonatal periods, neurological degeneration could be prevented. Wilson's disease, caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, shows autosomal recessive inheritance and the prevalence rate is high. This disease is associated with the toxic effects of accumulated copper in many tissues, including the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea. Serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin are significantly low, while the concentration of copper is very high in the liver. Diagnosis is made by findings of increased urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper accumulation. Gene analysis is also available for diagnosis. All patients should be treated with chelating agents or zinc. However, some patients with neurological disorders show a poor response to these treatments. Furthermore, these treatments are ineffective in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Liver transplantation is now accepted in these patients. In these patients too, the abnormalities can be prevented by early treatment with chelating agents or zinc. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are more important for Menkes disease and Wilson disease.",,"Kodama, H.",2006,January,,0,0,

[Chinese],"Objective: To review the clinical and autopsy neuropathological changes in a patient with Menkes disease who was misdiagnosed as Wilson's disease, and to reveal the clinical and neuropathological differences between these two diseases. Methods and Results: An 8-year-old girl progressively presented lower limb weakness, multiple joint deformities, ulnar drift deformity in both hand and claw, osteoporosis, lead-pipe rigidity of the limbs, tremor, dysphasia, and mental retardation. He presented high palatal arch, gingival bleeding, nosebleed and urinary retention, etc. Physical examination: the patient cannot perform the alternating test of both hands, heel-knee-tibia, finger-nose, and presents a pyramidal sign. Laboratory test: serum ceruloplasmin was 0.02 mumol/L. Clinical diagnosis: Hepatolenticular degeneration (also called Wilson's disease) complicated by osteopathy. Treated with D-penicillamine (0.3 g) orally 3/d. Signs and symptoms progressively deteriorated. He died at the age of 16. Neuropathological results of the autopsy: the cerebral parenchyma presented extensive atrophy, the bilateral subcortical white matter of the frontoparietal lobe showed severe atrophy, degeneration and cavitation. Light microscope observation: No obvious changes were observed in the basal ganglia tissue. Irregular vascular lumens and shrinkage of the endangium can occasionally be found. In the cortex, granule cell layer neurons were markedly reduced and the white matter showed extensive demyelinated degeneration with vesicle formation. Massive astrocytes, phagocytes, ectopic neurons, and satellite cells proliferated, without infiltration of perivascular inflammatory cells. No neuron loss or necrosis was observed in the head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus, but satellite cells around neurons were markedly increased. There were many activated microglial cells. The deposit can be found in neurons in the tail of the caudate nucleus. Opaski cells and type II Alzheimer cells were not observed. Characteristic changes in the cerebellum were as follows: residual Purkinje cells exhibited obvious abnormal dendritic arborization (called ""weeping willow""), increased perisomatic processes, and focal axonal swelling (""torpedoes""); and Purkinje cells deposited in the granule cell layer. Conclusion: 1) Menkes disease could be seen in women and could appear in childhood or early adulthood. 2) There is an important massive white matter degeneration, necrosis and cavitation. The basal ganglia construct that remains fairly well is inconsistent with the clinical signs and symptoms. Markedly reduced neurons in the granule cell layer of the cortex. Cerebellar Purkinje cells emerge from abnormal dendritic arborization. These are all characteristic presentations of Menkes disease.",,"Gao, J.;Guo, Y. P.;Gao, S. F.;Zhang, Z. X.;Huang, H. F.;Ren, H.

His general cognitive functions were below the level for his age and he was diagnosed with dysphasia. The boy was transferred to a special class for children with learning disabilities. Three months later he was referred to us again due to acute epigastric pain. The only abnormal laboratory finding was a slightly elevated level of alanine aminotransferase. Although the symptoms disappeared within a few days, the transaminase levels remained above normal for the next 6 months. Subsequent diagnostic workup revealed a low serum ceruloplasmin level and a high 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Liver copper concentration in the liver biopsy was high (2900 Âµg/g dry weight), confirming the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Brain MRI showed slight changes in the white matter. The patient's asymptomatic sister was also diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Both brothers began penicillamine therapy and a copper-restricted diet. The copper content of the household water was found to be above average and a new plumbing system was installed. After 1 year from the start of therapy, transaminase levels normalized and both brothers were symptom-free. After 2 years of therapy, the patient was able to return to normal school.

In the first movement, the neurological symptoms were misinterpreted as a side effect of haloperidol, but the consulted neurologist suggested an additional diagnostic procedure that confirmed Wilson's disease. Psychiatric symptoms and abnormal involuntary movements were the clinical manifestation of this disease, which improved with neuroleptic and chelation treatment. The interdisciplinary approach with a good collaboration of psychiatrists and neurologists is crucial for Wilson's disease, because early diagnosis and immediate treatment are essential for prognosis. This case serves as a reminder that involuntary movements can be a side effect of antipsychotics, but also the clinical manifestation of some diseases, for example Wilson's, Huntington's and Fuhr's diseases.

2114,Hereditary metabolic liver disease,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The last decade has seen a significant growth in understanding of the molecular machinery involved in the pathogenesis of genetic hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. This year has seen further progress in elaborating on the molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology and management of these inherited metabolic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Both Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis involve defects in heavy metal transport and accumulation in hepatocytes. In alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, intrahepatocyte accumulation of defective alpha1-antitrypsin occurs. As a more complete picture of the molecular biology of the proteins and genes involved in transport has evolved, so has our understanding of their interactions. The molecular genetics of these diseases explains the different phenotypes observed. Finally, the elucidation of the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases has given rise to new ideas in their clinical management. ABSTRACT: The recent developments detailed in this article have important implications for the future. Recent research has gracefully shifted the paradigm in our understanding to one focused on defects in the cell's genetic machinery and how a better understanding of these defects can lead to potential new therapies.

2116,Comparison of the reduction of copper levels with tetrathiomolybdate and zinc in mouse tumor models and doxorubicin,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), presumably by reducing copper levels and availability, has shown excellent efficacy in animal models of cancer and injury models producing fibrotic or inflammatory damage in the lungs, heart, and liver. Trials in human patients are ongoing. If the efficacy of MT is indeed through lowering copper levels, other anti-copper drugs should be equally effective. Zinc is an anti-copper drug, with proven efficacy in Wilson's disease, a disease of copper toxicity. In this study, the efficacy of zinc is compared to TM in a mouse tumor model and in the doxorubicin model of heart damage, and it is hypothesized that when copper availability is reduced to an equivalent degree, 2 drugs would show equivalent efficacy. No effect of zinc is found on inhibiting tumor growth that is markedly inhibited by TM, and zinc is found to be less effective than TM in inhibiting cardiac damage caused by doxorubicin. This study shows that the mechanism of action of TM in protecting against doxorubicin toxicity is due to its anti-copper effects, since copper supplementation abolished the protective effect of TM. There is also a hypothesis that the differences between TM and zinc may be due to TM's mechanism of action in which it binds to copper already in the body, while zinc does not. Â© 2006 Mosby, Inc.

2119,Metabolic diseases of the liver. [Croatian],"The most common metabolic liver diseases are Wilson's disease (WD), hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to its accumulation in the body, resulting in a number of potential hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric sequelae. Hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disease in white people of Northern European descent. Features of iron overload are often unrecognized and diagnosed only in the setting of advanced disease. If left untreated, WD and hemochromatosis are fatal conditions. On the other hand, patients detected early and treated with copper/iron reduction therapy, including penicillamine/phlebotomy, may have a normal life expectancy. Given the genetic basis of the condition, it is vital that counseling and evaluation of the patient's first-degree relatives take place.

2120,X-ray fluorescence microprobe imaging in biology and medicine,"Characteristic X-ray fluorescence is a technique that can be used to establish elemental concentrations for a large number of different chemical elements simultaneously at different locations in cell and tissue samples. Exposure of samples to an X-ray beam is the basis of X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). This technique provides excellent sensitivity to trace elements; and, due to the great depth of penetration of hard X-rays, an opportunity to image whole cells and quantify elements per cell. Additionally, because samples prepared for XFM do not require cutting, they can be investigated close to their natural hydrated state with cryogenic approaches. Until several years ago, XFM was not widely available to biomedical communities and rarely offered resolution better than several microns. This has changed dramatically with the development of third generation synchrotrons. Recent examples of elemental imaging of cells and tissues show the maturation of XFM imaging into an elegant and informative way of gaining insight into cellular processes. Future XFM Developments: Construction of new XFM facilities with higher resolution, higher sensitivity, or higher throughput will further advance studies of the native elemental composition of cells and provide the biological community, including the emerging area of bionanotechnology, with a perfectly suitable tool for monitoring the distribution of metals, including nanovectors, and measuring the results of interactions between nanovectors and living cells and tissues.

2121,Wilson's disease: an update for clinical biochemists,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a member of a family of genetic disorders characterized by abnormalities in copper metabolism. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, and mutations lead to dysfunction of a key copper transporter protein, the p-type ATPase ATP-7B. The consequence is the accumulation of copper in susceptible tissues, particularly in the liver and basal ganglia of the brain, which in turn can lead to symptomatic liver and/or neuropsychiatric disease. Patients with liver disease tend to present in the first two decades of life, while those with primary neurological manifestations tend to present later. Presentation with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatic decompensation may require liver transplantation. Hemolytic disease is a rare presenting symptom. Although laboratory investigations have traditionally focused on the measurement of free and total copper and serum ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper levels with and without penicillamine challenge, recent reports demonstrate that genotyping studies may play a role. in the diagnosis and characterization of WD. Radiocopper uptake studies have fallen out of favor, but a new approach using stable isotopes shows promise. Treatment focuses on limiting copper accumulation, using penicillamine. Zinc acetate or trientine offer alternatives if penicillamine is not tolerated. Although untreated WD is inevitably fatal, the prognosis is generally good once the diagnosis is made, and it is this that calls for a high index of clinical suspicion in cases where unexplained liver or neurological disease is present. children or in adults under 45 years of age. year old.",,"Chaloner, C.",2006,,,0,0,

2126,Extrapyramidal symptoms in Wilson's disease are associated with olfactory dysfunction,"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper, primarily in the liver and brain. Since the accumulation of copper in the brain causes alterations in the function of the basal ganglia, neurological patients usually present with hypo- and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal symptoms, with parkinsonism being very common. Although there are numerous reports of olfactory deficits in primary neurodegenerative disorders, olfactory function has not been investigated in metabolic disorders presenting with extrapyramidal features. Twenty-four patients with Wilson's disease participated in the investigation. All patients were treated pharmacologically. They included patients with liver disease alone (including mild enzyme elevations in asymptomatic individuals; n = 11) and/or neurological symptoms (n = 13) at the time of testing. Twenty-one patients underwent positron emission tomography with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging nuclear (magnetic resonance). The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was judged using a clinical scoring system ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). Psychophysical tests using the ""Sniff Sticks"" were performed on all patients, including tests for odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. The results of the present study revealed that Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms show significant olfactory dysfunction compared to liver-type patients. People with more severe neurological involvement also have a more pronounced olfactory deficit. Of interest, there was no significant effect of long-term penicillamine treatment on olfactory function. Olfactory function did not correlate significantly with the presence of MRI-visible lesions in the basal ganglia or with any regional glucose metabolism measured by [18] FDG-PET. In conclusion, these findings indicate that underlying pathological changes with basal ganglia degeneration and neuronal loss in association with a marked increase in copper content in this brain region play a role in the olfactory deficit.

2127,Clinical and genetic profile in Wilson's disease: Report of a case with family pedigree. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in copper accumulation in many organs. The Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring represents a typical symptom in Wilson's patients. ATP7B, the gene product of the Wilson's disease gene, is expressed in hepatocytes and plays a critical role in copper transport and secretion. Mutations encompassing this gene that lead to amino acid substitutions reduce the affinity of the enzyme ATPase for copper and prevent transport of copper through hepatocytes into the bile duct. More than 200 mutations have been described in the 21 coding exons of the ATP7B gene in Wilson's disease, with the European His1069Gln being the most common (30-60% in European patients). Wilson's disease can present with various clinical symptoms, commonly including liver and neuropsychiatric disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease (prevalence 1:30,000) is based on a combination of clinical and neurological symptoms (Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring, MRI), a multiparametric clinical chemistry panel (ceruloplasmin, 24-h copper excretion in urine, serum copper) and molecular genetic analysis of ATP7B gene mutations. Symptomatic patients are treated with the chelating agents D-penicillamine or trientine and, in a second phase, often with zinc. Lifelong therapy is required and provides a near-normal life expectancy. Here, we report the long-term follow-up of a 30-year-old Wilson patient showing compound heterozygosity for His1069Gln - Asn1270Ser mutations in the ATP7B gene as diagnosed by LightCycler real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. of exon 18 DNA. Molecular family pedigree analysis over four generations revealed seven additional heterozygous mutation carriers. Treatment of the index patient with high doses of the chelating agent D-penicillamine (1500 mg/d) in combination with zinc (150 mg/d) could revert copper encephalopathy to normal and markedly reduce neurological symptoms. The Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring was persistent. Wilson's disease should be considered for any liver disease of unknown origin or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Current diagnostic panels (international scoring system) encompassing clinical chemistry and molecular genetics for detection and confirmation of Wilson's disease are discussed.",,"Noppen, C.;Aerne-Wyrsch, L.;Wyrschs, J.;Viollier, E.

Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation was carried out on 100 patients (57 men, 43 women; mean age 19.3 +/- 8.9 years) using standard protocols. All but 18 patients were on copper agents. Their history, clinical manifestations, and disease severity scores were noted. Results: The mean duration of disease and treatment was 8.3+/-10.8 years and 7.5+/-7.1 years, respectively. Brain MRI was abnormal in all 93 symptomatic patients. The most conspicuous observations were atrophy of the cerebrum (70%), brainstem (66%), and cerebellum (52%). Signal abnormalities were also noted: putamen (72%), caudate (61%), thalamus (58%), midbrain (49%), pons (20%), cerebral white matter (25%), cortex (9% ), medulla (12%) and cerebellum (10%). Characteristic T2-W pallidal globus hypointensity (34%), ""giant panda face"" sign (12%), T1-W striatal hyperintensity (6%), central pontine myelinosis (7%), and bright claustral sign (4%). ) were also detected. MRI changes correlated with disease severity scores (P<0.001), but did not correlate with disease duration. Conclusion: MRI changes were universal but diverse and involved nearly all brain structures in symptomatic patients. A good correlation between MRI observations and various clinical features provides an explanation for the protein manifestations of the disease. Â© Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"Sinha, S.;Taly, A.

2135,Effect of D-penicillamine on rat lung elastin crosslinking during the perinatal period,"This study was designed to clarify the effects of D-penicillamine (DPA), a drug used for the treatment of various pathological events, on the formation of pulmonary elastin and the maturation of the newborn in the perinatal period. The research was carried out on 20 newborn rats reared from 40 female and six male rats. DPA doses of 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> and physiological saline solution were administered intraperitoneally (ip) to the experimental and control groups. To assess the maturation of the newborns, their body and lung weight were determined. Serum Cu levels were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and ceruloplasmin (Cp) activities were measured spectrophotometrically. The levels of elastin, desmosine (DES), and isodesmosine (IDES) in newborn lung tissue were measured by HPLC. The results showed that DPA treatment caused loss of skin elasticity and reduction of body and lung weight in the newborns of the experimental group. Serum Cu levels and Cp activity were found to be significantly lower in both the mother and the newborn of the experimental groups compared to the control group. DES, IDES, and lung elastin values of neonates in the experimental group were reduced compared to the control group. In conclusion, our results indicate that 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup> of DPA, a dose used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cystinuria, caused delayed maturation of the newborn, decreased DES-IDES cross-links and pulmonary elastin levels of offspring in the perinatal period. Another conclusion to be drawn from this study is that even low levels of Cu depletion due to DPA administration induce a change in pulmonary elastin crosslinking during the perinatal period.

2137,Importance of molecular genetic testing for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. [Czech],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper (Cu) transport with a frequency of 1:40,000 live births. The disease is caused by a deficiency of the copper transporting ATPase - ATP7B (13q14.3-q21.1). The disorder manifests as chronic liver disease and/or neurological impairment due to copper accumulation in various tissues, primarily the liver and brain. The most frequent manifestation of WD is between 8 and 20 years of age. Diagnosis consists of determination of serum ceruloplasmin and Cu, detection of Cu in 24-hour urine, penicillamine test, liver biopsy determining Cu content in hepatic dry weight, and DNA diagnosis, if available. Interpretation of changes in biochemical findings due to DNA analysis of mutations. So far there is no exact correlation between the patient's genotype and phenotype. Disease therapy is under development and is currently accepted for liver disease from infancy as standard therapy with chelates and zinc. In the final stage, the solution would be a liver transplant. The group included 22 children from 5 to 17 years of age. The first group (12) consisted of WD heterozygotes, siblings, or descendants of patients with WD confirmed by DNA diagnosis. The 2<sup>do</sup> group (10) were patients with hepatic form of WD, confirmed by DNA diagnosis and evaluation of copper content in hepatic dry weight. The control group consisted of 11 children aged 4 to 16 years. In 4 probands of the 1st group, i.e. 33.3%, the authors found that the blood ceruloplasmin level had decreased below 0.2 g/l (range between 0.12 and 0.43 g/l ). They demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) for serum CP between heterozygotes for WD; that is, between children of mothers with WD and siblings of probands with WD. Threshold levels of copper were determined in the basic urine collection of 4 children (ie, 0.6 mumol). The 24-hour urine copper level of 11 heterozygotes in the penicillamine test did not exceed 12.5 mumol. In 7 children of the 2nd group, the authors demonstrated a serum level of ceruloplasmin less than 0.2 g/l, that is, 70% (between 0.03 and 0.22 g/l). All 24-hour urine collections for copper contained elevated residues greater than 0.6 mumol (between 0.8 and 2.67 mumol). Contrary to expectations, levels greater than 1.6 mumol were detected in only 4 children. A statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was found in 24-hour urinary copper excretion between the control group of healthy children and the EW probands, also according to the sex of the investigated individuals. In the penicillamine test, urine Cu residue was less than 20 mumol (indicated as an extreme level for WD) in 8 probands. Urinary copper excretion after penicillamine administration does not contribute to the differentiation between heterozygotes and patients with WD. An important form of screening is the determination of liver dry weight copper content. However, the authors assume that the interpretation of these findings will change in the near future in view of the diagnosis of DNA mutations. According to these results, Kayser-Fleischer ring examinations in hepatic forms of early childhood are not very important. In a proband with the IVS12+1G>A/G1355C genotype, they found that the more severe the form of mutation demonstrated in a WD patient, the more severe the clinical course of the disease can be expected. A severe mutation in heterozygotes can mimic WD. The authors recorded an attack of anxiety disorder in a girl with the genotype H1069Q/W779X. In children with the H1069Q allele, they demonstrated minimal brain damage, graphomotor disability and slightly abnormal EEG in basic activity without clinical correlate.",,"Prochazkova, D.;Konecna, P.;Vrabelova, S.;Kozak, L.;Dastych, M.;Hrstkova, H.",2005,,,0,0,

2139,Wilson's illness in children: 37-year experience and King's review for liver transplantation,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare hepatic disorder of copper metabolism. The prognostic criteria described by our group in 1986 to predict death without a transplant have not been universally validated. Clinical characteristics of 88 children were reviewed, retrospectively on 74 and prospectively on 14. Data from retrospectively recruited patients who died or survived on long-term chelation were used to assess the validity of our old scoring system and design a new one. forecast index. , then evaluated in the 14 prospectively recruited patients. Using the old scoring system, 5 children with a score >= 7, the cutoff value for death without transplant, survived, while 4 with a score <= 7 died (87% sensitivity and 90% specificity). A new index based on serum bilirubin, international normalized ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and white blood cell count (WCC) at presentation identified a cutoff score of 11 for death and was shown to be 93% sensitive and 98% sensitive. % specific, with a positive result. 88% predictive value. When the new index was prospectively evaluated in 14 patients, it predicted the need for transplantation in only the 4 who required it, although 1 child with a score of 11 survived with medical treatment. In conclusion, the new Wilson index is more sensitive and specific for predicting mortality without transplantation than the old scoring system, but it needs to be validated in a larger number of patients.

2140,Wilson's disease with an initial manifestation of polyneuropathy,"Background: Recognition of Wilson's disease (WD) is sometimes difficult due to its various manifestations. Peripheral neuropathy is rarely reported in the setting of WD. Objective: To report an unusual patient with WD whose initial manifestation was peripheral neuropathy. Design: Case report. Setting: Department of Neurology in a tertiary referral center. Method: Personal observation. Outcome: A 17-year-old man, ultimately diagnosed with WD, was initially seen with polyneuropathy for at least 6 months before developing more typical symptoms of WD. Electrophysiological and pathological studies suggested a mixed-type neuropathy. Treatment for WD resulted in clinical and electrophysiological improvement.

2145,Liver transplant for Wilson's disease: the burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders,"retrospective analysis of liver transplant data for Wilson's disease (WD) among Italian liver transplant centers was performed. Thirty-seven cases were identified. The main indication for liver transplantation was advanced chronic liver disease in 78% of patients. Mixed liver and neuropsychiatric symptoms were recorded in 32.3%. Eight patients presented fulminant hepatic failure; 44.8% were receiving medical treatment. Patient and graft survival at 3 months, 12 months, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years after transplantation were, respectively, 91.8%, 89.1%, 82.9%, 75.6% and 58.8%, and 85.3%, 83.0%, 77.1%, 70.3% and 47.2%. Neurological symptoms improved significantly after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), but survival for patients with mixed neuropsychiatric and liver involvement was significantly lower than for patients with liver disease alone (P = 0.04). WD characterized only by liver involvement is a rare but good indication for liver transplantation when specific medical therapy fails. Patients with neuropsychiatric signs have a significantly shorter survival despite liver transplantation having a positive impact on neurological symptoms. In conclusion, a combination of hepatic and neuropsychiatric conditions deserves a careful neurological evaluation, which should contraindicate OLT in case of severe neurological deterioration.

2148,Role of animal models in the study of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions,"Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are a significant problem, largely due to their unpredictable nature. If we better understood the mechanisms of these reactions, they could be predictable. Its unpredictable nature also makes mechanistic studies very difficult, especially prospective clinical studies. Animal models are vital to most biomedical research and are almost the only way to test the basic hypotheses of DHRs, such as the involvement of reactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRs are also unpredictable in animals. For example. However, sulfonamide-induced DHRs in large breed dogs appear to be valid because they are very similar to DHRs that occur in humans. the incidence is only ~0.25%, and large breed dogs are difficult to use as animal models. Two other practical models are penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat and nevirapine-induced skin eruption in rats. The toxicity in these models is clearly mediated by the immune system. In other models, such as amodiaquine-induced agranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the drug induces an immune response but is not clinically toxic. This finding suggests that regulatory mechanisms often limit toxicity. Many of the basic features of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as memory and tolerance, are quite different, suggesting that the mechanisms are also significantly different. More animal models are needed to study the variety of mechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, progress in understanding such reactions is likely to be slow. Copyright Â©2003.

2149,"Essentiality, toxicology and zinc and copper chelation therapy","Both zinc and copper are essential minerals that are required for various cellular functions. Although these metals are essential, they can be toxic in excessive amounts, especially in certain genetic disorders. Zinc and copper homeostasis results from coordinated regulation by different proteins involved in the absorption, excretion, and intracellular storage/traffic of these metals. In addition to the zinc transporter (ZnT) and Cu-ATPase families, metallothionein is an important storage protein for zinc and copper. Metallothioneins are intracellular polypeptides with a remarkable ability to bind metal ions. These proteins bind both essential metals that are indispensable for the body and toxic metals (for example, cadmium or lead). Metallothioneins play a fundamental role in maintaining zinc and copper homeostasis. In this review, we summarize zinc and copper toxicity and potential treatment for zinc or copper toxicity by specific zinc or copper chelators: as well as the strategy to upregulate metallothionein.

2150,Hepatic Wilson's disease: initial treatment and long-term management,"This article is based on the experience of 320 patients with Wilson's disease who were cared for between 1954 and 2000. These patients were cared for at The Boston City Hospital, 1954 to 1955; University College Hospital, London, 1955 to 1957; Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1967 to 1987, and The Middlesex Hospital London, 1988 to 2000. Wilson's disease is not strictly a gastroenterological disease but rather a genetically determined metabolic disease that is mediated by a failure of copper excretion through the bile. The mutation carried on chromosome 13q14.3: involves a copper-bearing ATPase (ATPase 7B); now more than 250 mutations are known. The first organ affected is the liver, then many other tissues, mainly the brain but also the eyes, kidneys, bone marrow and the osteoskeletal system. It is with the hepatic form of the disease that this article is concerned. Liver disease can be acute, subacute, or chronic; It can be progressive or apparently self-limited. Hemolysis can also be found in 10% of patients which can later lead to the formation of pigment gallstones. The management of liver disease is not considered in this article, which is strictly limited to the therapeutic options available for copper removal and the long-term well-being of the patient. It should be remembered that all close relatives of the patient must be screened for the presymptomatic stage of the disease, so that if they are homozygous carriers of the mutation, preventive treatment can be started.

2151,"Inhibitory effects of trientine, a copper chelating agent, on the induction of DNA strand breaks in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat kidney cells.","The effects of treatment with trientine, a specific copper chelating agent, on copper accumulation and induction of DNA strand breaks were investigated in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model for human Wilson's disease. Copper accumulated in the kidneys of LEC rats in an age-dependent manner from 12 to 18 weeks of age. When LEC rats were treated with trientine starting at 10 weeks of age, renal copper content did not increase and remained at the same levels as in LEC rats at 4 weeks of age. Estimation of the amounts of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) by comet assay showed that DNA SSBs were induced in a substantial population of LEC rat renal cortex cells at around 12 weeks of age and that the amounts of SSB increased in an age-dependent manner. way from 12 to 18 weeks of age. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, the observed number of cells with DNA damage decreased, suggesting that SSB induction of DNA was inhibited and/or SSBs were repaired during the period of treatment. trientine treatment. The results show that DNA SSBs in LEC rat kidney cells are induced before clinical signs of liver damage appear and that treatment of LEC rats with trientine decreases the number of DNA strand breaks.

2152,Homozygosity for a macroscopic partial gene deletion of the C-terminus of ATP7B in a Wilson patient with hepatic manifestations and without neurological manifestations,"We identified a partial deletion of the ATP7B gene in a patient with liver-onset Wilson's disease. The deletion covered exon 20, including important parts of the flanking introns. Breakpoints were identified and the deletion size was determined to be 2144 bp. The deletion is predicted to lead to a mutated protein product containing an aberrant 45 amino acids after the 7-transmembrane domain and lacking the 8-transmembrane domain as well as the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. This is the first time that a partial deletion of a gene in ATP7B has been demonstrated. The patient presented at age 10 years with liver manifestations, including severe jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and spider naevus. Liver biopsy showed fibrosis and early signs of cirrhosis. There was a Kayser-Fleischer ring but no neurological manifestations. All symptoms resolved with penicillamine therapy. This suggests that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of ATP7B is not essential for its neurological function. Large deletions in ATP7B may be an overlooked cause of Wilson's disease. Patients who are homozygous for deletions may be valuable in understanding the function of various regions of the ATP7B protein. Â© 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Moller, L.

The objective of this study is to increase knowledge of a probably underdiagnosed syndrome. Clinical recognition of the syndrome in infants and children with and without HSCR is important for patient selection for cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Methods. The clinical characteristics of four Italian patients are reported. FISH and mutational analyzes were performed. The evaluation of psychomotor development was carried out using the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (DDTS II). Results. All four patients had ZFHX1B gene mutations; patients 1, 3 and 4 showed novel mutations, never before described. The clinical characteristics of our patients were compared with those of the literature. The most frequent malformations were CRHS (62.8%), congenital heart disease (50.7%), agenesis of the corpus callosum (45.6%). Hypospadias was present in 46.2% of the patients. Seizures were very frequent (75.0%). Conclusions. Mowat-Wilson syndrome is well recognizable, like the classic genetic syndromes, by the distinct facial phenotype, associated malformations, seizures, microcephaly, and severe mental retardation. Confirmation of the diagnosis by the presence of mutations in the ZFHX1B gene is important for genetic counseling since all the patients reported to date have been sporadic findings, although the possibility of gonadal mosaicism cannot be ruled out.",,"Cerruti Mainardi, P.;Garavelli, L.;Pastore, G.;Virdis, R.;Pedori, S.;Godi, M.;Provera, S.;Rauch, A.;Zweier, C.;Castronovo, C.;Zollino, M.;Banchini, G.;Bernasconi, S.;Neri, G.",2005,April,,0,0,
2154,EMG and motor magnetic evoked potentials in patients with Wilson's disease,"Four patients with Wilson's disease (WD) were examined, mean age 37.5 years; and with disease duration between 2 and 6 years. Diagnosis was made on the basis of examination of copper metabolism with significant 24-h urine copper levels, neurological status, head CT, liver involvement, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring. All patients underwent a complex EMG examination: blink reflex (BR), cranial and spinal motor magnetic evoked potentials (MEP), and nerve conduction velocities (NCV) of the extremities. The first 3 patients (2 women and 1 man) were examined before starting d-penicillamine therapy and the last patient, a 25-year-old woman with WD of 12 years of evolution, after 2 years of treatment with Cuprenil. All patients had normal spinal NCV and MEP. BR and cranial MEPs were abnormal in 3 untreated patients. The patient with permanent treatment showed almost normal parameters, except for reduced amplitudes of the cranial MEPs. Although our results are preliminary and insufficient for a firm conclusion and statistical analysis, they suggest that, by applying specific electrophysiological methods, we could determine clinically latent dysfunctions of the central motor neuron, pyramidal tracts, and brainstem in WD. There is evidence that some parameters of these tests could be additionally useful in monitoring treatment.",,"Klissurski, M. G.;Muradyan, N.;Novachkova, S.;Vassileva, E.;Ishpekova, B.",2005,,,0,0,
2155,Risk and benefit of drug use during pregnancy,"Environmental teratogenic factors (eg alcohol) can be prevented. We focus our analysis on human teratogenic drugs that are not frequently used during pregnancy. Previous human teratogenic studies had serious methodological problems, for example, the first trimester concept is outdated because environmental teratogens cannot induce congenital abnormalities in the first month of gestation. In addition, teratogens often cause specific congenital anomalies or syndromes. Finally, the importance of chemical structures, routes of administration and reasons for treatment in the evaluation of drugs was not considered. On the other hand, in so-called epidemiological case-control studies, in general, recall bias was not limited. These biases explain why the teratogenic risk of drugs is exaggerated, while the benefit of drug use during pregnancy is underestimated. Therefore, a better balance between the risk and benefit of pharmacological treatments during pregnancy is needed. Of course, we have to do everything possible to reduce the risk of teratogenic drugs as much as possible, however, it is worth emphasizing the preventive effect of drugs for maternal diseases (for example, diabetes mellitus and hyperthermia) related to congenital anomalies.

2156,Zinc supplementation decreases hepatic copper accumulation in LEC rats: a model of Wilson's disease,"The effect of dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on copper (Cu)-induced liver damage was investigated in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, a model for Wilson's disease (WD). Four-week-old LEC (N=64) and control Long-Evans (LE) (N=32) female rats were divided into two groups; one group was fed a Zn-supplemented diet (group I) and the other received a normal rodent diet (group II). LEC rats were sacrificed at 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 20 weeks of age; LE control rats were sacrificed at 6, 12, 18 and 20 weeks of age. Liver Cu concentration was reduced in LEC rats fed a Zn-supplemented diet compared to LEC rats fed a normal diet between 6 and 18 weeks of age. The concentration of metallothionein (MT) in the liver of LEC group I rats increased between 12 and 20 weeks of age, while the liver concentration of MT in LEC group II rats decreased after 12 weeks. Hepatocyte apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL, was reduced in Zn-supplemented LEC rats at all ages. Cholangiocellular carcinoma was observed only in LEC rats in group II at week 20. These results suggest that Zn supplementation may reduce hepatic Cu concentration and delay the onset of clinical and pathological changes of Cu toxicity in LEC rats. Although the actual mechanism of protection is unknown, it could be explained by the sequestration of Cu from the diet by intestinal MT, induced by the high content of Zn in the diet.

2157,Genetic disorders of copper transport - Diagnosis and new treatment for patients with Wilson's disease -. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease and Menkes disease are inherited genetic disorders of copper metabolism. Each disease results from the absence or dysfunction of homologous copper transporting ATPases present in the trans-Golgi cell network. Wilson's ATPase transports copper to the hepatocyte secretory pathway for incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion in the bile. Therefore, patients with autosomal recessive trait Wilson's disease present with signs and symptoms arising from impaired biliary excretion of copper. Menkes ATPase transports copper across the placenta, gastrointestinal tract, and blood-brain barrier, and the clinical features of this X-linked disease arise from copper deficiency. Despite the striking differences in the clinical presentation of these two diseases, the respective ATPases function in exactly the same way within the cell. The different clinical features of each disease are the result of the tissue-specific expression of these ATPases. In Wilson's disease, impaired biliary excretion of copper leads to accumulation of this metal in the liver. When hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, cell death occurs, with release of copper into the plasma leading to hemolysis and deposition of copper in extrahepatic tissues. Affected patients usually present in the first or second decade of life with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis or acute liver failure. The accumulation of copper in the cornea results in Kayser-Fleischer rings. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are more common in adults and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairment as a result of copper accumulation in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, and elevated liver copper concentration. A large number of different mutations occur in the genes of patients with Wilson's disease. Copper and zinc chelating drugs are effective in most cases. New treatment guidelines now advise doctors to start treating patients with zinc.",,"Aoki, T.",2005,,,0,0,

2160,Cognition in liver disease,"Background: Cognitive dysfunction has been observed in a variety of liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis C virus, alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Wilson's disease. Such dysfunction can range from mild cognitive changes to overt hepatic encephalopathy and represents a significant complication of liver disease that can negatively affect a patient's quality of life and normal activities of daily living (eg, driving). Method: This article reviews the published evidence related to cognitive dysfunction in liver disease. Outcome: Issues of definition, diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, treatment, and outcome are discussed. Special attention is dedicated to the identification of mild cognitive changes that occur in liver diseases of different aetiology.

2161,Huntington's disease and related disorders,"Numerous conditions are known to produce movement abnormalities, including chorea, along with cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. HD has received the most clinical and research attention, in part due to the availability of accurate genetic tests, but commercial genetic tests are available for several other conditions, including SCA. Genetic testing is helpful in some trinucleotide repeat disorders, but the impact of testing on the patient and family must be evaluated. Basal ganglia degeneration is seen in several of these conditions and may explain some of the behavioral changes, especially deficits in impulse control, motivation, and executive function, along with motor symptoms. Because many of the conditions discussed can present with similar motor and behavioral symptoms, a careful family history, examination, and the select use of laboratory tests may be necessary if the diagnosis is in doubt. Psychiatric symptoms are common in these disorders and can cause disability comparable to that caused by the movement disorder itself. There is little research on the treatment of psychiatric conditions in these disorders, but standard therapies may be helpful and should be tried if necessary.",,"Anderson, K.

2163,Wilson's disease: high prevalence in a mountainous area of Crete,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. The worldwide incidence is of the order of 30 cases per million, with a gene frequency of 0.56% and a carrier frequency of 1 in 90. The increase in the number of patients with Wilson's disease on the island of Crete led us to study the spectrum of mutations in a small town near the city of Heraklion, from where many patients have been referred during the last 25 years. To estimate the frequency of the disease, we first investigated the number of births and the number of WD patients in the village since 1978. Six of 90 births were diagnosed as WD patients, presenting the highest prevalence of WD reported so far. Whole gene analysis in three patients with Wilson's disease and relatives of a child who died of WD led to the detection of 4 different point mutations. Two of them missense (p.I1148T and p.G1176R) and cosegregated in cis in the same patient; the other allele from this patient carried a missense mutation (p.Q289X). This is the first report in the literature of three co-segregating mutations in the same WD patient. The fourth mutation identified was a novel frameshift mutation (c.398delT) with documented cosegregation. When examining 200 inhabitants from the same area, it was found that 18 were carriers of one of these mutations. These findings indicate the need for an intervention of health education, genetic counseling, and screening for Wilson's disease in newborns. Â© University College London 2005.",,"Dedoussis, G. V.

2164,The role of copper in tumor angiogenesis,"Copper stimulates the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and is necessary for the secretion of various angiogenic factors by tumor cells. Copper chelation decreases the secretion of many of these factors. Serum copper levels are upregulated in many human tumors and correlate with tumor burden and prognosis. Copper binders reduce tumor growth and microvascular density in animal models. The new orally active copper chelators have allowed clinical trials and several studies are ongoing. A unifying mechanism of action by which copper chelation inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and tumor secretion of angiogenic factors remains to be elucidated, but potential targets include copper-dependent enzymes, chaperones, and transporters.

2167,"Copper, oxidative stress and human health","Copper (Cu), a redox active metal, is an essential nutrient for all species studied to date. Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in the concept that marginal deficiencies of this element may contribute to the development and progression of a number of disease states, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Deficiencies of this nutrient during pregnancy can cause serious structural malformations in conception and persistent neurological and immunological abnormalities in the offspring. Excessive amounts of Cu in the body can also pose a risk. Acute Cu toxicity can lead to a number of pathologies and, in severe cases, death. Chronic Cu toxicity can result in liver disease and severe neurological defects. The concept that elevated ceruloplasmin is a risk factor for certain diseases is discussed. In this article, we will review the recent literature on possible causes of Cu deficiency and Cu toxicity, and the pathological consequences associated with the above. Finally, we will review some of the possible biochemical lesions that could be the basis of these pathologies. Since oxidative stress is a feature of Cu deficiency, the role of Cu in the oxidative defense system will receive special attention.

We present two new cases with identical lesions. In the families of each of the patients, there were mutations in the ATPase7B gene, especially in the family of proband 1, and in the first cousin of proband 2. These cases included massive white matter destruction in the superior gyri, in his frontal majority, extending to the deep cortex with neuronal loss and capillary proliferation. The astrocytes were from Alzheimer type 1 and 2; and type 1 were marked by anti-metallothionein. Opalski cells were abundant and their macrophage lineage was confirmed by immunostaining. Among the possible mechanisms proposed, the role of vascular factors and penicillamine treatment could be excluded. The cerebral copper content in the white matter and putamen of case 1 was at the same level as in common WD, but the accumulation of free copper in the white matter was a distinctive feature suggesting a pathological neurotoxic effect.

The effect of oral treatment with zinc acetate (Zn) on the development of acute hepatitis and the biochemical parameters of liver damage induced by Cu was studied in 5-week-old LEC rats (n = 52). Methods: Rats receiving 50 or 80 mg/ml/day Zn acetate by gavage and control rats receiving a daily dose of 0.02 g/ml glucose solution by gastric intubation were sacrificed 1.2 u 8 weeks after the start of treatment. Results: Zn acetate treatment resulted in the prevention of acute hepatitis: 10 of 13 untreated rats developed signs and symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis between the 6th and 7th week of treatment. Tissue metallothionein (MT) increased significantly in treated rats and was positively correlated with liver Zn concentrations. Control rats had significantly higher iron concentration in liver and kidneys compared to supplemented rats, after both short-term and long-term experiments. The amounts of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were significantly lower in untreated rats. Conclusions: Zn acetate prevents acute hepatitis by increasing tissue concentrations of MT, reducing Cu absorption and interfering with Fe metabolism.

2175,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc from the time of diagnosis in pediatric patients: a 10-year follow-up study in a single hospital.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by a failure of the liver to excrete copper, leading to its accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea, and kidneys, with resulting chronic degenerative changes. . It is generally accepted that ""presymptomatic"" patients, in whom WD is diagnosed in childhood and who are defined as those who, although still asymptomatic, have liver disease, as indicated by increased serum transaminase levels, should be treated prophylactically. Here we report our results in 22 children treated with continuous oral zinc therapy for 10 years. Zinc sulfate was administered at a dose of 25 mg elemental zinc twice daily until age 6 years, 25 mg three times daily between ages 7 and 16 years, or until the child reached a body weight of 125 lb and 50 mg three times a day thereafter. Five years after the start of zinc treatment, we observed highly significant decreases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and urinary copper excretion, but white blood cell counts did not change significantly. Six of 22 patients continued to demonstrate ALT levels above normal, and only 1 patient demonstrated an ALT level greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Additional decreases in urinary copper excretion, ALT, and AST were observed at the end of 10 years of follow-up, but these decreases were not statistically significant. Only 1 patient continued to show abnormal ALT levels. Once again, the white blood cells did not show significant variations. All histological scores (steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis) decreased significantly after treatment. Liver copper content also decreased significantly, although it remained above normal in all patients. The elimination of toxic copper was confirmed by the disappearance of the Kayser-Fleischer rings in 3 patients. Zinc had no adverse effects on growth. The efficacy of zinc in WD in presymptomatic pediatric patients has been established in previous studies, and our study adds considerably to previous findings because it includes a large number of very young children, up to 11 under 6 years of age and 20 under 10 years of age. excellent clinical results in all patients, together with improvement in liver histological findings in the vast majority, convincingly indicate that zinc treatment can effectively and safely control the disease, preventing its progression over the course of 10 years . Histological findings reportedly improved in 3 patients treated in an earlier study, but our data are numerically much more relevant. In particular, the histological study of the liver revealed that copper concentration was reduced with treatment, suggesting that oral zinc could not only prevent further accumulation of copper but also promote, at least in part, the depletion of its stores . The lack of adverse effects of zinc on growth suggests that our patients received enough anti-copper therapy to prevent damage resulting from copper toxicity, but adequate copper for adequate growth and development. In conclusion, our findings indicate that zinc is the treatment of choice in presymptomatic pediatric patients with WD. Â© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A central feature of treatment is the choice of anti-copper drug(s) for the various stages and classes of the disease. Physicians should no longer rely on penicillamine as their primary choice for treating this disease. In fact, our recommendation is that penicillamine be used infrequently. For the initial treatment of liver failure presentation, we recommend a combination of trientine and zinc. For the initial treatment of the neurological/psychiatric presentation, we recommend tetrathiomolybdate and zinc. If tetrathiomolybdate is not available, our second choice is zinc alone. For maintenance therapy (generally 2 to 4 months after initial therapy), for presymptomatic patients, and for pregnant patients, zinc with trientine is recommended as a second choice. Follow-up recommendations are provided for both the efficacy and safety of these various anti-copper drugs. Liver transplantation should be reserved only for patients with severe hepatic impairment and should never be used for neurological indications.

A significant number of these positive designations have already been converted into full marketing authorizations. Three main reasons (failure to meet the criteria for prevalence or significant benefit or to provide evidence of biological plausibility) have equally contributed to the negative opinion or withdrawal of the remaining applications by the applicants. In July 2004, the European Commission issued a communication setting out its position on certain issues related to the implementation of market exclusivity and designation provisions.

2188,Serum transaminases in children with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVES: The response of serum transaminase levels to treatment with penicillamine and zinc in Wilson's disease is poorly understood. The objective of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate transaminase levels after treatment with penicillamine and zinc in children with Wilson's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 119 patients with Wilson's disease (median age at diagnosis, 7.2 years; range, 1 to 18 years), treated for at least 12 months and observed in the last 20 years in 11 Pediatric Departments. . Clinical, laboratory and histological characteristics were recorded at the time of diagnosis and initial treatment. Efficacy parameters were normalization of serum transaminase level and improvement of clinical and/or laboratory signs. One hundred and two patients had clinical or laboratory signs of liver disease. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 87 patients (64%) received normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels with penicillamine at a median of 17 months (range, 2 to 96 months). Of the 29 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, 17 (59%) switched to zinc; only four of these normalized ALT with zinc within a median period of 38 months (range, 7 to 48 months). Eleven (50%) of the 22 patients who received zinc alone normalized ALT within a median period of 6 months (range, 1 to 36 months). Of the 11 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, five switched to penicillamine. Three of the five normalized ALT within a median of 6 months (range, 6 to 9 months). Overall, in penicillamine-zinc-treated patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia, ALT decreased from a baseline median of 236 IU/L (range, 54 to 640 IU/L) to a median of 78 (range, 46 to 960 IU/L). ) at the end of follow-up (P = 0.0245). Poor compliance was suspected in only 10% of cases. No predictive factor for persistent hypertransaminasemia was identified. Liver disease did not worsen in any patient during the study.

2193,Effects of high Zn intake on metabolism in man. [Chinese],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of high-level Zn intake on zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lipid metabolism, and antioxidant function in man to provide a scientific basis for Zn supplementation. METHODS: 40 healthy rural men were recruited and took 50 mg Zn tablets (as 0.2 g zinc glucose) per day for eight weeks. All subjects were reviewed five times: at week 0, 2, 4, 8 during the Zn supplementation period and at week 12 and had their serum, red blood cells, hair, and 24-hour urine collected for trials at the same time. weather. RESULTS: (1) Serum, red blood cell, and hair Zn contents increased significantly after 2 to 4 weeks of supplementation and decreased at 4 weeks after stopping supplementation, but were still higher than before supplementation. The 24-hour urine Zn content increased significantly after supplementation and decreased at 4 weeks after stopping supplementation to the same level as before supplementation. (2) Serum, red blood cell, and hair Cu contents increased significantly after 4 weeks of supplementation and decreased at 4 weeks after stopping supplementation. Cu contents in the 24-h urine did not change significantly during the experiment. (3) Red blood cell superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities persistently decreased after 2 weeks of supplementation and did not recover by 4 weeks after stopping supplementation. Red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities increased significantly after 4 weeks of supplementation. Lipid peroxide (LPO) content increased significantly after 2 weeks of supplementation. (4) Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) increased significantly, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HLD-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) decreased after supplementation.

2196,Wilson's disease and its pharmacological treatment. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease is an inherited copper toxicosis caused by a presumed defect in copper ATPase transport in the liver. Due to impaired bile secretion, copper remains in the liver, resulting in chronic liver injury including fatty metamorphosis, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. In the late stage, extrapyramidal syndromes with or without symptomatic liver injury may develop. Acute liver injury associated with hemolysis and profound jaundice may be the first manifestation. Most patients have hypoceruloplasminemia, which has been used as a screening test for the disease. A large number of mutations in the ATP7B gene have been reported. Therefore, genetic diagnosis could be used in a limited way for the presymptomatic diagnosis of siblings when mutations are identified in an index patient. The introduction of penicillamine caused a revolution in the treatment of patients. Another chelator, trientine, is now available for those who cannot tolerate penicillamine. Tetrathiomolybdate and zinc acetate are additional alternatives currently being tested. Hypoceruloplasminemia and further reduction after chelation therapy may be associated with iron overload. This complication is closely related to impaired ferrous ion transport due to ferroxidase deficiency. Noncompliance and teratogenicity are other important concerns because any treatment with the agents listed above is a lifelong regimen. Despite the various side effects of penicillamine, its teratogenicity is negligible. These data indicate that penicillamine is the drug of first choice for this disease.

2200,Treatment of Wilson's disease with penicillamine and zinc salts: a follow-up study. [Chinese],"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver and then in the brain and other organs. Penicillamine acts as a reducing chelator. Zinc salts induce metallothionein synthesis in cells. Therefore, these two drugs are theoretically synergistic for the treatment of the disease. However, the two medications can also have some unfavorable interactions. In this study, the effect of combined penicillamine-zinc salt therapy was evaluated based on follow-up observations in 21 patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Using the combined therapy of penicillamine [10-30 mg/(kg.d)] and zinc (22.5 mg, 3 times a day), follow-up study by hospitalization or communication by telephone or mail. RESULTS: Before treatment, all 21 patients had a chronic liver disorder. Among them, 13 patients (62%) were found to be treatment-reactive for their liver disorder, 5 patients (24%) died, and 3 patients (14%) dropped out of our follow-up study. Among the 5 patients who died, 3 died within 40 days after treatment, one had taken penicillamine alone 8 mg/(kg.d), and one died after parental discontinuation of treatment. Of the 12 patients with neurological compromise, neurological symptoms disappeared or markedly improved in 11 patients after treatment. One patient dropped out of the follow-up study. The patient with renal tubular acidosis responded well to treatment. Routine urinalysis was followed in 6 of the 7 patients with hematuria. Hematuria disappeared in one, became less severe in 1, and remained unchanged in 4 patients. Hypersensitivity to penicillamine was found in one patient. White blood cells and platelets were found to decrease further in 3 patients after the drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with penicillamine and zinc salts was effective in the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Li, M.;Zhang, Y. H.;Qin, J.",2003,Feb,,0,0,
2201,What have we learned from CDNA microarray gene expression studies about the role of iron in MPTP-induced neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease?,"There have been numerous hypotheses about the etiology and mechanism of dorsal raphe dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and its animal models, MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and 6- hydroxydopamine. The advent of cDNA microarray gene expression where the expression of thousands of genes can be assessed globally has indicated that the mechanism of MPTP neurodegeneration is a complex cascade of vicious circles. One of them is the alteration of genes associated with the metabolism of iron, a transition metal closely related to the induction of the formation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of oxidative stress. cDNA gene expression analyzes support the established hypothesis of oxidation-induced neurodegeneration involving iron deposition in parkinsonian substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) brains. The regulation of cellular iron metabolism has been further enhanced by the recent discovery of two iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, which control the level of iron in the cell. When the cellular level of iron increases, IRP2 is degraded by ubiquitination and no more iron is accumulated. The opposite occurs when the iron level is low inside the cell. IRP1 and IRP2 knockout mice have shown that, in the latter, the accumulation of iron in the brain precedes the neurodegeneration, ataxia and bradykinesia observed in these animals. Indeed, MPTP treatment, which results in iron accumulation in SNCPs, suppresses IRP2 with the concomitant increase in alpha-synuclein. Iron chelators such as R-apomorphine and EGCG, which protect against MPTP neurotoxicity, prevent the loss of IRP2 and the increase in alpha-synuclein. The presence of iron together with alpha-synuclein in SNPCs may be detrimental to dopaminergic neurons. Since then, iron has been shown to cause the aggregation of alpha-synuclein to a nerve agent. The use of iron chelators that penetrate the blood-brain barrier as neuroprotective drugs has been envisioned.",,"Youdim, M. B. H.",2003,,,0,0,

2208,Increased plasma levels of nociceptin/orphanin FQ in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Objective: The heptadecapeptide nociceptin alias orphanin FQ is the endogenous agonist of the opioid receptor-like receptor. It is involved in pain modulation and cognition. Elevated blood levels have been reported in patients with acute and chronic pain, and in Wilson's disease. An accidental observation led us to investigate nociceptin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Plasma nociceptin level was measured by radioimmunoassay, using aprotinin as protease inhibitor. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by laboratory, ultrasound, other images, and confirmed by fine-needle biopsy. The results were compared with healthy controls and patients with other chronic liver diseases. Results: Although nociceptin levels were elevated in patients with Wilson's disease (14.0+/-2.7 pg/mL, n=26), primary biliary cirrhosis (12.1+/-3.2 pg/mL , 17=21) and liver cirrhosis (12.8+/-4.0 pg/mL, n=15) compared to healthy controls (9.2+/-1.8 pg/mL, n=29, P<0.001 for each), in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma a tenfold increase was found (105.9+/-14.4 pg/mL, n=29, P<0.0001). High plasma levels were found in every patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, including those with normal alpha-fetoprotein and those with pain (104.9+/-14.9 pg/mL, n=12) and without pain (107.7+/-14 .5 pg/mL, n=6). Conclusion: A very high plasma level of nociceptin seems to be an indicator of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism and clinical significance of this novel finding.",,"Szalay, F.;Hantos, M. B.;Horvath, A.;Lakatos, P.

2209,Tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of acute hepatitis in an animal model for Wilson's disease,"Background/objectives: Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelating agent that has been shown to be effective in patients with Wilson's disease with neurological symptoms. Here, we investigate the potential use of TTM in the treatment of acute hepatic copper toxicosis in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an authentic model for Wilson's disease. Methods: After the onset of acute hepatitis, LEC rats were treated once with 10 mg TTM/kg. After 1 and 4 days, liver toxicity parameters and subcellular distribution and binding of copper and iron were studied. Results: In 11 of 12 rats, TTM rapidly ameliorated acute hepatitis. Liver copper was decreased through removal of cytosolic metallothionein and lysosomal metallothionein polymers. The remaining lysosomal copper forms a metallothionein-copper-TTM complex. However, in a near-moribund rat, TTM caused severe hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome. Conclusions: TTM is effective in the treatment of acute hepatitis in LEC rats when applied before the animals are moribund. TTM appears to act by removing the presumably reactive copper associated with lysosomal metallothionein polymers. The remaining lysosomal copper appears to be inactivated by complexing with TTM. Furthermore, TTM removes copper from cytosolic copper-containing metallothionein. As a consequence, metallothionein is degraded and copper metallothionein uptake in lysosomes and the formation of metallothionein polymer-associated copper are reduced.

2211,Genotype-phenotype correlations for a broad spectrum of mutations in the Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B),"Wilson's disease (WND) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene and exhibits substantial allelic heterogeneity. In this study, we report the results of molecular analyzes of 20 families of WND not previously described. When combined with our previous results, the cohort includes 93 index patients from 69 unrelated families. Twenty different mutations accounted for 86% of the WND chromosomes. The most frequent were p.H1069Q (35%), p.R969Q (12%), c.2530delA (7%), p.L936X (7%), p.Q289X (7%) and P.I1148T (3%). ). We also present here a detailed phenotypic evaluation for patients whose molecular outcome was previously reported. Thirty cases were homozygous for 9 different mutations, 13 of which were homozygous for p.H1069Q and 7 for p.R969Q. The p.H1069Q and p.R969Q mutations appeared to confer milder disease as patients showed older age onset and were associated with milder severity when found in trans people with severe mutations. Predicted missense and frameshift mutations were associated with severe phenotypic expression with earlier disease onset and lower ceruloplasmin values. WND can be treated with copper chelation therapy, particularly if the disease is diagnosed before irreversible tissue damage occurs. Our results on the effect of predicted missense and frameshift mutations are especially important for early medical intervention in presymptomatic infants and children with these genotypes.

2224,Postural tremor in Wilson's disease: magnetoencephalographic study,"The following study included 5 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) showing a right-sided postural forearm tremor (4-6 Hz) and addressed the question of whether the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in tremor generation. . Using a 122-channel full-head neuromagnetometer and surface electromyogram (EMG), we investigated cerebromuscular coupling. Postural tremor was observed in a sustained 45 degree posture of the right forearm. The data was analyzed using dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS), which revealed cerebromuscular coupling between EMG and brain activity. Coherent sources were superimposed on individual high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). The gaps between the EMG and the brain areas that showed the greatest coherence were determined by means of a Hilbert transform of both signals. In all patients, postural tremor was associated with a strong coherence between tremor EMG and activity in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) at tremor frequency or double tremor. Lag values between S1/M1 activity and EMG revealed efferent and afferent components in corticomuscular coupling. Taken together, our results indicate that postural tremor in WD is mediated by pathological oscillatory input from the primary motor cortex.

2225,movement disorders in pregnancy,"Movement disorders are not particularly common during pregnancy, with a few exceptions. RLS most commonly occurs followed by CG. Today, with the incidence of rheumatic fever lower than ever before, any woman who develops GC should be screened for diseases other than rheumatic heart disease. The differential includes systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [21]. Regarding the use of dopaminergic agents, the dopamine agonist pergolide can be maintained during pregnancy for the treatment of PD, Segawa disease and RLS. The use of levodopa and ropinirole should be limited during pregnancy due to possible teratogenic effects. Amantadine is contraindicated during pregnancy [54]. Data on selegiline are controversial; animal studies show possible serotonergic effects [52] and teratogenic effects [53]. If treatment is indicated in patients with Tourette's syndrome, high-potency neuroleptic drugs (haloperidol) are preferred to treat associated symptoms [38]. Depression is a frequent comorbidity in patients with PD, HD, Tourette's syndrome or other chronic neurological diseases. Treatment of depression during pregnancy is covered by Levy et al elsewhere in this issue. As discussed above, most data on drug use during pregnancy, especially dopaminergic agents, is limited to animal studies and case reports.

When mild, chorea can be difficult to distinguish from restlessness. When the chorea is proximal and of great amplitude, it is called ballismus. Chorea usually worsens with anxiety and stress and disappears during sleep. Most patients try to disguise chorea by incorporating it into a certain activity. While ballismus is most often found as hemiballismus due to contralateral structural lesions of the subthalamic nucleus and/or its afferent or efferent projections, chorea can be the expression of a wide range of disorders, including metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, vascular and neurodegenerative. as well as drug-induced syndromes. In clinical practice, Sydenham's chorea is the most common form of childhood chorea, whereas Huntington's disease and drug-induced chorea account for the majority of adult-onset cases.

2231,Metals in our mind: therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders,"Background Abnormal interactions of copper or iron in the brain with metal-binding proteins (such as beta-amyloid peptide [Abeta] or neuromelanin) leading to oxidative stress have emerged as potential mechanisms important in brain aging and neuromelanin. neurodegenerative disorders. Although a controlled study of desferrioxamine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) had some promising results, concerns about toxicity and delivery to the brain have limited trials of traditional chelators. The therapeutic importance of metal dysregulation in neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. Recent Developments Clioquinol was identified as a prototype metal protein quenching compound (MPAC). In a 9-week, blinded, controlled study of an AD mouse model, oral clioquinol decreased brain Abeta by 49% without systemic toxicity. Brain copper and zinc concentrations increased by about 15% in clioquinol-treated mice. Two other studies in mice showed that increasing brain copper concentrations through diet or genetics could reduce amyloid burden and increase survival. A recent placebo-controlled trial in 36 AD patients showed that clioquinol (250-750 mg daily) reduced plasma Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> concentrations, increased plasma zinc concentrations, and, in a subgroup with moderate dementia - slow cognitive decline over 24 weeks. Two recent experiments also showed the neuroprotective effects of iron chelation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Where next? Experimental and transgenic animal studies of metal-protein interactions are convincing but do not provide conclusive answers about causality and whether this strategy will protect against neurodegeneration in humans. The finding that clioquinol could modulate plasma amyloid concentrations and cognition in AD patients should be interpreted with caution, but it is an important first step. Clioquinol was withdrawn due to concerns about its association with subacute myelooptic neuropathy in Japan; therefore, any further study with this drug will likely be a small, closely controlled proof-of-concept study. The development of optimal second-generation MPACs is a desirable goal and may allow a greater understanding of the importance of metal-protein interactions in various neurodegenerative disorders.",,"Doraiswamy, P.

2234,Inhibition of key cytokines by tetrathiomolybdate in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate is an anti-copper drug with a unique mechanism of action. Tetrathiomolybdate forms copper complexes with protein and itself, making copper unavailable for cellular uptake. It was originally developed for Wilson's disease and is now being developed as an antiangiogenic agent for cancer treatment. Many angiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper, and low copper levels reduce cytokine signaling while cellular copper requirements are met. Fibrosis and inflammation cytokines may be equally dependent on copper, as tetrathiomolybdate inhibits bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The basis for this inhibition was assessed here by examining the effects of tetrathiomolybdate on cytokines in the lung that are pathophysiologically important in the bleomycin mouse model of lung damage. Results in mice injected endotracheally with bleomycin confirmed that tetrathiomolybdate therapy was effective in reducing fibrosis. This effect was associated with a significant inhibition of bleomycin-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta expression in lung homogenates. These effects were shown to be independent of each other. This indicates that tetrathiomolybdate therapy may be effective even when fibrosis is at a more chronic stage, in which inflammatory cytokines play a diminishing role. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha suggests that tumor necrosis factor alpha overexpression diseases are also potential targets for tetrathiomolybdate therapy. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc.

2242,Copper deficiency myelopathy produces a clinical picture as a subacute combined degeneration,"Background: Copper deficiency in ruminants is known to cause ataxic myelopathy. Copper deficiency as a cause of progressive myelopathy in adults is poorly recognized. Objective: To describe the clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological and imaging characteristics of 13 patients with myelopathy associated with copper deficiency. Methods: Records of patients with myelopathy associated with copper deficiency were reviewed. Clinical features, laboratory investigations, and responses to therapeutic intervention were summarized. Results: Thirteen patients of this type were found, 11 of them in a period of 15 months. All patients had significant gait difficulty, reflecting sensory ataxia due to thoracic spine dysfunction and lower extremity spasticity. All patients had polyneuropathy. A high or high normal serum zinc level was observed in 7 of the 11 patients for whom this information was available. Somatosensory evoked potential studies performed in eight patients showed impaired conduction in central proprioceptive pathways. Dorsal column signal change on spinal MRI was present in three patients. An initial clue to the diagnosis was a very low level of ceruloplasmin; additional tests of copper metabolism excluded Wilson's disease. The cause remained unexplained in most patients. Oral copper supplementation restored normal or near-normal copper levels in 7 of 12 patients with adequate follow-up data; parenteral supplementation restored the normal level in another 3 patients. Copper supplementation prevented further neurological deterioration, but the degree of actual improvement was variable. Conclusions: Unrecognized copper deficiency appears to be a common cause of idiopathic myelopathy in adults. The clinical picture bears striking similarities to the subacute combined degeneration syndrome associated with vitamin B<inf>12</inf> deficiency.

No information is available on ATP7B gene mutation and haplotypes using linked markers for WD patients in India. Therefore, the present study was carried out to identify, by means of a PCR-based molecular diagnostic test, presymptomatic siblings of individuals affected by WD in families with multiple children. Methods: Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood of patients, siblings, and their first-degree relatives. Repeat markers flanking the WD locus were amplified by PCR using fluorescently labeled primers. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on the ABI 377 DNA Sequencing System. Sample genotypes were determined using Genescan software. The haplotypes were determined based on the segregation of the alleles in the families under study. Results: Among 15 families affected by WD with several children, 4 cases were identified in which the younger siblings shared the same genotype as the patient in the three markers analyzed. Furthermore, eight different haplotypes were detected in the four patients. Interpretation and Conclusion: Siblings of WD patients who carried the same genotype at markers linked to the WD locus were presymptomatically diagnosed individuals. The presence of eight different haplotypes in the four patients suggested mutational heterogeneity at the WD locus.

We present the case of an 18-year-old patient with fulminant liver failure due to Wilson's crisis. Methods: The molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) was used to remove albumin-bound toxins and overcome the wait until an organ became available. Results: A total of 18 MARS sessions and 4 plasmapheresis sessions were performed. Bilirubin levels and hepatic encephalopathy improved with MARS therapy. A total of 75 mg of copper was removed until serum copper levels were within the normal range. Copper removal was measured in 15 MARS treatments, which removed a total of 12.9 mg of copper. Four plasma exchange sessions, with a total exchange of 11 liters of plasma, removed 12 mg of copper. The urinary excretion of copper with penicillamine was 50 mg. Conclusion: MARS was an effective method to stabilize a patient with Wilson's crisis, it contributed to the elimination of copper and bought time for liver transplantation.

2253,Tetrathiomolybdate therapy protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a drug developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease, produces an antiangiogenic effect by reducing systemic copper levels. Several angiogenic cytokines appear to depend on normal levels of copper for their activity. In both animal tumor models and cancer patients, MT therapy has been shown to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth. We hypothesize that the activities of fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines are also subject to modulation by copper availability in a similar manner to angiogenic cytokines. As a first step in evaluating whether TM plays a therapeutic role in inflammation and fibrosis diseases, we studied the effects of TM in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Oral MT therapy resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in serum ceruloplasmin, a surrogate marker of systemic copper levels. Significant decreases in systemic copper levels were associated with a marked reduction in pulmonary fibrosis as determined on the basis of histopathological findings and a biochemical measure of fibrosis. The protection provided by TM was also reflected in a significant reduction in bleomycin-induced body weight loss. In the next phase of this work, we will seek to determine the mechanisms by which TM generates this therapeutic benefit.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Ullenbruch, M. R.;Dick, R.;Olivarez, L.;Phan, S.

2256,Diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease 38-year experience of therapy in a specialized outpatient clinic. [German],"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive inherited disorder, is caused by more than 200 different mutations in the gene (locus 13q14.3) that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase 7B. Hepatic manifestations became evident mainly during the first, neurological and psychiatric during the second or third decade of life, rarely later. Genotype-phenotype correlations are probably. Diagnosis involves laboratory tests (Cu metabolism), molecular genetics, and, if necessary, liver biopsy. Treatment should be continued for life, without interruption, also during pregnancy. In addition to D-penicillamine, which has been the drug of choice for many years, trientine, zinc, and tetrathiomolybdate are used successfully. Monitoring (copper balance, side effects) is necessary at least once or twice a year. Brain MRI and FDG-PET appear to be a useful tool in practice for long-term therapy. Continued care of Wilson's patients (38, 10 of them without liver or neurological signs) in a specialized outpatient clinic since 1964 has proven valuable. 31 patients consistently treated with D-Penicillamin tolerated the drug well with few side effects. Even marked neurological symptoms improved, with some patients becoming virtually symptom free. All patients without clinical signs remained symptom free. If intolerance to D-penicillamine occurs, trientine and zinc are effective alternative therapy. Recurrent hepatic decompensations were observed in 2 female patients. One of them eventually required a liver transplant. 19 pregnancies were carried to term without complications or fetal harm while taking medication (17 with D-penicillamine, 2 with trientine and zinc). Discontinuation of therapy resulted in fatal liver failure in a pregnant patient.",,"Kunath, B.;Reuner, U.",2003,February,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2003-37060,0,1,
2257,Copper-reducing therapy with tetrathiomolybdate for cancer and fibrosis and inflammation diseases,"Angiogenesis is necessary for tumor growth and is likely to be an Achilles' heel for cancer. However, antiangiogenic agents have been somewhat disappointing in cancer therapy, perhaps because they target a single angiogenic factor and there is much redundancy in angiogenic systems. Copper is required for high levels of angiogenesis, and many angiogenic factors have a copper requirement. Therefore, anti-copper drugs offer the possibility of more global inhibition. Our group has developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. Penicillamine makes approximately 50% of these patients neurologically worse, and many never recover. Only 2 of 55 (3.6%) patients worsened when treated with TM. Because TM exhibited desirable properties of potency, speed, and safety, we studied it as an antiangiogenic agent. We hypothesize that if copper is reduced to a mid-range, cellular copper requirements are met, but angiogenic cytokine signaling is inhibited. TM has shown strong inhibition of cancer growth in five rodent models, encouraging results in a canine study of advanced and metastatic cancer, and encouraging results in a phase 1/2 study of advanced and metastatic cancer in 42 patients. Finally, we have hypothesized that the fibrosis pathway involving transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and connective tissue growth factor is inhibitable by TM copper-reducing therapy. This pathway is hyperactive and dysregulated in many fibrosis diseases. In animal studies, TM has completely inhibited bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, concanavalin A-induced hepatitis, and carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. We found that TM inhibits transforming growth factor beta and inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1-beta. Â© 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Brewer, G.

Clinical Picture: A 49-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of recurrent hemorrhagic blisters, milia, and purpura on both elbows while receiving long-term penicillamine (1.5 g daily) for Wilson's disease. Histologically, dermal elastin fibers were markedly reduced in affected areas, consistent with penicillamine-induced elastolysis. Treatment and outcome: The patient's lesions improved significantly after reduction of the penicillamine dose to 500 mg daily. Conclusions: It is important to recognize the cutaneous side effects of long-term penicillamine therapy as they may be associated with significant morbidity and may be markers of more ominous underlying systemic elastic fiber damage.",,"Tang, M.

2262,Excess dietary histidine decreases liver copper level and serum alanine aminotransferase activity in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats.,"Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats spontaneously develop fulminant hepatitis, associated with excessive accumulation of Cu in the liver, which is why they are considered an animal model of Wilson's disease. In the present study, we investigated the ability of excess dietary histidine to reduce excessive Cu accumulation in the liver in LEC rats compared to Fischer rats. The results clearly showed that the histidine-excess diet markedly stimulated urinary Cu excretion and significantly decreased liver Cu content in LEG rats by 47.5%. Serum Cu content in LEC rats was not influenced by excess dietary histidine. We also compared the effects of excess dietary histidine on some hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities, serum and liver lipid levels, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC and Fischer rats. Dietary histidine decreased total superoxide dismutase and Cu,Zn activities in the liver of both strains. In LEC rats, hepatic cholesterol content decreased and serum cholesterol and phospholipid levels increased when fed a diet with excess histidine. When fed the basal diet, serum alanine aminotransferase activity was higher in LEC rats than in Fischer rats, but a significant decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase activity was observed in LEC rats when fed a normal diet. with excess histidine. These results suggest that excess dietary histidine is effective in removing Cu ions from the liver of LEC rats. Therefore, it may be beneficial in the prevention or treatment of liver injury in LEC rats and in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Xu, H.;Sakakibara, S.;Morifuji, M.;Salamatulla, Q.;Aoyama, Y.",2003,2022-09-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/BJN2003939,0,0,

2269,Wilson's disease: the importance of measuring serum ceruloplasmin in a non-immunological way,"Wilson's disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any child, adolescent, or young adult with unexplained liver damage, especially when hemolysis is present. However, it can also present in adolescents or young adults with neurological signs limited to the motor system. The first diagnostic screening test is estimation of serum ceruloplasmin and total serum copper concentrations, with calculation of serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin (""free""). Serum ceruloplasmin, which contains copper, is best determined by measuring its oxidase activity, since the immunonephelometric method measures both ceruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo form. Diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient should be screened and, when in doubt, screening for the Wilson gene on chromosome 13q14.3 can be used. Lifelong follow-up studies are best done at a specialized center. Compliance with chelation therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by determining ""free"" serum copper, which should be maintained at or near 1.6 mumol/l (10 ug/ 100ml).

We also investigated the change in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and determined the biochemical profile in the blood and the levels of metals in the urine. We show that the Zn-treated group had higher levels of MT in liver and intestinal cells compared to the basal and untreated groups. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in the Zn-treated group compared to untreated and basal groups, while Cu and Fe concentrations decreased. Antioxidant enzyme activities in the Zn-treated group did not change significantly from those in the baseline group, except for hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity. Furthermore, the biochemical data on the blood of the Zn-treated group clearly indicate that there is no liver damage. These observations suggest an important role for Zn in relation not only to its ability to compete with other metals at the level of absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, producing a decrease in hepatic and renal deposits of Cu and Fe, but also to the induction of MT as free radicals. scavenger Â© 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Santon, A.;Irato, P.;Medici, V.;D'Inca, R.;Albergoni, V.;Sturniolo, G.

2274,"Copper toxicity, oxidative stress and antioxidant nutrients","Copper (Cu) is an integral part of many important enzymes involved in a number of vital biological processes. Although normally bound to proteins, Cu can be released and left free to catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Data from in vitro and cell culture studies strongly support the ability of Cu to initiate oxidative damage and interfere with important cellular events. Oxidative damage has been related to chronic Cu overload and/or exposure to excess Cu caused by accidents, occupational hazards, and environmental pollution. Furthermore, Cu-induced oxidative damage has been implicated in disorders associated with abnormal Cu metabolism and neurodegenerative changes. Interestingly, a deficiency of Cu in the diet also increases cell susceptibility to oxidative damage. Several nutrients have been shown to interact with Cu and alter its cellular effects. Vitamin E generally protects against Cu-induced oxidative damage. While most in vitro or cell culture studies show that ascorbic acid aggravates Cu-induced oxidative damage, available animal study results suggest that the compound is protective. High intakes of ascorbic acid and zinc may provide protection against Cu toxicity by preventing excessive Cu absorption. Zinc also removes Cu from its binding site, where it can cause free radical formation. Beta-carotene, alpha-lipoic acid, and polyphenols have also been shown to attenuate Cu-induced oxidative damage. Further studies are needed to better understand the cellular effects of this essential but potentially toxic trace mineral and its functional interaction with other nutrients.

2275,Animal models of copper-associated liver disease,"Recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to identify genetic defects responsible for Wilson's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis, and copper toxicosis in Long Evans Cinnamon rats, toxic milk mice, and Bedlington terriers. The Wilson's disease gene is located on human chromosome 13 and encodes ATP7B, a copper transporting P-type ATPase. A genetic defect similar to Wilson's disease occurs in Long Evans Cinnamon rats and toxic milk mice. Familial copper storage disorders in Bedlington and West Highland white terriers are associated with early subclinical disease and copper accumulation with subsequent liver damage culminating in cirrhosis. The locus of canine copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers has been mapped to canine chromosome region CFA 10q26. Recently, a mutated MURR1 gene was discovered in Bedlington terriers affected by the disease. Idiopathic infantile cirrhosis is biochemically similar to copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, but clinically much more severe. Both conditions are characterized by the absence of neurological damage and Kayser-Fleisher rings, and normal levels of ceruloplasmin. A recent study added North Ronaldsay sheep to the list of promising animal models to study Indian childhood cirrhosis. Morphological similarities between the two conditions include periportal to panlobular copper retention and liver changes ranging from active hepatitis to panlobular pericellular fibrosis and cirrhosis. Certain copper-associated disorders, such as chronic active hepatitis in Doberman pinschers and hepatitis in Skye terriers, are characterized by copper retention secondary to underlying disease, resembling primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Copper-associated liver disease is increasingly recognized in Dalmatians. Copper-associated liver diseases in Dalmatians and Long Evans Cinnamom rats share many morphological features. Fulminant hepatic failure in Dalmatians is characterized by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and severe necrosis of hepatocytes in centrilobular areas (periacinar, zone 3). Surviving macrophages and hepatocytes contain copper-positive material. Liver disease associated with periacinar copper accumulation has also been described in Siamese cats. Many questions remain to be answered about copper metabolism in mammals, the genetic background, pathogenesis, and treatment of copper-associated liver diseases. This review describes the similarities between clinicopathologic features of spontaneous copper-associated diseases in humans and domestic animals.

Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused by defective hepatic excretion of copper. The disease is fatal without treatment. Prevention of serious permanent damage depends on early recognition and diagnosis, followed by adequate lifelong anti-copper treatment. The goal of Wilson's disease therapy is to remove copper by chelating agents (D-penicillamine, triethylenetetramine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and to inhibit the absorption and accumulation of copper by zinc salts (zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc gluconate). zinc).",,"Nagy, J.;Vincze, Z.;Folhoffer, A.;Horvath, A.;Csak, T.;Zelko, R.",2003,,,0,0,
2277,Wilson's disease. [Croatian],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The protein in Wilson's disease is a copper transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction results in the toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the accompanying liver and/or neurological symptoms. this sickness. Patients present, usually between the ages of 10 and 40, with liver disease, movement disorder-type neurological disease, or behavioral abnormalities, and often with a combination of these. Because Wilson's disease is so effectively treated, it is extremely important that doctors learn how to recognize and diagnose the disease. Laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper content, and increased hepatic copper concentration. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 200 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are compound heterozygotes. Treatment of Wilson's disease should be lifelong. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective therapy in most patients. Another chelating agent that has been used successfully as initial therapy is trientine. The search for new anti-copper drugs for Wilson's disease is culminating in two excellent new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (still an experimental drug to date) for initial therapy. Liver transplantation is indicated for the fulminant form and in those patients with severe disease who do not respond to optimal medical management.

Although this psychiatric symptom was well controlled with pharmacological treatment for two years, he developed olfactory paranoia in addition to drooling, dysarthria, and finger tremor at the age of 20 years. One year later stiffness developed. also present on extremities. At 23 years of age, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was found based on hematological examinations. Because her extrapyramidal symptoms were progressive, she was referred to our service to evaluate her neurological condition. Wilson's disease was diagnosed based on (1) the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, (2) extrapyramidal signs, and (3) a reduced level of serum copper and ceruloplasmin. Brain MRI T2 and FLAIR images showed hyperintense lesions in the putamen, thalamus, and pontine tegmentum. Diffusion-weighted images also showed hyperintense lesions in the thalamus and pontine tegmentum. Liver biopsy sample revealed chronic hepatitis with copper accumulation. Since starting treatment with D-penicillamine, he has shown no olfactory paranoia or exacerbation of ITP. His gait disturbance has also improved.

2280,Rare but important chronic liver diseases. [German],"The presence of steatosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These findings are similar to those of alcoholic liver disease. However, in the NASH situation, alcohol does not play a significant role. Risk factors for the development of NASH are obesity and diabetes. Most patients are clinically asymptomatic. This means that a diagnosis of NASH is a diagnosis of exclusion: viral-induced, autoimmune, metabolic, and toxic liver diseases must be excluded. The disease has a benign clinical course. The risk of cirrhosis is low. So far, there is no established treatment. Preliminary reports suggest a positive effect of weight loss and ursodeoxycholic acid. Wilson's disease, a copper storage disorder in which biliary excretion of copper is reduced, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Most patients with Wilson's disease become symptomatic between the ages of 6 and 15 years. In about 90% of patients, serum ceruloplasmin levels and serum copper concentrations are reduced. Copper excretion increases. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens reveals fatty infiltration, Mallory bodies, and swollen glycogen nuclei, abnormalities also found in alcoholic liver disease. The definitive diagnostic parameter is the quantitative determination of liver copper content (> 250 micrograms/g dry weight). Untreated Wilson's disease is always fatal. Lifelong treatment with anti-copper drugs is essential, with D-penicillamine being the first-line therapy. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The frequency of the disease is high. The first symptoms can usually be found at the age of 20-50 years. Arthralgia develops in up to 50% of patients. Many organs are involved, most often the liver. The organ is usually enlarged, transaminases are always moderately elevated. Laboratory findings reveal a marked elevation of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. More than 80% of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The first-line treatment of HH is phlebotomy. Treatment is for life. When serum ferritin falls below 50 micrograms/l, the frequency of phlebotomies should be reduced (4-12 per year). If the patient already has cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is very high.",,"Maier, K.

2282,Appropriate administration schedule of D-penicillamine for pediatric patients with Wilson's disease based on urinary copper excretion. [Japanese],"The purpose of this study was to increase the amount of copper excreted as a result of D-penicillamine (DP) administration in pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD). By measuring urinary copper excretion after adjusting administration schedules, the appropriate time for PD administration was investigated. Subjects were three siblings with pediatric WD. The initial daily dose of DP was 5 mg/kg/day and was gradually increased to the maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Until the daily maintenance dose was reached, PD was administered 2 h after the morning meal and dinner. After reaching the daily maintenance dose of PD, the appropriate time to take PD both in the morning and in the evening was investigated. Three times of PD administration were compared: 2 h after meals; 30 min before meals (fasting); and 1 h before the morning and 1.5 before dinner (address 1). The resulting urinary copper excretion was compared at each dosing schedule. Little difference was found in urinary copper excretion in the first two schedules, ie 2 hours after meals and 30 minutes before meals. When PD was administered 30 min before meals, urinary copper excretion [mug/day] was 1173 in the first brother, 918 in the second, and 875 in the third. However, when PD was administered according to direction 1, urinary copper excretion increased significantly to 1,701 in the first brother, 2,701 in the second, and 3,808 in the third. It is known that the efficiency of urinary copper excretion with DP administration depends on the maintenance of the chelating capacity after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Our results indicate that excretion was lower when PD was administered 2 h after or 30 min before meals (fasting), as recommended in the package insert. Therefore, to achieve better copper excretion efficiency, direction 1 is recommended for WD patients.

[French]","Purpose: Wilson's disease is characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms with frequent extrapyramidal and intellectual presentations. They have an insidious course that leads to late diagnosis and less therapeutic efficacy in advanced forms. Methods - We report 21 cases of Wilson's disease with neurological complications, emphasizing clinical semiology, diagnostic means and therapeutic problems in our country. Results - The average age of onset of the disease was 17.6 years, with a female predominance (8/13). The signs at the beginning were mostly all neurological (71.4%), then psychiatric (19%) or hepatic (19%). The most frequent neurological signs were limb dystonia (81%), dysarthria (76%), tremors (76%) or motor disorders (71.4%). Sometimes there was hypersalivation or writing disorders. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 19 patients. Eighteen patients had clinical and/or biological liver involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical tests, which found a low level of copper in the blood, a low level of ceruloplasmin, and a very high level of copper in the urine. Brain computed tomography shows cortical and/or subcortical atrophy (37%), and/or low density of central gray nuclei (35%). Treatment was based on D-penicillamine and/or zinc sulfate, depending on the availability of the drugs. The evolution was favorable in 18 patients (85%) and not good in 42.8% of the cases. Six of the first patients had poor outcomes after many years of follow-up. Ultimately, only 12 patients (57%) had a very good outcome. Family research conducted among 17 patients revealed 13 familial cases. The only predictor of poor outcome was therapeutic noncompliance (p = 0.006). Conclusions - Neurological presentations are traditional during Wilson's disease, but are often ignored. We must suspect the disease in children with writing disorders or school failure and in adults, with neurological symptoms in a patient with liver disease. We should not hesitate to consider it even in the face of purely psychiatric signs, and it is better to know how to look for the neurological ones.

2289,Current principles of Wilson's disease: diagnosis and treatment. [Polish],"Wilson's disease, also defined as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an important clinical problem in young adults that still causes diagnostic difficulties. Over the course of the last decade, the genetic background of the disease has been definitively established and elucidated, confirming the variety of genetic mutations responsible for its origin. The current treatment scheme for the disease has been developed and established. Its goal is to remove excess toxic copper ions from the body as quickly as possible. In the initial phase of treatment, administration of traditional and recently introduced chelating agents generally results in prompt excretion of copper stores in the tissues and maintenance of balanced copper metabolism. In chronic therapy, zinc compounds, which induce intestinal and hepatic metallothionein synthesis, have gained more common application. Pharmacological therapy for Wilson's disease, constant and for life, administered after its early diagnosis, allows long periods of patient survival, often comparable to the normal population.",,"Najda, J.;Stella-Holowiecka, B.;Machalski, M.;Woszczyk, D.;Mykala-Ciesla, J.",2002,,,0,0,
2290,Copper metabolic defects and liver disease: environmental aspects,"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for many biological processes. Cu homeostasis is generally well maintained by built-in controls on intestinal absorption, biliary excretion, and intrahepatic storage. Copper deficiency disorders are rare. Acute Cu toxicity occasionally occurs in accidental Cu sulfate poisoning. Chronic Cu toxicity in the form of liver cirrhosis and other organ damage is classically seen in Wilson's disease (genetic abnormality of Cu metabolism) and in the presumed environmental disorder Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (CHF). The clinical, epidemiological and treatment aspects of CCI are described. The evidence linking CHF with environmental Cu is (i) a considerable increase in hepatic Cu; (ii) early introduction of Cu-contaminated milk boiled or stored in brass containers; (iii) dramatic decrease in ICC throughout the country coinciding with the change in feeding boats; and (iv) continued long-term remission in patients treated with D-penicillamine after drug withdrawal. The nature and role of a second factor in the causation of CHF remain unclear, although a genetic predisposition is strongly suspected. Scattered reports of disease similar to CHF from the West (idiopathic copper toxicosis, endemic Tyrolean childhood cirrhosis), suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic, or both) may lead to the same end-stage liver disease: 'echogenetic' disorders.

[Chinese],"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of gandou tablet I (GDI), a Chinese herbal recipe, on bile trace element content in patients with hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). METHODS: Before and after 4 weeks of treatment with orally administered GDI, bile from 32 cases of ALD was collected by duodenal drainage for determination of bile trace elements, including copper, zinc, iron, and calcium, by absorption spectrum spectrophotometer. atomic, and were compared with those of 30 cases of patients without HLD as control. RESULTS: The contents of copper, iron and the copper/zinc ratio were obviously lower, while the content of calcium was much higher (P < 0.01), in the HLD group before GDI treatment than in the control ( P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). ), but zinc content was not significantly different between the two groups. Biliary copper production after GDI treatment increased significantly compared to that before treatment (P < 0.05), but zinc, iron, calcium contents and copper/zinc ratio did not change markedly. CONCLUSION: Impairment of biliary copper outflow was one of the mechanisms for copper storage in the body of patients with LD. GDI could promote biliary copper excretion in HLD patients.",,"Hu, W.

2292,The hepatic form of Wilson's disease in young patients. [Czech],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism with highly varied clinical and biochemical symptoms. The hepatic and neurological forms are the most frequent manifestations of this rare disease. In schoolchildren and adolescents, symptoms of liver damage predominate. In a retrospective study, 19 patients with biochemical signs of liver disease manifested before the age of 18 years were evaluated. The diagnosis of WD was established at the age of 7 to 27 years. One patient was admitted with fulminant hepatic failure who was treated by acute liver transplantation at the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague. Only 9 of 18 patients with chronic liver disease at the time of diagnosis met Sternlieb's diagnostic criteria. These patients had low levels of ceruloplasmin (0.08-0.18 g/l) and a high copper content in hepatic dry matter (783 ug/g +/- 323 [SD]). In the remaining 9 patients the ceruloplasmin level was normal, however, in 8 a high content of copper was found in the hepatic dry matter (696 ug/g (+)- 352[SD]. The last patient in this group presented Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring syndrome It was possible to confirm the high copper content in liver dry matter only after one year of treatment with penicillinamine because at the time of diagnosis poor coagulation did not allow liver biopsy. statistically significant difference in hepatic dry matter copper content in patients meeting and not meeting Sternlieb's criteria Statistically significant differences were found between both groups in plasma copper levels and in 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Histological examination of the liver under a light microscope revealed findings ranging from minimal changes associated with the presence of glycogen nuclei in hepatocytes. up to chronic active hepatitis. In the 19 patients the H1069Q gene mutation was examined and the results were positive in 39.8%. In 3 asymptomatic patients it was present in a homozygous form. CONCLUSION: Early detection of the atypical form of WD remains very difficult. The gold standard remains in all cases the evaluation of copper in dry liver tissue. Direct DNA analysis will also occupy an important place in the near future, although its use is limited not only by the large number of known mutations but also by the economic costs of the method.",,"Smolka, V.;Frysak, Z.;Kozak, L.;Mathonova, J.;Jezdinska, V.;Novak, Z.;Hrckova, Y.;Vrabelova, S.",2000,Jan,,0,0,

To assess whether life-associated liver transplantation (LRLT) can correct copper metabolism in WD patients, we studied two children who underwent LRLT due to fulminant liver failure. They were 7 and 13 years old when the LRLT was performed. Serum ceruloplasmin levels, serum copper levels, urinary copper excretion, and liver copper concentrations were measured. Serum ceruloplasmin levels (16.7 +/- 1.2 mg/dl) and serum copper levels (67.0 +/- 1.4 mg/dl) were below the normal range after LRLT in the case 1. In both patients, urinary copper excretion was markedly reduced after LRLT, but not normalized (case 1, 191.2 +/- 182.2 mug/d; case 2, 140.0 +/- 156 .7mug/d). Liver copper concentrations were slightly elevated (case 1, 158.8 +/- 44.6 ug/g dry weight; case 2, 147.0 ug/g dry weight) after LRLT in both cases, but they did not exceed 250 ug/g of dry weight. LRLT is a curative procedure in Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. However, this study indicates that copper metabolism conditions in WD patients undergoing LRLT are similar to those of heterozygous genetic carriers. Because living related donors are the parents who carry the abnormal gene, LRLT cannot fully restore copper balance in WD patients.",,"Komatsu, H.;Fujisawa, T.;Inui, A.;Sogo, T.;Sekine, I.;Kodama, H.;Uemoto, S.;Tanaka, K.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1399-0012.2002.01074.x,0,0,

To explore the roles of bacterial ATPase residues homologous to those involved in human disease, we have introduced several point mutations in ZntA. Mutants P401L, D628A, and P634L correspond to Wilson's disease mutations P992L, D1267A, and P1273L, respectively. The D628A and P634L mutations are located in the C-terminal part of the phosphorylation domain in the so-called hinge motif conserved in all P-type ATPases. P401L resides near the N-terminal part of the phosphorylation domain, while the H475Q mutations and P476L affect the heavy metal ATPase-specific HP motif in the nucleotide-binding domain. All mutants show reduced ATPase activity corresponding to 0-37% of wild-type activity. Mutants P401L, H475Q and P476L are poorly phosphorylated by both ATP and P<inf>i</inf>. Their dephosphorylation rates are slow. The D628A mutant is inactive and cannot be phosphorylated at all. In contrast, the P634L mutant with six separate residues in the same domain shows normal phosphorylation by ATP. However, phosphorylation by P<inf>i</inf> is almost absent. In the absence of added ADP, the P634L mutant dephosphorylates much more slowly than wild-type, whereas in the presence of ADP the rate of dephosphorylation is faster than wild-type. We conclude that the P634L mutation affects the conversion between E<inf>1</inf>P and E<inf>2</inf>P states such that the mutant favors E<inf>1</inf> or E <inf>1</inf>Status P.",,"Okkeri, J.;Bencomo, E.;Pietila, M.;Haltia, T.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02810.x,0,0,

2309,Cardiac involvement in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. One of the reported manifestations is cardiac involvement. Methods: We studied 42 patients with Wilson's disease (19 men and 23 women, mean age 34+/-10 years) and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent a complete echocardiographic examination; 24-h Holter ECG monitoring was performed in 23 patients with Wilson's disease. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, patients with Wilson's disease had increased interventricular septal thickness (9.5+/-1.4 vs. 8.6+/-1.1 mm, p < 0.01 ) and the posterior wall of the left ventricle (LV) (9.1+/- 1.3 vs. 8.2+/-1.0 mm, p < 0.01). Although the two groups did not differ in LV mass index, relative LV wall thickness was significantly increased in patients with Wilson's disease compared with control subjects (0.39+/-0.06 vs. at 0.34+/-0.04 p < 0.001). LV concentric remodeling was present in 9 patients (21%) and LV hypertrophy in one patient. LV systolic function showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower values in patients with Wilson's disease (EF 62+/-5% vs. 64+/-5%, p = 0.06). Diastolic filling and the frequency of valvular abnormalities were comparable in both groups. Established echocardiographic abnormalities did not correlate with the type of Wilson's disease manifestation, the presence of the His1069G1n mutation, laboratory parameters, or the duration and type of therapy. Twenty-four-hour Holter ECG monitoring detected ECG abnormalities in 10 patients (42%), the most frequent findings being supraventricular tachycardia and frequent supraventricular ectopic beats.

Although it appears that only a minority of IMDs have these effects, experience is still being gained. For some disorders, patients will not have reached childbearing age. Pregnancies in this group of patients will increase as management of IMD in childhood and adolescence improves. Physicians should be aware of possible complications and carefully consider the best way to manage these conditions. Ideally, patients should be followed into adult life by a specialist clinical team, who can implement a planned approach to conception and pregnancy, but this is often not possible. For disorders in which the risk of complications is well established (eg, phenylketonuria), optimal treatment can lead to good fetal and maternal outcome. It is also important to consider the possibility that IMD is present in fetuses from pregnancies affected by nonimmune hydrops, maternal HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), or acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",,"Preece, M.

Early diagnosis is necessary to prevent complications such as cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and kidney failure. Early supportive treatment, particularly intravenous N-acetylcysteine, may be effective, but liver transplantation is usually the definitive treatment and therefore early referral to a specialized liver transplant unit is mandatory. Chronic liver failure may be due to unresolved neonatal liver disease, either hereditary biliary hypoplasia or extrahepatic biliary atresia, whereas in older children, autoimmune liver disease or cystic fibrosis are the most common causes.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the mutation of the ATP7B gene that leads to the accumulation of toxic copper mainly in the liver and brain and in other organs such as the kidney and cornea. Measurements were made by <sup>125</sup>I-radioimmunoassay. No sex differences or correlation were found between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results in patients with Wilson's disease. It is suggested that the significantly elevated level of plasma nociceptin is due to inhibition of Zn-metallopeptidases that inactivate nociceptin (aminopeptidase N, endopeptidase 24.15) by toxic levels of copper, as it is known to change the central Zn atom a Cu results in an approximate 50% reduction of inhibition in the activity of these enzymes.

2313,"Reduction of copper and metallothionein in toxic milk mice by tetrathiomolybdate, but not by deferiprone","Copper is essential for life and toxic. Aberrant regulation of copper at the level of intracellular transport has been associated with inherited diseases, including Wilson's disease (WND) in humans. WND results in accumulation of copper and the copper-zinc transporter protein metallothionein (MT) in the liver and other tissues, liver degeneration, and neurological dysfunction. The toxic milk (TX) mutation in mice results in a phenotype that mimics human WND, and TX has been proposed to be a model of the disease. We characterized TX mice as a model of altered metal ion and MT levels during development and after treatment with the metal ion chelators tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and deferiprone (L1). We report that liver, kidney, and brain copper and MT are elevated in TX mice at 3 and 12 months of age. Zinc was significantly higher in TX mouse liver, but not in brain and kidney, at both time points. Nodules appeared spontaneously in livers of TX mice at 8-12 months that maintained high copper levels, but with more normal morphology and decreased MT levels. Treatment of TX mice with TTM significantly reduced elevated liver copper and MT levels. Transient increases in blood and kidney copper accompanied TTM treatment and indicated that renal excretion was a major route of elimination. L1 treatment, on the other hand, had no effect on copper and MT in the liver or kidneys, but did result in increased levels of copper and MT in the brain. These data indicate that TTM, but not L1, may be useful in treating copper overload diseases, including WND. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Czachor, J. D.;Cherian, M.

2315,Roles of metallothionein in copper homeostasis: responses to Cu-deficient diets in mice,"Metallothionein (MT) protects the body from harmful non-essential metals and excess essential metals. Copper (Cu) is an essential metal, and its concentration in the body is regulated at a constant level between excesses and deficiencies. The copper that accumulates in the livers of patients with Wilson's disease and its animal model, the Long-Evans rats with tan fur (LEC), is in the form of Cu, Zn-MT, with MT being a antioxidant. Contrary to efficient MT production in response to excessive Cu accumulation in LEC rats, Cu binding to MT only occurs marginally under normal conditions. However, the present study revealed that Cu binds MT more with severe Cu deficiency.

2317,Tetrathiomolybdate cancer therapy: Antiangiogenesis by lowering body copper - A review,"new anti-copper drug, tetrathiomolybdate (TM), developed for Wilson's disease, is a very promising anti-angiogenic agent. Copper levels reduced to an antiangiogenic window by TM have shown anticancer efficacy in a variety of animal models, as well as in patients. The only significant toxicity so far results from overtreatment and excessive copper depletion in the bone marrow. The resulting anemia and/or leukopenia can be easily treated by reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. The underlying concept of MT's efficacy as an anticancer agent is that when the body's copper status is in the window, cellular copper needs are met and toxicity is avoided. Copper status is relatively easily monitored by monitoring serum ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein secreted by the liver at a rate that depends on the amount of copper in the liver available to incorporate into the protein. The authors speculate that the copper level is a primitive regulator of angiogenesis and growth signaling that has been maintained throughout evolution.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Merajver, S.

Rats receiving 80 mg zinc acetate daily by gavage and control rats receiving no treatment were sacrificed after 1 or 2 weeks. Using immunohistochemistry and analytical chemistry techniques, we revealed that treated rats had higher levels of MT in liver and kidney cells compared to untreated rats. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in treated compared to untreated rats, while Cu concentrations were decreased in liver and kidney, as indicated by analytical chemistry analyses. MT levels also decreased with the treatment period. A histochemical procedure, obtained by Cu-metallothionein autofluorescence, confirms these findings: after 2 weeks, the signal decreased in both liver and kidney sections. This gives a better understanding of the mechanism of Cu metabolism in the two considered tissues. These results suggest that Zn acts both to compete for absorption on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelium and to induce MT synthesis.",,"Santon, A.;Giannetto, S.;Sturniolo, G.;Medici, V.;D'Inca, R.;Irato, P.;Albergoni, V.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00418-002-0380-8,0,0,

We present two patients with Wilson's disease and ALF treated with the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculation System (MARS). Both patients met poor prognosis criteria. Since LTx was not immediately available in either case, MARS was used as a bridge to LTx. In Case 1, serum bilirubin decreased from 803 to 425 Âµmol/L after 3 treatments, but increased to 656 Âµmol/L during a break, and decreased again to 457 Âµmol/L with additional treatment. Serum copper decreased from 53.7 mumol/l to 35.8 mumol/l after the first treatment session and to 17.4 mumol/l at the end of treatment. In Case 2, MARS treatment for 2 weeks reduced serum bilirubin from 1200 to 450 mumol/L and copper from 35 to 13 mumol/L with marked improvement in encephalopathy and reduction in ammonia (59 to 34 mumol/L).

2324,MetalotioneÃ­na y enzimas antioxidantes en ratas Long-Evans Cinnamon tratadas with zinc,"The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant animal model for Wilson's disease. Abnormal accumulation of Cu and Fe in the liver and low concentrations of both ceruloplasmin and Cu in serum are known to occur in these rats. The accumulation of Cu is explained by the defective expression of the Cu transporter P-type ATPase gene, homologous to the gene for Wilson's disease (ATP7B). The objective of this work was to clarify the mechanism of action of Zn, and to verify the role that this metal plays in LEC rats in short-term treatment experiments (1 and 2 weeks) on concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, metallothionein (MT ), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh<sup>8</sup>dG) and on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. It is well known that Zn induces MT and has the ability to prevent the redox active metals Cu and Fe from binding and causing oxidative damage at the active sites of Zn metalloenzymes and non-specific binding sites of proteins. . Zn administration reduces Cu and Fe transport from the intestinal mucosa to the serosa through competitive mechanisms. Our findings show that zinc acetate treatment increases tissue Zn and MT contents and decreases liver and kidney Cu and Fe concentrations, even if liver Zn and MT concentrations decrease with the treatment period. . The induction of MT synthesis by Zn contributes to the reduction of free radicals produced by Cu and Fe. We also observed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the liver decreases with the duration of treatment in association with hepatic decline. of Cu and Fe. However, SOD activity in the kidney is increased in untreated rats at 2 weeks compared to those untreated for 1 week.",,"Medici, V.;Santon, A.;Sturniolo, G.;D'Inca, R.;Giannetto, S.;Albergoni, V.;Irato, P.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00204-002-0377-z,0,0,

Methods: Iron indices (ferritin, transferrin saturation [TS], serum iron), liver parameters, prevalence and significance of C282Y and H63D HFE mutations were studied in 40 Caucasian patients unrelated to Wilson's disease and 295 healthy controls. Thanks to specific treatment, Wilson's disease was well controlled in all but one patient. Results: Allele frequencies for mutations C282Y (11.3% vs. 6.2%) and H63D (18.8% vs. 16.4%) did not differ between patients with Wilson's disease and healthy controls. A patient with C282Y homozygous HH and Wilson's disease was identified who exhibited progressive liver disease despite reasonable venous and copper chelation therapy. No differences in iron indices and liver values were observed between heterozygous HFE and wild-type HFE patients with Wilson's disease. Higher serum ferritin levels were observed in patients with Wilson's disease compared to healthy controls (149 +/- 26 ug/1 vs. 87 +/- 8 ug/1; P < 0.03).

Over the past 35 years, zinc deficiency in humans has been recognized as a result of nutritional factors and various disease states. Many of the clinical features of liver cirrhosis have been linked to zinc deficiency, including loss of body hair, testicular atrophy, poor appetite, immune dysfunction, altered taste and smell, reduced vitamin A metabolism, and of thyroid hormone, impaired protein metabolism, delayed wound healing. and decreased ability to eliminate the drug. One of the most interesting and novel aspects of the presumed role of zinc deficiency in producing the clinical features of liver cirrhosis is the possible relationship between zinc and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Long-term zinc supplementation in HD patients improves neurological symptoms and metabolic parameters. In Wilson's disease, an inherited liver copper defect, zinc is used for maintenance and treatment of presymptomatic, pregnant and pediatric patients. Zinc may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C.

2334,Wilson's disease,"Sir Alexander Kinnear Wilson made the original description of a hepatolenticular degeneration syndrome nearly a century ago, correctly postulating a connection between the observed liver cirrhosis and neurological signs and symptoms. However, it was not known then that copper was the etiopathological agent. Although the genetic basis of this disease is now clear, our understanding of its pathogenesis is still evolving. Wilson's disease (WD), as the syndrome was later called, is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase 7B (ATP7B) gene on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a copper transporter in hepatocytes Critical for hepatic excretion of excess copper in bile. WD, although a relatively rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism present in approximately 1 in 30,000 people, is often considered in the differential diagnosis of patients younger than 45 years with fulminant hepatic failure or unexplained liver disease or in patients with symptoms neurological or psychiatric and liver disease. When WD is identified and treated appropriately, disease progression is prevented and copper-induced injury can be reversed. Specific clinical and biochemical findings used to establish the diagnosis include serum ceruloplasmin, serum and urinary copper, Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, and liver histology, histochemistry, and copper content. Identification of the gene has allowed testing with haplotype analysis for siblings of identified patients and direct mutation analysis for de novo diagnosis in specific populations with dominant mutations. Treatment is lifelong medical therapy with chelators or zinc to remove copper or prevent its absorption, or liver transplantation, which cures the metabolic defect.",,"Schilsky, M. L.",2002,,,0,0,

2340,Molecular diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical criteria, but its low sensitivity is increasingly recognized. Genetic diagnosis is considered impractical due to the large coding region of the ATP7B gene and the extreme diversity of mutations. We evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of genetic diagnosis in WD. The coding region of the ATP7B gene was scanned by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in 6 cases in which the diagnosis of WD was uncertain. In addition, we attempted molecular diagnosis in 26 WD patients of similar ethnic origin but with variable disease manifestations. In 6 individuals in whom the biochemical/clinical diagnosis was uncertain, DNA analysis was helpful in assigning their status with respect to WD. Molecular diagnosis identified presymptomatic individuals in WD-affected families and assigned wild-type or heterozygous carrier status to individuals previously diagnosed as affected. In 26 WD patients, 92% of the disease alleles were identified. The most common mutations were H1069Q, L936X and 2532delA, which represent 48, 10 and 8% of the disease alleles, respectively. Three new mutations were identified: Q898R, 3061(-1)g -> a, and 3972insC. Genetic diagnosis is feasible for WD.

2352,"The copper chelating agent, trientine, suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis in murine hepatocellular carcinoma cells","Angiogenesis is now recognized as a crucial process in the development of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since HCC is known as a hypervascular tumor, antiangiogenesis is a promising approach to inhibit HCC development. Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is used in clinical practice as an alternative copper (Cu) chelating agent for patients with intolerance to penicillamine or Wilson's disease. In our study, we examined the effect of Cu chelating agents on tumor development and angiogenesis in the murine HCC xenograft model. Although both trientine and penicillamine in drinking water suppressed tumor growth, trientine exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than penicillamine. In combination with a Cu-deficient diet, both trientine and penicillamine almost abolished HCC development. Trientine treatment resulted in a marked suppression of neovascularization and increased apoptosis in the tumor, while tumor cell proliferation itself was not altered. In vitro studies also showed that trientine is not cytotoxic to tumor cells. On the other hand, it significantly suppressed the proliferation of endothelial cells. These results suggested that Cu plays a critical role in tumor development and angiogenesis in murine HCC cells, and Cu chelators, especially trientine, could inhibit angiogenesis and enhance apoptosis in tumor with consequent growth suppression. tumor in vivo.

2354,"Copper in disorders with neurological symptoms: Alzheimer's, Menkes and Wilson diseases","Copper is an essential element for the activity of several physiologically important enzymes. Enzyme-related dysfunctions can contribute to serious neurological symptoms and neurological diseases: Copper is a component of cytochrome c oxidase, which catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water, the essential step in cellular respiration. Copper is a cofactor of Cu/Zn-superoxide-dismutase that plays a key role in the cellular response to oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, copper is a constituent of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, a fundamental enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. A detailed exploration of the biological significance and functional properties of proteins associated with neurological symptoms will have a major impact on understanding disease mechanisms and may accelerate the development and testing of new therapeutic approaches. Copper-binding proteins play an important role in establishing and maintaining metal ion homeostasis, in deficiency disorders with neurological symptoms (Menkes disease, Wilson disease) and in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease) . The Menkes and Wilson proteins have been characterized as copper transporters, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease has been proposed to function as a Cu(II) and/or Zn(II) transporter. Experimental, clinical, and epidemiological observations in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and in the genetically inherited copper-dependent disorders Menkes and Wilson's disease are summarized. This could provide a rationale for a link between severely dysregulated metal ion homeostasis and selective neuronal pathology. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",,"Strausak, D.;Mercer, J. F.

2357,Mitochondria and degenerative disorders,"In mammalian cells, mitochondria provide energy from aerobic metabolism. They play an important regulatory role in apoptosis, produce and detoxify free radicals, and serve as a cellular calcium buffer. Neurodegenerative disorders affecting the mitochondria can be divided into those caused by abnormalities of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), either due to abnormalities of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), for example, chronic external ophthalmoplegia, or due to nuclear mutations of the mitochondria. OXPHOS proteins, eg complexes I and II associated with Leigh syndrome. There are diseases caused by nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins other than OXPHOS, such as frataxin in Friedreich's ataxia (probably playing an important role in the mitochondrial-cytosolic iron cycle), paraplegin (possibly a zinc-dependent metalloprotease AAA mitochondrial ATP -ATPases in hereditary spastic paraparesis), and possibly Wilson's disease protein (an abnormal copper-transporting ATP-dependent P-type ATPase associated with Wilson's disease). Huntington's disease is an example of diseases with OXPHOS defects associated with mutations in nuclear genes encoding non-mitochondrial proteins such as huntingtin. There are also disorders with evidence of mitochondrial involvement that cannot yet be assigned. These include Parkinson's disease (where a complex I defect is described and free radicals are generated from dopamine metabolism), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, where there is evidence suggesting mitochondrial compromise perhaps secondary to other anomalies.

However, many biochemical or clinical studies support a high clinical relevance of trace elements, especially zinc, in the therapeutic concepts of diseases. Unfortunately, the boundary between severe (or true) and mild (or subclinical) zinc deficiency is not clearly defined. In addition, methodological problems in the determination of trace elements and misinterpretations of the study results lead to the unjustified assignment of several diseases to the group of zinc deficiency disorders. Another current issue is consideration of the bioavailability of oral commercial trace mineral products. Especially the regulation of zinc absorption in humans under normal conditions and in case of zinc deficiency is not clear at this time. These issues have tangled up the current literature for the clinician active in the zinc field.

Material and methods: Thirty-five male albino Wistar rats were equally divided into 5 groups. The control group (G1) received normal tap water, while the 4 groups (G2, 3, 4, 5) received copper-laden water. After 5 weeks, the rats in G1 and G2 were sacrificed. The remaining rats (G3, 4, 5) received a normal diet for the next 4 weeks. During this period, the fourth group (G4) received zinc sulfate (6.5 mg/kg) and the fifth group (G5) received penicillamine (20 mg/kg). The third group (G3) was left untreated. Results: The amounts of copper deposited in the liver tissues of G2 were significantly higher than those of G1 (p = 0.008). In G3, brain copper levels were significantly higher than in G1 and G2 (p < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively), while liver concentrations were not statistically different. Rats in G5 had significantly lower brain and liver copper levels than in G3 (p = 0.023 and < 0.001, respectively). There was a significant reduction in brain copper levels in G4, compared to G3 (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The reduction of copper levels in liver and brain tissues with penicillamine in copper overloaded rats suggests that mechanisms other than the redistributive effect in the brain may be responsible for the neurological deterioration induced by penicillamine treatment in patients with WD. In addition, zinc may have an early effect in preventing excessive copper deposition, probably by inducing metallothionine synthesis in the liver. In conclusion, zinc can be used in conjunction with chelating agents for the initial control of patients with neurological symptoms.",,"Ozcelik, D.;Eralp, Y.;Oztekin, G.;Dursun, S.;Uzunismail, H.",2001,,,0,0,

[Japanese],"We present the case of a young adult woman with Wilson's disease who presented with a mental disorder and signs in the frontal lobe. The patient was admitted to our neurological unit on October 4, 1999 due to symptoms similar to schizophrenia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and gait disturbance. He had slowly progressive rigidity and dystonia. His parents were second cousins. Neurological examination revealed bilateral pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, frontal lobe signs (includes imitation behavior). Tendon reflexes were slightly exaggerated in all extremities. Bilateral Babinski, Chaddock, and Hoffmann signs were positive. Her verbal IQ on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised was 49. Biochemical examination revealed low plasma concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse cerebral atrophy and enlargement of the lateral ventricles. T<inf>2</inf> weighted MRI images demonstrated a hyperintense signal in both the thalamus and basal ganglia. SPECT showed hypoperfusion in the left frontal lobe, both in the thalamus and in the basal ganglia. EEG revealed a diffuse 2q wave. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and treatment with D-penicillamine 900mg per day was started. This hypoperfusion of the SPECT and EEG findings improved after 2 months of treatment with D-penicillamine. Neurological findings showed a slight improvement.

2370,Alterations of the visual pathway Wilson's disease by electrophysiological study by electroretinography and visual evoked potentials,"The pathogenesis of pattern reversal visual evoked potential (PRVEP) abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) has not been previously investigated. Since electroretinography (ERG) assesses the functional integrity of the retina, it was used in conjunction with PRVEP to localize PRVEP abnormalities in Wilson's patients. Ten newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease underwent PRVEP and flash ERG shortly after the diagnosis was established. PRVEP latencies were prolonged compared to controls (P<0.001). Photopic and scotopic A waves and oscillatory potentials were prolonged (P<0.02) with a reduction in photopic A and B wave amplitudes (P<0.001). Six of these patients underwent repeat PRVEP and flash ERG after clinical improvement with specific therapy. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment visual electrophysiological studies revealed a significant reduction in PRVEP and ERG flash A wave latencies (P < 0.05) with an increase in PRVEP P100 amplitudes (P < 0.05), A waves. and B from flash ERG (p<0.01). These findings confirm the PRVEP changes reported in WD and further demonstrate the reversibility of retinal dysfunction that partially contributes to PRVEP abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ERG in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. Furthermore, there have been no previous reports in the literature evaluating the effect of specific treatment on PRVEP and GERD in Wilson's disease.

2371,Comparative Efficacy of Various Potential Treatments for Copper Mobilization in Copper-Overloaded Rats,"D-penicillamine (DPA) is effective in the treatment of Wilson's disease, while zinc salts are also used as therapy for this copper transport disorder. Recently, it has been shown that the copper chelators 1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecane tetrahydrochloride (TAUD) and tetraethylenepentamine pentahydrochloride (TETREN) could be useful for copper mobilization in rats. Because these agents could be potential clinical alternatives to DPA for patients with Wilson's disease who are intolerant to this drug, we examined whether oral administration of TAUD and TETREN could have an effect on copper mobilization in experimental copper-loaded rats. The efficacy of a combined administration of zinc and DPA, TAUD or TETREN was also evaluated. The rats were copper loaded with 0.125% copper acetate in water for 12 weeks. After this period, DPA, TAUD, and TETREN were administered by gavage at 0.67 mmol/kg/d for 5 d, and zinc was administered at 2.5 mg Zn/kg/d. Twelve weeks of copper loading resulted in a 32-fold increase in total liver copper. TETREN was the most effective chelator to increase urinary copper excretion. However, it did not significantly reduce liver copper levels. In turn, the combined administration of zinc and chelating agents significantly reduced the amount of copper found in feces. Although TAUD and TETREN showed similar or superior efficacy to DPA in copper mobilization, concomitant treatment with chelating agents and zinc salts should be ruled out based on current results.",,"Domingo, J.

These dilemmas have for the most part not been resolved by the identification and cloning of the Wilson's disease gene. Objectives - To report our experience over three decades with patients with Wilson's disease to illustrate the various patterns of presentation and thus broaden the diagnostic approach. Methods - Clinical and laboratory findings of 30 patients with Wilson's disease were reviewed. Results - Twenty-two patients presented liver manifestations (eight with fulminant liver failure and 14 with chronic liver disease), three with neurological disease and one with hemolysis; four were asymptomatic siblings of patients with Wilson's disease. Seventy percent were diagnosed within six months of symptom onset, but diagnosis was delayed up to nine years. The age range at the time of diagnosis was wide (7-58 years) and five patients were over 40 years of age. In patients with nonfulminant disease, 18% did not have Kayser-Fleischer rings or low ceruloplasmin levels. Elevated liver copper concentrations were found in all but one patient who had undergone six years of penicillamine treatment. In fulminant hepatic failure (n = 8), additional features useful in diagnosis included evidence of hemolysis, elevated urinary copper (range 844-9375 Âµg/24 h) and elevated non-ceruloplasmin copper (range 325-1743 Âµg/L) . Conclusions - The diagnosis of Wilson's disease still depends mainly on the evaluation of clinical and laboratory evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. Neither feature is reliable, but the diagnosis can usually be made whenever it is suspected.

2376,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVII: Treatment during pregnancy,"Wilson's disease therapy continues to evolve. In 1997, zinc acetate was added to the Food and Drug Administration's list of approved drugs, which includes penicillamine and trientine. Zinc's anti-copper mechanism of action is unique. It induces metallothionein in intestinal cells, which binds to copper and prevents its transfer to the blood. As the intestinal cells die and shed, the contained copper is eliminated in the feces. Thus, zinc prevents the intestinal absorption of copper. It is universally accepted that pregnant patients with Wilson's disease should remain on anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. There are numerous reports of such patients discontinuing penicillamine therapy to protect their fetus from teratogenicity, only to suffer severe deterioration and even death from renewed copper toxicity. Penicillamine and trientine have teratogenic effects in animals, and penicillamine has known teratogenic effects in humans. In this report we discuss the outcomes of 26 pregnancies in 19 women who were on zinc therapy throughout their pregnancy. There is good evidence that zinc protects the mother's health during pregnancy.

2380,Oxidative phosphorylation defects in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease,"Bottom. Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in a P-type ATPase and is associated with copper deposition in the liver and brain. The WD protein is present in the trans-Golgi network and can also be imported into mitochondria. The WD protein functions as a P-type copper transporter ATPase in the Golgi, but any action in mitochondria is currently unknown. Methods. We studied mitochondrial function and aconitase activity in liver tissue with WD and compared the results with those of a series of healthy controls and patients without WD. Recommendations. There was evidence of severe mitochondrial dysfunction in the livers of WD patients. Enzyme activities decreased as follows: complex I by 62%, complex II + III by 52%, complex IV by 33%, and aconitase by 71%. These defects did not appear to be secondary to penicillamine use, cholestasis, or impaired hepatocellular synthetic function. Interpretation. The results show that there is a defect of energy metabolism in WD. The pattern of enzyme defects suggests that free radical formation and oxidative damage, likely mediated by mitochondrial copper accumulation, are important in the pathogenesis of WD.

[Serbian],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability of the liver to excrete copper into the bile and incorporate copper into ceruloplasmin. The gradual accumulation of copper in various tissues leads to organ dysfunction, thus untreated disease is invariably fatal. Because the manifestations of Wilson's disease are varied and the disease is masked as well as anything else, recognition of the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major problem leading to serious underdiagnosis of the disease. The longer recognition and diagnosis are delayed, the greater the risk of permanent damage, primarily to the liver and/or brain. The availability of effective therapy and the risk of delaying therapy make early diagnosis critical. Current therapies include chelators that increase urinary copper excretion and tetrathiomolybdate that complexes with copper and blocks copper absorption in the intestine or renders blood copper nontoxic. In cases of liver failure, liver transplantation is an effective treatment. Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are discussed.",,"Vucelic, B.",2000,,,0,0,
2384,Zinc as initial treatment for Wilson's disease in children. [Serbian],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited copper accumulation disease caused by failure of biliary excretion of excess copper. Accumulated copper causes tissue damage. The chelating drugs penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of therapy, and most WD patients were treated with potentially toxic cupryuretic agents. A more recent approach has used zinc, which blocks copper absorption and increases copper excretion in the feces, and long-term administration induces a negative copper balance. Until recently, most patients had been treated initially with cupryuretic agents to remove excess copper and then maintained on oral zinc. Recently, zinc has also been used for initial treatment and for the treatment of presymptomatic patients. Until now, zinc therapy has shown exceptional efficacy and lack of toxicity. In this article we present our data on the long-term follow-up of three children with WD, whose initial and consecutive treatment was zinc sulfate.

2385,Novel mutations of the ATP7B gene in Japanese patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas, culminating in copper poisoning in these organs. In this study, we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene, ATP7B, in four Japanese patients with WD. Using direct sequencing, we identified five mutations, of which two were new, and 16 polymorphisms, of which 6 were new. Mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame such that a truncated abnormal protein is expected. In contrast to these mutations found in patients with early-onset hepatic type, mutations A874V, R778L, and 3892delGTC were missense mutations or 1-amino acid deletions in frame, and occurred in patients with late-onset hepatoneurological type. The 2871delC and R778L mutations were previously reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients. In particular, R778L is known to be more prevalent in Asian countries than in other countries in the world. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner. Therefore, the accumulation of the types of mutations in Japanese WD patients will facilitate rapid and effective genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients.",,"Kusuda, Y.;Hamaguchi, K.;Mori, T.;Shin, R.;Seike, M.;Sakata, T.",2000,,,0,0,
2386,Biological regulation of copper and selective copper removal: Therapy for Wilson's disease and its molecular mechanism. [Japanese],"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element and constitutes the active site of Cu redox enzymes such as Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD), ceruloplasmin, and cytochrome c oxidase. Among hereditary diseases due to a defect in Cu metabolism, Menkes disease (caused by Cu deficiency) and Wilson's disease (caused by excessive Cu accumulation) have been shown to be caused by mutation of genes encoding Cu binding. ATPase for Cu efflux, ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Following the identification of these causative genes, intracellular Cu transporters (Cu chaperones) specific for the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and Cu, Zn-SOD, were discovered, and these findings have facilitated the study of the underlying mechanisms of Cu biological regulation. . Apart from these physiological and biochemical studies, toxicological studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms for the occurrence of acute hepatitis caused by Cu accumulation in the liver of an animal model for Wilson's disease, LEC rats. In these toxicological studies, two biological aspects of metallothionein (MT) have been proposed, that is, antioxidant and prooxidant depending on the Cu/Zn ratio in the Cu-containing MT. This article analyzes the recent findings on the biological regulation of Cu and on the toxicological aspect of Cu. Cu is known to form a stable ternary complex with molybdenum and sulfur under reducing conditions in the body. Based on this observation, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) has been applied to remove Cu from the liver of Long-Evans rats with tan coat color (LEC). The precise mechanisms underlying the formation of the complex between Cu bound to MT and TTM were presented, and an appropriate protocol for chelation therapy was also proposed along with the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of side effects.",,"Suzuki, K.

When Zn<sup>2+</sup> was applied together with 2 ÂµM GABA, the block of GABA-mediated currents induced by Zn<sup>2+</sup> was not additive to Cu<sup>2 +-induced block. In the presence of 0.1 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the bath solution, the degree of inhibition of GABA-mediated responses by Zn<sup>2+</sup> was strongly attenuated. 4. Pre-application of 100 muM Zn<sup>2+</sup> for 10 s, terminated 1 s before exposure to 2 muM GABA, did not affect GABA current in Cu<sup>-free solution 2+</sup>, but eased its block by 0.1 muM Cu<sup>2+</sup>.

2390,Metabolic fate of the insoluble copper/tetrathiomolybdate complex formed in the liver of LEC rats with excess tetrathiomolybdate,"Copper (Cu) that accumulates in a metallothionein (MT)-bound form in the liver of Long-Evans rats with tan fur (LEC rats), an animal model of Wilson's disease, can be removed from the MT with tetrathiomolybdate (TTM). However, it is known that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex that forms with excess TTM is deposited in the liver. In the present study, the metabolic fate of the insoluble Cu/TTM complex was investigated. LEC rats were injected with TTM at the dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days and fed standard or low Cu diet for 14 days after the last injection. About 95% of Cu in the liver became insoluble along with Mo. Cu concentration in liver supernatants of rats fed the standard diet was significantly increased compared with that of rats dissected 24 h after the last injection. (control rats), while the concentration in rats fed the low Cu diet remained at a level comparable to that in controls. The rate of Cu accumulation in the livers of rats fed the standard diet did not differ before and after treatment, suggesting that there was no rebound effect of TTM treatment. These results suggest that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is resolubilized in the liver, and that the solubilized complex is excreted in the bile and blood, that is, the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is not the source of Cu reaccumulation in the liver. the MT-bound form in the liver after TTM treatment. It was concluded that once Cu forms a complex with TTM, the metal is excreted immediately in soluble form or slowly in insoluble form into bile and blood.

We examined the ATP7B gene in two Japanese sisters with Wilson's disease who had fulminant hepatic failure but who did not have Kayser-Fleischer rings or abnormal neurological findings. Genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood of patients and their relatives. The entire ATP7B exons and their associated splice junctions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of all exons was performed using a non-radioactive sequencing method. Sequencing of exon 12 of ATP7B revealed a 9 bp deletion. The mutation deleted 922Gly, 923Tyr, and 924Phe, and three conserved residues in the Menkes gene, ATP7A, located in the fifth transmembrane region. Of the 14 family members tested, 7 were normal and 7 were heterozygous for the deletion. Mean serum copper and cerulopasmin levels were significantly lower in family members who were heterozygous for the deletion than in normal family members, and two heterozygous family members showed abnormally low levels of cerulopasmin; however, there was no difference in the mean levels of aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase between the two groups.",,"Okada, T.;Morise, T.;Takeda, Y.;Mabuchi, H.",2000,April,,0,0,

2398,Dissolution of copper-rich granules in hepatic lysosomes by D-penicillamine prevents the development of fulminant hepatitis in Long-Evans cinnamon rats,"Background/Objective: The Long-Evans cinnamon rat has a mutation homologous to the human Wilson's disease gene, leading to a large accumulation of copper and the development of hepatitis. D-penicillamine, a copper-chelating drug widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, has also been shown to prevent hepatitis in Long-Evans cinnamon rats. The objectives of this study were: i) to investigate the efficacy of D-penicillamine when administered to already affected animals, and ii) to elucidate the drug's mechanism of action. Methods: Long-Evans cinnamon rats were divided into groups according to age and D-penicillamine treatment. The drug was administered orally before and after the onset of hepatitis. Livers were examined by light and electron microscopy. The effect of D-penicillamine on the subcellular distribution and binding of copper was investigated in more detail. Finally, the interaction between D-penicillamine and liver-specific copper-binding proteins was studied in vitro. Results: When D-penicillamine was administered to healthy or diseased animals, hepatitis was prevented or reversed, respectively. The drug particularly inhibited the disease-specific accumulation of copper in the lysosomes of hepatocytes, tissue macrophages, and Kupffer cells. When administered to diseased animals, the drug sequestered copper particularly from insoluble lysosomal particles. According to the results obtained in vitro, it is likely that the mobilization of this copper proceeds through the solubilization of these particles. In contrast, and as supported by in vitro data, D-penicillamine had only a minor effect on metallothionein-bound copper in the cytosol. Conclusion: Our findings in the Long-Evans cinnamon rat provide some conclusions about the mechanism of action of D-penicillamine in the therapy of Wilson's disease. The drug prevents the formation or promotes the solubilization of copper-rich particles that are produced in the lysosomes of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease. Once chelated with D-penicillamine, copper could be excreted in the urine. However, the mobilization of copper by D-penicillamine appears to be limited due to the metal's binding to metallothionein in the liver cytosol. This copper, even in relatively high concentrations, appears to be well tolerated.",,"Klein, D.;Lichtmannegger, J.;Heinzmann, U.;Summer, K. H.",2000,February,,0,0,
2399,CopA â a P-type ATPase that translocates Cu(I) from Escherichia coli,"The product of the copA gene, a putative copper-translocating P-type ATPase, has been shown to be involved in copper resistance in Escherichia coli. The copA gene was disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin gene by homologous recombination. The mutant strain was more sensitive to copper salts but not to salts of other metals, suggesting a role in copper homeostasis. The copper-sensitive phenotype could be rescued by complementation with a plasmid carrying E. coli copA or Enterococcus hirae copB. CopA expression was induced by copper or silver salts but not by zinc or cobalt. Everted membrane vesicles from copA-expressing cells exhibited an accumulation of ATP-coupled copper, presumably as Cu(I). The results indicate that CopA is a Cu(I) translocation efflux pump that is similar to the copper pumps associated with Menkes and Wilson diseases and provides a useful prokaryotic model for these human diseases.",,"Rensing, C.;Fan, B.;Sharma, R.;Mitra, B.;Rosen, B.

TTM was injected intravenously as a single dose of 2, 10, or 50 mg TTM/kg body weight in LEC and Wistar rats (normal Cu metabolism), and Cu and molybdenum (Mo) concentrations were then monitored in the bile and plasma with time after injection. In Wistar rats, most of Mo was excreted in urine, only a small amount was excreted in bile, while Cu excreted in urine decreased. However, in LEC rats, Cu and Mo were excreted in the bile and blood, with bile being recognized for the first time as the main route of excretion. Cu excreted in both bile and plasma was accompanied by an equimolar amount of Mo. The relative ratio of the amounts of Cu excreted in bile and plasma was 40/60 for the low and high dose groups, and 70 /30 for the low and high dose groups. medium dose group. The systemic dispositions of Cu mobilized from the liver and Mo complexed with Cu for the kidneys, spleen and brain were also determined along with their urinary excretion. Although Mo in all three organs and Cu in the kidneys and spleen increased or showed a tendency to increase, Cu in the brain did not increase with all doses of TTM.

2403,Wilson's disease therapy. [German],"Wilson's disease is a copper storage disease with an autosomal recessive trait that is predominantly a disorder of the adolescent and young adult. Clinical manifestations are dominated by hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Diagnostic procedures include determination of serum total copper, serum free copper, and serum ceruloplamin concentrations, as well as urinary copper excretion. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be achieved by liver biopsy and histological determination of copper content. The goal of treatment is the reduction of copper concentration in the tissues and copper detoxification. The applied drugs are chelating agents. D-penicillamine and trientine, or zinc. Chelating agents induce renal and biliary excretion of copper and increase metallothionein synthesis, which binds and detoxifies intracellular copper, leading to poor absorption and binding of excess intracellular copper. Zinc treatment results in the induction of hepatic and intestinal metallothionein synthesis. Regular examinations of copper metabolism parameters are necessary to monitor the therapeutic effect. Serum free copper concentrations and urinary copper excretion should reach values less than 10 micrograms/dl and 80 micrograms/day, respectively. Significant improvement in clinical symptoms and normalization of copper metabolism parameters can be expected within six months of initiation of therapy. The anti-copper treatment can be accompanied by a diet low in copper. Lifelong therapy is required and provides a near-normal life expectancy. Discontinuation of treatment leads to reaccumulation of copper, often resulting in fulminant hepatic failure. This can also be seen as the initial presentation in 5% of cases (predominant age 12-25 years). End-stage liver disease and fulminant hepatic failure are indications for liver transplantation by which the genetic defect is phenotypically cured. Here the decoppering treatment is no longer necessary. To this day it is not clear whether severe neurological disorders can also improve.",,"Smolarek, C.;Stremmel, W.",1999,Apr,,0,0,

2413,Treatment of chronic Wilson's disease in 2 patients by plasmapheresis-clinical-biochemical observations. [Croatian],"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) was a historic event [1]. D-pericylamine (d-PAM) showed some potential side effects, such as myasthenia, renal toxicity, etc. In the previous decade, the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) with zinc sulfate started successfully [4]. Danks [7] described the use of exchange transfusions, peritoneal dialysis, and plasmapheresis in the treatment of young patients with WD in acute liver failure. These patients had acute copper intoxication. The results of this study were beneficial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Therapeutic plasmapheresis (PF) has been used in many diseases in which immunological mechanisms have been demonstrated [8, 9]. We started with the use of FP in the treatment of two young chronic patients with Wilson's disease. The clinical picture of the patients worsened, probably due to the decrease in the cupryuretic effect of d-PAM. One patient (1) was not taking d-PAM regularly. In this study, FP was performed with the use of haemonetics V-50 and filter 704. During FP treatment, 2000 mL of plasma was always exchanged, i.e. withdrawn. During the treatment with FP, the patients were hospitalized in the Department of Neurology and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. CLINICAL CASE AND RESULTS: Patient No. 1. A 24-year-old male, born in 1965, presented with a coarse tremor. He was diagnosed with WD at the age of 18 years. Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in the cornea by slit-lamp examination. The disease began when he was 15 years old with polymorphous difficulties. Over time, the tremor became more severe. It was evident when the patient made any movement. The first treatment with FP (1) lasted from February 13 to March 16, 1989. The patient had 10 FPs without any side effects. During treatment with FP the patient felt better. After FP, tremor was significantly reduced and subjective and objective condition improved. Patient (1) was readmitted to the hospital on June 24, 1991 for continuation of FP treatment. Anamnestic data and neurological examination revealed disease progression. His condition worsened, especially tremor. He could not write a single letter (Figures 1-5) and walk without the help of others. His tremor became more severe when he made any type of voluntary movement. The second FP treatment started on June 25, 1991 and ended on July 16, 1991. He received 9 FPs in this series. The treatment was without side effects. Tremor was reduced by approximately 15%. Plasma copper examined before and after 9 PF showed different values (Table 2). This difference (2.79 mumol/l; 23.70%) in plasma copper level was removed from the circulation. Patient no. 2. A 23-year-old male, born in 1966, who came to the hospital with an acute exacerbation of WD. At the age of 16, he was diagnosed with latent psychosis. A year later, the diagnosis of WD was made in hospital when he was 17 years old. Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in the cornea by slit-lamp examination. Treatment with d-PAM and other drugs (BAL, symptomatic therapies, sedatives, antidepressants, etc.) has been accompanied by good and prolonged remissions and brief exacerbations. A few years later, the flare got longer and longer and worse and worse. He was admitted to the hospital on November 28, 1989 with an acute relapse of WD. His condition was very difficult, completely bedridden. PF treatment began on December 26, 1989 and lasted until January 25, 1990. PF treatment was without d-PAM. He only received symptomatic therapies. After a few FPs, he showed side effects with nausea, sometimes vomiting, facial sweating, pulse of about 120/min while blood pressure was normal. Therefore, human albumin was administered the next day and no side effects were observed. Removal of a small amount of plasma copper from the bloodstream correlated well with a small improvement in clinical symptomatology.

RESULTS: The peak latency (PL) and peak-to-peak latency (IPL) of BAEP in untreated patients increased considerably compared to those in the control group, especially in prolongations of III, V, III-V and IV. PL and IPL improved as improvement of clinical symptoms in HLD patients treated with TCM-WM than in untreated patients. The abnormal rates of men and women in BAEP were reduced from 21.97% and 19.05% in untreated patients to 9.09% and 6.75% in treated patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: BAEP not only has a complementary diagnosis but also judges the efficacy of treatment in HLD disease.",,"Xu, S. H.;Cai, Y. L.;Yang, R. M.",1997,Jan,,0,0,
2416,"A late form of Wilson's disease, with a first psychiatric aspect and neuroradiological correlates of pseudo-compulsive stereotypies. [French]","Wilson's disease rarely begins after the third decade and can present with misleading psychiatric symptoms. We observed a 39-year-old white male who developed hysterical behavior followed by frank delusional psychosis. Secondary neurological symptoms such as astasia and dysarthria were misinterpreted as drug-induced. Despite treatment with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate, there was further deterioration with anarthria and pseudocompulsive stereotypies. These latter signs disappeared after five months, while astasia and abasia remained the same and magnetic resonance imaging showed further deterioration characterized by marked bilateral putaminal cavitation. The SPECT image could not predict the clinical evolution. Our case highlights that Wilson's disease can have variable initial presentations, and confirms the relationship between pseudocompulsive stereotypies and bilateral lenticular lesions, as has been described in other diseases of the basal ganglia.",,"Garnier, H.;Diederich, N.;Pilloy, W.;Lenaerts, M.;Dooms, G.;Metz, H.",1997,March,,0,0,

The drug was injected subcutaneously at 5 mg/kg body weight twice a week for 65 days (20 mg total dose) into 40-day-old Long-Evans Cinnamon rats. In Tetrathiomolybdate-treated Long-Evans Cinnamon rats, hepatic Cu concentration was 60 ug/g wet weight, compared to 170 ug/g in untreated rats. In seven brain regions (cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, and cortex) of Tetrathiomolybdate-treated Long-Evans Cinnamon rats, Cu concentration (1.5 to 2.3 Âµg/g) was slightly lower (1.6 to 2.7 Âµg/g) than in untreated rats. A significant difference between the two groups was only found in the midbrain. Brain Fe concentrations in regions other than the striatum did not change significantly with tetrathiomolybdate injections. Hepatic Fe concentration was approximately 120 Âµg/g in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats without tetrathiomolybdate. Tetrathiomolybdate injection further increased the concentration to approximately 250 Âµg/g. Our results indicated that subcutaneous injection of tetrathiomolybdate did not have a stimulating effect on Cu and Fe redistribution in the seven brain regions examined, although hepatic Cu was markedly decreased and excreted Cu was deposited in the kidneys, spleen, and testes. .

2425,Zinc and manganese in schizophrenia,"The essential trace elements zinc and manganese have been suggested as factors in brain disease since the 1920s. The combined use of zinc and manganese in schizophrenia is based on: 1) Increased urinary excretion of copper when both zinc and manganese manganese are administered orally; 2) Zinc by itself causes a decrease in manganese in the blood; 3) Double deficiency of zinc and manganese is frequently found in patients with copper excess. Malva factor (cryptopyrrole) is known to increase the excretion of zinc and vitamin B<inf>6</inf> (pyridoxine). In children, insufficient levels of zinc and manganese have been associated with reduced learning ability, apathy, lethargy, and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc, manganese, and vitamin B<inf>6</inf> and have excess lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease, and Pick's disease are brain disorders dynamically related to zinc and manganese levels. Zinc has been used successfully to treat Wilson's disease, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and specific types of schizophrenia. Manganese is important in the building and breakdown cycles of proteins and nucleic acids. For RNA chain initiation, manganese was found to be a better effector than magnesium. Manganese stimulates the activity of adenylate cyclase in brain tissue. Because cyclic AMP plays a regulatory role in the action of several brain neurotransmitters, manganese is important in brain function. Due to the fact that zinc is well absorbed from the gut but manganese is poorly absorbed, all diagnostic categories may be impaired by prolonged oral doses of zinc without manganese. In oral doses, manganese occasionally raises blood pressure in patients older than 40 years. Zinc can only lower blood pressure in some hypertensive patients. Chronic user of hydralazine (a manganese chelator) in rats produced manganese deficiency resulting in seizures. Low blood and serum manganese levels may play a role in epilepsy, possibly by interfering with membrane stability. Long-term use of phenothiazines causes tardive dyskinesia. Phenothiazines can chelate manganese and make it unavailable for some purported function as an enzyme activator.",,"Pfeiffer, C. C.;LaMola, S.",1999,First Quarter,,0,0,

Methods Patients who had symptoms were treated with high-dose zinc sulfate (100-150 mg, <6 years; 150-200 mg, 6-8 years; 200-300 mg, 9-10 years; 300 mg, >10 years). years; 3 times a day) in addition to low-dose penicillamine (8-10 mg/kg/d) at the start of treatment. Zinc sulfate was administered only to presymptomatic patients and used as maintenance therapy when clinical improvement was obtained. 31 children were followed for 4-11 years. Results In 3 presymptomatic patients no clinical alterations were found. Among 28 patients with symptoms, 23 patients (82%) had symptoms and signs that decreased or greatly improved, 2 patients (7%) remained unchanged, and 3 (11%) died.

2433,Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease),"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is a recessive hereditary disorder in which the homozygous mutation in the ATP7B copper ATPase gene (on chromosome 13) reduces the ability of the liver to secrete ceruloplasmin into plasma and excrete it into bile. REVIEW SUMMARY: Systemic accumulation of copper causes progressive hepatic dysfunction, neurological impairment, psychiatric disorders, or combinations of these symptoms. Wilson's disease is diagnosed by measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion, followed by measurement of copper in a liver biopsy sample. Wilson's disease is treated with copper removal therapy (penicillamine or trientine), followed by maintenance zinc therapy. The frequent exacerbation of neurological deterioration with penicillamine has led to the use of tetrathiolmolybdate as an alternative agent to remove copper. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease should be considered in all patients with unexplained liver disorders and in those with progressive movement disorders or unexplained psychiatric disorders. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are essential. Tetrathiolmolybdate appears to be as effective as penicillamine and is associated with less frequent neurological worsening compared to penicillamine.",,"Fink, J. K.;Hedera, P.;Brewer, G.

2436,Anesthetic management of a patient with Wilson's disease. [Japanese],"Characterized by cirrhosis, extrapyramidal symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, Wilson's disease is a rare congenital disorder with abnormal copper metabolism. Despite the many anesthetic problems, there are no reports in the field of dental anesthesiology. We present a case of anesthetic management with Wilson's disease. The patient was a 24-year-old man who was scheduled to have multiple teeth extracted. He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 11 and treated with D-penicillamine. It was complicated by cirrhosis, but liver laboratory profiles were normal without slight elevations of ZTT (12.6U) and TTT (5.2U) (Table 1). The esophageal varices had been treated by endoscopic varicosclerosation two years earlier. Serum copper (16 ug/dl) and ceruloplasmin (less than 0.4 mg/dl) concentrations were markedly reduced and urinary copper excretion increased (130 ug/dl). He had extrapyramidal symptoms such as dysarthria, involuntary movements, and muscle rigidity, but intellectual function was preserved. After anesthetic induction with thiamylal, vecuronium, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane, general anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane (Fig. 1). Because the effect of vecuronium was expected to be prolonged due to liver dysfunction, we monitored the degree of neuromuscular blockade with a nerve stimulator, but recovery of muscle relaxation was normal. During the operation, the ECG began with first degree AV block and then progressed to second degree AV block (Wenckebach type) (Fig. 2). Second-degree AV block disappeared after administration of atropine sulfate (0.5 mg), and the patient's hemodynamic status remained stable until the end of surgery. No serious complications were found during the operation. No postoperative deterioration of liver or kidney function or extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. Most Wilsonian patients respond to penicillamine treatment, allowing them to resume normal life. Due to involuntary movements or muscle stiffness, general anesthesia may be necessary for your dental treatment. We emphasize the need for sufficient preoperative screening for cardiac compromise, such as electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiomyopathy, as well as preoperative evaluation of liver function. In addition, side effects of D-penicillamine, such as myasthenia gravis and fever, also needed to be considered.",,"Tanaka, K.;Kamekura, N.;Teramoto, T.;Kimura, Y.;Fukushima, K.",1999,,,0,0,

We observed the appearance of LKM1 autoantibodies 4 months after the transplantation for Wilson's disease, in close association with an episode of steroid-resistant rejection, in the absence of evidence of autoimmune hepatitis or hepatitis C. Methods: Sera from various time points before and after transplantation were analyzed for reactivity. of LKM by immunofluorescence, ELISA and Western blot. Antigen specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis on different cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The absence of hepatitis C and hepatitis G virus infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Organ donor serum was also tested. Results: All sera before transplantation and up to 4 months after transplantation were LKM negative in all assay systems used. In the course of an episode of steroid-resistant rejection at this time, the patient developed LKM antibodies in high titers (70% inhibition in ELISA) and has remained positive ever since (now over 4 years). The reactivity was exclusively to the cytochrome 2D6 isoenzyme. Hepatitis C infection never occurred, but hepatitis G was transiently present many years before transplantation. The donor serum was negative for all autoantibodies and for hepatitis C and G virus infection. Discussion: Here we describe a patient who developed LKM1 autoantibodies without evidence of autoimmune or viral hepatitis. The close temporal association with an episode of transplant rejection suggests immunological mechanisms of rejection together with hepatocellular injury as a pathogenic mechanism.",,"Lohse, A.

2441,Hepatic hereditary metabolic disorders of metals. [Slovak],"The authors address inherited metal metabolic disorders that cause liver damage, primarily the inherited copper and iron metabolic diseases. Copper is an essential metal in the body that facilitates the transmission of electrons in many critical biological reactions and is a component of numerous biologically important enzymes. Of the inherited copper metabolic diseases, Wilson's disease is the most important, as it is still diagnosed too late, at the stage of severe liver damage. New insights into pathogenesis are emphasized: gene for P-type ATP-ase ATP 7B (so-called WD protein) on chromosome 13q14.3, deficiency in Cu transport from the cell through the cell membrane, is i.e. excretion of Cu in bile, persistent metabolism of fetal Cu with predominant metallothionein instead of ceruloplasmin, complex approach in diagnosis and new treatment approaches (zinc). The authors analyze the complexity of hereditary hemochromatosis emphasizing its frequent incidence, knowledge in genetics - mutation of the HLA-H (HFE) gene, Fe deposits in tissues and stimulation of fibrosis by monocytes, and mechanism of development of bronze diabetes. As a screening, they recommend transferrin saturation (greater than 50% is highly suspicious of hemochromatosis), ferritin concentration greater than 1000 Âµg/l, gene analysis, liver biopsy and significance of imaging methods.

2442,Hepatic hyperplasia and cancer in rats: Alterations in copper metabolism,"We previously showed that rats exposed to the peroxisome proliferator (PP) diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) had reduced serum ceruloplasmin (CP) oxidase activity, suggesting copper deposition in tissues. Copper is highly toxic in excess and causes cell damage and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). This study addresses changes in gene expression related to copper and metal accumulation in hyperplastic liver and tumors induced by PP. Male rats were fed diets containing DEHP or clofibrate (CLF) for 3 to 60 days (hyperplasia) and 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidin)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio(N-beta-hydroxyethyl) acetamide for 10 months (HCC). During hyperplasia, an immediate and progressive decrease in serum CP activity was observed (P < 0.05), as well as reductions in mRNA levels for both CP and the Wilson's disease gene (WD gene, a P-type ATPase) (P < 0.05), tumor Carrier rats had lower serum CP activity (P < 0.05), and CP and WD gene mRNA levels were reduced in tumors (P < 0.05) and in tumors surrounding the liver (SL) (P < 0.05). Metallothionein mRNA did not show consistent changes during hyperplasia. Tumors showed a 2.5-fold (P < 0.05) induction of metallothionein mRNA and a 1.2-fold increase in SL. Temporary increases in liver copper content occurred during hyperplasia, with increases of 2-fold (DEHP) and 3.3-fold (CLF) at 60 days (P < 0.05). Copper content was 2.2 times higher in tumors (P < 0.05) and 1.7 times higher in SL; iron did not increase and zinc temporarily decreased. Therefore, copper accumulation and changes in copper-related gene expression may be contributing factors in hepatic neoplasia in PP-treated rats. Loss of CP results in decreased free radical scavenging capacity and thus may increase PP-induced oxidative damage.",,"Eagon, P. K.;Teepe, A. G.;Elm, M. S.;Tadic, S. D.;Epley, M. J.;Beiler, B.

This favorable result raises the question whether liver transplantation should also be offered to patients with neurologic Wilson's disease but stable liver function. Given the still high mortality after liver transplantation, the neurological status of patients with Wilson's disease with stable liver function cannot be a general indication for liver transplantation, which in these cases should still be considered experimental.

2445,Families of soft metal ion transporting ATPases,"In the last 5 years, much progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of action and the evolution of soft metal ATPases. Evolutionary pressure to flourish despite the geological ubiquity of metals has ensured that gene families for soft metal resistance are not limited to a single species or even a single kingdom. Many questions remain to be answered, and we look forward to accelerated knowledge acquisition in the near future. One question is the function of the ArsA homologues. Clearly, in bacteria, the arsA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the ArsAB pump. It is not known whether the eukaryotic and archaeal arsA homologues are orthologous or encode proteins with unrelated functions. Eukaryotes have mechanisms of resistance to arsenicals. In both Leishmania and Chinese hamster cells, we have shown that resistance is related to active extrusion of arsenite (44). But at this time the genes or gene products that cause resistance have not been identified. A second question is the distribution of chaperones for soft metals in bacteria. While copper chaperone homologues such as Atx1p and Lys7p are widely distributed in eukaryotes (12), they do not appear to exist in bacteria. CopZ has a chaperone function in E. hirae (10), but no counterparts with copper chaperone activity have been found in other bacteria. Furthermore, it is unclear whether cells require chaperones for non-redox active metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). A third issue is the distribution of ZntA homologues in nature. Related Cu(I)-translocating P-type ATPases are found in most organisms. In humans, these pumps are required for copper homeostasis, and mutations in the ATP7A or ATP7B gene cause inborn errors in copper metabolism, resulting in Menkes or Wilson disease, respectively. Although zinc is not as toxic as copper, in part because it is not a redox active metal, it is still toxic in excess and mechanisms must be in place to prevent overaccumulation. To date, an increasing number of zntA and cadA genes for zinc-translocating P-type ATPases have been identified. Genes for putative ATP-dependent zinc pumps are being discovered in other kingdoms, for example, in the genome of the archaea Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (GenBank accession number 2621474) and in the genome of the plant A. thaliana (accession number 2621474). GenBank accession 4210504). Within the next 5 years the sequencing of the human genome, and many others, will be completed. At that time, the phylogenetic distribution of zinc pumps and their role in human health and disease will be better understood.",,"Rensing, C.;Ghosh, M.;Rosen, B. P.",1999,October,,0,0,

2447,Identification of the zinc-binding protein specifically present in male rat liver as carbonic anhydrase III,"zinc-binding protein (Zn) that is specifically present in the livers of adult male rats was detected by HPLC with on-line detection mass spectrometry (ICP MS). The Zn-binding protein was purified on Sephadex G-75 and G3000SW HPLC columns, and identified as carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) based on the amino acid sequence of a peptide obtained on digestion with lysyl endopeptidase. CAIII is expressed as one of the major Zn-binding proteins in male rat liver in an age-dependent manner, a comparable amount of Zn to that of copper, Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) binds to CAIII at 8 weeks of age. Castration at 4 or 8 weeks of age was shown to reduce Zn bound to CAIII to 47.5% of the sham-operated control level, suggesting that the sex-dependent expression of CAIII is partially regulated by a sex hormone. , the androgen.

Most of the patients were adolescents or young adults who had usually had the disease for several years. Patients were often untreated, poorly treated, or induced by d-penicillamine treatment. The clinical features were characterized by contralateral weakness, tremor and dystonia.

Remission rates in children have been reported to range from 20% to 58%. The recently available lamuvidin has also been used in combination with interferon therapy. Oral chelation therapy and liver transplantation have dramatically affected the outcome of patients with Wilson's disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are effective in reducing both morbidity and mortality from autoimmune hepatitis. Harmful carbohydrates are eliminated from the diet of patients with galactosemia and hereditary fructose intolerance. The most important and often neglected component of the management of chronic liver disease in childhood is nutritional therapy and rapid interventions for ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy. With definitive etiologic and histologic evaluation and institution of specific and supportive therapy, children with chronic liver disease may have prolonged survival with improved quality of life.

Quantitative assessment of motor deficits and psychiatric disorders correlated with EEG features. We mainly found an increase in delta activity, a decrease in alpha activity combined with a more posterior localization of EEG generators in the delta band and a more anterior one in the alpha band in patients compared to healthy controls. The localization of EEG generators in patients with apparent clinical neurological symptoms was shallower in all frequency bands compared to controls and patients without neurological symptoms. With longer duration of illness, the lower the premorbid intelligence, the more posteriorly the EEG delta generator was located. Although the alpha EEG generator was more anteriorly located with longer disease duration and more severe cognitive deficits, it was more superficial with more pronounced psychiatric symptoms, more severe cognitive deficits, lower premorbid intelligence, and more pronounced motor disabilities. With more pronounced psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits, the beta EEG generator was located more anteriorly.

2455,Intracellular localization of Menkes and Wilson disease proteins and their role in intracellular copper transport,"Copper is a heavy metal ion essential for the activity of a variety of enzymes in the body. In excess, copper is a very toxic ion and therefore efficient regulation of its metabolism is required. This is dramatically illustrated by the genetic disorders, X-linked Menkes disease and autosomal recessive Wilson's disease. In 1993, the Menkes and Wilson genes were isolated and it was discovered that these genes encode homologous copper cation transporting P-type ATPase proteins. The Menkes protein (ATP7A) is expressed in most tissues except the liver. In contrast, Wilson's protein (ATP7B) is abundantly expressed in the liver. The intracellular localization of these proteins was investigated. Both ATP7A and ATP7B are located in the trans-Golgi network and in the post-Golgi vesicular compartment (PGVC) in the cell. This intracellular localization was altered by the copper content present in the cell. This result may support the hypothesis that ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in cellular copper transport and these proteins could be suitable models to elucidate intracellular copper metabolism.",,"Suzuki, M.;Gitlin, J.

2457,Copper transport disorders,"Copper is an essential component of several important enzymes. Efficient systems have been developed to provide enough copper for essential functions while removing excess to prevent tissue toxicity. Copper transport is disrupted in two human diseases: Wilson's disease and Menkes disease. Both have defects in copper transport membrane proteins. Many other proteins are involved in copper transport. Some of these proteins have been identified through a study of the similar copper pathway in yeast. This suggests that other copper transport diseases have yet to be discovered. Molecular diagnosis is promising for the reliable diagnosis of patients. Lateral marker testing is a reliable way to detect presymptomatic siblings of a defined patient. Although most of the heavy metals are too rare or too insoluble to be of biological importance, at least eleven appear to be essential for normal function. These include vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium, molybdenum, and tin<sup>1</sup>. Most of these metals, while essential for normal function, are toxic when present in excess. Little is known about the homeostatic control mechanisms necessary to maintain the delicate balance between need and toxicity.

A male and a female beagle dog received trientine-2HCl by oral administration in variable doses (50 to 2000 mg/kg) or in constant doses of 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for two weeks. After administration of 2,000 or 1,000 mg/kg, severe signs (abnormal gait, ataxia, emesis, diarrhoea, body tremor) and marked loss of body weight were evident. In the constant dose phase, similar treatment effects were seen in both animals receiving 600 mg/kg/day. The approximate lethal dose was considered to be greater than 2000 mg/kg. 2) Four-week study. Beagle dogs received trientine-2HCl orally at doses of 50, 125, or 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week reversibility phase. There were no deaths. For some animals receiving 300 mg/kg/day, hypoactivity, abnormal gait, ataxia, and body tremors were observed during the last week of treatment. In the lungs, interstitial pneumonia was recorded in one control male and four animals receiving 300 mg/kg/day with or without recovery. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed that the exposure of the animals to trientine-2HCl was dose-dependent and that there was no significant accumulation of trientine-2HCl during the dosing period. 3) Twenty-six week study. Beagle dogs were scheduled to receive trientine-2HCl orally at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks followed by a 13-week reversibility phase. However, in view of the severe signs that led to the humane culling of two males and one female who received 200 mg/kg/day during week 9 of treatment, the surviving dogs in this group were only treated for 10 weeks. . Pre-dispatch signs included marked lack of activity, body tremors, abnormal gait, limited use of limbs, and prone posture. Ante-mortem neurological examination generally indicated depressed postures and flexor retraction reactions. The signs were rapidly reversible except in one female that was humanely euthanized on day 2 of the reversibility period. Beginning at week 23 of treatment, an abnormal ""stiff-legged"" gait and lack of activity were seen in two men and one woman receiving 100 mg/kg/day. In the absence of gross or histopathologic findings, even after examination of additional muscle and nerve samples, the exact nature of this condition could not be elucidated.

2465,A critical appraisal of copper metabolism in children with Wilson's disease from India with special reference to their phenotypes and relatives.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation in various organs, with the most common clinical manifestations being hepatic, neurological, and renal dysfunction. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease were significantly lower compared to normals, controls, and relatives of patients with Wilson's disease, while marked hypercupriuria (145 +/- 7 Âµg/24 h) only in Wilson's children. A good correlation (r = 0.92) was found between ceruloplasmin-unbound copper and 24-hour urinary copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Furthermore, copper studies among the different phenotypes of Wilson's disease revealed substantially low serum ceruloplasmin and marked hypercupriuria in children with Wilson's disease associated with renal tubular acidosis compared with patients with hepatologic or neurologic manifestations. Serum ceruloplasmin levels in 14 patients with Wilson's disease were between 14 and 20 mg/dL. These patients with Wilson's disease were confirmed by measuring copper in a liver biopsy, which was approximately nine times higher than normal liver copper content. During family screening using copper studies, four asymptomatic siblings were diagnosed with Wilson's disease.

2466,Copper and boron as examples of dietary trace elements important in bone development and disease,"Boron and copper are examples of elements that are present in man in small or 'trace' amounts, but important. Copper is essential for bone growth and development, and copper supplementation reduces bone loss in middle-aged women. Copper deficiency is indicated by the presence of long bone abnormalities (osteopenia, fraying and cupping of the provisional zone of calcification, metaphyseal spurs, fractures), psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, hypopigmentation, prominent scalp veins in palpable periosteal depressions, pallor, iron-resistant sideroblastic anemia, vacuolated erythroid and myeloid cells in the bone marrow with iron deposition in the vacuoles and some mitochondria, hepatosplenomegaly, neutropenia (<1.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L ), and serum concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin less than 6.28 mmol/L and 0.13 g/L, respectively. Unintentional copper depletion from excessive zinc therapy or chelation therapy (eg, deferoxamine or EDTA) as a treatment for heavy metal poisoning, vascular disease, or intermittent claudication is of obvious importance. Intentional chelation of copper with medications including penicillamine for the treatment of abnormalities such as Wilson's disease, Parkinson's disease, and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can also deplete copper stores. Signs of copper deficiency associated with perinatal stress are sometimes confused with unexplained fractures in nonaccidental childhood injuries that sometimes manifest in shaken baby syndrome. Boron is beneficial for the metabolism of minerals, vitamin D, insulin, and energy substrates, and for immune function in animals and humans. In particular, dietary boron has beneficial physiological effects on bone growth and maintenance. Further characterization of the metabolic roles of these and other trace minerals related to bone metabolism seems an extremely prudent endeavor due to the likely association of several refractory bone diseases with ultralight and trace mineral nutrition.",,"Hunt, C.

2471,Targeting of tetrathiomolybdate on copper accumulation in the liver of LEC rats,"The uptake of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) by the liver and the removal of copper (Cu) accumulated in the liver in a form bound to metallothionein (MT) by TTM were studied in Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model of Wilson disease, in order to develop better treatments for the disease and Cu toxicity. Although molybdenum (Mo) was incorporated in a dose-dependent manner into the livers of LEC and Long-Evans agouti (LEA) rats, the original strain of LEC rats used as the reference animal, uptake into the liver of LEC rats was 13 times greater than that of LEA rats. Mo concentration in the soluble fraction stabilized and was more distributed in the insoluble fraction with higher dose in LEC rats. Cu concentration in the whole livers of LEC rats decreased by TTM in a dose-dependent manner only at lower doses. However, the concentration of Cu in the soluble fraction continued to decrease with the dose of TTM. The results can be explained in terms of complex formation. That is, TTM forms a complex with Cu, tentatively named the Cu/TTM complex, which can be excreted into the bloodstream and then selectively binds to albumin when the TTM dose is low. On the other hand, TTM forms an insoluble complex, called Cu/TTM polymer, which precipitates in the liver when the dose is high. The results further indicate that TTM taken up by a cell is immobilized in the cell by the dose-dependent formation of a complex containing Cu, Mo and sulfur (S), causing increased TTM uptake. TTM injected into rats or incubated in vitro with serum does not remove Cu from ceruloplasmin. Therefore, it is suggested that TTM targets a cell that accumulates excess Cu as Cu-MT, and selectively removes Cu without interacting with Cu in Cu enzymes. The results indicate that the TTM is absorbed by the liver depending on the amount of Cu that accumulates in the form of MT, and then the Cu leaves together with the Mo in the form of a Cu/TTM complex into the bloodstream.",,"Ogra, Y.;Suzuki, K.

2472,Zinc in human health: an update,"Topics covered in this review include zinc and growth, serum testosterone and zinc levels, the association of zinc and iron deficiencies, zinc and Alzheimer's disease, zinc as a therapeutic agent, and the role of zinc in immunity. A meta-analysis of trials of zinc supplementation in nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, eight in North America or Europe, five in Asia and the Middle East, and three in Africa revealed a highly significant effect of zinc supplementation on height and weight in children under 13 years of age. It appears that the growth-promoting effect of zinc is mediated by changes in circulating IGF-1. A recent study from China showed that zinc supplementation improved neuropsychological functions in children aged 6 to 9 years. A study from Birmingham, Alabama, showed that women who received zinc supplementation gave birth to babies who weighed more and had a larger head circumference compared to babies of women who did not receive zinc. Serum testosterone correlated with cellular zinc concentration in healthy adults 20 to 80 years of age. Therapeutic uses of zinc include treatment of childhood diarrhea and chronic diarrhea in developing countries, treatment of the common cold, and treatment of Wilson's disease. Recent studies indicated that in humans, zinc deficiency produces an imbalance between the functions of TH1 and TH2 cells, which explains the decrease in cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is a T-cell-specific growth factor, and reduced gene expression of the DNA-synthesizing enzyme thymidine kinase in zinc-deficient HUT-78, a malignant lymphoblastoid human T-cell line, negatively affected DNA synthesis in S phase and delayed the cell cycle. .",,"Prasad, A.

In a first experiment, three groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with one of the following treatments for 5 days: DPA 0.5 mmol/kg/day, zinc acetate 0.046 mmol/kg/day dihydrate and 0.5 mmol/kg/day of DPA plus 0.046 mmol/kg/day of zinc acetate dihydrate. A fourth group of rats (control group) received deionized water for the same period.

During week 4 or 8 of treatment, urinalysis revealed, in males receiving 100 mg/kg/day or animals receiving 350 mg/kg/day or more, increased electrolyte production possibly due to the nature of trientine hydrochloride-2HCl, with low levels of alkaline phosphatase in plasma. activities evident in animals receiving 350 or 1200 mg/kg/day. After 4 and 8 weeks, and through 8 weeks of treatment, elevated lung weights and hypertrophy of the bronchiolar epithelium and bronchoalveolar pneumonia were recorded in animals receiving 1200 mg/kg/day, and acute submucosal inflammation was recorded within the region stomach gland. for men who received 350 or 1200 mg/kg/day and in all groups of women treated. 26-week study. One male receiving 175 mg/kg/day and three males receiving 600 mg/kg/day died, showing changes in the lungs. Body weight gain of animals receiving 600 mg/kg/day decreased slightly. Blood chemistry tests and urinalysis showed changes similar to those reported in the 4- or 8-week study. The low plasma copper concentrations observed in males given 600 mg/kg/day, the slightly low liver copper concentrations found in animals given 600 or 175 mg/kg/day, and the high urinary copper concentrations found in all treated groups are attributed to the pharmacological action of trientine-2HCl. Histopathology revealed a dose-related incidence and severity of focal chronic interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by fibrosis of the alveolar walls in women receiving 175 mg/kg/day or more and in all treatment groups of men, but without significant pathologic changes in stomach. Apart from the histological changes found in the lung, all of the above changes were reversible. In conclusion, the NOAEL for trientine-2HCl in this 26-week study was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day for women and less than 50 mg/kg/day for men.",,"Yanagisawa, T.;Maemura, S.;Sasaki, H.;Endo, T.;Okada, M.;East, P.

However, the long-term effects have not been fully evaluated, and some evidence questions the long-term safety of the drug. The aim of the present study was to investigate the systemic distribution and retention of Cu and Mo in TTM-treated sheep of different breeds and Cu status. Cambridge low-Cu sheep were divided into a TTM test group (3.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, on three alternate days per month, for 5 months) and a control group, and were euthanized at the end of the test. of the course or 7 months later. High Cu sheep consisting of a Cu-supplemented Cambridge group (150 mg/kg) and a North Ronaldsay group were administered TTM as above and compared to untreated controls. Brain, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pituitary, adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries were preserved for metal analysis. Mo accumulated in all organs including brain and pituitary (P < 0.02) in all groups of the TTM trial and was maintained after discontinuation of treatment except liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. . Cu was increased (P < 0.02) and retained in the cerebellum and medulla in the TTM-treated high-Cu Cambridge groups. Brain concentrations of Cu versus Mo showed a strongly positive correlation (r 0.7) in the high-Cu Ronaldsay group 7 months after TTM treatment. It is concluded that TTM is not completely excreted, but (Mo) is widely distributed and retained in many organs, including the brain and pituitary. In addition, TTM may redistribute some of the displaced excess hepatic Cu (Cu-TTM) to the brain.

He had been diagnosed 27 years earlier with Wilson's disease and was being treated with penicillamine (1.5 g daily). Systemic elastic fiber abnormality was confirmed by light and electron microscopy after biopsy of skin, lung, esophageal muscle, gingiva, pharyngeal tissue, and cervical connective tissue. Dysphagia was relieved with cricopharyngeal myotomy. Substitution of triene dihydrochloride for penicillamine relieved skin and systemic manifestations. This is possibly the first case demonstrating an association between long-term use of penicillamine and biopsy-proven systemic pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The presenting symptoms may be due to abnormal numbers and properties of elastic fibers, and the changes were caused by the use of penicillamine, rather than an inherited idiopathic pseudoxanthoma elasticum.",,"Coatesworth, A.

2485,Metallothionein and apoptosis in the milk toxic mutant mouse,"Milk toxic mutant (tx) mice accumulate excess copper (Cu) in the liver with age and develop symptoms similar to those seen in human Wilson's disease. Because metallothionein (MT) is the main Cu-binding protein in the liver of tx mice, and Cu-MT can enhance lipid peroxidation. Initiated by an organic hydroperoxide, the potential genotoxicity of Cu-MT in tx mice was evaluated in male tx mice (11â12 months of age) and in age- and sex-matched wild-type (DL) control mice. Milk toxic mutant mice, but not control DL mice, developed regenerative liver nodules (tx-N) with normal histological appearance. Residual non-nodular tx mouse liver (tx-R) was microscopically abnormal with large atypical hepatocytes. Cu, zinc (Zn) and MT levels, and the number of apoptotic cells (APC) in tx-N, tx-R and DL livers were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, <sup>109</sup>cadmium - heme assay and the TUNEL method, respectively. Significantly higher levels of MT, Cu, and Zn, as well as higher numbers of APCs, were found in both tx-N and tx-R compared to livers from DL mice. Strong nuclear and cytoplasmic immunohistochemical staining for MT was observed in normal and atypical tx mouse hepatocytes, while cytoplasmic staining for MT was only detected in DL mouse liver tissue. Accumulated Cu could be detected in tx-R and tx-N liver by rhodamine staining, but was not detected in other tx mouse organs, nor in mouse liver or other DL organs. APC number and MT level were significantly higher in tx-R liver compared to tx-N and DL liver. These results suggest that: (a) the aged tx mouse accumulates excess Cu in the liver accompanied by striking morphological changes, and (b) although MT binds Cu in the tx mouse liver, the presence of high Cu-MT and Cu in the nucleus can be genotoxic and can lead to increased apoptosis.",,"Deng, D.

2487,Oxidative stress in LEC rats evaluated by plasma antioxidants and free fatty acids,"The Long-Evans cinnamon rat (LEC), an animal model of Wilson's disease, develops hepatitis and liver cancer. Since LEC rats accumulate copper especially in the liver and since copper is a good oxidation catalyst, selected plasma markers of oxidative stress were measured in LEC rats and control Long-Evans agouti (LEA) rats. A significant decrease in plasma ascorbate level was observed even at the onset of hepatitis, suggesting that LEC rats are under oxidative stress because ascorbate is highly susceptible to oxidation. The ratio of plasma ubiquinol-9, another oxidatively vulnerable antioxidant, to ubiquinone-9 in LEC rats was also significantly decreased after the onset of hepatitis. Oxidative damage in the liver of LEC rats after the onset of hepatitis was also suggested by a decrease in the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to free fatty acids (FFA) and an increase in the ratio of palmitoleic acid to FFA in plasmas from LEC rats compared to LEA rats, as PUFAs are vulnerable to oxidation and DELTA<sup>9</sup> desaturase is activated to compensate for the loss of PUFA. All of the above changes and hepatitis were prevented by adding a copper chelating agent, trientine dihydrochloride, to the drinking water of LEC rats. These data suggest that oxygen radicals may play an important role in the development of hepatitis and subsequent liver cancer.",,"Yamamoto, Y.;Sone, H.;Yamashita, S.;Nagata, Y.;Niikawa, H.;Hara, K.;Nagao, M.",1997,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291520-670X%281997%2910:2%3C129::AID-JTRA10%3E3.0.CO;2-T,0,0,

2490,Wilson's disease. Different forms of appearance. [Spanish],"Wilson's disease is characterized by a disorder of copper metabolism and the mechanism responsible for the basic defect is still unknown. It is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance in relation to chromosome 13. The presenting signs depend on the age of the patient. In children aged 4 to 10 years, it varies from asymptomatic forms with minimal laboratory evidence to acute liver failure and death. The course of Wilson's disease is variable, but it usually becomes chronic, occasionally associated with neurological, renal, hematological, and ocular abnormalities. Diagnosis is based on serum and urinary copper levels, serum cerulopasmin concentration, and histological study of the tissues in which the metal is deposited (liver, kidneys, CNS, etc.). Copper chelators (penicillamine, triene, zinc sulfate) can be administered as a bridge to liver transplantation, which is the definitive treatment for this metabolic disorder. We present a retrospective study of 7 cases of Wilson's disease diagnosed in our center, focusing on the presenting signs, biochemical alterations, diagnostic methods, clinical course and treatment.",,"Sanchez, C.

2491,Ultrastructural changes in the intestine of rats fed high-zinc diets,"Feeding humans high-zinc diets is often used as therapy for patients with Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation. There appear to be no external adverse effects of this treatment; however, preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown apparent weaknesses in the intestinal wall of rats fed high-zinc diets. As a consequence, this study was undertaken to determine whether feeding rats high zinc diets would affect the ultrastructural morphology of the small intestine. The effects of treatment on the copper status of the rats were also determined. Weanling male rats were fed diets containing 35 or 350 mg zinc/kg. After 7 weeks, blood and various tissues were collected to measure indicators of copper status, and portions of the upper duodenum were excised and prepared for light and electron microscopy. Results showed that rats fed zinc-rich diets had significantly lower copper status, as indicated by low serum copper, serum ceruloplasmin activity, and liver copper, than rats fed normal zinc diets. Hepatic superoxide dismutase or cytochrome c oxidase activities were not affected by high zinc. Observations of sections of the duodenum by electron microscopy showed that unassembled collagen molecules in the lamina propria were more frequently disorganized and formed tangled masses in rats fed a high zinc diet than in those fed normal zinc diets. This suggests that the low copper status caused by high zinc diets could be affecting the activity of lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme, and thus the cross-linking of collagen molecules. However, these observations did not always correlate with low copper status. Other possible explanations include direct competition between zinc and copper for lysyl oxidase sites, zinc blocking of aldehyde residues in the collagen molecule, or some unrecognized process involving other enzymes or other aspects of assembly. of collagen. Whether such processes or affinities actually exist is still being investigated.",,"Reeves, P. G.;Newman Jr, S.

In addition, lactating tx females produce copper-deficient milk. To further characterize the biochemical basis of this defect, Western blots of tissue extracts from normal and tx mice were tested with various radioisotopes of heavy metals (<sup>63</sup>Ni, <sup>65</sup>Zn and <sup>64</sup>Cu). A 30 kDa Ni/Zn-binding polypeptide was found to be markedly decreased in the livers of tx mice. This protein was isolated from normal adult mice using a Ni chelation chromatography-based method. The amino acid sequences of two CNBr peptides were identical to portions of the mouse skeletal muscle carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) sequence. Two other peptides sequenced had sequences closely related to that of CAIII, but with two 45 amino acid differences. These two peptides may be derived from a new isoform of CAIII, which we call CAIIIB to distinguish it from the published form, CAIIIA. We isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to CAIIIA and used it to show that CAIIIA mRNA was also decreased in mutant liver, but not in muscle. Copper loading of normal mice also decreased hepatic CAIIIA mRNA, suggesting that the decrease in CAIII mRNA in tx mouse liver is a secondary consequence of high liver copper levels.",,"Grimes, A.;Paynter, J.;Walker, I.

[Spanish],"Among the minerals whose presence is quantitatively important for the body (macrominerals), some -sodium, chlorine, potassium- are metabolically linked to water, the most abundant element in the human body. Related metabolic disturbances are primarily due to water imbalance and are therefore studied in the context of disorders of water metabolism. Other elements - calcium, phosphorus and magnesium - contribute to bone metabolism under the influence of calcitrophic hormones: parathormone, calcitonin and 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. Beyond the neonatal stage, the distinctive diagnosis of hypocalcemia is based on the level of phosphates, parathormone and vitamin D derivatives to identify the different types of rickets or parathyroid dysfunction. Likewise, causal identification of hypercalcemia depends on parathyroid function. Microminerals, named for the presence of traces in the body, play an irreplaceable role in various enzymatic functions. Some are (iron, iodine) intimately linked to specific organic functions (synthesis of hemoglobin and myoglobin and thyroxine, respectively).

However, when trientine and the same number of moles of copper ions were administered simultaneously to the rat, trientine clearance decreased to almost the same level as creatinine clearance. To elucidate this active trientine excretion system, the uptake of trientine and a physiological polyamine compound, spermine, was investigated using rat renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Although, because trientine and spermine are organic cations, the organic cation transporter/H<sup>+</sup> is expected to recognize these compounds, neither a directed H<sup>+</sup> gradient to the outside nor a Na< to the inside. sup>+</sup> gradient-stimulated uptake of trientine. However, [<sup>14</sup>C] spermine uptake was transstimulated by both unlabeled spermine and trientine, and the transstimulatory effect of spermine on trientine uptake was, moreover, completely abolished by the addition of copper ions to the incubation medium. These results suggest that there is a specific transport system for spermine and trientine in the renal brush border membrane. This transport system contributes to trientine secretion in the proximal tubule of the kidney but does not recognize the trientine-copper complex.",,"Kobayashi, M.;Tanabe, R.;Sugawara, M.;Iseki, K.;Miyazaki, K.",1997,April,,0,0,
2511,Menkes disease: Recent advances and new aspects,"Copper is the third most abundant trace element in the body, after iron and zinc, and is required for the normal function of several important copper enzymes. However, the same element in excess is highly toxic and has detrimental effects. Therefore, fine regulation of intracellular copper homeostasis is of vital importance and disturbance of this balance is reflected in two inherited disorders, Menkes disease and Wilson disease. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in this field following the isolation of the defective gene in Menkes disease (MS), which will be the main topic of this review. Progressive neurodegeneration and connective tissue abnormalities are the main manifestations of X-linked recessive Menkes disease, and most of the clinical features can be explained by malfunction of one or more copper enzymes. The disease locus was mapped to Xq13.3 and the defective Menkes disease gene (MNK) was isolated by positional cloning. The protein product is predicted to be a copper-binding P-type ATPase (ATP7A), the first intracellular copper transporter described in eukaryotes. The identification of MNK led to a number of advances in a very short time. The mouse homologue of MNK was isolated and the allelic relationship between MD and occipital horn syndrome was confirmed. Importantly, the defective gene in Wilson's disease was isolated using MNK-specific sequences and the predicted protein product showed high homology to ATP7A. In this review we will describe these recent advances and their consequences with special reference to Menkes disease. Wilson's disease will be briefly described and the defective metabolism of copper in both diseases will be summarized in light of new knowledge. Finally, copper translocating ATPases identified in other species and their importance in understanding copper metabolism will be discussed.",,"Tumer, Z.;Horn, N.",1997,,,0,0,

2513,(D)-Penicillamine increases hepatic oxalate production and causes hyperoxaluria.,"Purpose: To determine if (D)-penicillamine is effective in reducing hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. Materials and methods: (D)-penicillamine was administered orally to rats to determine its effect on urinary oxalate excretion and used in isolated rat hepatocytes to investigate the effect of (D)-penicillamine on oxalate production. from glycolate. Studies with hepatic aminotransferases and hepatocytes isolated from rats treated with (D)-penicillamine were used to clarify the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo results. Results: In hepatocytes (D)-penicillamine leads to a significant reduction in oxalate production from glycolate. However, in vivo, (D)-penicillamine caused a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion and a decrease in plasma aminotransferase activity. Hepatic aminotransferases are involved in the diversion of oxalate precursors from oxalate production. In vitro, (D)-penicillamine was shown to inhibit hepatic aminotransferases. Hepatocytes isolated from (D)-penicillamine-treated rats produced significantly more oxalate than controls. Conclusions: These results indicate that (D)-penicillamine increases hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. Therefore, (D)-penicillamine has no therapeutic potential to reduce endogenous oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. Also, in conditions such as Wilson's disease, which is often associated with hypercalciuria, its use may be contraindicated.",,"Baker, P. W.;Bais, R.;Rofe, A.

2518,Wilson's disease and idiopathic copper toxicosis,"The pathogenic agent of both Wilson's disease (WD) and non-Indian childhood cirrhosis (which we call idiopathic copper toxicosis or ICT) is copper that accumulates in excess in the liver. Inheritance of a pair of alleles of an autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 13 is necessary and sufficient to cause such accumulation of copper in WD; reducing dietary intake of copper cannot prevent the development of WD. In contrast, lethal accumulations of copper in children with CTI have been attributed primarily to increased dietary intake of copper. However, 64,124 child-year exposures of children under 6 years of age to drinking water containing a copper concentration of 125.9 mumol/L (8 mg/L) did not result in deaths from any form of liver disease. Furthermore, the CTI of seven infants was attributed primarily to drinking water containing < 110.2 mumol Cu/L (7 mg/L) despite evidence of the presence of a genetic defect in three of the patients, one of the which was fed exclusively with breast milk. These data suggest that TICs cannot be caused solely by increased dietary copper intake and occur only in children with an unidentified genetic defect.",,"Scheinberg, I.

2519,Metal-induced hepatotoxicity,"Figure 3 summarizes several proposed mechanisms of iron or copper-induced hepatotoxicity. It has long been suspected that free radicals may play a role in iron and copper-induced cellular toxicity due to the powerful pro-oxidant action of iron and copper salts in vitro. In the presence of available cellular reductants, iron or copper in low molecular weight forms can play a catalytic role in initiating free radical reactions. The resulting oxyradicals have the potential to damage cellular lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, resulting in widespread impairment of cellular function and integrity. However, cells are endowed with cytoprotective mechanisms (antioxidants, sequestering enzymes, repair processes) that act to counteract the effects of free radical production. Thus, the net effect of metal-induced free radicals on cell function will depend on the balance between radical production and cytoprotective systems. As a result, there may be a rate of free radical production that must be overcome before cell injury occurs. Evidence has now accumulated that iron or copper overload in experimental animals can result in oxidative damage to lipids in vivo, once the concentration of the metal exceeds a threshold level. In the liver, this lipid peroxidation is associated with impaired membrane-dependent functions of mitochondria (oxidative metabolism) and lysosomes (membrane integrity, fluidity, pH). Although these findings do not prove causality, it seems likely that lipid peroxidation is involved, as metal-induced lipid peroxidation produces similar functional defects in these organelles in vitro. Both iron and copper overload impair hepatic mitochondrial respiration, primarily through decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity. In iron overload, hepatocellular calcium homeostasis may be affected by damage to mitochondrial and microsomal calcium sequestration. DNA has also been reported to be a target of metal-induced damage in the liver; this may have consequences in terms of malignant transformation. Levels of some antioxidants in the liver are decreased in rats with iron or copper overload, also suggesting ongoing oxidative stress. Reduced levels of cellular ATP, lysosome fragility, altered cellular calcium homeostasis, and DNA damage may contribute to hepatocellular injury from iron and copper overload. There are few data addressing the key question of whether tree radical production is increased in patients with iron or copper overload. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have elevated plasma levels of TBA reagents and elevated liver levels of MDA protein and HNE protein adducts, indicating lipid peroxidation. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of Wilson's disease patients have evidence of lipid peroxidation, and some Wilson's disease patients have reduced hepatic and plasma levels of vitamin E. Further research will be required to fully assess oxidative stress and its potential pathophysiological role. in patients with iron. or copper overload.",,"Britton, R. S.",1996,,,0,0,

2521,Inhibition of hereditary hepatitis and liver tumor development in Cinnamon Long-Evans rats by the copper chelating agent trientine dihydrochloride,"Trientine Dihydrochloride (Trientine) is an alternative medicinal copper chelating agent for patients with intolerance to penicillamine or Wilson's disease. We examined the effects of trientine on the spontaneous development of hepatitis and liver tumors, through short-term and long-term administration. Cinnamon Evans rats (CLE) with liver copper accumulation, as animal models of Wilson's disease. Male rats were given trientine in their drinking water at 1,500 ppm for 18 weeks from 6 weeks to 24 weeks of age in a short-term experiment, and 1,500 ppm for 27 weeks, then 750 ppm for 52 weeks, from 8 to 87 weeks of age in the long-term experiment. Development of hepatitis was observed in control LEC rats at 18 weeks of age. They had elevated levels of plasma transaminases (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [GOT], glutamic pyruvic transaminase [GPT]), and hepatocyte destruction was observed on pathological examination. Histological findings revealed that short-term administration of trientine markedly inhibited the development of hepatitis. Plasma GOT and GPT levels of the treated animals were only slightly higher than those of normal LEA (Long-Evans Furred Agouti) rats, a sister line of LEC rats. Liver copper levels were reduced by a maximum of 50%. In long-term administration of trientine, the incidence of hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) in treated rats was 67% of that in untreated LEC rats, and the number of HCC per rat in the treated group was 0. .7 +/- 0.5. being significantly lower compared to 4.7 +/- 3.5 in untreated rats. Furthermore, the development of cholangiofibrosis in LEC rats was completely prevented by long-term administration of the agent. The copper level in the liver of treated rats was reduced by 33% at 87 weeks of age. The development of HCC in LEC rats could be due in part, but not entirely, to copper accumulation.

The purpose of the study was to describe the range of abnormalities seen on cranial MR images of patients with Wilson's disease and to correlate the findings with clinical severity, duration of disease, and duration of neurological signs and symptoms before treatment. In those patients with serial studies, the changes in the MR images were compared with the clinical response. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twenty-five patients with Wilson's disease underwent MR imaging of the brain using conventional spin-echo sequences (n = 25), phase maps (n = 8), and partially refocused interleaved multiple-echo sequences (n = 5). RESULTS. MRI findings were abnormal in 22 patients and normal in three patients. The basal ganglia were interpreted as abnormal in 19 (86%) of 22 patients, involving the putamen in 19 (86%), the thalamus in 12 (54%), the caudate head in 10 (45%), and the globus pallidus. . in nine (41%). We found a predilection for the involvement of the outer edge of the putamen and the ventral nuclear mass of the thalamus. The claustrum was abnormal in three patients. The midbrain was abnormal in 17 (77%) of these 22 patients, predominantly involving the tegmentum but also the substantia nigra, red nuclei, inferior roof, and crura. The pons was abnormal in 18 (82%) of 22 patients, and the cerebellum was abnormal in 11 patients (50%), with involvement of the superior middle cerebellar peduncles. Atrophy was present in 18 (82%) of 22 patients, and cortical white matter changes were evident in 13 (59%) of 22 patients. Examination of an untreated patient revealed a shortening of the T1 relaxation time in the thalamus, which was consistent with the paramagnetic effects of copper. Phase maps and partially refocused interleaved multiple echo sequences performed on eight and five patients, respectively, and used to reveal an iron- or copper-induced change in susceptibility showed normal results. We found a significant inverse relationship between the severity, but not the extent, of the change in signal intensity and duration of untreated disease (p = 0.030) and total disease duration (p = 0.015). The study group was too small to show a correlation with clinical findings. The changes seen on the MR images were consistent with the clinical response to treatment in only two of the seven patients who underwent follow-up studies. CONCLUSION. MRI revealed abnormalities in the basal ganglia, cerebral white matter, midbrain, pons, and cerebellum. Paramagnetic effects of copper were detected only in untreated patients. Patients with a longer duration of illness had less severe changes in signal intensity. MRI was of limited value at follow-up.",,"King, A. D.;Walshe, J. M.;Kendall, B. E.;Chinn, R. J. S.;Paley, M. N.

Female LEC rats were injected intraperitoneally with TTM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days. More than 2/3 of the Cu accumulated in the liver was removed by TTM treatment 24 h after the last injection. Although most of the Cu was bound to MT in the soluble fraction before TTM treatment, the Cu remaining in the liver was almost exclusively present in the non-soluble fraction together with molybdenum (Mo). Cu, Zn, Cd-MT was separated from the liver of LEC rats injected with cadmium (Cd) and reacted with TTM in molar ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2 0.0 and 4.0 to Cu bound to MT for 10 min at 37Â°C. When TTM was added at a molar ratio lower than 1.0, a Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex was detected, while addition of TTM at a molar ratio higher than 1.0 selectively removed Cu from MT and produced a Cu/TTM complex. complex by releasing Zn,Cd-MT from the Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex. Excessive TTM seemed to facilitate the polymerization of the Cu/TTM complex to insoluble polymers.

We present six Native Canadian children with severe chronic cholestatic liver disease, who had excess liver copper and zinc. Methods. The children, ages 22 months to 8 years, were from northern Ontario, Canada. All were referred for possible liver transplantation due to end-stage liver disease. We examined explanted liver samples (or liver biopsy material in one case) by scanning transmission electron X-ray elemental microanalysis (STEM) and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Samples from four controls (two without liver disease, one with biliary atresia, and one with Wilson's disease) were also analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Recommendations. The explanted livers showed similar hallmarks of advanced biliary cirrhosis, and on electron microscopy there were dense deposits in the enlarged lysosomes and cytoplasm. Liver copper concentrations were many times higher in the five patients with measurements (47.6-56.9 ug/g dry weight) than in two normal control liver tissue samples (2.3 and 2.9 ug). /g). Similarly, liver zinc concentrations were many times higher in patients than controls (104-128 vs. 1.9-3.2 ug/g dry weight). Interpretation.

The severity of neurological signs, defined by semiquantitative scores of motor impairment, was highly correlated (r = -0.80) with the reduction of striatal rCMRGlc. Clinical. Scores, striatal rCMRGlc, and degree of abnormalities on MRI showed no correlation with different dopamine D2 receptor binding indices. Sequential PET measurements in three patients during treatment with chelating agents revealed a moderate increase in striatal rCMRGlc (in two patients) and a moderate to marked increase in striatal D2 receptor binding (in three patients) in association with clinical improvement. Our data suggest that the rCMRGlc represents a sensitive and objective measure to assess and monitor striatal and extrastriatal involvement in WD. The lack of correlation between striatal dopamine D2 receptor and rCMRGlc binding and structural abnormalities may be explained by the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and different responses to treatment in WD patients.",,"Schlaug, G.;Hefter, H.;Engelbrecht, V.;Kuwert, T.;Arnold, S.;Stocklin, G.;Seitz, R.

The results showed that the Vocable IQ (VIQ), the Performance IQ (PIQ) and the Full IQ (FIQ) of the HLD patients were markedly lower than those of the control (P < 0.005), especially in visual space disorder. , which indicated that the copper ion being deposited in the patient's brain not only impaired motor neuron functions but also had a marked effect on the patient's intelligence. After treatment, total intelligence level including VIQ, PIQ and FIQ increased, particularly in PIQ where all scores obviously increased (P < 0.001). It was also shown that intelligence impairment in patients with HLD became more severe as the course of the disease was prolonged and early treatment made it easier for the IQ level to approach normal criteria.

2544,"Disposition behavior and mechanism of absorption of trientine, an orphan drug for Wilson's disease. [Japanese]","The disposition behavior of trientine, a selective copper chelating drug for Wilson's disease, and its metabolites were studied in normal Wilson's disease patients and rats. A high concentration of metabolites appeared in blood samples from patients and rats in the early stage after administration of trientine. In addition, a large amount of trientine metabolites were excreted in the urine of patients. These results suggest that trientine is remarkably subject to a first-pass effect. The drug concentration area under the curve (AUC) of the unchanged form and trientine metabolites in patients was not dependent on the administered dose. It seems that the absorption process is an important factor for the disposition behavior of trientine, we have also investigated the absorption characteristics of trientine by rat intestinal brush border membrane vesicles. The absorption characteristics of trientine were similar to those of the physiological polyamines, spermine and spermidine. The absorption rate of trientine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by spermine and spermidine. Furthermore, spermine competitively inhibited trientine uptake with a Ki value of 18.6 muM. This value is very close to the Km value for spermine (30.4 muM). These data suggested that the mechanism of uptake of trientine into brush border membrane vesicles of the rat small intestine was almost identical to that of spermine and spermidine, and that physiological polyamines appear to have the ability to inhibit the absorption of trientine in the gastrointestinal tract.",,"Tanabe, R.",1996,Mar,,0,0,

Mice and rats received trien-2HCl in their drinking water at concentrations of 0, 120, 600, or 3,000 ppm for up to 92 days. Twenty mice and 18 rats of each sex were assigned to each dose group fed a cereal-based (NIH-31) or purified (AIN-76A) diet, both with nutritionally adequate levels of copper. An additional control group of rats and mice received a Cu-deficient AIN-76A diet. This low-copper diet caused symptoms of Cu deficiency, such as anemia, hepatic periportal cytomegaly, pancreatic atrophy and multifocal necrosis, hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen, and increased heart weight, along with undetectable plasma copper levels in rats but not in rats. mice. Trien-2HCl somewhat reduced plasma copper levels (at 600 and 3000 ppm) in rats fed the AIN-76A diet, but did not induce the usual signs of copper deficiency. Trien-2HCl caused a higher frequency of uterine dilatation at 3000 ppm in rats fed the AIN-76A diet that was not observed in females fed the Cu-deficient diet. Triene-2HCl toxicity occurred only in mice in the highest dose group fed an AIN-76A diet. Increased frequencies of inflammation of the pulmonary interstitium and periportal fatty infiltration of the liver were observed in both sexes, and hematopoietic cell proliferation was observed in the spleen of males. Kidney and body weights were reduced in males, as was the incidence of renal cytoplasmic vacuolation. There were no signs of copper deficiency in mice exposed to trien-2HCl.

The changes in the concentrations of molybdenum (Mo) and Cu and their biological forms in serum of LEC rats determined at different times after a single intraperitoneal injection were compared with those of Wistar (normal) rats. The change in Mo concentration in serum of normal rats was monophasic, while in LEC rats it was biphasic. The phase in normal rats and the first phase in LEC rats seemed to reflect the process of uptake and disappearance of TTM in the livers of Wistar and LEC rats. On the other hand, the second phase in LEC rats paralleled Cu changes and seemed to reflect complex formation (Cu/thiomolybdate complex) between Mo and Cu accumulated in the liver. The complex specifically bound albumin as determined by high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS).

Systemic molybdenum (Mo) disposition and altered Cu distributions were compared in eight organs between LEC rats and Wistar (normal) rats at different times after a single intraperitoneal injection of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) for chelation therapy. Excretion via urine and faeces was also examined. Hepatic Mo disposition was dramatically increased in LEC rats, suggesting that the interaction of TTM with Cu results in increased Mo uptake. Concentrations of Mo and Cu decreased in the liver of LEC rats over time, while that those of the spleen increased. Although the concentration of Mo taken up by the kidney decreased with time after an initial increase in both rats, the concentration of Cu increased with time. Cu was not redistributed to the brain. Urinary Mo excretion was decreased and fecal Mo excretion increased in LEC rats compared to Wistar rats. These results indicate that TTM is absorbed by the liver depending on the Cu content, and Cu and Mo eliminated from the liver are mainly excreted through feces. Cu redistribution was observed in the spleen and kidneys, but not in the brain.",,"Ogra, Y.;Ohmichi, M.;Suzuki, K. T.",1995,,,0,0,

Methods: Three European children between 10 and 29 months of age presented with abdominal distention, pyrexia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Over 1-5 weeks, his condition rapidly deteriorated due to liver failure. Two died within 2 months of onset and one received a successful liver transplant. In two cases, consideration of the diagnosis occurred only on examination of the liver after orthotopic liver transplantation or death. Light microscopy was used, with hematoxylin and eosin, reticulin and orcein stains. Copper levels in tissue, plasma, and water were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: All presented micronodular cirrhosis and severe hepatocellular necrosis with Mallory bodies and abundant positive orcein material. Liver copper concentrations ranged from 1100 to 1310 mg/g dry weight. For two patients, domestic water with a high copper content had been used for food preparation. No environmental source of excess copper could be identified in the third case.

2557,Wilson's disease. Evolutionary overview of diagnosis and treatment in the last forty years. [Japanese],"In 1912, Wilson and Fleischer independently reported autopsies of patients with progressive neurological disorder associated with liver cirrhosis, and proposed that the syndrome might be a specific disease of toxic origin. In 1952 Scheinberg demonstrated a deficiency of serum ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease and it was possible to diagnose the disease while the patient was still asymptomatic. In 1956, Walshe introduced penicillamine as the most excellent drug for the treatment of the disease. These momentous discoveries encouraged Japanese doctors to make an early diagnosis and try to prevent the disease. This conference was to review the changing landscape in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease in the period of forty years focusing on the experiences in Japan. Early detection of patients based on hypoceruloplasminemia made it possible to investigate the ages of onset of elevated serum GOT or GPT and the appearance of Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. So far, the youngest patients with elevated GPT and KF ring levels were three and five years old, respectively. It became popular that an unexpected elevation of serum transaminase in apparently healthy children aged 3 years and older led to examination for Wilson's disease, and an increasing number of unrelated patients were detected in late childhood. Now, mass screening for Wilson's disease is in progress. Follow-up studies on prophylaxis for more than thirty years definitively demonstrated that the onset of clinical symptoms was prevented by continuous penicillamine therapy. There were patients who developed symptoms such as hemolytic crises, motor impairment, and especially psychotic or affective disorders after stopping therapy for several years when they reached their twenties or thirties.

The incidence of hepatitis A is steadily declining thanks to the remarkable improvement of health teams. VHA vaccination is recently available and is effective in almost 100% of cases. Hepatitis B is a major public health problem. Between a quarter and a third of chronic carriers have acquired this infection during infancy or childhood and constitute a vast reservoir of the virus. Hepatitis B is associated with high morbidity and mortality (fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma). Routine vaccination is recommended. Pediatric chronic carriers may benefit from interferon alfa therapy. Hepatitis B is usually confined to various risk groups and tends to run a chronic course. Maternal-fetal transmission is described. Other known or unknown viruses can cause hepatitis, such as severe NANBNC childhood sporadic hepatitis that can be complicated by bone marrow aplasia. Among the metabolic causes, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson's disease are the most common, the latter being the one that requires rapid diagnosis and specific treatment.

2560,Liver disorders. Characteristics and proper management,"The spectrum of liver disease is extremely broad, and many of the underlying disorders have acute and chronic presentations. Most of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are explained by autoimmune diseases, viral infections and toxic insults. The management strategy for any liver disease is a combination of treatment of the symptoms and complications that arise, as well as pharmacological therapies relevant to the specific underlying diagnosis. Encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal bleeding, and pruritus are the main complications targeted by pharmacological treatment, although in some cases they represent only one aspect of overall management. Pharmacological treatment per se is largely ineffective in acute liver failure, with the possible exception of acetylcysteine, but many drugs are used in the treatment of the constituent components of this complex medical emergency. Treatments for specific liver conditions are expanding, especially in the areas of autoimmune and viral diseases. The increasing availability and success of liver transplantation have tended to change the emphasis of management, and it is often not appropriate to exhaust treatment options before referring the patient for transplantation.

[German],"BACKGROUND: Establishing an early diagnosis is crucial to successfully treating the majority of young patients with sudden-onset acute liver failure as the initial symptom of Wilson's disease. It is important to recognize the entity of fulminant Wilsonian hepatitis, because liver transplantation improves survival if performed in a timely manner. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cases regarding the characteristic profile of standard laboratory parameters and the clinical course of Wilsonian acute liver failure. RESULTS: In two female patients (ages 17 and 27) with nonautoimmune hemolysis, serum AST and ALT levels were only moderately elevated with markedly decreased ALT activity and relatively low serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels. Despite the immediate application of D-Penicillamin, one patient died from complications of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: In fulminant Wilsonian liver failure, the AP/bilirubin ratio is usually less than 2. In addition, estimation of serum free copper concentration and renal excretion of ionic copper in combination with non-autoimmune hemolysis provide clues to establish an early diagnosis of Wilsonian liver failure.",,"Herrmann, S.;Hofmann, W.;Theilmann, L.",1995,2022-08-15 00:00:00,,0,0,

2564,"Disordered copper metabolism in LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease: functions of metallothionein","Disordered copper (Cu) metabolism in LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease, was characterized by specifying Cu in the liver, bloodstream, and kidneys during the accumulation process and at the onset of jaundice; Cu accumulates in the liver with age in a form bound to metallothionein (MT). Massive Cu is released from MT when Cu accumulates beyond the capacity of MT synthesis. MT-bound Cu is not supplied to ceruloplasmin (Cp) during its maturation process, while the metal is transferred to Cu, zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD) directly from MT. Cu ions that do not bind to MT are transferred to Cp, and holo-Cp is excreted into the bloodstream near and at the onset of jaundice. Cu accumulated in the liver in a MT-bound form is selectively removed by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), and the animal at the onset of jaundice is recovered by chelation therapy. Mechanisms of the elimination reaction were proposed to involve the formation of MT/TTM, Cu/TTM and/or polymeric Cu/TTM complexes according to the stoichiometry of TTM to Cu. It was assumed that the Cu/TTM complex was expelled into the bloodstream and specifically bound to albumin. The TTM is absorbed by the liver according to the Cu content. Cu toxicity was explained by the active oxygen species produced in Cu-mediated reactions and the participation of MT.",,"Suzuki, K. T.",1995,,,0,0,

LEC rats were fed a semi-synthetic diet containing 10 ppm Cu for 40 days. Fischer rats were fed the same diet containing 10 or 500 ppm Cu for 40 days. Rats were injected subcutaneously with TTM at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals for the last 3 days. Hepatic Cu concentrations were 392 and 194 Âµg/g in Fischer and LEC rats not treated with TTM, respectively. However, hepatic MT concentration was approximately 10-fold higher in LEC rats than in Fischer rats. In Fischer rats, TTM increased Cu excretion in bile and serum, resulting in a reduction in hepatic Cu concentration (264 Âµg/g). In LEC rats, TTM injection accelerated Cu leakage into serum, but not biliary Cu excretion. The increase in serum concentration of Cu was 0.7 Âµg/ml in LEC rats compared to 14.4 Âµg/ml in Fischer rats. Hepatic Cu concentration was 170 Âµg/g in LEC rats treated with TTM. Serum ceruloplasmin activity (as oxidase) in LEC rats was not increased by TTM injection.

2571,Effects of some chelating agents on urinary copper excretion in rats,"In order to estimate the potential benefits of new chelating agents that may increase copper excretion in chronic copper intoxication arising in Wilson's disease, the relative ability of nine chelating agents to induce urinary copper excretion was compared. with that of D-penicillamine (DPA ) and triethylenetetramine.2HCl (TRIEN), all administered ip at 1 mmol/kg to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The compounds examined were the following: tris(2-aminoethyl)amine.3HCl (TREN), tetraethylenepentamine.5HCl (TETREN), pentaethylenehexamine.6HCl (PENTEN), 1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecane.4HCl (TAUD), 1 ,5,8,12-tetraazadodecane.4HCl (TADD), 1-N-benzyltriethylenetetramine.HCl (BzTT), 4,7,10,13-tetraazatridecanoic acid.2H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4 </inf> (TTPA), 1,10-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazadecane.4HCl (BPTETA) and N,N-bis(2-pyridyl-methyl)-4- acid (aminomethyl)benzoic acid (4ABA). Of these, BzTT, TTPA, and 4ABA are new chelating agents that have not been previously reported. The factors by which these chelating agents improved copper excretion over control (untreated) levels were as follows: DPA, 7.2; TRAIN, 1.6; TRIEN, 4.0; TETREN, 10.1; PENTEN, 7.8; TAUD, 7.8; SADD, 2.6; APTT, 5.6; BzTT, 1.8; and 4ABA, 5.5. The results indicate that it may well be possible to develop additional chelating agents that are equal to or superior to those now used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, as well as structural types whose immunological properties may be significantly different from DPA or TRIEN, the compounds currently used clinically for this disorder.",,"Jones, M.

2573,Case Report: Concordant Traumatic Brainstem Contusion Delayed Diagnosis in a Young Man With Wilson's Disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The corresponding gene locus has been located on the long arm of chromosome 13. Three different clinical variants of the disease can be distinguished: hepatocerebral, abdominal/hepatic and central nervous type. The heterogeneity of symptoms can cause problems in the differential diagnosis, especially when another concordant disorder may also explain the pathogenesis of the symptoms. The case report of a young man who sustained a brainstem contusion demonstrates the potential for misinterpretation because his presenting symptoms could be attributed to traumatic brain injury followed by adjustment disorder or Wilson's disease. Clinical signs included left-sided hemiparesis, bilateral gaze nystagmus, marked dysarthria with consecutive generalized mutism, choreoathetoid movements, spasmodic torticollis, and gaze-dependent diplopia.

It has been shown that the first step in the removal of Cu from Cu-MT forms a complex between MT and TTM through (MT)-S-Cu-S-(TTM) bridges (referred to as the MT/TTM complex). Additional TTM was shown to remove Cu from the MT/TTM complex as a second step to form the Cu/TTM complex by releasing MT. The Cu/TTM complex binds specifically to serum albumin and high molecular weight proteins in the absence of albumin, and is presumed to be a form of Cu for exit by TTM treatment.",,"Ogra, Y.;Suzuki, K.

Ionic Cu (cuprous and cupric ions) was incorporated more efficiently than metal bound to metallothionein. Cu binds not only to the Cu binding site but also to the Zn binding site. Although the Zn in the reaction medium and the metal bound to the Zn binding site of SOD little affected the binding reactivity of ionic Cu, they perturbed the reactivity of metallothionein bound Cu to the Cu binding site. Both ionic and metallothionein-bound Zn were transferred with comparable efficiency to the Zn binding site but not to the Cu binding site. Coexistent ionic Cu but not metallothionein-bound Cu in the medium inhibited Zn binding to SOD. The results indicate that ionic Cu can be transferred to the Cu and Zn binding sites of SOD more efficiently than metallothionein-bound Cu, while both ionic Zn and metallothionein-bound Zn are transferred only to the binding site of SOD.

2579,Copper metabolism leading to and following acute hepatitis in LEC rats,"The process of accumulation of copper (Cu) in the liver and the following metabolic disorder of Cu were examined in LEC rats, a mutant strain that accumulates Cu with age and shows acute spontaneous hepatitis and/or hepatoma. Cu concentration in the liver of female rats was ~220 ug/g liver at 2 weeks of age, decreased to 100 ug/g liver at 4-6 weeks, and then began to increase linearly with age until the highest concentration of 250 ug/g. g of liver at 16 weeks. Although the level of Cu expressed by concentration (mug/g liver) decreased during weaning, it increased linearly with age when expressed by content (mg/liver), indicating a constant and preferential accumulation of Cu in the liver. Cu concentration stopped increasing at 16 weeks in the liver, followed by a sudden decrease to half the highest level. Biological markers (serum lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activities) of liver damage began to increase, along with the appearance of signs of jaundice, when Cu reached the highest concentration. The distributions of Cu and zinc (Zn) in the supernatant fraction of the liver indicated that both metals were distributed mainly in metallothionein (MT) and, to a lesser extent, in superoxide dismutase in a gel filtration column during the course of the experiments. Serum concentration of Cu began to increase in a form of ceruloplasmin, along with serum marker enzyme activities of liver damage. Cu concentration in the kidneys also began to increase after the increase in serum Cu. The results indicate that Cu accumulates as MT in the liver of LEC rats up to a maximum level of ~250 Âµg/g liver, and then decreases sharply with the onset of acute hepatitis. The maximum level appears to be related to the capacity for MT synthesis, and acute hepatitis is presumed to occur when Cu accumulates beyond capacity. Serum Cu started to rise from the abnormally low level when the metal accumulated beyond the capacity of MT synthesis in the liver, and was partially reabsorbed by the kidneys and the rest was excreted in the urine. The changes in the levels of iron and zinc in relation to those of Cu were determined and discussed.",,"Suzuki, K.

2584,"Copper: Not too little, not too much, but fair","Copper is an essential trace element with a well-established mechanism for maintaining the metal balance in the body, which is controlled by at least two genes. The interruption of a gene on the X chromosome determines a defect in the process of copper absorption, with the consequent deficiency of available copper at the cellular level. This results in abnormalities in collagen formation and brain maturation, leading to premature death. So far there is no effective treatment. Disruption of the other gene that controls copper, located on chromosome 13, is associated with the accumulation of excess copper in the body, first in the liver leading to cirrhosis and then in the brain leading to destruction of the motor control center and, frequently, personality changes. Excess copper can also cause kidney damage, osteoarticular changes, and joint pain. If kidney injury leads to urinary calcium loss and other tubular defects, osteoporosis or, occasionally, osteomalacia with pathologic fractures may be present. In this disease, abnormal copper stores can be mobilized with chelating agents or depleted by administration of zinc salts or thiomolybdate. This usually, but not invariably, leads to improvement or even complete reversal of symptoms. Brain lesions, demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may also resolve. The mechanism of this phenomenon is obscure, but suggests that the long-held doctrine that there is no recovery in the central nervous system may need to be revised.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1995,,,0,0,

The age of onset was 9 years for liver involvement and 17 years for neurological involvement. The mean delay in diagnosis was 14 months. Chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and fulminant liver failure were the clinical forms of liver disease. Patients with neurological disorders had behavioral disturbances and extrapyramidal manifestations such as dystonia and parkinsonism. The patients responded well to penicillamine, except for 3 who died of liver complications, in whom treatment was delayed or discontinued.

2587,MRI of the liver in Wilson's disease. [German],"To show that Wilson's disease is a likely cause of multiple low-intensity liver nodules, we obtained MR images in 16 patients with clinically and histopathologically confirmed Wilson's disease. In correspondence with the morphological changes, the magnetic resonance allowed the subdivision of the patients into two groups. Using a T<inf>2</inf> weighted spin echo sequence (TR/TE = 2000/45-90), liver parenchyma showed multiple minute low intensity nodules surrounded by high intensity septa in 10 of 16 patients. 5 patients also had low-intensity nodules on T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images (TR/TE = 600/20). In patients in this group, histopathology revealed liver cirrhosis (n = 7) and fibrosis (n = 2). The common feature of this group of patients was the marked infiltration of inflammatory cells in the fibrous septa, increased copper concentration in the liver parenchyma, and various pathological changes in laboratory data. In the remaining 6 patients, no pathological change in liver morphology was demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, corresponding to slight histopathological changes in the parenchyma and normal laboratory data. As low-intensity nodules surrounded by high-intensity septa can be demonstrated in patients with marked inflammatory infiltration of the liver parenchyma, MRI can help define Wilson's patients with a worse prognosis. In patients with low-intensity liver nodules and an unknown cause of liver cirrhosis, laboratory data and histopathology should be checked when looking for disorders of copper metabolism.",,"Vogl, T.

Concentrations of liver Cu (100 Âµg/g) and metallothionein (MT)-bound Cu (2600 to 540 Âµg/g protein) were markedly reduced by injection. On the other hand, renal Cu concentration increased significantly, but brain Cu concentration increased only very slightly. The reduction in hepatic Cu concentration was accompanied by reductions in Zn and Fe concentrations in liver, kidney, and brain. The TTM compound slightly (about 3-fold) stimulated Cu excretion in bile, but strongly (about 40-fold) in blood. In rats not treated with TTM, most of the biliary (100%) and serum (78%) Cu was recovered in the fraction soluble in trichloroacetic acid (TCA). On the other hand, in TTM-treated rats, bile and serum Cu were overwhelmingly recovered in the TCA insoluble fraction, probably in the form of a Cu-TTM-albumin complex. Our results suggest that although there is an inherent failure in the liver's intrinsic Cu secretory process in LEC rats, the TTM compound can remove Cu from Cu-MT, resulting in decreased hepatic Cu.",,"Sugawara, N.;Li, D.;Sugawara, C.",1994,,,0,0,

The author's formulation of efficacy and toxicity suggests that certain medications commonly used in movement disorders should be discontinued prior to pregnancy, if possible. These medications include neuroleptics, amantadine, diazepam, primidone, selegiline, and reserpine. Pregnancy may unmask preexisting potential for chorea (ie, chorea gravidarum) and often has a mild exacerbating effect on PD symptoms; however, it has little effect on other movement disorders.

No consistent significant correlations were found between copper metabolism and pyramidal tract function tested by magnetic brain stimulation. An improvement in CCTs and response amplitudes was observed with copper removal therapy only in the early phases of therapy. There was no correlation with duration of therapy or neurological symptoms. Thus, magnetic brain stimulation appears to be sensitive in detecting subclinical pyramidal tract impairment in WD, but appears to test too specific an aspect of motor impairment in WD to reflect the general neurological status of patients.

2599,Liver disease and psychiatric illness: relationships and treatment,"There has long been speculation about a relationship between liver disease and psychiatric symptoms. While liver detoxification renders exogenous substances harmless to the body, there are times when the liver can convert a harmless substance into a more toxic substance. With such an important role, the liver protects all the organs of the body. When the liver malfunctions, toxic metabolites harmful to the brain can be produced. As the brain receives a high blood supply, a large number of metabolites reach this organ. Hence, the metabolic function of the liver maintains a delicate reciprocal relationship between both organs. Also, several psychiatric medications affect liver functions. Another puzzling clinical problem is the difficulty in treating psychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disease. For example, benzodiazepines that do not affect liver function in physically healthy psychiatric patients can induce hepatic coma in patients with liver disease. Benzodiazepine antagonists produce dramatic and temporary improvement in patients with hepatic coma. Clinically, many psychoactive drugs cause liver complications. The same drugs that cause hepatic side effects are needed for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disorders. To properly handle these situations, a thorough understanding of the side effects of these medications is necessary.",,"Ananth, J.;Swartz, R.;Burgoyne, K.;Gadasally, R.",1994,,,0,0,

2601,"Wilson's disease. Physiopathology, therapeutic approach and clinical contribution. [Italian]","Wilson's disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder that affects about five people for every million inhabitants. The primary defect is located in the liver and the disease is manifested by the accumulation of copper in the tissues. Ceruloplasmin depletion, which until a few years ago was mistakenly thought to be the pathogenic cause of Wilson's disease, is an epiphenomenon of the underlying metabolic defect characterized by defective biliary excretion of copper. There are four stages in the natural history of the disease: 1) an asymptomatic stage of hepatic copper accumulation; 2) release and redistribution of copper leading to hepatocellular necrosis and hemolysis; 3) extrahepatic accumulation of copper leading to the appearance of cirrhosis and neurological damage; 4) stage of homeostasis after treatment but with possible irreversible neurological damage. Treatment of Wilson's diseases takes the form of drug, dietary, and surgical therapy. Through the formation of copper and metal protein complexes, D-penicillamine depletes copper deposits, causing the reduction or disappearance of hepatic and neurological symptoms; a small percentage of treated patients develop a nephrotic syndrome that requires discontinuation of the drug. In this case, a valid alternative is triethylenetetramine dichloride (TETA), which causes an increase in cupremia during cupruresis. The response to pharmacological treatment is better the earlier the start of treatment and the more regular its administration. The dietary intake of copper should be reduced while avoiding foods with a high copper content. Liver transplant obviously leads to 'resolution' of the underlying metabolic problem in patients who develop fulminant hepatitis with hypercupremia and haemolysis and, of course, in cases of uncompensated cirrhosis unresponsive to chelation therapy. Finally, the authors describe the case of a young man with early-stage Wilson's disease who developed severe nephrotic syndrome after D-penicillamine therapy; the new TETA therapy is better tolerated and the patient today continues to maintain the disease in good functional compensation.",,"Gallo, V.;Riva, P.;Sidoli, L.;Bisbocci, D.",1994,,,0,0,

Design: Case report. The patient described is briefly compared with a previously studied group of 13 similar presymptomatic patients who received zinc therapy without any clinical worsening and who had a follow-up of 3 to 9 years. Setting: Referral hospital. Patients: The patient was referred to us. Intervention: The patient had been initially treated with penicillamine. Main outcome measure: The main outcome of interest is permanent neurological disability, depending on the type of initial treatment. Results: The result of initial penicillamine therapy in the described patient is permanent neurological disability. This is thought to be due to hepatic copper mobilization and redistribution causing high copper levels in key areas of the brain. Conclusion: We conclude that penicillamine used as initial therapy, even in patients with neurologically asymptomatic Wilson's disease, increases the risk of inducing permanent neurological damage.",,"Brewer, G.

On the other hand, ceruloplasmin (Cp) is synthesized in the liver and excreted into the blood plasma mainly as an apoprotein before the onset of acute hepatitis and then as a hologram at the onset of jaundice. Thus, Cu is supplied differentially between Cp and SOD, and at different times, ie before and at the onset of acute hepatitis. Cu availability in apo-SOD was examined to explain the mechanisms of differential Cu supply between three different forms of Cu; i) cuprous ion bound to glutathione, ii) free cupric ion and iii) cuprous ion bound to MT. Cu was transferred to SOD from all three Cu complexes, although MT-bound Cu was a less efficient Cu source for apo-SOD. The results indicate that SOD is always present in the holographic form in LEC rats because even MT-bound Cu can be supplied to SOD, whereas Cp is present in apo form because Cu is sequestered in MT and not available in free ionic forms. in LEC rats before the onset of acute hepatitis.",,"Suzuki, K.

Cu and metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels in the liver of LEC rats were made to decrease to the same levels as those in LEA rats by selective removal of Cu in vivo with tetrathiomolybdate. Cu was taken up by LEC rat cells to the same extent as LEA rat cells by low medium Cu exposure and to a greater extent by high medium Cu exposure, whereas the level of MT mRNA in LEC rat cells dose-dependently increased at a much higher rate. higher rate than that of LEA rats. MT mRNA levels in both cells were comparable by exposure to cadmium, zinc, and dexamethasone.

The effects of tetrathiotungstate on systemic copper metabolism in normal and copper-treated rats,"Intraperitoneal administration of tetrathiotungstate to rats (6-17.4 mg W/Kg BW) caused profound changes in copper metabolism in both normal and copper-pretreated rats. Plasma albumin-associated copper was increased, liver copper, particularly cytosolic copper, was decreased, and biliary excretion was increased. There was also a movement of copper to higher molecular weight proteins in both liver cytosol and bile. Unlike penicillamine, tetrathiotungstate did not increase liver cytosolic apometallothionein levels and reduced the copper-induced increase. Copper bound to metallothionein was removed. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was inhibited and there was evidence of increased movement of copper into subcellular organelles, probably lysosomes. It is concluded that tetrathiotungstate has a true 'decopper' effect and could be considered as an alternative to thiomolybdates in the treatment of copper storage diseases.",,"McQuaid, A.;Lamand, M.;Mason, J.",1994,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0162-0134%2894%2980005-7,0,0,

At tracer levels (12.5 mug W), the major plasma-binding protein eluted at the ceruloplasmin position, but the association did not prevent liver uptake of thiotungstate. At higher dose levels (1.5 mg W) there was considerable hydrolysis immediately after injection with rapid excretion of the tracer in the urine. The [<sup>185</sup>W]tetrathiotungstate remaining in plasma was associated with albumin and the amount retained was increased by pretreatment of rats with copper. Increased albumin binding did not prevent hepatic uptake and, during short-term copper pretreatment, increased movement of the isotope into subcellular organelles, probably lysosomes. Bile excretion was increased and the marker was associated with high molecular weight proteins. In the liver cytosol, <sup>185</sup>W was bound to specific proteins, not yet characterized. At the higher dose levels, there was some movement towards higher molecular weight proteins and this was greatly increased by copper pretreatment.

We report a high accumulation of hepatic MT protein (more than 100-fold compared to wild-type mice) in toxic milk (tx) mice, along with markedly higher cytosolic copper and zinc levels. Increased MT gene transcription alone could not explain the high levels of constitutive MT protein, since MT mRNA levels were not increased in livers of tx mice. However, hepatic MT was significantly more stable in adult tx mice: MT half-life (t(1/2)) was 79 or 77% longer than in wild-type mice before and after Cd induction, respectively. Treatment with Cd or Zn increased the accumulation of MT mRNA, but not MT protein, in livers of tx mice: Cd displaced MT-bound Zn and Cu in pre-existing MT. Thus, tx mice appear to accumulate hepatic MT as a result of decreased protein degradation.

2624,"Zinc-induced metabolism of metallothionein and copper in intestinal mucosa, liver and kidney of rats","Large doses of parenteral zinc (Zn) and/or feeding high-Zn diets to animals or humans for prolonged periods affect copper (Cu) metabolism. Previous work suggests that Zn-induced metallothionein (MT) in intestinal epithelial cells binds Cu and inhibits its absorption. This study was designed to determine the effects of treating rats with high dietary or parenteral Zn on Cu metabolism and its relationship to MT in the intestinal epithelium, liver, and kidneys. Six-week-old male rats were fed a control diet containing 42 mg Zn and 6 mg Cu/kg for one week. They were then divided into the three groups. One group continued to receive the control diet while the other received a similar diet containing 560 mg Zn/kg. A third group, fed the control diet, received a subcutaneous dose of 90 mg Zn/kg body weight every 2-3 days for the duration of the experiment. Rats in each group were sacrificed on days 7 and 14. Low Cu status in Zn-treated rats was indicated by lower than normal serum Cu concentration, serum ceruloplasmin activity, low liver Cu concentrations and kidneys and low cytochrome C oxidase activity. However, none of these changes were related to an increase in Cu as a result of Zn-induced MT in the intestinal epithelial cell. In contrast, as MT concentrations increased, Cu concentration decreased. This study suggests that the effects of high-Zn treatment on Cu status are not a result of the long-held theory that Zn-induced intestinal MT sequesters Cu and prevents its entry into the circulation. Instead, it may be caused by a direct effect of high Zn concentrations in the lumen on Cu transport into the epithelial cell.",,"Reeves, P. G.;Rossow, K. L.;Bobilya, D.

LEC groups at 7 and 13 weeks of age showed lower Cu concentrations in all regions compared to Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats. However, in 32-week-old LEC rats, Cu concentration increased in 7 regions, notably significantly in the striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, and cortex. No changes in Zn concentration were found in any region. Fe concentration increased in the olfactory cortex and lobes. All three LEC groups showed very high liver Cu concentration and low serum Cu concentration compared to LEA rats. However, in 32-week-old LEC rats, liver Cu decreased and serum Cu increased compared to the other two LEC groups. These results suggest that the increased brain concentration of Cu is closely related to the inherently abnormal Cu metabolism and then to changes in Cu metabolism starting at about 13 weeks after birth.",,"Sugawara, N.;Ikeda, T.;Sugawara, C.;Kohgo, Y.;Kato, J.;Takeichi, N.",1992,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993%2892%2991587-5,0,0,

The average age of onset of symptoms and signs was 18.1 years. Kayser-Pleischer ring was the most frequent sign (97.1%), followed by tremor (76.5%) and rigidity (41.2%). Biochemically, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels decreased, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion increased in all patients. Interestingly, 19 patients tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, in contrast to its high prevalence (15%) among the general population in Taiwan. Six patients received liver biopsy to show liver cirrhosis in 2 patients and active chronic hepatitis in the remaining four. Atomic absorption was used for quantitative copper testing in 2 patients to show abnormally high copper content in the liver tissue of both. All patients received D-penicillamine treatment with improved neurological symptoms, and one patient was switched to zinc sulfate due to bone marrow suppression. By the end of 1989, 5 patients had died of liver failure: one of them died 12 days after liver transplantation due to primary graft failure and sepsis, and two died of neurological complications. This study showed that the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of our patients were similar to Western reports, except that most of our early-onset patients developed a mixed syndrome rather than liver symptoms alone.",,"Chang, C.

2678,"Metallothionein concentration in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and liver metastases from colorectal cancer","In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, liver copper concentrations increase during the course of the disorder. Accumulated copper is believed to be detoxified by metallothionein, a protein that binds copper and zinc. In liver metastases from colorectal cancer, copper and zinc concentrations are often decreased compared to normal liver tissue, but concomitant levels of metallothionein are poorly understood. In the present study, metallothionein concentrations were determined in archival liver samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, and in both normal and malignant liver samples from patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. Twenty-seven control liver samples contained 3.98 +/- 1.55 mg metallothionein/g protein. Of 21 liver samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, which had a mean metallothionein concentration of 6.06 +/- 5.03 mg/g protein, 6 were above the highest control level. Hepatic metallothionein concentrations for the 8 patients with Wilson's disease were significantly elevated (10.98 +/- 6.93 mg/g protein, P < 0.005 vs. controls and P < 0.05 vs. primary biliary cirrhosis). In the 11 liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinomas, metallothionein concentrations (1.17 +/- 0.90 mg/g protein) were significantly (p < 0.005) lower than those in surrounding normal liver tissue (4.25 +/- 0.005). /- 1.75 mg/g of protein). We conclude that in primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, increased concentrations of metallothionein in the liver can detoxify accumulated copper.

Serum ceruloplasmin and total copper levels were significantly lower in Wilson's disease patients compared to all other groups, but three children with Wilson's disease had normal ceruloplasmin levels and seven had normal total copper levels. No significant differences were found for serum free copper levels and liver copper content between patients with Wilson's disease and the other groups. Baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion was significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease compared with the other patients, but six children with Wilson's disease had levels just above the upper limit of normal, overlapping with values. obtained in three children with liver failure, two with acute hepatitis, two with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and three with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Urinary copper excretion 24 hours after penicillamine challenge proved to be the single most accurate diagnostic test; levels greater than 25 mmol/24 h were present in 15 of 17 patients with Wilson's disease, but in only 1 child with hepatic failure of 58 with other disorders.

D-penicillamine is a copper chelating agent and one of the effective drugs for human Wilson's disease, in which abnormal copper metabolism is also observed. The results show that D-penicillamine treatment inhibited the elevation of serum transaminases, suppressed abnormal histological changes in the liver, and completely prevented the occurrence of hepatitis in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats. In addition, we found that liver copper concentration and serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels decreased, while urine copper level increased in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with D-penicillamine.

Serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and AST found in fulminant Wilson's disease were significantly different from those found in other cases of fulminant hepatic failure, but differentiation from other causes of fulminant hepatic failure on the basis of these parameters was not possible. biochemists Alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin and AST aspartate/bilirubin ratios derived from the above parameters were also significantly lower in fulminant Wilson's disease than in other categories of fulminant liver failure, but it was not possible to distinguish between diagnostic categories on this basis. When proportions were selected that correctly identified all cases of fulminant Wilson's disease, 59/190 (31%) and 84/190 (44%) cases of non-Wilsonian fulminant liver failure were wrongly assigned a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease , by phosphatase/bilirubin and AST/bilirubin ratios, respectively. A low alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin ratio (<0.57) in any category of fulminant liver failure suggested a significantly worse prognosis than cases with higher ratios (chi<sup>2</sup>, Yates correction = 5 .37, p = 0.02). In the Wilson disease group, serum and liver copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal in 4/21, 2/15, and 2/19, respectively, while urine copper level was elevated in 18/18 and was the most valuable test in diagnosis. Massively elevated hepatic copper deposits with normal serum copper concentrations were observed in some patients; in others, the tissue copper concentration of different regions of the same liver varied up to 7-fold.

Jejunal loop absorption rates and in vitro metabolism in liver fraction S9 (9000 xg supernatant) were approximately the same for both strains. The decreased urinary excretion of trientine in LEC rats is believed to be primarily due to decreased functional activity of the kidney, because urinary excretion of creatinine and phenolsulfonphthalein was significantly lower in LEC rats than in Wistar rats. Both acceleration of urinary copper excretion and reduction of hepatic copper levels were observed with trientine treatment in 6-week-old LEC rats. However, in 13-week-old LEC rats, no effect on hepatic copper clearance was observed, although urinary copper excretion was increased.

The index case presented with anicteric hepatitis and hydrops of the gallbladder. Neurological involvement appeared later. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was based on the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, a low serum ceruloplasmin level, and an elevated urinary copper concentration. Histological examination of the liver biopsy sample revealed active cirrhosis. Acute liver failure developed during D-penicillamine therapy. Continuation of the drug at a lower dose, along with other supportive measures, reversed this. After three years of therapy, the index patient's neurological signs disappeared and liver function and gallbladder size and function returned to normal. Family evaluation revealed that three other siblings have the disease and all have been treated with D-penicillamine. The parents are related but asymptomatic. An unusual feature of the index case was the presence of a distended, nonfunctioning gallbladder that returned to normal with removal of the copper. Although treatment with D-penicillamine possibly precipitated acute liver failure, paradoxically it was also successful in its treatment.",,"Ahmad, F. E. R. E.;El-Tayeb, A. A.;Satti, M.

However, the effect depends on the presence of intracellular copper, since depletion of copper by chelators blocks the effect and does not alter the ability of dexamethasone to stimulate mRNA production. Penicillamine did not alter <sup>64</sup>Cu distribution in hepatocytes as measured by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), although the pattern may be affected by the amount of MT present. The data indicate that penicillamine removes copper from some intermediate ligand, making it available to induce metallothionein.

Gastroduodenal intubation was performed in six healthy subjects and five patients with Wilson's disease. After intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (40 ng/kg/h), pancreatobiliary zinc secretion increased from a basal rate of 283.1 +/- 75.8 nmol/L/min to a peak of 716.6 +/- 175.3 nmol/L/min. in normal subjects. Normal subjects on a zinc-deficient diet had lower basal (66.8 +/- 15.8 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (559.5 +/- 31 nmol/L/min) pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion. than with a diet with sufficient zinc. In contrast to markedly reduced pancreaticobiliary copper secretion, zinc-untreated patients with Wilson's disease had normal basal (226.6 +/- 126 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (728.7 +/- 195 nmol/L/min) secretion. .5 nmol/L/min) of zinc. . These studies indicate that a considerable amount of zinc is secreted in the pancreatobiliary fluid in healthy subjects and that there was no alteration of zinc secretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Our data also indicate that pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion is dependent on the zinc status of the subjects, suggesting that endogenous zinc secretion may play an important role in zinc homeostasis.",,"Lee, H.

2733,Hepatolenticular degeneration. [Serbian],"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is an inherited disease in which the metabolic disorder of copper leads to its accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea and kidneys with consequent pathological changes in these organs. The hereditary mechanism of the disease is autosomal recessive with a prevalence of 30-100 per 1,000,000 inhabitants. The etiology of this disease is not yet explained. There are two hypotheses. The first is that it is ceruloplasmin metabolism disorder caused by insufficient synthesis of normal ceruloplasmin, or functionally abnormal ceruloplasmin synthesis. The second is: the blockade of the biliary excretion of copper that is a consequence of the functional defect of the hepatic lysosomes. The pathogenetic mechanism of the disease is, firstly, the long-term accumulation of copper in the liver, and later, when the hepatic depot is full, it is released into the circulation and accumulates in the brain, cornea, kidneys and bones, causing appropriate pathological changes. The toxic activity of copper is a consequence of its activity on enzymes, particularly those with the -SH group. There are two basic clinical forms of the disease: liver disease or neurological disease. Before puberty, liver damage is more common, while in adolescents and young adults the neurological form of the disease is common. Liver disease is nonspecific and is characterized by symptoms of cirrhosis and aggressive chronic hepatitis. The only specificity is hemolytic anemia, which, in combination with the previous symptoms, is important for the diagnosis of the disease. Neurological symptoms are the most frequent consequence of pathological changes in the basal ganglia. In our patients, the most frequent symptoms were tremor (63%); dysarthria, choreoathetosis and rigidity (38%); ataxia and mental disorders (31%); dysphagia and dystonia (12%), diplopia, hypersalivation, nystagmus and Babinski's sign (6%). Among the pathological changes in other tissues and organs, the most important is the finding of the Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea as a result of copper accumulation. Its importance for an accurate diagnosis is great. The diagnosis of the disease is based on the history, clinical examination, specific and non-specific laboratory tests. The therapy of choice is penicillamine. If we use it early, the result will be a good remission in most patients. Late diagnosis or delay in treatment causes death, which is the result of bleeding from esophageal varices or basal ganglia disease. Immunological damage caused by penicillamine requires discontinuation of therapy and substitution with three-ethyl-tetra-amine (TETA). We also use zinc salts and tetrathiomolybdate in the therapy of this disease. The pathogenesis, clinical picture and therapy of the disease are based on our own results.",,"Zudenigo, D.;Relja, M.",1990,,,0,0,

While receiving penicillamine, 1 g IV four times a day, the neurological signs worsened and akinesia, mutism, tachyarrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias developed, as well as transient respiratory failure. Serum copper concentration on the sixth day of treatment markedly decreased to 28 ug/dl, increasing to 60 ug/dl on the ninth day. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was initially 4,500-5,000 cups. Only after a drastic reduction in the dose of penicillamine to 600 mg three times a day was there any improvement and after 11 weeks the patient was walking again and was discharged. The marked depletion of copper, mainly hepatic, due to the high dose of penicillamine was the probable cause of the patient's initial deterioration.

Our cases were nervous variables of this disease or pseudosclerosis (Westphal-Strumphell). The first three patients showed tremor-rigidity and a tremor form of disease. All the patients were men. We believe that early identification of this disease is very important, in order to reduce the time from the acute manifestation to make a diagnosis and apply the appropriate therapy. This period of time in our cases was from 0 to 4 years. Except for the use of d-penicillamine (up to 900 mg/day), we believe that the use of acidum ascorbicum (up to 4.5 g/day) is also very important. This acidum shows less consumption of d-penicillamine and has low complications. The recurrent work capacity begins with the disappearance of the neurological phenomenology and with the rehabilitation of the psychic state.

2751,Trace metal interactions in vivo: inorganic cobalt enhances urinary copper excretion without producing an associated zincuresis in rats,"The effects of cobalt chloride on copper and zinc metabolism in male Sprague-Dawley rats were examined. These effects were compared to those of penicillamine, a chelating agent used in the therapy of the genetic abnormality of copper metabolism in humans, Wilson's disease. Cobalt caused an increase (~4-fold) in urinary copper excretion that lasted up to 72 hours after a single dose of cobalt. In contrast to the marked increase in urinary zinc excretion produced by penicillamine, cobalt greatly reduced (~75%) urinary zinc production. Tissue copper and zinc concentrations were measured after cobalt treatment at doses ranging from 12 to 60 mg/kg body weight. A substantially reduced renal copper concentration (~25%) was observed 1 and 3 days after cobalt administration. In addition, cobalt produced a concomitant dose-dependent elevation (up to 1.6-fold) in hepatic zinc concentration. Cytosolic zinc eluted from a Sephadex G-75 column in the molecular weight region associated with metallothionein. The time-dependent induction of metallothionein concentration (10-fold) in the liver by cobalt was confirmed by the cadmium/hemoglobin affinity assay. The ability of inorganic cobalt to elevate liver zinc concentration and produce increased urinary copper excretion without the zincuresis that normally accompanies penicillamine administration represents a newly defined biological property of this essential trace metal.",,"Rosenberg, D.

In the presence of equal amounts of liver copper load, control rats show liver damage but zinc-treated rats do not. Zinc-treated rats have much higher levels of hepatic metallothionein. Gel filtration studies reveal that much of the liver copper in zinc-treated rats is found in this metallothionein fraction, while copper in control animals is associated primarily with high or low molecular weight fractions. Subcutaneous zinc therapy also induces intestinal but not cerebral metallothionein. We interpret these findings to indicate that zinc therapy protects against liver copper toxicity by inducing hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters copper in a non-toxic form.",,"Lee, D.

2761,Effect of chelators on copper metabolism and copper stores in mouse hepatocytes,"Copper storage disorders are usually treated with chelation therapy. In general, chelators are believed to work by mobilizing copper from the liver, allowing it to be excreted in the urine. This article has examined the effect of chelators on copper uptake and storage in mouse hepatocytes. Penicillamine, a clinically important chelator, does not block copper uptake or remove copper from hepatocytes. Two other copper chelators, sar and diamsar, which from very stable and kinetically inert Cu<sup>2+</sup> complexes by encapsulating the metal ion in an organic cage, blocked the accumulation of copper in the cells and eliminated to 80% of the copper associated with the cell. They also removed most (~80%) of the <sup>64</sup>Cu accumulated by cells in 30 min, but released only a small percentage (<20%) of that accumulated over 18 h. The results show that copper in the hepatocyte can be divided into at least two pools, one easily accessible and one non-removable even after prolonged incubation with either chelator. Most of the copper normally found in the cell appeared to be associated with the ancient pool.",,"McArdle, H. J.;Gross, S. M.;Creaser, I.;Sargeson, A. M.;Danks, D. M.",1989,,,0,0,

2768,Wilson's disease: symptomatic treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Some comments,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in Wilson's disease may require symptomatic relief beyond often prolonged anti-copper therapy. The concomitance of brain and liver damage makes it necessary to carefully choose drugs, their dosage and the identification of these symptoms due to accumulation of copper in the brain and those of hepatic encephalopathy. Short half-life benzodiazepines, ""nonclassical"" neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and phenobarbital may be valuable therapeutic tools in the symptomatic treatment of Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is a rare condition characterized by degenerative changes in the brain, with softening of the basal ganglia and cirrhosis of the liver. Biliary excretion of copper is defective, and the metal accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues. Patients usually present in the second or third decade of life with hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric compromise. Administration of agents that remove copper from the body, penicillamine, or prevent its absorption, zinc, or possibly both, such as trientine, at least ameliorate or reverse the manifestations of more established Wilson's disease, even after of months or years, and prevent its appearance in asymptomatic affected siblings. Anti-copper therapy for Wilson's disease has been extensively reviewed (Walshe, 1986; Brewer et al., 1987; Hogenraad et al., 1987; Marsden, 1987; Walshe, 1988). However, in addition to specific anti-copper therapy, in severe cases, particularly in those patients whose clinical picture worsens on initiation of penicillamine treatment (Brewer et al., 1987), symptomatic treatment can be used and the selection of the appropriate treatment can be difficult in the presence of concomitant brain damage with liver compromise. In this work we will discuss the convenience of symptomatic treatment and, in some cases, we will indicate the drug of choice.",,"Priori, A.;Formica, A.;Berardelli, A.",1989,,,0,0,

The activity of PSH in cystinuria and hepatolenticular degeneration is largely explained by these transformations. The action of PSH on PSS may also be due to the formation of thiazolidine, a recognized biochemical reaction of PSH. However, the pharmacodynamics of PSH in suppressing inflammatory activity in RA and possibly PSS remains poorly understood. Future studies are needed in systems that adequately model PSH-sensitive inflammatory disease and that are exposed to therapeutically relevant concentrations of PSh and its metabolites. A better understanding of PSH pharmacodynamics should lead to safer and more effective use of the drug and indicate a direction for the development of new antirheumatic drugs.",,"Joyce, D.

In the first patient, the diagnosis was confirmed histologically only after three weeks, thus the start of penicillamine treatment was delayed. With this drug, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, and total bilirubin levels returned to normal, but returned to abnormal after about seven weeks. Despite replacement of coagulation factors, thromboplastin time remained reduced. He died 82 days after the onset of symptoms. In the second patient, treatment with penicillamine was started immediately, without waiting for histological confirmation. All laboratory values normalized and remained normal. From these observations it is concluded that liver transplantation is indicated if the abnormal values of cholinesterase, thromboplastin time and bilirubin do not remain normal after six weeks and if the initial suppression of alkaline phosphatase continues or recurs.",,"Zilker Th, R.;Felgenhauer, N.;Hibler, A.;von Clarmann, M.",1989,,,0,0,

We compared a standard immunofluorescence method with a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for StrAb detection. Retrospective testing of 264 stored sera by the two methods gave well-correlated results (58 sera were positive by both assays; r = 0.8). For 104 patients with spontaneously acquired MG or thymoma, the results were 100% concordant, of which 53% were positive. For 34 D-penicillamine receptors, StrAb were found in 15% by EIA and 6% by immunofluorescence. StrAb were detected in two of four bone marrow recipients by EIA and in one by immunofluorescence. Prospective testing of 434 fresh sera (of which 49 were positive by both methods) yielded discordant results in only 4. Serial EIA quantification of StrAb in two patients with MG and thymoma proved useful for monitoring immunosuppressive therapy and in a third patient predicted tumor recurrence Both assays detected a high prevalence of StrAb in elderly patients with spontaneous MG, but StrAb were more easily quantified by EIA.

Excessive levels of zinc can be released during intense neuronal activation and contribute to the paroxysm and toxic damage observed. Zinc ions are contained in high concentrations in the mossy fibers of the hippocampal formation, and it is the postsynaptic neurons of these fibers that are most susceptible to the toxic effects of kainic acid, a potent convulsant, or to chronic exposure to organometallic compounds.

There was a significant correlation between the copper and sulfur contents in the lysosomes of all the patients studied, but there was no correlation in the rest of the cytoplasm. Zinc was not detected in lysosomes. Regardless of the copper content in the lysosomes, the ratio of DELTAcopper to phosphorus (w/w) to DELTAsulfur to phosphorus was 0.60.

2820,Kinetics of copper absorption in states of zinc overload and after zinc supplement withdrawal: the role of endogenous zinc status,"Zinc (Zn), in therapeutic doses, has been used to inhibit copper (Cu) absorption in patients with Wilson's disease. A series of experiments were performed to corroborate the effects of high doses of Zn on Cu uptake using the experimental animal model. In the first experiment, five groups of mice were fed five different levels of Zn: 6 ppm (basal diet), 30 ppm (control), 750 ppm, 1,000 ppm, and 2,400 ppm, over a period of 35 days. A <sup>64</sup>Cu loading test was performed to measure the whole body retention (WBR) of <sup>64</sup>Cu on days 10, 14, 21 and 35. The results showed that inhibition of <sup>64</sup>Cu absorption by Zn is dose and time dependent. However, maximal inhibition occurred in mice fed 1000 ppm Zn, and no additional effect was seen in mice fed 2400 ppm Zn. In the second experiment, the distribution between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the gutless carcass of the retained dose of <sup>64</sup>Cu was measured in the controls and in the group fed 750 ppm Zn. . Although the WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in mice fed 750 ppm Zn, the retained dose distribution was not affected. In the third experiment, one group of mice received 30 ppm Zn for a period of 70 days (control), and a second group received 1000 ppm Zn for the first 35 days (replenishment), after which they were switched to the basal diet (6 ppm) for the next 35 days (exhaustion). WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu was performed at intervals throughout the experimental period. Endogenous fecal Zn (MFZn) was determined at the end of replacement (0 t) and at intervals during depletion. The results of this experiment indicated that the effect of Zn on the absorption of <sup>64</sup>Cu continued up to 21-35 days, after the suspension of the Zn supplement. In addition, WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu correlated significantly (r = -0.92, p < 0.005) with MFZn. We conclude that (a) high doses of Zn may not cause complete inhibition of Cu uptake, and (b) endogenous Zn secreted in the GIT (as MFZn) plays an important role in inhibiting Cu uptake and Therefore, maintenance of a high endogenous Zn state is essential for maximal inhibition of Cu uptake.",,"Cossack, Z.

The great diagnostic importance of copper metabolism (plasma copper level, urine copper), plasma ceruloplasmin concentration, histochemical and quantitative determination of copper in liver cells (after liver biopsy) is highlighted. They are especially important in young patients (under 25 years of age) and in children with chronic parenchymal liver disease. In 1/4 of the patients, the early stage of the disease resembled chronic active hepatitis (predominantly hepatic type of disease). The basic therapeutic drug is D-penicillamine hydrochloride and when it is not tolerated, the drug Trien can be used. Very good therapeutic results have been achieved and a considerable improvement in prognosis, social and occupational rehabilitation of patients.

We have been using oral zinc as another approach to therapy for Wilson's disease, with copper balance studies being the key initial assessment of the adequacy of a given dose or regimen of zinc therapy.

We have now shown with balance studies that a simplified zinc therapy regimen of 50 mg zinc taken 3 times daily is effective in controlling copper balance. Preliminary work presented here with other simplified regimens also indicates their effectiveness.

2832,Clinical-biochemical diagnosis of Wilson's disease and its treatment. [Slovak],"The review work presented deals with the current knowledge in pathophysiology, clinical-biochemical diagnosis (CB) and therapy of Wilson's disease (Wd). CB screening is performed by determining ceruloplasmin and total copper in serum, copper in urine under basic conditions and after administration of penicillamine. The second phase screening, in case of diagnostic uncertainty (as well as postmortem), is carried out by means of the quantitative determination of copper in liver bioptic samples, or by means of the <sup>64</sup>Cu load test. This fatal congenital disease has been effectively treated for more than 30 years with penicillamine and, in case of intolerance, with triethylenetetramine hydrochloride. The newer zinc therapy has a different mechanism of action: it removes excess copper from the body through the faeces, while the older treatments are done through the urine. For monitoring Wd therapy, the authors recommend dose adjustment based on urinary copper excretion or <sup>64</sup>Cu loading test. Therapy is monitored once a year, unless the patient's clinical condition requires a shorter interval, by determining urinary copper excretion on 2-3 consecutive days and checking tubular functions. Complete blood count, ALT and urinalysis should be examined along with clinical control at least 4 times a year. In case of zinc treatment, serum zinc should be monitored. In conclusion, the authors suggest groups indicated for CB screening of Wd, which is not as rare as used to be considered (today 1:35,000 or 1:50,000): 1) Patients with suspected hepatological or neurological symptoms aged 5 to 60 years . 2) First-degree relatives of the patient with Wd 3) Children with chronic liver symptoms or acute symptoms of prolonged or fulminant annual course. In children, even a slit lamp should be used to search for the Kayser-Fleischer ring.

2835,Liver cirrhosis: is pharmacotherapy of the underlying disease possible?. [German],"Liver cirrhosis has many causes and the answer to the question ""is drug treatment of cirrhosis useful?"" it depends on the underlying cause and not on histology. The answer is definitely ""yes"" in hereditary disorders such as Wilson's disease or hemochromatosis where specific treatment is highly successful. In primary biliary cirrhosis, pharmacological treatment with corticosteroids is only justified in cases with characteristics of chronic active autoimmune hepatitis (CAH). The results with penicillamine seem disappointing. Azathioprine may be helpful in some cases. Colchicine and cyclosporine are in the testing phase and the results are not yet available. HB(s)AG negative autoimmune CAH cirrhosis should be treated with corticosteroids or a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine for months or even years. Steroids are no longer recommended for HB(s)AG-positive patients with CAH-cirrhosis because the results of controlled trials suggest that they may even be harmful: they increase virus replication and may increase the tendency for cancer to form. The results of treatment with antiviral drugs alone or in combination with interferon are still poor and further evaluation is needed before recommendations can be made. In alcoholic liver disease, pharmacological treatment is rarely successful. Glucocorticosteroids have been tested and may be indicated in rare and exceptional cases with encephalopathy. Propylthiouracil and colchicine are currently used in controlled trials; Conclusive evidence is still lacking as to whether androgenic hormones are useful in the treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis.",,"Martini, G.

Lethargy and anorexia (70%), jaundice (50%) and abdominal pain (48%) were the most common symptoms, and the least common were intellectual impairment (22%) and recurrent epistaxis (22%). The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from five days to three years (mean 10.5 months), and only five of the patients were diagnosed before remission. Analysis of physical signs at presentation showed that hepatomegaly (81%) and splenomegaly (70%) were common, and the only signs that were significantly more common in the 13 fatal cases were jaundice and ascites. In three of them and in one other patient who survived, the clinical course was exceptionally severe and indistinguishable from fulminant hepatic failure. Based on the severity of the abnormality in serum aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and prothrombin time at admission, a prognostic index was derived that allowed complete separation of fatal and nonfatal cases and, when used subsequently in other nine index cases, correctly predicted the outcome. Two other cases that had rates in the fatal category did well after liver transplantation, which should be considered as soon as the diagnosis is made in cases with such severe liver damage.",,"Nazer, H.;Ede, R.

The data show a progressive decrease in serum concentrations of copper and zinc in general. Urinary copper excretion gradually stabilized to approximately 50% of baseline, but zinc excretion increased. Therefore, urinary zinc:copper ratios increased with duration of treatment. Copper clearance was considered adequate as long as challenge with a test dose of D-penicillamine did not result in increased copper excretion. Urinary zinc excretion increased further at the test dose. Zinc depletion was clinically suspected in a patient on maintenance treatment with D-penicillamine. Dose reduction relieved symptoms, urinary zinc loss decreased from 64 to 34 Âµmol/24 hours, and copper excretion remained virtually unchanged. The data obtained indicate that D-penicillamine alters the metabolism of both copper and zinc. The extent of this is not only dose dependent but also related to the efficiency of copper removal. Both copper and zinc concentrations should be monitored to assess the benefits of treatment and the risks of inducing overt or subclinical zinc deficiency.",,"Van Caillie-Bertrand, M.;Degenhart, J.

The course, judged by clinical, biochemical and histological parameters, was satisfactory in both. Urinary copper concentration reverted to less than 1.26 mmol/24 hours; and serum copper concentration further decreased during treatment with zinc sulfate. In one child, the increase in 24-hour urinary copper excretion observed after a challenge dose of D-penicillamine (+/- 20 mg/kg) was constant throughout the observation period, while liver content of copper decreased from 1460 ug/g dry weight to 890 mug/g dry weight. In the other patient, however, liver copper content, as well as 24-hour urinary copper excretion, increased after D-penicillamine challenge during the third year of treatment. We conclude that zinc sulfate is a low-toxic and well-tolerated alternative to D-penicillamine. The dosage depends, however, on individual factors that are not yet well understood, and we recommend restricting its use to patients who do not tolerate D-penicillamine well. We suggest monitoring treatment with annual D-penicillamine challenge and liver biopsy if liver function deteriorates.",,"Van Caillie-Bertrand, M.;Degenhart, H. J.;Visser, H. K. A.",1985,,,0,1,

2865,Trace Element Interactions: Clinical Significance,"We examined the interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. In sickle cell anemia, the usual situation is mild to moderate zinc deficiency due to renal zinc loss. Zinc deficiency appears to cause mild copper overload and an increased ceruloplasmin level, probably by increasing copper absorption. With zinc therapy, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc, when administered in a manner that ensures efficacy (without food), usually lead to copper deficiency. We have taken advantage of the copper-depleting effect of zinc to design a new therapy for Wilson's disease. Zinc, by inducing intestinal metallothionein, inhibits dietary copper absorption and inhibits reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, leading to negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are confident that zinc blocks copper accumulation in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, zinc therapy will become available as an approach to treat this deadly disease. Animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity when both elements are administered orally, presumably through the intestinal metallothionein mechanism. In preliminary experiments in rats we have not been able to show that the toxicity of lead entering the body non-orally is affected by oral zinc supplementation.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G.;Dick, R.

Biochemical disorders resulting from genetic defects cause aberrant metabolism of the element and thus symptoms of disease. Diseases caused by abnormal metabolism of copper, zinc, iron, and molybdenum are discussed. Trace metal abnormalities can also be the result of other genetic diseases. This aspect of genetic trace metal alterations is the least investigated. However, the information should be important to improve the existing treatment protocol for the most common inborn errors of metabolism, such as phenylketonuria.",,"Wai-Yee, Chan;Rennert, O.

2869,Effects of high-dose trihexyphenidyl on symptomatic dystonia in a case of Wilson's disease. [Japanese],"We present a 16-year-old boy with Wilson's disease who suddenly relapsed with generalized dystonia, which improved with high-dose trihexyphenidyl. Wilson's disease was diagnosed when he developed a hemolytic crisis at age 6. At the age of 14, gait disturbance, dysgraphia and dysarthria appeared. These were ameliorated by an increase in the dose of D-penicillamine alone. He was doing well until he deteriorated acutely shortly after suffering from an acute respiratory infection. On admission, he was unable to walk, speak or swallow, and had violent involuntary movements and right hemiplegia. Liver functions, however, were normal. Dystonia and anarthria persisted, although involuntary movements and hemiplegia gradually improved. Surface EMG showed the characteristic dystonic pattern. A few weeks after starting treatment with trihexyphenidyl 10 mg daily, he was able to stand, walk, and write. When the medication was discontinued to test its effects, she evidently worsened and could barely walk or write. Psychiatric symptoms including irritability and emotional instability were noted as adverse effects, but were not severe enough to stop the drug. Seven months after starting treatment, dystonia tended to fluctuate, increasing in the morning and decreasing at night, with no corresponding diurnal changes in CSF homovanillic acid or dopamine levels. Fahn (1979) reported that treatment of dystonia of various types with high-dose trihexyphenidyl was especially effective in childhood. In the present case, we also found a beneficial effect with trihexyphenidyl at a dose of 10-12 mg daily without serious adverse effects.",,"Hirabayashi, S.;Kanda, H.;Tsuno, T.",1985,,,0,0,

TETA was scheduled for toxicological evaluation due to a deficiency of such information. Analytical chemical procedures to determine drug purity, as well as adequate drug concentration and stability in the dosed water, were prerequisites for toxicological testing. A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure employing ion pairing and conductivity detection has been developed for the analysis of TETA in dosed water at levels as low as 10 ug/mL and for the determination of drug purity. The response of the conductivity detector was linear in the concentration range of 10 to 100 ug/mL. Data on the stability of the drug in water during storage at room temperature and after autoclaving are presented. An auxiliary colorimetric procedure for the analysis of aqueous solutions of TETA is also presented, which is based on the measurement of the absorbance of the colored TETA copper chelate at 599 nm. The HPLC method is applicable to the analysis of TETA and the chemically similar polyamines spermidine and spermine in admixture.",,"Hansen Jr, E. B.;Rushing, L. G.;Thompson Jr, H. C.",1985,,,0,0,

After discontinuation of D-penicillamine, an increase in serum copper almost to the normal range was observed; concomitantly decreased urinary excretion of copper. Under oral zinc sulfate therapy (145 mg/day) a drop in serum copper level was achieved and liver function improved; serum albumin, gamma globulins and prothrombin time reached normal values. The patient did not complain of any side effects during oral zinc sulfate therapy.

2881,Long-term treatment in chronic hepatitis. [German],"Before deciding on long-term treatment, each case of chronic hepatitis requires histological classification and knowledge of the etiology. Drug- and alcohol-induced chronic active hepatitis is treated by elimination of the causative agent alone. No additional measures are necessary. Only symptomatic patients with chronic hepatobiliary disorders, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, should be treated. The standard regimen consists of cholestyramine, fat-soluble vitamins, and medium-chain triglycerides. Penicillamine treatment should be restricted to advanced stages. Whether liver transplantation plays a role in the treatment of PBC remains to be determined. Some types of chronic active hepatitis caused by metabolic or autoimmune disorders can be treated with a standardized therapy regimen. Hemochromatosis should be treated by regular phlebotomy. Wilson's disease requires lifelong penicillamine therapy, and autoimmune hepatitis responds well to steroids or a combination of steroids and azathioprine. The optimal treatment for Hb(s)Ag-positive patients with non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis is still being investigated. Immunosuppression is not recommended.

Thiazolidine formation with maturing collagen makes D-penicillamine potentially teratogenic; sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange allows the formation of a mixed disulfide with L-cysteine from the L-cystine dimer; chelation allows you to bind metals such as copper; and the removal of superoxide makes it theoretically capable of influencing the inflammatory response of specific cellular systems.

Reinstitution of penicillamine therapy 2 weeks before the fulminant decompensation failed to prevent it. Renal failure in this patient was apparently secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The addition of penicillamine to a peritoneal dialysis solution allowed chelatin and removal of more than 14 mg per day of copper, but with no apparent benefit. Exchange transfusion and high-dose dexamethasone therapy (24 mg/day) were similarly ineffective in reversing liver failure. Other reported cases have also been fatal.

2889,Diagnostic value and significance of radiocopper loading test abnormalities in Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease in this patient was suspected due to the association of histological characteristics of chronic active hepatitis and increased hepatic copper concentration. However, the patient had longstanding cholestasis, no Kayser-Fleischer ring, no neurological symptoms, and had a serum ceruloplasmin concentration within the normal range. The time course of plasma <sup>64</sup>Cu levels in this patient was compared with those found in four other subjects: one normal subject, two patients with typical Wilson's disease, and one patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. Similar time courses were observed for both the patient with suspected Wilson's disease and the two typical cases, thereby unequivocally establishing the diagnosis. This pattern differed from that of the normal subject by the absence of a secondary increase in plasma concentration of <sup>64</sup>Cu. In the patient with primary biliary cirrhosis, the time course was intermediate between that of the normal subject and that of patients with Wilson's disease. These results suggest that: 1) a radiocopper loading test is useful in diagnosing difficult cases of Wilson's disease, especially when the ceruloplasmin level is normal; 2) the absence of a secondary increase in plasma levels of <sup>64</sup>Cu in Wilson's disease is largely independent of the decrease in serum ceruloplasmin; it appears to be more related to isotope dilution in an expanded hepatic copper pool and abnormalities in intrahepatic copper distribution.",,"Mavier, P.;Meignan, M.;Wirquin, E.",1982,,,0,0,

2903,Hudson Memorial Lecture: Wilson's Disease: Genetics and Biochemistry: Its Relevance to Therapy,"Wilson's disease is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects children, adolescents, and young adults. Before puberty, the initial signs and symptoms are almost always related to liver damage, with or without hemolysis. After puberty, the neurological signs become increasingly prominent, always involving the motor centers, sometimes the personality, never the sensory nervous system. The most characteristic physical sign is Kayser Fleischer's ring of corneal pigment resulting from copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. The primary genetic defect is unknown, but the disease appears to be the result of failure of hepatocytes to excrete copper through the bile. Consequently, this metal accumulates first in the liver and then, when this organ is saturated, in the brain, corneas and, to a lesser extent, the kidneys. Once present in excess in tissues, copper poisons various enzyme systems leading to cell damage and death. There is currently no satisfactory explanation for the pleomorphic nature of the disease, much less for the often severe asymmetry of the lesions in the brain. Treatment involves establishing a negative copper balance until abnormal body stores of the metal have been eliminated. Thereafter, the patient must remain in balance for life. There are two main drugs available for this purpose, penicillamine and triethylenetetramine (Trientine). Both will achieve biochemical and clinical reversal of the disease. Penylamine can give rise to a wide range of toxic reactions, mainly of an immunological nature; therefore, regular monitoring of blood counts and renal function is essential. Currently, less is known about Trientine's potential to induce unwanted side effects. Wilson's disease is characterized by recessive inheritance. It can be diagnosed in the presymptomatic stage by finding abnormalities in copper metabolism. All families must be screened and, where appropriate, initiate prophylactic treatment, thus aborting the clinical course of the disease.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1983,,,0,0,
2904,Metallothionein - aspects related to the metabolism of copper and zinc,"Metallothionein is a low molecular weight protein rich in cysteine that binds zinc, copper and cadmium. It is inducible in the liver, kidney, and intestine by glucocorticoids, changes in dietary zinc supply, acute administration of various metals, food restriction, infection, stress, and endotoxin treatment. The regulation of synthesis involves altered gene expression. The protein degrades fairly rapidly when zinc is the primary metal species bound, but the rate of degradation slows when cadmium or copper are also bound. The net result of metallothionein production appears to be accumulation of bound metal and/or intracellular redistribution of metal. Copper accumulation in various tissues of individuals with Menkes and Wilson disease may be related to impaired metallothionein turnover. The physiological role is unclear, but the response of metallothionein to hormonal stimuli suggests an important role in cellular metabolism.",,"Cousins, R. J.",1983,,,0,0,

In addition, in 8 cases a very high increase in liver copper concentration was demonstrated. D-penicillamine therapy produced hepatic improvement in 8 cases, 6 of which affected only the liver, and the treatment was well tolerated.

In 2 patients persistent partial unilateral ptosis remained after 15 and 25 months, while in another patient there was diplopia 42 months after resolution of the other myasthenic symptoms. PIM patients compared to a healthy ""control"" population had a significant increase in HLD Dr1 (p corr < 0.005) and an absence of HLA Dr3.

Normal ionized calcium levels were not maintained during a 24-hour follow-up period. The patient had tetany during a period of rapid decline in ionized calcium levels, and an appropriate rise in circulating levels of immunoreactive parathyroids was never demonstrated. Hypocalcaemia induced during citrate infusion did not stimulate parathyroid secretion, nor did magnesium infusion. We conclude that parathyroid insufficiency may be associated with Wilson's disease.

How, for example, do we classify the type of cirrhosis found in an individual who drinks 80 g of alcohol per day, is positive for hepatitis BsAg, and is found to be an MZ heterozygous for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency? Many cases of cirrhosis may have multifactorial origins; alcohol and the hepatitis B virus may act synergistically in this regard. Some types of cirrhosis, for example those caused by the hepatitis B virus, are now potentially preventable, while others may be partially reversible. In hereditary diseases such as Wilson's disease and hemachromatosis, for which there is a specific treatment, it is essential to screen other family members. In established cirrhosis associated with disorders such as non-A, non-B hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Indian childhood cirrhosis, the antifibrogenic drugs penicillamine and colchicine show promise, although it is questionable whether either drug should at present , used outside the limits of a controlled trial. Finally, in some forms of end-stage cirrhosis, liver transplantation should be considered.",,"Warnes, T. W.",1982,,,0,0,
2918,Patterns of hepatocyte injury in man,"Three patterns of hepatocyte damage in man are described, direct, immunological, and cholestatic. Features of the direct pattern are predominantly mitochondrial damage, central necrosis (zone 3), and usually fatty change. It can be subdivided into alcoholic type (also seen with obesity, diabetes, perhexiline reaction, Wilson's disease, and Indian childhood cirrhosis) and Reye's syndrome type (also seen with tetracycline toxicity, fatty liver of pregnancy, and cytotoxic drugs). Reactive drug metabolites, metal poisoning, and anoxia are also associated with the direct pattern of hepatocyte injury. The immunological pattern is characterized by damage to cell membranes with fragmentary necrosis of periportal hepatocytes (zone 1) and infiltration of mononuclear cells. Examples include chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions such as those to halothane. In the cholestatic pattern, there is an alteration of the bile secretory mechanism with retention of bile within the hepatocytes. Cholestatic liver injury can be intrahepatic, as in sex hormone cholestasis, or extrahepatic, as in choledocholithiasis or bile duct carcinoma. Identification of the type of hepatocyte injury is valuable in diagnosis, evaluation of prognosis, and selection of treatment.",,"Sherlock, S.",1982,,,0,0,

We evaluate D-penicillamine in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. In a prospective double-blind trial, 26 patients received D-penicillamine (250 mg four times a day) and 26 received an identical placebo. Although the desired urinary copper excretion was achieved in patients taking D-penicillamine, there was no improvement in survival or symptoms after 28 months. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased equally in both groups. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were lower in the D-penicillamine group, but serum albumin was also lower in this group. Liver histology worsened equally in both groups. Major side effects, some appearing more than 24 months after the start of treatment, occurred in 31 percent of patients receiving D-penicillamine. Less serious side effects occurred in an additional 46 percent. We conclude that D-penicillamine at the dose we use is not effective in treating primary biliary cirrhosis and is associated with a high incidence of serious side effects.",,"Matloff, D.

2927,Role of catecholamines in the biochemical mechanisms of the pathogenesis of hepatocerebral dystrophy. [Russian],"In 48 patients with hepatocerebral dystrophy, the main parameters of catecholamine metabolism were examined. Pronounced changes characterized mainly by a considerable decrease in the excretion of dopamine and norepinephrine and an increase in the excretion of their immediate precursor, ie DOPA, were observed. On the basis of the data obtained it was assumed that the synthesis of these neurotransmitter catecholamines was depressed. In the course of treatment with d-penicillamine, which is capable of mobilizing copper and stimulating its excretion from the body, a statistically significant increase in dopamine excretion (compared to its initial level) was observed, and in patients with hyperkinetic arrhythmo more severe rigid form of the disease increased excretion not only of dopamine, but also of norepinephrine. Alterations in catecholamine metabolism in hepatocerebral dystrophy are thought to have a complicated mechanism and are associated with both severe liver pathology and abnormalities in copper metabolism. In this regard, additional methods of treating that disease are offered. These methods influence the metabolism of catecholamines and act mainly on extrapyramidal motor and also psychic disorders. The studies carried out by the author contribute to the existing concepts on the biochemical mechanisms of the pathogenesis of hepatocerebral dystrophy, and expand the possibilities of treatment of the serious hereditary disease.",,"Barkhatova, V.

As in Wilson's disease, penicillamine has recently been introduced for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease, biliary excretion of copper is decreased. The present study shows that, compared with controls, biliary excretion of copper is not decreased in primary biliary cirrhosis; instead, it may increase in some patients. However, when compared to high hepatic copper concentration, biliary copper excretion was low. In contrast to copper, biliary secretion of bile acids decreased in eight of the 17 patients. Treatment with oral penicillamine (600 mg/day) for one year resulted in a significant decrease in hepatic copper concentration, but had no consistent effect on biliary copper excretion or on the amount of copper-positive copper-binding protein. histologically stainable orcein. The results suggest that excessive hepatic copper accumulation in primary biliary cirrhosis may not be caused primarily by decreased biliary excretion, or that a new balance is achieved in advanced primary biliary cirrhosis.

A brief review of the pertinent literature revealed that the dermatologic lesions of penicillamine-induced pemphigus are relieved by discontinuation of penicillamine and initiation of prednisone therapy. Our patient's mainly oral lesions did not resolve with this recommended alteration in therapy, as penicillamine could only be briefly discontinued in order to maintain acceptable serum copper levels and due to the scarcity of available alternative copper chelating agents. Finally, the patient received tetraethylene tetramine (TETA), an experimental copper chelating agent, and betamethasone (Celestone). This has provided a satisfactory reduction in serum copper levels and resolution of oral lesions.",,"Eisenberg, E.;Ballow, M.;Wolfe, S.

Hepatic copper concentrations correlated with urinary copper excretion in cholestasis and treated Wilson's disease, but not in hepatitis or cirrhosis. In treated Wilson's disease, measurement of urinary copper excretion should be valuable in estimating the extent of copper removal from the body during therapy.

In the hemorrhagic lesions the elastic fibers were diminished. In SPE lesions, elastic fibers were markedly increased in the papillary and reticular dermis. These looked like bramble bushes with patches of elastic fiber as Lund describes. Ultrastructurally, the bramble bush fibers consisted of a nearly normal core and an abnormal shell that is moderately electron dense and lacks the alternating dense and light shell pattern of normal dermal elastic fibers. The ""spines"" formed as regular swellings of this coating material at regular intervals and at right angles to the longitudinal axis of these fibers. In some fibers, the coating material did not surround the entire circumference of the core, suggesting that it was added on top of the normal elastic fiber after the disease process began. The elastic fibers in the perforation channel through the epidermis were either intact briar fibers or degenerated. Collagen fibers in both hemorrhagic and EPS lesions stained poorly with routine electron microscopic stains. The most striking abnormality was an extreme variation in the thickness of individual fibers ranging from 0.01 mm to 0.05 mm. Band patterns and periodicity were normal. Subendothelial separation of vascular endothelial cells in small vessels and actual degeneration of subendothelial elastic fibers (internal elastic membrane) in larger vessels appear to be the basic defect in hemorrhagic lesions. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa appears to be a phenomenon caused by a variety of abnormal elastic fibers. Clearly, those in our case are completely different from the idiopathic ones.

Liver cells are first affected and then other organ systems are involved. In this way the typical syndromes arise. Despite the abundant literature in recent years, early diagnosis is often not performed. This loses valuable therapy time, which is particularly detrimental for Wilson's disease. This therapy consists of removal of copper by long-term treatment with penicillamine D, reduction of copper supply through the intestine, and prescription of the antiabsorptive agent potassium sulfide in Wilson's disease as in idiopathic hemochromatosis. In it, treatment with the previous deferozamine complex is often omitted. The earlier treatment is started, the better the clinical results.

It has been widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since 1965 and progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). Numerous side effects can develop in patients receiving penicillamine, including autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, Goodpasture's syndrome, and polymyositis. Several patients who unequivocally developed myasthenia gravis (MG) have recently been reported.

2972,Treatment of Wilson's disease. A report on 30 cases. [French],"The therapy is based on the use of penicillamine, which must be administered very progressively in the initial stages. The usual dose is 1.5 to 2 g/day initially, followed by a maintenance dose of 1 to 1.5 g/day, which should be continued indefinitely. Neurological symptoms evolved favorably in 21 of 24 patients. Of 18 cases with advanced liver disease, 2 died from increased liver damage after 5 and 15 years of treatment, and 3 of the 8 patients with initial severe cirrhosis died less than a year after starting treatment with the chelator. The Kayser-Fleischer ring had disappeared in 11 of the patients after an average period of 5 years. Hematologic and rheumatologic manifestations were not influenced by treatment. Three pregnancies had successful outcomes. Iatrogenic effects of treatment, at an early stage, were: worsening of neurological signs (4 cases) or thrombocytopenia (3 cases), severe allergic reactions (2 cases) and one case of epileptic seizures. It seems essential to prevent these accidents. Subsequently, 5 nephropathies were observed, one case of pemphigus and 2 cases of lupus erythematosus. Although the complications of penicillamine therapy represent a very important practical problem, the seriousness of the spontaneous progression of Wilson's disease justifies assuming this therapeutic risk. The prognosis depends on the extent of the neurological and especially hepatic lesions. Therefore, early diagnosis is of paramount importance.",,"Pepin, B.;Goldstein, B.;Lidy, C.",1980,,,0,0,

Penicillamine was found to clearly reduce the cytotoxic action of serum obtained from patients affected by hepatolenticular degeneration. The effect was less evident when sera from patients suffering from hepatic coma and sera containing exogenous copper salts were used. There was no reduction in the cytotoxic effect of ammonia. The above observations led to the assumption that the protective effect of penicillamine is manifested only in cases where copper is the only or concomitant pathogenic factor. The partial mitigating effect of penicillamine observed in cultures with serum containing exogenous copper and in cultures with serum from patients affected by hepatic coma is attributed in the first case to an excess of copper salts relative to penicillamine, and in the second to a common action of copper and ammonia, pathogenic factors of equal rank.",,"Mossakowski, M.

The positive correlation of the serum zinc level with the amount of alpha<inf>1</inf> globulins, as well as the increase of the latter in Pick's disease, suggest a pathophysiology that could be closer to hemochromatosis than to hemochromatosis. hepatolenticular degeneration.

We report a patient (51-year-old man) in whom the clinical picture of this syndrome developed during treatment with this drug. Peritoneal dialysis was necessary and a renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed several glomeruli that were fully sclerosed and 6 that had focal proliferative changes with prominent epithelial crescent formation. Immunofluorescence did not show deposits of IgG or complement components. A thin section (one micron) did not indicate the presence of immune complex deposits and therefore electron microscopy was not performed. Clinical features very similar to those of this patient have recently been described in patients with Wilson's disease who were treated with penicillamine D. In these cases, the features were attributed to Goodpasture syndrome and penicillamine D was implicated as the causative agent. . However, linear deposition of immunoglobulin in the glomerular basement membrane was not demonstrated in any of these cases. This is a characteristic feature of Goodpasture syndrome, and its absence should preclude the use of this diagnostic term. For this reason, it would be better to describe the disease as ""pulmonary purpura and nephritis."" However, circumstantial evidence implicates penicillamine D in the clinical syndrome described and it is considered that this case report lends credence to the association reported by previous authors.",,"Gibson, T.;Burry, H.

In patients with Huntington's chorea, SGOT activity was lower than in controls (P = 0.02), in Friedreich's ataxia, LGPT activity decreased (P < 0.001); in patients suffering from ALS SGOT (P = 0.005), SGPT (P < 0.001) and LGOT (P < 0.001) increased activities. Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease with Ldopa resulted in an increase in SGOT, LGOT, and SGPT activity for approximately 2 months, with subsequent normalization of these enzyme activities despite continued therapy. . Guanidine treatment led to increased aminotransferase activities in ALS patients. Penicillamine caused a decrease in SGOT and SGPT activities in Wilson's disease.

3100,Stomatitis caused by penicillamine D. [French],"The authors recall the chemical structure of penicillamine D, its pharmacological properties and its main indications: Wilson's disease and rheumatoid polyarthritis. Treatment with D-penicillamine can cause digestive, neurological, hematological, renal and mucous-cutaneous accidents, the study of which is very interesting. Apart from early-onset pruritic erythema-type accidents that appear to be allergic in nature, these accidents occur late after taking large doses and their mechanism is different: lupus erythematosus syndrome, erosive and lichenoid stomatitis, hemorrhagic shedding of the skin in pressure points with the formation of epidermal microcysts apparently related to the lathyrogenic effect of the product, blistering eruptions identified clinically, histopathologically and immunologically with pemphigus. The authors describe the case of a 49-year-old woman who had been treated for 17 months with penicillamine D for rheumatoid arthritis. A pruritic erythema of the face and extremities that appeared in the 5th week gradually showed a diminishing response to antihistamines. At 14 months, a painful, erosive, and keratotic stomatitis developed that was maintained at the rate of treatment and quickly resolved when D-penicillamine was discontinued. Clinically it appeared similar to erosive lichen planus, but histopathologically it appeared very different and there was a hint of acantholysis in the epithelium. It could therefore be an atypical pemphigus and penicillamine seems to be the first known drug capable of inducing this disease.",,"Kuffer, R.;Noble, J. P.",1973,,,0,0,

Such a change appears to belong to the primary picture of Wilson's disease, since it is known to occur in the asymptomatic form. However, a drug effect could not be completely excluded, as both patients were treated with penicillamine D.

3103,"Penicillamine, its metabolism and therapeutic applications: a review","Penicillamine has been shown to be an excellent therapeutic agent for the treatment of Wilson's disease and cystinuria. However, its use in other disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis remains controversial. This controversy has arisen largely due to the increased incidence of drug-induced side effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For the most part, the etiology of these side effects is unknown, and therefore it remains imperative that patients receiving penicillamine be carefully monitored for adverse reactions. Measurements of penicillamine and its metabolic products may be a useful adjunct to currently used laboratory parameters to assess patient response to this drug. The mechanism by which penicillamine exerts its beneficial effects in different disease states is not understood. What is clear, however, is that the thiol group of penicillamine plays a critical role in determining the actions of the drug. It follows that the action of penicillamine in situ will depend on such factors as the physical state of the drug, its disposition in the body, and the rate of its metabolism and excretion. Hopefully, when more is known about these parameters, it will be more feasible to speculate on the mechanisms by which penicillamine exerts both its beneficial and detrimental effects. Much more research will be required if this goal is to be achieved in the near future.",,"Crawhall, J. C.;Lecavalier, D.;Ryan, P.",1979,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bdd.2510010205,0,0,

Complementary psychiatric therapy is not applied. Physical findings are verified after 5 to 7 months of treatment. The evaluation is carried out under the criteria of psychopathometric and psychological clinical tests. In 4 of the 5 patients, the transition syndrome has functioned after 5 to 7 months. In the treatment section of HAWIE, a substantial increase in values compared to the first tests (between 14 and 27 IQ points) corresponds to the previous results. Only in the case of one patient did the clinical picture improve with a delay of 7 months.

3107,Treatment of inflammatory and metal storage diseases of the liver.,"No specific drug therapy is indicated for chronic persistent hepatitis since the prognosis in this condition is uniformly favorable. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents have been used in chronic active hepatitis for 20 years, and corticosteroids have been shown to prolong life in most controlled studies. It is usual to start prednisone at 20 or 40 mg daily and decrease the dose as symptoms and biochemical abnormalities improve. Azathioprine alone is no more effective than placebo. However, it has a steroid-sparing effect and allows lower doses of corticosteroids. It is advisable to discontinue treatment gradually only when patients have been in biochemical and histological remission for at least 6 months. Further trials are needed for the use of transfer factor, interferon and levamisole immunostimulation. Treatment of symptomatic precirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis with azathioprine has not been beneficial. However, there was improvement in cases of pruritus. A preliminary report from the Mayo Clinic suggests that copper chelation therapy with D-penicillamine may be effective, with significant improvement in serum levels of gamma globulin, bilirubin, and IgM. Supportive treatment and correction of malabsorption, fluid retention, portal hypertension, and hepatic decompensation are of utmost importance. Pruritus can be relieved with cholestyramine or androgens. Fat-soluble vitamins are given on a monthly schedule of vitamin A, 100,000 IU, vitamin D, 100,000 IU, and vitamin K, 10 mg. No pharmacological agent has been shown to be unequivocally beneficial in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. The use of corticosteroids has been advocated and condemned on the basis of a number of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials. There is considerable evidence that iron is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hemochromatosis. Two controlled studies have shown venesection therapy to be effective with respect to survival, liver function, skin pigmentation, and diabetes mellitus. Phlebotomies twice a week, each 500 ml, are recommended and serum iron concentration should be kept below 150 ug/100 ml and serum ferritin level should be kept in the low normal range. Deforroxamine chelation therapy is not practical, but can be used when venesecton therapy is not feasible. The cornerstone of therapy for Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is copper removal. The most effective copper chelating agent is D-penicillamine. Numerous studies have shown that patients with this once-fatal disease can expect functional recovery from both liver and neurological abnormalities. The initial dose is 500 mg 3 times a day, increasing to 3 to 4 g daily until adequate cupryuresis is achieved. One-third of patients develop side effects including rash, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy. Complications of this therapy can be managed with temporary suspension followed by restart with steroid coverage. (Mattar - SÃ£o Paulo)",,"Powell, L. W.;Tolman, K. G.",1979,,,0,0,

The patient had been using oral zinc sulfate for approximately 1.5 years at the time. No changes in Kayser-Fleischer rings or ceruloplasmin levels were mentioned.

Sustained improvement was seen in 8 patients who remained well (median survival time, 7 years) with near-normal liver function tests and inactive liver histology. Patients with Wilson's disease presenting as chronic active hepatitis frequently exhibit atypical features: Kayser-Fleischer rings and neurologic dysfunction may be absent, and both serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper may be normal, especially if necrosis is present. severe hepatocellular As a result, the diagnosis of Wilson's disease may be delayed, and once cirrhosis is established, this form of Wilson's disease may have a poor prognosis despite D-penicillamine therapy. Therefore, it is essential that the diagnosis of Wilson's disease be excluded in all patients with chronic active hepatitis and chronic parenchymal liver disease of unknown aetiology so that an optimal response to D-penicillamine treatment can be achieved.",,"Scott, J.;Gollan, J.

[German],"Iron, copper, and zinc concentrations were measured in postmortem specimens of liver, muscle, and brain tissue by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Concentrations varied markedly in normal liver samples from person to person, but not in samples from other organs. Copper concentrations in samples from cirrhotic livers were normal in most cases, however, at the upper limit of normal in approximately 20% of the cases evaluated. Zinc and iron concentrations were lower than normal in cirrhotic livers. Mineral concentrations were higher by a factor of 10-20 in liver samples from patients with hemochromatosis or M. Wilson than in normals. Iron overload as a consequence of therapy (secondary hemochromatosis) and changes in the liver due to long-term artificially elevated plasma copper levels may mimic the adult form of the 'classical' mineral storage diseases mentioned.

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have sometimes been attributed to D-penicillamine treatment and its toxicity; however, we have found that cytopenia is a frequent finding in the laboratory data of patients with Wilson's disease. Twenty-eight patients (52%) had thrombocytopenia and 16 of these patients (30% of the total) also had leukopenia. Intermittent, acute, and severe hemolytic episodes were the initial and only complaint of one patient. Six of the patients with significant cytopenias underwent splenectomy, and in all cases peripheral blood counts returned to normal values.

Even the typical decrease in serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels may be absent. In 3 cases of Wilson's disease diagnosed at the Heidelberg University Pediatric Clinic, the possibilities of atypical manifestations are described with the intention, through earlier diagnosis and therapy, of helping not only the patient who already suffers symptomatically, but also of help your brothers and sisters presymptomatically.

[German],"Among the diseases with extrapyramidal disorder syndromes, hepatocerebral degeneration (synonyms are Morbus Wilson and Strumpell-Westphalic Pseudosclerosis) occupies a special place while here the cause of the problems lies in a recessively inherited metabolic disorder. It can be effectively influenced by consequent drug therapy and diet. The disorder is quite rare: it is estimated that only a total of 100 patients in the entire FG require such specific treatment. A basic feature of the anti-copper regimen is the change to a low-copper diet. If possible, copper intake should not exceed the level of 1 mg per day. For the past 15 years, D-penicillamine (metalcaptase) has been the preferred agent in the drug treatment of hepatocerebral degeneration. The substance mobilizes stored copper in the organs and prevents more from being stored, so that the copper is transformed into soluble chelate complexes that can then be discharged through the kidneys. The substance must be administered slowly; As a general rule, 0.9 to 1.8 g per day is needed. In experiments, an antagonism between D-Penicillamine and vitamin B-6 (Pyridoxine) was established. As a result, latent vitamin B-6 deficiencies were observed under D-penicillamine therapy. Consequently, an additional administration of 40 mg of vitamin B-6 per day is recommended, especially in those patients who already had signs of latent or manifest hypovitaminosis before starting treatment (21 references).",,"Fouquet, H.;Broser, F.",1977,,,0,0,

[Japanese],"Kidney and liver biopsies from 2 patients with abnormal urinary findings were studied using light, fluorescent, and electron microscopy, as well as electron microanalysis. A 10-year-old boy had liver cirrhosis with prominent vacuolar degeneration. Percutaneous renal biopsy was performed twice, before and after the administration of D-penicillamine. The kidney showed glomerulosclerosis. Light microscopy showed a prominent increase in mesangial matrix with slight cell proliferation and focal thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Electron microscopy confirmed these findings and showed electron-dense deposits in the subendothelial areas and the mesangial matrix, as well as a so-called ""moth-eaten appearance"". Thickening of the GBM and mesangial interposition were evident. IgG and IgM were present in the glomeruli; IgG and fibrinogen were observed in the mesangial areas. After treatment with penicillin O, granular staining of IgG, IgM, IgA and fibrinogen was observed in the mesangium and along the GBM. On electron microanalysis, a high concentration of copper was evident in the dense lysosome-like bodies in the cells of the proximal tubule. No copper was obtained from the glomeruli. The second case was that of a 6-year-old boy. In the blood, IgA increased; C<inf>3</inf> and C<inf>4</inf> were normal. The findings in the glomeruli under the light microscope were not very different from those of case 1: ultrastructurally, an increase in the mesangial matrix and thickening of the GBM were evidenced. However, the electron-dense deposits and ""moth-eaten appearance"" were absent. By immunofluorescence, IgG was only stained in the mesangial area and weakly along the glomerular capillary walls. Copper could not be demonstrated. The results lead to some hypotheses. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia and low levels of serum complement components may be caused by liver failure (case 1). The glomerular morphologic changes were apparently not caused by direct accumulation of serum copper based on tissue copper microanalysis; immunological mechanisms may play a role, although no antigen was identified. Lysosomes play a role in the metabolism of copper in the proximal tubular epithelium. It is conceivable that hyperimmunoglobulinemia and low serum levels of C<inf>3</inf> and C<inf>4</inf> may be involved in the pathogenesis of nephrosclerosis, although they were only found in case 1.",,"Fukunishi, Y.;Fujisawa, S.;Shimizu, S.",1976,,,0,0,

[German],"In 2 years, a total of 12 patients with proteinuria after D-penicillamine therapy were examined clinically, serologically, and by renal biopsy (light microscopy, immunohistology, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy). Light microscopic, immunohistological, and electron microscopic evaluations were performed independently at 3 different institutes. One table summarizes the renal symptoms of the patients at the time of the renal biopsy, and a second table compares the degree of proteinuria with the histological diagnoses. In all cases, a 'mesangioproliferative' glomerulonephritis somewhat similar to LE nephritis was found. The interstitium contained infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often with hyaline vacuoles, and foam cells as an expression of lipoid nephrosis. There was no evidence of amyloidosis. Immunohistology corresponded to the picture of nephritis due to immune complexes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed irregular thickening of the basement membrane of the glomerulus. Diffuse thickening of this membrane as in typical membranous glomerulonephritis and spike-like protrusions were not found. The mesangial matrix was enlarged by increased cell proliferation. Scanning electron microscopy, particularly in cases with heavy proteinuria, showed partial contraction and distortion of the podocyte processes by cocoon- or shell-shaped outgrowths. Podocyte changes are probably not specific. The clinical evolution of the disease was favorable. On the basis of renal biopsies (in part marked proliferation of mesangial cells and an increase in PAS-positive matrix substances), D-penicillamine glomerulopathy is considered to be a special form of ""mesangioproliferative"" glomerulonephritis, because, as a rule, all glomeruli had undergone inflammatory changes and electron microscopy showed a relatively strong proliferation in the mesangium. This, as well as the regressive thickening of the basement membrane by subepithelial deposits, goes against a classification of this LE-type nephropathy among the typical forms of membranous or perimembranous glomerulonephritis. Etiologically, it is not unlikely that this D-penicillamine glomerulonephritis is a drug-induced immune complex nephritis similar to gold nephropathy. In favor of this assumption are: the immunohistological picture with IgG and complement deposits, the periglomerular and periarteriolar round cell infiltrations, and the evident lack of dose dependence. Antibodies against D-penicillamine are demonstrable, but their pathogenic significance is unclear. The higher prevalence of kidney damage from D-penicillamine in diseases with normal copper metabolism compared to Wilson's disease is possibly explained by the fact that D-penicillamine after copper chelation acts in a less immunogenic manner. .",,"Brass, H.;Genth, E.;Hartl, P.

3169,Penicillamine-induced skin lesions: occurrence in a patient with hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease),"Penicillamine is a metabolite of penicillin, it is antigenic and therefore allergenic in man. However, the adverse side effects of this drug are related not only to its allergenicity, but also to its effect on connective tissue and possibly on heavy metal chelation. Since side effects frequently occur with penicillamine, and since the drug is used to treat numerous disorders, the following case is reported. A 41-year-old patient with hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease), who had been treated for 15 years with penicillamine, developed small white papules at venipuncture sites in the antecubital fossa and at surgical suture sites. Histologically, these papules showed connective tissue degeneration in the dermis. Most likely, the changes were the result of penicillamine's effect on the formation of new connective tissue at the sites of injury. The patient also developed skin wrinkles on her face and neck while taking the penicillamine regimen, and these changes were attributed, at least in part, to the effects of this drug on connective tissue.",,"Greer, K.

3173,The diagnostic application of specific anti-procollagen sera. I. Analysis of skin biopsies,"Antisera were prepared in rabbits against mature calf skin collagen (type I) and a polypeptide characteristic of calf skin procollagen (type I). This latter peptide binds to the amino terminus of the alpha chains and is cleaved during normal maturation by a specific enzyme, procollagen peptidase. For the present study, procollagen was isolated from the skin of calves with a congenital deficiency of procollagen peptidase, a disease called dermatosparaxis. Antisera against mature collagen and procollagen were rendered specific by appropriate immunoadsorption procedures. These serums show a strong cross reaction with the collagen and procollagen of human skin. While the anti-collagen sera produced indirect immunofluorescent staining of the entire dermis, the anti-pro-collagen sera only reacted with the upper dermal layer (stratum papillary) of unfixed frozen sections of normal human skin biopsies. Unfixed frozen sections of skin biopsies from 50 patients with various diseases were analyzed in indirect immunofluorescence tests with antiprocollagen sera. In 19 cases, material from unaffected skin areas was also available for study. The skin of patients with connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, scleroderma) reacts like normal skin. The skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris and lichen planus shows extensive subepithelial areas of procollagen fluorescence. Keloids show very weak or no procollagen immunofluorescence in several cases. In 3 cases studied with prolonged treatment with local corticosteroids, a normal pattern of procollagen immunofluorescence reappeared. Biopsies from a case of Wilson's disease on prolonged penicillamine D therapy and a case of epidermolysis bullosa also lacked reactivity with anti-procollagen sera. Unaffected skin of all patients revealed normal procollagen immunofluorescence. It is concluded that immunofluorescence studies with procollagen-specific antisera provide a simple and accurate tool for localized analysis of collagen metabolism.",,"Wick, G.;Kraft, D.;Kokoschka, E.

Penicillamine D treatment has drastically altered the course of this disease, so that a normal reproductive life is the rule rather than the exception. None of the 18 women with Wilson's disease, who received penicillamine during 29 pregnancies and gave birth to 29 normal babies, had an exacerbation of their disease during pregnancy. Of two women with Wilson's disease in whom penicillamine treatment was discontinued before or during pregnancy, one developed evidence of progressive hepatic decompensation in the third trimester and died of liver disease two years later. In the other, severe hemolytic anemia developed in the second trimester, seven months after stopping penicillamine. It is concluded that penicillamine treatment, continued throughout pregnancy, protects the mother against relapse of Wilson's disease and carries no risk to the fetus.

The following enzyme activities were recorded: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH), glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), acid phosphatase (AcP), and 'leucine aminopeptidase' (LAP). . A dose-dependent activation by D-penicillamine occurred in the case of G 6 PDH and AcP activities, a dose-dependent inhibition by D-penicillamine was found with AP and GAPDH activities. LDH and LAP activities remained unchanged in the presence of D-penicillamine at concentrations up to 10 mg/ml (67 mM/l). From the data of pharmacokinetic studies in rats, it can be concluded that penicillamine D concentrations influencing enzyme activities can be easily achieved in vivo, under the conditions of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Morbus Wilson.

Personal experience points to the great improvement in the child's general conditions and neurological picture observed after sustained penicillin therapy.

Early recognition of this condition is of great importance because this is one treatment of the few liver diseases for which effective treatment is available. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease can now be made relatively easily without having to wait for the development of the typical and clinically recognizable multi-organ involvement. This is important to the physician and pediatrician because these patients can now be treated effectively by the simple oral administration of a relatively non-toxic agent, penicillamine D. Whereas previously all untreated patients with Wilson's disease died, they can now be restored to virtually normal health; they can live a normal life and a normal life, as long as the diagnosis is made and treatment is instituted in time, before irreparable damage is done to vital organs.

3194,Molecular biology of copper. A circular dichroism study on copper complexes of thionein and penicillamine,"Cd, Zn thionein (metallothionein) was isolated from chicken liver from Cd-pretreated chickens weighing 1500 g. The native Cd,Zn thionein contained 9 g metal atoms per 12,000 g protein. After addition of Cu(CH<inf>3</inf>CN)<inf>4</inf>ClO<inf>4</inf>, all Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup >2+</sup> were successfully replaced. 15 g Cu<sup>+</sup> atoms of the acetonitrile perchlorate complex were bound to the protein. Due to the absence of aromatic amino acid residues, thionein has unique ultraviolet and circular dichroism properties. The shoulder of the ultraviolet spectrum at 250 nm (A<inf>250</inf> x A<inf>280</inf><sup>-1</sup> = 23.9) was shifted to 275 nm (A< inf >250</inf> x A<inf>280</inf><sup>-1</sup> = 1.6). No significant absorption was detected in the visible region. The conformational changes of the protein moiety were much more visible in the circular dichroism spectra. Titration with Cu(CH<inf>3</inf>CN)<inf>2</inf><sup>+</sup> caused the appearance of three new Cotton effects: 257.5 nm (<sup>+ </ sup>), 350 nm (+) and 301 nm (-). The negative Cotton effect at 239 nm of the parent metallothionein was completely leveled off. The binding strength of copper with thionein is extraordinarily high: it survives proton treatment up to a pH of 1.9. Displacement of Cd<sup>2+</sup> by Cu<sup>+</sup> using Cd thionein that formed at pH 2.2, resulted in the same circular dichroism properties observed for the Cu thionein. D Penicillamine proved to be a suitable model for metal-free thionein, as redox reactions and polymerization of the sterically hindered thiol residue are known to be slow. The correlation of the circular dichroism properties of any copper complex using thionein or penicillamine D was surprisingly high. Circular dichroism measurements of penicillamine Cu(I) D revealed cotton wool effects at 255 nm (+), 280 nm (+), and 355 nm (â). When examining the red-violet mixed Cu(I) Cu(II) D penicillamine complex, cotton bands were observed in the visible region at 425 nm (-) and 495 nm (+). In many blue copper enzymes, copper is assumed to be in the vicinity of cysteine and aromatic amino acid residues, which are known to play important roles in electron transfer. This is not the case for Cu thionein, which would explain many different properties of this copper protein. It is very attractive to conclude that the sterically hindered SH group of penicillamine D reacts with excess copper in a specific manner, similar to Cu thionein. This phenomenon could explain the considerable success of penicillamine D in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Rupp, H.;Voelter, W.;Weser, U.",1975,,,0,0,

Eighteen died of their disease at a mean age of 19.1 years. Kayser Fleischer rings were present in 37 patients. Splenomegaly and hyperpigmentation of the shins were observed in the middle. 17 had easy bleeding and bruising. Less frequent symptoms or signs were included; edema, arthralgias, jaundice, palpable liver and ascites. Neurological symptoms were common. More than half of the patients had at least one of the following: poor coordination, psychological impairment, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, masked facies, altered gait, rigidity, dementia, dystonia, hypertonia, and drooling. Pancytopenia was a frequent finding, in correlation with splenomegaly. Hyperchloremia, hypokalemia, and low serum carbon dioxide content associated with fixed alkaline urine pH suggested renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Serum uric acid was reduced and uric acid clearance increased in almost all patients. Hyperaminoaciduria occurred in the majority of patients who had received less than 1 year of penicillamine treatment. Elevated serum creatinine and BUN and reduced creatinine clearance were found. Fasting blood sugar levels were normal, and glycosuria was not detected. Serum calcium was reduced and calcium clearance increased. Serum inorganic phosphates were low in 60% and phosphorus clearance increased in 36%. Four patients had bone deformities. Prothrombin time was the most frequent abnormal liver function test. BSP retention was present in 75%, SGOT was elevated in 36%; SGPT at 14%. Serum proteins, albumin, and transferrin were reduced by approximately 1/4 and complement by 3 of 16.

The cause is probably a genetic defect that allows increased copper absorption due to ceruloplasmin deficiency. At the forefront of internal damage in this complex of diseases are liver cirrhosis and kidney damage. The involvement of multiple organs gives a multiplicity of clinical symptoms, for example, the hepatocerebral form, the abdominal or hepatic type, and the pseudosclerosis or neurological type.

3205,Penicillamine D-induced lupus during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Two cases and immunological study during treatment. [French],"Based on 2 observations of penicillamine D-induced lupus erythematosus in the course of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, the authors provide a systematic review of the biological characteristics of lupus during such therapy. The first observation involved a 45-year-old woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. At month 11, there was an episode of muscle pain with the appearance of LE cells and antinuclear antibodies. Clinical signs disappeared when treatment was discontinued. The second case was a 53-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis who presented with a facial rash and appearance of antinuclear antibodies at month 11. The rash disappeared when treatment was discontinued, but subsequent resumption of treatment resulted in recurrence of the rash and antinuclear antibodies. In the systematic study involving 25 patients (including the 2 described above), the authors found by using indirect immunofluorescence on liver sections that antinuclear antibodies were initially absent in 15 patients. During treatment, 10 of these negative cases became positive, usually only to a small extent. Of the 10 initially positive cases, 3 became negative during treatment and 3 increased significantly. With the help of the latex agglutination test, it was shown that anti-DPN antibodies remained absent in all 25 patients. The observations are comparable to those described in the literature on the treatment of Wilson's disease or cystinuria. The absence of immunological abnormalities before treatment in the two cases described indicates that the lupus was induced by the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The extent or frequency of appearance of antinuclear antibodies in approximately half of the cases during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with penicillamine D can be compared with the results obtained with the use of procainamide or hydralazine. Penicillamine D-induced lupus appears to be quite rare even in cases of rheumatoid arthritis in which antinuclear antibodies are positive. The presence of such antibodies does not seem to be sufficient to contraindicate the use of penicillamine D against rheumatoid arthritis.",,"Crouzet, J.;Camus, J. P.;Leca, A.

[Slovenian],"Penicillamine D, which has already proven effective in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma, is now being introduced in the area of chronic aggressive hepatitis (CAH). A nonspecific mesenchymal reaction with accentuated collagen synthesis represents the basic event in both collagenoses and CAH through an indirect blockade of cysteine, penicillamine D obstructs collagen synthesis and the consequent fibroplasia. Contraindications to such treatment, known so far, are kidney failure and disorders of the hematopoietic system. Penicillamine D was administered to 10 CAH patients who had not responded to corticosteroid and immunosuppressant medication, in whom liver histology had not improved. In all but 2 patients (all younger than 45 years, mean age 29.4 years) there was overt subjective improvement and normalization of laboratory findings. Seven patients could be controlled bioptically. In 3 patients the histological picture improved to the point of indicating a practical cleaning of the morbid process. In 2 patients the signs of aggressiveness disappeared, while one patient remained unchanged and one showed even stronger aggressiveness on histological picture. Unwanted side effects in the form of changes in the skin and mucous membranes were observed in 3 patients. A trial of penicillamine D seems warranted, especially in AuAg-positive subjects with CAH in whom treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants may be dangerous, or in whom such treatment has been unsuccessful.

3213,Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease is a rare, genetically determined condition characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body, and in particular in the liver, brain, and corneas. Onset, usually between the ages of 10 and 20 years, is marked by neurological signs and symptoms that combine dyskinesia with dystonia. There is usually little or no evidence of liver involvement, and cirrhosis is rare. Kayser Fleischer's ring is a virtually constant and pathognomonic sign of the disease. Chelation with penicillamine D is usually followed by a regression of the neurological signs and symptoms of the disease. Its effect on liver changes is less certain. The drug is remarkably effective in preventing the development of clinical manifestations in asymptomatic disease, as found in the systematic investigation of the family tree and the 2 main biochemical abnormalities, namely, a reduced level of circulating ceruloplasmin and an increase in hepatic copper.",,"Sicot, C.",1974,,,0,0,
3214,Bicarbonate excretion in Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Acid excretion and bicarbonate excretion were examined in 13 patients with Wilson's disease, 11 of whom had been treated with penicillamine D. Five patients had had serum bicarbonate levels less than 22 mEq/L before penicillamine treatment, but only one had such a value at the time of these studies. Nine patients did not acidify their urine to pH 5.2 after ammonium chloride loading. The Tm for bicarbonate was low after bicarbonate loading in only two patients, although the threshold for bicarbonate excretion was apparently decreased in half of the patients (ie, excretion greater than muEq/min at a plasma level less than 22 mEq/l). Mean bicarbonate excretion was high at normal plasma bicarbonate levels, but was less than 3% of the filtered load in all but two patients. These data suggest that two patients had proximal or type II renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and another seven had a gradient defect or distal RTA. Bicarbonate loss was minimal in most patients and could be due to tubular damage directly or indirectly to a defect in the gradient for excretion of hydrogen ions.",,"Wilson, D. M.;Goldstein, N.

3231,Pathogenesis and course of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease can be defined as an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by excessive storage of copper, particularly in the liver, kidneys, brain and cornea, eventually leading to liver disease, tubular reabsorption abnormalities proximal kidney stones, basal ganglia disease, and the characteristic Kayser Fleischer cornea. rings. The metabolic abnormality is most likely abnormal processing of copper by the liver, resulting in decreased biliary excretion of copper and accumulation of copper in the body. The biochemical nature of the hepatic defect in copper metabolism is unknown, but removal of copper from the body by chelation therapy is followed by a dramatic reversal of all manifestations of the disease. This response to chelation therapy can be taken as evidence that the clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease are due to the damaging effects of excessive copper deposition in the tissues. A concept of disease is presented that explains the variability of clinical manifestations as successive stages in the natural evolution of the disease. According to this concept, copper accumulates in the liver until it reaches a certain critical level. The copper is then released into the blood and there is a progressive accumulation of copper in the brain. After copper in the brain reaches a critical level, neurological disease sets in, and unless the copper accumulation is reversed by chelation therapy, progressive neurological disease ends with disease.",,"Cartwright, G.

3237,Trace elements and skin pigmentation,"Of the 50 or so trace elements known to exist in the body, zinc offers the most interesting insights in its relationship to melanin. Hyperpigmented skin lesions have been reported in patients with trace element metabolism abnormalities, such as Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis. Although elevated serum copper levels are found in several hyperpigmentary conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and melanosis accompanying pregnancy or oral contraceptive intake, many other conditions with hypercupremia are not associated with pigmentary changes. In a recent study of vitiligo there was no evidence of copper deficiency in either skin or serum, while serum zinc levels were significantly reduced. However, any speculation about the role of trace elements in vitiligo should take into account the structural defect that underlies the absence of melanin. Heavy metals can cause skin discoloration in several ways. Melanosis has long been associated with the excessive use of drugs containing heavy metals such as arsenic, bismuth, gold or silver. In these cases, there is an increase in melanin within the basal cell layer and in the dermal melanophages. Hyperpigmentation resulting from the use of mercury in cosmetic creams is probably more common than assumed. The metal particles themselves can contribute to skin color and can often be demonstrated directly in sections. Bureau (1967) has recommended the use of EDTA in skin complications after gold therapy, in view of the renewed interest shown by rheumatologists in prescribing this heavy metal. Our findings suggest that gold may be retained by the skin for a considerable time after administration, and therefore such an approach may be warranted in patients with a decreased ability to excrete gold.",,"Molokhia, M.

3242,Influence of penicillamine and sodium maleate on acute toxicity and copper distribution in certain organs,"It has been established in the course of experiments with female albino rats that penicillamine D administered intramuscularly at doses of 20 to 100 mg/kg shows a mild and unreliable antidotal effect on acute subcutaneous copper sulfate poisoning and reduces to a negligible degree (expressed as a negligible trend) the copper content in the liver and kidneys after a single subcutaneous injection with a sublethal dose of copper sulfate. Sodium maleate, administered subcutaneously in doses of 50 to 400 mg/kg, reduces copper content in the liver and kidneys (significantly or trending). At the lowest doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg the toxicity of copper sulfate does not change significantly, while at the highest doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg its effect is a clear intensification of this toxicity. Sodium maleate, administered at what is itself an ineffective dose of 25 mg/kg, does not alter the copper decorporating effect of penicillamine and shows a tendency to potentiate its antidotal effect.

It is advantageous to evaluate the degree of ceruloplasmin and total copper in the serum and to verify the kinetics of modified radio copper. This is the only reliable diagnosis even for patients in whom liver puncture with quantitative chemical detection of copper has been contraindicated. The procedure developed by Biesold and Gunther (assessment of the rate of incorporation of 64 Cu into ceruloplasmin) has been an efficient and preferable method and is also used for routine controls.

Acquiring such data is an extremely complex task that requires the collaboration of science, industry, and government, but it is clearly a pressing obligation. The author presents a review of the contaminating effects of lead and mercury and describes the steps that will be necessary in the development of better analytical methods. Among the proposals presented in this paper are: First, that long-term trends in the redistribution of environmental metals and their rate of accumulation should be studied and projected while simultaneously investigating and identifying local pollution problems. Second, research into the effects of metals on biological systems should be expanded and efforts should be made to develop more sensitive toxicity signals. In particular, the study of the biological consequences of prolonged exposure to low doses of metals should be promoted and matrices should be developed that reflect and allow the assessment of metal ion imbalance and related biological antagonisms. Third, in support of such efforts, researchers must strive for even better analytical approaches that are sensitive, fast, and accurate.",,"Ulmer, D. D.",1973,,,0,0,

Comparison of Tetrathiomolybdate and Trientine in a Double-Blind Study of the Treatment of the Neurological Presentation of Wilson's Disease,"Randomized, double-blind, controlled, 2-arm DESIGNA study of 48 patients with the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease. Patients received trientine hydrochloride 500 mg 2 times daily or tetrathiomolybdate 20 mg 3 times daily with meals and 20 mg 3 times daily between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received 50 mg of zinc 2 times a day. The patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with weekly evaluation of neurological and speech function; discharged taking 50 mg zinc 3 times daily, and returned yearly for follow-up. SETTING A reference environment of a university hospital. PATIENTS Mainly newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms who have not been treated for more than 4 weeks with an anti-copper drug. INTERVENTION Treatment with trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neurological function was assessed using semi-quantitative neurological and speech examinations. Adverse drug events were assessed by complete blood cell counts and biochemical measures. RESULTS Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm had neurological deterioration (p < 0.05). Three patients who received tetrathiomolybdate had side effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had more transaminase elevations. One patient who received trientine had an adverse effect of anemia. Four patients who received trientine died during follow-up, 3 of whom showed initial neurological deterioration. Neurological and speech recovery during a 3-year follow-up period was quite good. CONCLUSION Tetrathiomolybdate is a better option than trientine to preserve neurological function in patients with neurological disease.

We have developed zinc as a lifelong therapy for patients with Wilson's disease. The interference with lymphocyte function that occurs as a side effect of zinc therapy could lead to serious problems in our patients. We evaluated the mitogenic response of lymphocytes and the activity of natural killer cells in patients with Wilson's disease treated for 5 years or more with zinc, compared to normal controls, and found no differences. In a second study, we evaluated these same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after 1 year of zinc treatment and again found no significant differences. We have seen no evidence of immune suppression or increased susceptibility to infection in our patients, who have now been treated with zinc for up to 15 years.

3252,Wilson's disease in personal material--alterations in hemostasis,"The genetically determined impairment of copper excretion from the liver to the bile in Wilson's disease (WD) causes ""free copper"" to accumulate in toxic amounts not only in the liver, but also in other organs. In WD, a liver biopsy could often not be performed due to severe hemostatic disturbances. The aim of the study was: a) to demonstrate our 9 patients with various forms of WD. b) examine some blood coagulation factors and compare the results with those obtained in other liver diseases. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made on the basis of abnormalities in copper metabolism. Among our 9 patients (8 women and 1 man, between 17-33 years old) we diagnosed: 3 patients with fulminant Wilson's disease with profound jaundice throughout the day, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhagic diathesis and liver failure, died, 2 patients with chronic active hepatitis , hemolytic anemia and bleeding diathesis, 2 patients with liver cirrhosis, bleeding diathesis, Kayser-Fleisher ring, neuropsychiatric syndrome, 2 asymptomatic patients without bleeding diathesis.

3253,Time course of changes in plasma trace element levels after thrombolysis during the acute phase of human myocardial infarction.,"It has been suggested that reperfusion-induced injury of ischemic myocardium could result, in part, from the cytotoxic effects of oxygen free radicals. Since several trace elements are involved in several of the reactions that lead to the production of free radicals, we have measured plasma levels of copper, zinc, selenium and iron: 1. In 18 patients (average age 60 years) undergoing therapy thrombolytic within 6 h after the onset of myocardial infarction (G1); 2. In 16 patients with coronary artery disease but no history of prior myocardial infarction (MI) (mean age 50 years, G2); and 3. In 50 healthy volunteers divided into two subgroups according to age (mean age 33 years, G3 and 55 years, G4). Plasma myosin levels were used to quantitatively estimate the extent of the infarcted mass. Plasma trace element levels were measured in blood samples after centrifugation and storage at -80 degrees C. The main results were as follows: In G1 patients who underwent thrombolysis, significant plasma myosin release was measured , with a peak at D6 (1678 vs. 95 microU/L in H0). In those G1 patients after myocardial infarction: 1. A significant increase in plasma copper levels was observed from day 4 to day 10 post-infarction (x1.15 relative to baseline data in H0) ; 2. A decrease in plasma zinc levels was observed and was maximum 12 hours after the start of thrombolytic treatment; 3. A decrease in selenium concentration was observed in G1 patients, as well as in G2 patients, compared to control groups (80% of G3 and G4 values); and 4. A significant decrease in plasma iron levels was observed in G1 (67.8% of G3 and G4 control values) and was significant from H0 to day 7 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this study highlighted the temporal evolution of plasma trace element levels in the follow-up of patients who have undergone thrombolysis after MI and the possible prognostic implication of such variations.",,"Pucheu, S;Coudray, C;Vanzetto, G;Favier, A;Machecourt, J;Leiris, J",1995,,10.1007/BF02790115,0,0,

Among them, 68 were G6PD-deficient patients, of whom 34 were in the supplemented group and 34 in the non-supplemented group. The supplemented group received vitamin E for 60 consecutive days at a dose of 800 IU/day for adults and 400 IU/day for children < or = 12 years (4 times a day). 34 apparently healthy subjects matched for age and sex with a normal level of G6PD were taken to observe the reference data (healthy control) and also to compare. All G6PD-deficient patients were selected from the Outpatient Department (OPD) of Hematology, BSMMU, Dhaka, and all healthy subjects by personal contact. The level of G6PD in blood was determined by the spectrophotometric method and the serum levels of Cu, Zn by the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. To observe binding protein availability, total serum protein, albumin, globulin, and A:G ratio were performed using standard laboratory techniques. All parameters were measured on day 1 of their first visit and also on day 60 in the deficient groups. Data analysis was performed using an appropriate statistical method. Serum Cu was significantly higher (p<0.001) but serum Zn, total protein, albumin, and A/G ratio were significantly lower (p<0.001) in the G6PD-deficient groups compared to the healthy control on day 1. After vitamin E supplementation, the values of these parameters were comparable to those of the healthy control in the supplemented group compared to those of their pre-supplemented and non-supplemented groups on both day 1 and day 1. day 60. Therefore, vitamin E supplementation has its effective role in restoring normal serum concentration of Cu and Zn in this group of patients.",,"Sultana, N;Begum, N;Akhter, S;Begum, S;Quraishi, Sb;Ferdousi, S;Ali, T",2008,,,0,0,
3255,Effect of intragastric pH on oral zinc acetate and zinc oxide absorption in healthy young volunteers,"METHODS: After a 9-hour fast, 10 healthy subjects (5 men and 5 women) received a single oral dose of 50 mg elemental zinc as an acetate or salt oxide and under conditions of high or low intragastric pH. In all phases, a Heidelberg capsule pH detector-transmitter was used to continuously monitor intragastric pH. During the high pH phases, single oral doses of famotidine 40 mg oral suspension were administered before zinc to raise intragastric pH above 5. Intragastric pH < or = 3 was maintained in the low pH phases. RESULTS: The mean plasma zinc area under the curve for low pH zinc acetate (AL), high pH zinc acetate (HA), low pH zinc oxide (OL), and high pH zinc oxide (OH ) were 524, 378, 364 and 66 micrograms xh /dL, respectively. The highest plasma zinc concentrations occurred with the acetate salt at low intragastric pH, while the lowest plasma concentrations occurred with the oxide salt at high intragastric pH. The importance of pH for the dissolution of these salts was verified by in vitro tests. Twenty-four hour urinary zinc excretion was highest for the AL phase and lowest for the OH phase. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that intragastric pH and salt-solubility are important in the oral absorption of zinc. Specifically, the oxide salt is not an appropriate zinc salt for use in those patients with elevated intragastric pH. BACKGROUND: Zinc is an important nutrient and is required to support a multitude of physiological processes. Mineral supplements that provide physiological doses of zinc can be used when dietary zinc is inadequate. Zinc is also used in pharmacological doses to treat zinc deficiency and conditions such as Wilson's disease and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Although various zinc salts are available, they do not have the same solubility, which is believed to be a key factor in zinc absorption. Furthermore, the solubility of salts is affected by pH, which can vary between pH 1 and 7 under various physiological conditions in the stomach. The objectives of this 2-way, 4-phase crossover study were to assess the effect of high (> or = 5) and low (< or = 3) intragastric pH on zinc oxide and acetate salt absorption in young healthy volunteers. . .",,"Henderson, Lm;Brewer, Gj;Dressman, Jb;Swidan, Sz;DuRoss, Dj;Adair, Ch;Barnett, Jl;Berardi, Rr",1995,,10.1177/0148607195019005393,0,0,
3256,Tetrathiomolybdate versus trientine in the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Initial treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, used for years in most patients, causes neurological worsening in up to half of these patients, and half of those who worsen never recover. Zinc, ideal for maintenance therapy, is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We have developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for these types of patients and it has worked well in open studies. Trientine, another anti-copper drug on the market approved for patients intolerant to penicillamine, had not been tested in this type of patient. Here, we report a double-blind trial of TM versus trientine in the neurologically presenting patient with Wilson's disease. Design and methods: The study was a double-blind design in which patients received TM plus zinc or trientine plus zinc for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they had neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease, if they had not been treated for more than 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed up in hospital throughout the 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semi-quantitative speech and neurological examinations to assess for possible neurological worsening. Weekly blood and urine studies were also performed. At hospital discharge, they continued zinc maintenance therapy and returned at yearly intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients entered the trientine arm and 6 met criteria for neurological deterioration, while 25 patients entered the TM arm and only 1 deteriorated (p < 0.05). One patient with trientine had an adverse event while 7 with TM had adverse events. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 of whom showed initial neurological deterioration, 2 patients in the TM arm died. In those patients who did not deteriorate or die, neurological and speech recovery over 3 years was good. Interpretation: TM is a superior option to trientine for the initial therapy of neurologic Wilson's disease.

3257,Zinc therapy for Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,"Zinc is effective in all phases of Wilson's disease treatment and is the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy. It works by blocking the absorption of copper in the intestine and lacks the side effects of the other two anti-copper drugs. Zinc is approved in the US, Europe, and Japan for maintenance therapy of Wilson's disease. We will discuss the proper dosage, management, and follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc. Because we found that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were zinc deficient, and zinc is so important for neuronal function, we conducted a double-blind clinical trial of a new once-daily 150-mg zinc gastroretentive tablet developed by Adeona Pharmaceuticals, for 6 months in patients with AD. Patients older than 70 years treated with zinc had statistically significantly better scores than the placebo group in two cognitive scoring systems (ADAS-Cog, p= 0.037 and CDR-SOB, p= 0.03), indicating that the therapy with zinc is effective in older patients with AD.",,"Brewer, Gj",2011,,,0,0,1733.0
3258,"An Ongoing Phase 2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of WTX101 in Newly Diagnosed Wilson's Disease Patients","Background and objectives WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational drug with a novel copper-binding mechanism, being tested in an ongoing prospective study to assess safety and efficacy in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) newly diagnosed. Methods Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD older than 18 years and treatment-naÃ¯ve or treated for < 2 years with chelation or zinc therapy initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD, and after 6 weeks, dosing was guided by clinical and laboratory criteria. Periodic evaluations included safety, liver disease status, neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and parameters of copper metabolism. Results Twenty-eight patients have been enrolled in the study. At trial entry, most patients received no treatment or were treated for < 28 days with WD therapy, with only 5/28 receiving treatment for > 90 days. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 mM), 25/28 had neurologic manifestations at baseline, and mean UWDRS part III was 22. Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5. Adverse events (AEs) included reversible liver elevation. tests (n=5, of which 3 were related to per protocol dose escalation) and neutropenia (n=2). After the starting dose was reduced from 60 mg daily to 15-30 mg once daily and the dose increase was limited to 60 mg once daily, WTX101 was well tolerated with few adverse events. Liver status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable in all patients. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over time on treatment. Other measurements of Cu (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) indicate a similar pattern of copper elimination. UWDRS Part III scores were greatly improved in patients with neurological manifestations or remained stable in those without. Daily activity status (UWDRS part II) showed a similar improvement. Summary WTX101 appears safe and well tolerated as initial therapy in patients with WD. Improvements in liver and neurological disease, Cu metabolism, and daily activity status were observed over time with WTX101 treatment. More data is accumulating. Conclusion Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to establish its safety and efficacy for the initial treatment of WD. The potential for once-daily dosing will increase patient comfort and adherence to treatment.",,"Schilsky, Ml;Askari, Fk;Ferenci, P;Ala, A;Czlonkowska, A;Nicholl, Dj;Bronstein, J;Bega, D;Weiss, Kh",2016,,,0,0,1136.0
3259,The promise of tetrathiomolybdate copper-reducing therapy in the cure of previously incurable advanced cancer and the treatment of inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) complexes copper with proteins in a strong tripartite complex. This complex with dietary protein is excreted in the feces, causing a negative copper balance. In the blood, this complex, TM, free copper and albumin, makes free copper unavailable and toxic. TM, developed for Wilson's disease, is very effective for the neurological presentation, for which no other drug is optimal. Reducing copper to intermediate levels with TM, levels high enough to avoid clinical deficiency, inhibits many cytokines, such as those that promote fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. TM is effective in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis, inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TM is effective in mouse models of inflammatory disease involving the liver and heart, and in four mouse models of immunomodulated disease. In humans, TM met both primary endpoints in a one-year randomized controlled trial in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune attack on the bile ducts. TM shows great promise in the areas of fibrosis, inflammation, and autoimmunity diseases. As long as steroids are helpful, TM will be better and safer. Most excitingly, recent developments show that MT can cure previously incurable advanced metastatic cancer. Tumor growth requires angiogenesis (Folkman). Many angiogenic promoters are copper-dependent, particularly those active at the level of micrometastatic cancer. LEADING CUE: TM COMPLETELY INHIBITED CANCER GROWTH IN THE HER/2neu GENETIC MOUSE BREAST CANCER MODEL. Microclusters of cancer cells, which were still there after a year of MT therapy, were unable to grow due to a lack of angiogenesis, while all controls had large cancers. Human trials ignored this clue and tested MT only against advanced cancers. These can recruit many promoters, many not dependent on copper, and only modest effects in these trials generated little interest. Now two US groups are curing metastatic cancer with MT by going back on the mouse trail. One group requires conventional excision with no evidence of disease (NED), although the disease is considered incurable due to micrometastases. After three years of TM, the cancer is cured, with 10 different advanced metastatic cancers, hitherto incurable. The second group uses MT from the start, and conventional therapy plus certain therapies targeting the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer, curing many patients with different metastatic cancers. We have started a randomized controlled trial of TM in micrometastatic osteosarcoma in dogs. It appears that TM can cure many previously hopeless cancer cases.",,"Brewer, Gj",2013,,,0,0,1531.0
3260,Zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: multicenter study in Japan,"Background and objectives: The AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as a treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). However, there are some reports of zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD. Here, we aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children, <10 years of age, with asymptomatic WD in Japanese pediatric centers and to establish appropriate benchmarks for maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective and prospective study to examine 21 children (median age 6 years, range 1-9) who met diagnostic criteria for WD and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to symptom onset at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan. No additional sequelae of WD, such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities, were observed. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urinary copper for 1 to 7 years after initiation of zinc monotherapy. We performed an abdominal ultrasound and evaluated the clinical manifestations of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for patients < 5 years was 25 mg twice daily; for those children 6 years and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the dose of zinc if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L, and decreased it if they had adverse effects of zinc such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At diagnosis, 24-hour urine AST/ALT and copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 Âµg/day (5.8+/-2.9 Âµg/kg / day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT decreased significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after treatment initiation and remained mostly below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST /ALT: 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/L at 1 and 7 years from the start of treatment, respectively). Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly to 49+/-21 cups/day (2.2+/-1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) at 6 months after treatment initiation and remained at mostly below 75 cups/day and between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study (2.2+/-0.6 and 1.5+/-0.2 cups/kg/day at 1 and 7 years after the start of treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD has been shown to be highly effective and safe. A reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD using zinc appears to be to maintain both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 ug/kg/day (and less of 75 ug/day).",,"Mizuochi, T;Eda, K;Takaki, Y;Iwama, I;Araki, M;Inui, A;Hara, S;Kumagai, H;Hagiwara, S-I;Murayama, K;Murakami, J;Kodama, H",2016,,,0,0,1132.0
3261,Renal functional and structural integrity in infants with iron deficiency anemia: relationship with oxidative stress and response to iron therapy,"Background: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare renal functional and structural integrity in 50 IDA infants and 50 healthy controls and to assess the relationship between IDA and oxidative stress and response to iron therapy. Methods: This was a prospective study in which peripheral blood samples were collected from all study subjects and the following laboratory investigations were performed: serum iron profile, urinary microalbumin, urinary leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), serum total antioxidant (TAC), serum malondialdehyde (MDA), serum and urinary trace elements (iron, copper, zinc, calcium and magnesium). All patients received oral iron therapy and were followed up for 3 months. Results: Baseline urinary marker levels were higher among IDA patients than controls (p < 0.05). Patients had lower pre-therapy CT and lower serum zinc and magnesium levels than controls, as well as higher serum MDA and copper levels (p < 0.05). The level of MDA was positively correlated with the level of microalbumin and LAP (p < 0.05). Urinary LAP concentration was positively correlated with urinary trace element concentrations (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in microalbumin, LAP, FeNa and urinary trace elements was observed after iron therapy, while hemoglobin and ferritin levels increased (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Among study subjects, IDA had an adverse influence on renal structural and functional integrity that could be reversed by iron therapy. Oxidative stress played an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney injury in ADH.

3263,Comparison of long-lasting therapeutic effects between succimer and penicillamine in hepatolenticular degeneration,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term effect of succimer (Suc) with that of penicillamine (Pen) in the treatment of hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). METHODS: One hundred and twenty HLD patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 60) received Suc 750 mg, po.bid. Group B (n = 60) received Pen 250 mg, po. qid. The maintenance treatment period ranged from 6 months to 3 years, with an average of 1.5 years. Symptoms and therapeutic effects were evaluated using the modified Goldstein scale. RESULTS: The total effectiveness of group A in two different periods of treatment was 80% and 85%, respectively, higher than that of group B (58% and 59%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Suc also had obvious curative effects for patients who failed to use Pen. There were fewer side effects in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). Suc and Pen could increase urinary copper excretion effectively and continuously. CONCLUSION: Suc is more effective and safer than Pen. Clinically, it may replace Pen as the drug of first choice for long-term maintenance therapy of HLD.",,"Ren, M. S.;Zhang, Z.;Wu, J. X.;Li, F.;Xue, B. C.;Yang, R. M.",1998,Dec,,1,1,
3264,Hepatic Features of Wilson's Disease,"In Wilson's disease (WD), defective function of AT7B leads to biliary excretion of copper and pathological accumulation of copper, particularly in the liver and brain, where it induces cell damage. Liver disease usually precedes neurological or psychiatric manifestations. In most patients with neurological or psychiatric symptoms, some degree of liver disease is present at the time of disease presentation. The hepatic manifestations of WD can be extremely variable. Patients with clinically asymptomatic WD are often detected through family screening or identified through routine laboratory testing. Others may have a clinical picture of chronic active hepatitis or end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis. A minority develop acute liver failure, often in the setting of advanced fibrosis. Complications of liver disease may be related to portal hypertension, and concomitant liver disease may accelerate the course of liver disease. Liver cancer can occur in patients with WD, most commonly when cirrhosis and inflammation are present. The prognosis of WD patients is excellent, especially for those without cirrhosis at diagnosis, but requires timely initiation of appropriate WD-specific therapy and for the patient's liver disease independent of WD.",,"Boga, S.;Ala, A.;Schilsky, M.

3265,A comparison of the results of empirical studies of complementary search techniques and recommendations in review methodology manuals: a methodological review,"BACKGROUND: The purpose and contribution of complementary search methods in systematic reviews is being increasingly recognized. Numerous studies have shown its potential in identifying studies or study data that would have been missed by searching bibliographic databases alone. What is less certain is how the complementary search methods actually work, how they are applied, and the consequent advantages, disadvantages, and resource implications of each search method. The objective of this study is to compare the current practice in the use of complementary search methods with methodological orientation. METHODS: Four methodological manuals to inform systematic review practice in the UK were read and audited to establish current methodological guidance. Studies evaluating the use of complementary search methods were identified by searching five bibliographic databases. Studies were included if they (1) reported the practical application of a complementary (descriptive) search method or (2) examined the utility of a complementary (analytical) search method or (3) identified/explored factors impacting utility of a complementary search method. method, when applied in practice. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included in this review in addition to the four methodological manuals. Studies were published between 1989 and 2016, with manual publication dates ranging from 1994 to 2014. Five complementary search methods were reviewed: contacting study authors, citation search, hand search, essays and web search. CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable consistency between recommended best practices (manuals) and current practice (methodological studies) with regard to the application of complementary search methods. Methodological studies provide useful information on the effectiveness of complementary search methods, often seeking to assess aspects of the method to improve effectiveness or efficiency. In this way, the studies advance in the understanding of complementary search methods.

3267,Clarifying the distinction between case series and cohort studies in systematic reviews of comparative studies: potential impact on the body of evidence and workload,"It is difficult to distinguish cohort studies from case series. We propose a conceptualization of cohort studies in systematic reviews of comparative studies. The main objective of this conceptualization is to clarify the distinction between cohort studies and case series. We discuss the potential impact of the proposed conceptualization on the body of evidence and workload. All exposure-based sampling studies collect multiple exposures (with at least two different exposures or exposure levels) and allow calculation of relative risks that should be considered cohorts. studies in systematic reviews, including non-randomized studies. The term ""enables/may"" means that a predefined analytical comparison is not a prerequisite (ie, absolute risks per group and/or a risk ratio are provided). Instead, all studies for which sufficient data are available for reanalysis to compare different exposures (eg sufficient data in publication) are classified as cohort studies. There may be a large number of studies without a comparison for the exposure of interest but with the data needed to calculate effect measures for a comparison. Consequently, more studies could be included in a systematic review. Therefore, on the one hand, the approach described may increase confidence in the estimates of effect and the robustness of the conclusions. On the other hand, the workload would increase (eg additional data extraction and risk of bias assessment, as well as new analyses).",,"Mathes, T.;Pieper, D.",2017,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10.1186/s12874-017-0391-8,0,0,

3269,Wilson's disease: a review for the general pediatrician,"Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder due to a mutation of the ATP7B gene that results in impaired hepatic copper excretion and copper accumulation in various tissues. It is associated with the classic triad of cirrhosis, neurological manifestations, and the ocular finding of Kayser-Fleischer rings; however, the clinical presentation can vary widely from incidental findings of abnormal liver enzymes to acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Pediatric patients may present with subtle findings including asymptomatic hepatomegaly, transaminitis, behavioral changes, movement disorders, or school failure. The general pediatrician may be the first to recognize these symptoms and should consider Wilson's disease in his differential diagnosis. Wilson's disease can be managed with lifelong chelation or zinc therapy in patients with early disease; therefore, pediatricians should have a low threshold for referral to a pediatric hepatologist for further evaluation when suspected.

Interestingly, both TM and WLN are associated with the efficacy of cisplatin, a widely used anticancer drug. Herein, we show that TM induces dimerization of the metal-binding domain of ATP7B (WLN4) via a unique sulfur-bridged Mo2S6O2 cluster. TM expels copper ions from Cu-WLN4 and forms a copper-free dimer. Mo binding to cysteine residues of WLN4 inhibits platination of the protein. Reaction with multidomain proteins indicates that TM can also connect two domains in the same molecule, forming intramolecular Mo-bridge crosslinks. These results provide structural and chemical insights into the mechanism of action of TM against ATPase and reveal the Molecular mechanism by which TM attenuates cisplatin resistance mediated by copper efflux proteins.",,"Fang, T.;Chen, W.;Sheng, Y.;Yuan, S.;Tang, Q.;Li, G.;Huang, G.;Su, J.;Zhang, X.;Zang, J.;Liu, Y.",2019,2022-01-14 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08102-z,0,0,

3272,Accuracy evaluation of exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper (REC) in a mouse model of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene responsible for a toxic copper overload mainly in the liver and central nervous system. Phenotypic heterogeneity can challenge diagnostic confirmation. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) has recently been proposed as a new WD marker, and its relationship with total serum copper (Cus), relative exchangeable copper (REC = CuEXC/Cus), as a diagnostic marker. This study aimed to investigate whether this could be confirmed in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, a designed WD animal model. Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> (n=137) and wild type (WT; n=101) mice were investigated under the same conditions at 6-8, 20, 39 or 50 weeks of age. Twenty-four Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice received D-penicillamine treatment from 39 to 50 weeks of age. Serum and liver [histology and intrahepatic copper (IHCu)] data were evaluated. In the WT group, all serum and liver data were normal. The atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> livers developed a chronic lesion ranging from isolated moderate inflammation (6-8 weeks: 16/33 = 48%) to inflammatory fibrosis with cirrhosis (50 weeks: 25/25 = 100% and 16/25 = 64% respectively). Cus and CuEXC increased up to week 39, while IHCu and REC were stable with increasing age and much higher than in WT mice (mean +/- SD: 669 +/- 269 vs. 13 +/- 3 mug/g dry liver and 39 +/- 12 vs. 11 +/- 3%, respectively). A cutoff value of 20% for REC provided a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100%, regardless of gender, age, or use of D-penicillamine. Eleven weeks of 100 mg/kg D-penicillamine reduced liver fibrosis (p = 0.001), IHCu (p = 0.026), and CuEXC (p = 0.175). In conclusion, this study confirms that REC is a diagnostic marker of WD in a mouse model of chronic liver disease caused by copper overload. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of CuEXC to monitor the evolution of WD, particularly during treatment. Copyright Â© 2018",,"Heissat, S.;Harel, A.;Um, K.;Brunet, A.

3273,"Tetrathiomolybdate, a copper chelator, inhibited imiquimod-induced skin inflammation in mice","Background: Copper is an essential metal for the maintenance of many biological functions; however, an excessive amount can induce inflammation and oxidative stress. Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a copper chelator for the treatment of Wilson's disease and decreased the severity of autoimmune arthritis in mice. Objective(s): In this report, we evaluate the effects of MT in a mouse model for psoriasis. Method(s): A mouse model of psoriasis induced by imiquimod was used. We applied immunohistochemical staining and ELISA to determine cytokine levels in inflamed skin, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes. Furthermore, we used keratinocytes and splenocytes to test the inhibitory effects of TM on cytokine production and transcription factor activation. Result(s): Our results showed that TM significantly reduced cumulative scores, epidermal thickness, and ki-67 expression in inflamed skin. Additionally, TM decreased skin cytokine levels and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, TM suppressed activation in keratinocytes and splenocytes with reduced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and STAT3. Conclusion(s): These findings are strong evidence that TM can inhibit psoriasis in the model. Copyright Â© 2018 Japan Society of Investigative Dermatology",,"Hsu, P. Y.;Yen, H. H.;Yang, T. H.;Su, C.

3274,Case report: Co-occurrence of Wilson's disease and oculocutaneous albinism in a Chinese patient,"RATIONALE: Both Wilson's disease (WD) and oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) are rare autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations on chromosome 13 and chromosome 11, respectively. Here, we report on a patient with coexisting WD and OCA, who initially presented with episodes of tremors. PATIENT CONCERNS: WD is a disorder of copper metabolism. The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and brain, causing liver symptoms. OCA is a disorder of melanin biosynthesis, characterized by a generalized reduction in pigmentation of the eyes (oculo-), skin (-cutaneous), and hair. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of WD was confirmed by neurological symptoms, metabolic tests, and MRIs. Interestingly, the patient also had very light skin color, blonde hair and eyebrows, and dark brown eyelashes and irises. Because the association of dermatologic signs in WD has been rarely reported, OCA was highly suspected based on these clinical findings. Genetic analysis was subsequently performed and the results revealed that p. (Arg778Leu) mutation in 1 allele and p. (Asn1270Ser) mutation in the other allele of the ATP7B gene, confirming the diagnosis of WD; p. (D456fs) mutation in 1 allele and p. (R299H) mutation in the other allele of the TYR gene, confirming the diagnosis of OCA. Family history was positive for WD with a brother younger than 14 years also diagnosed with it. His parents are negative for OCA and WD. INTERVENTIONS: Sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) was administered during hospitalization. Treatment with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate was started after discharge for long-term control. RESULT(S): Postural and intention tremor disappeared, and other symptoms and signs markedly improved after treatment. LESSONS: In this study, we report the first case of a child who presented simultaneously with WD and OCA, raising the possibility of a presumed link between these 2 rare diseases.",,"Rao, R.;Shu, S.;Han, Y.

3275,Featured Article: Trientine Selectively Delivers Copper to the Heart and Suppresses Pressure-Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy in Rats,"Dietary copper supplementation reverses pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by replenishing copper in the heart. A selective copper chelator, trientine (triethylenetetramine [TETA]), reverses left ventricular hypertrophy associated with diabetes also by replenishing copper in the heart. The present study was carried out to address the critical problem of how TETA delivers copper to the heart. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (CT) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Eight weeks after CT surgery, cardiac hypertrophy developed and copper content in the heart was reduced. TETA was then administered by tube at two different doses (21.9 or 87.6 mg/kg/day) for six weeks. The results showed that at the lower dose, TETA replenished the copper content in the heart, along with a decrease in the copper concentration in the blood and kidneys, and an increase in the urine. At the highest dose, TETA did not replenish copper content in the heart, but markedly increased urine copper concentrations and decreased blood and kidney copper concentrations. Neither the lowest nor the highest dose of TETA altered copper concentrations in other organs. Corresponding to myocardial copper replenishment, the lower dose of TETA suppresses cardiac hypertrophy, as judged by a reduction in left ventricular wall thickness and heart size, and a decrease in fibrosis. as reflected by a decrease in collagen I content. TETA at the highest dose not only did not suppress cardiac hypertrophy, but also caused cardiac hypertrophy in sham-operated rats. TETA-mediated myocardial restoration of copper is independent of copper transporter 1 or 2, but is associated with energy-dependent transport. This study demonstrates that low-dose TETA functions as a copper chaperone, selectively delivering copper to the copper-starved heart via active transport; at higher doses, TETA simply retains its chelating function, removing copper from the body by urinary excretion. Impact Statement: Our study reveals that TETA, traditionally considered a copper chelator, at lower doses selectively delivers copper to the heart via a copper-1 or -2 transporter-independent mechanism. Copper supplementation with a lower dose of TETA suppresses pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Since ischemic heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are associated with myocardial copper loss, this approach of using a lower dose of TETA to supplement copper in the heart would help treat the disease in patients with such cardiac events.

Three subtypes of EPS have been reported that differ based on etiology, associated diseases, and histopathologic features. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature, as well as the case of a 41-year-old woman with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine (PCM), who developed EPS after 11 years of medication intake. Objective(s): To analyze and characterize EPS subtypes based on an evaluation of different potential histological patterns. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic bibliographic search was carried out in Pubmed to identify articles describing EPS. Result(s): A peculiar histological pattern was identified in patients related to EPS PCM, either in affected or unaffected skin samples. Using specific stains for elastic fibers (Verhoeff-van Gieson, Weigert, and Orcein), the fibers appeared with an irregular surface with a thorn-like protrusion, probably due to weaker fiber cross-links, making them unable to re-link. expand after contraction along its length. axis. Interestingly, similar histological patterns have also been reported in the elastic tissues of the vessel walls of the lungs and upper respiratory tract, joints, visceral adventitia, and kidneys. Conclusion(s): A distinctive histologic pattern of PCM-related EPS is observed in affected and normal-appearing skin as well as in extracutaneous elastic tissue, suggesting potential serious drug-induced systemic elastolytic damage.

3278,Implications of manganese in chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration,"Neurological symptoms may be one of the predominant symptoms in patients with liver cirrhosis. Patients may present with subtle changes in mood or neurological function due to hepatic encephalopathy (HE), to more severe presentations including stupor and coma. Although HE, in its severe form, can be clinically easy to diagnose, the more subtle forms can be more difficult to recognize. In fact, other neurological diseases may be missed in the setting of cirrhosis or confuse the clinician regarding the diagnosis. Chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (CAHD) is a rare problem that occurs in patients with cirrhosis characterized by a parkinsonian-like neurological presentation with damage to the brain secondary to manganese (Mn) deposition. Here we describe a case of a patient with a neurological presentation of liver disease with a review of the current CAHD literature. In conclusion, CAHD is a rare condition occurring in liver cirrhosis that should always be considered in patients with neurological manifestations of chronic liver disease.

3279,Acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease: Eight years of the national liver transplant program in Uruguay,"Introduction and objective. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients with ALF due to WD. Material and methods. Retrospective review of medical records of all patients with ALF due to WD in eight years in Uruguay. Results. WD was the cause of six (15%) of thirty-nine cases of ALF. All patients were women, with a mean age of 18 years. Four patients presented peracute liver failure and two acute failure. Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. Mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), AST, and ALT were 27.5 mg/dl, 45.5 IU/l, 156 IU/l, and 51 IU/l, respectively. Ceruloplasmin levels were low in four patients, urinary copper was high in four, and two had Kayser-Fleischer rings. All patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, histochemically identifiable copper, and advanced fibrosis on liver histology. The mean MELD score was 36. All patients were treated with d-penicillamine and included on the urgent liver transplant (LT) list. Prometheus was performed on a patient. Three patients died: two without LT and one after LT. Three patients survived: one without HT (New Wilson Index < 11) and two with HT. The time of referral to the program and the total time (referral plus time on the waiting list) were greater for non-survivors than for survivors (14 vs. 3 days and 23 vs. 8, respectively). Conclusion. All cases had typical clinical, analytical and histopathological characteristics. Early referral was determinant of prognosis. Copyright Â© 2019, South Medical Clinic Foundation.

3280,El tetratiomolibdato inhibe the reacciÃ³n of cisplatin with the chaperona de cobre humana Atox1,"Cisplatin is a widely used clinical anticancer drug, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ([(NH<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>MoS<inf>4</inf>], TM ) is a chelator used clinically for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Recently, TM has been found to enhance the therapeutic effect of cisplatin; however, the origin of this effect is unclear. Here we found that TM can inhibit the reaction of cisplatin with Cu-Atox1 and prevent cisplatin-induced protein unfolding and aggregation. Although Ag(i) binds Atox1 in a similar way to Cu(i)-Atox1, TM does not prevent the reaction of Ag-Atox1 with cisplatin. This result indicates that the formation of a group of Mo-focused trimeric proteins in the TM-Cu-Atox1 system plays a role in the inhibitory effect. This work provides new insights into the mechanism by which MT enhances the cytotoxic efficacy of cisplatin and helps circumvent cisplatin resistance in tumor cells.

3281,Pediatric Wilson's disease: Findings in different presentations. A cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) can present with different manifestations: from an asymptomatic state to liver cirrhosis. Here, our aim was to evaluate clinical presentations and laboratory findings and prognoses among WD cases. DESIGN AND SETTING: Record-based cross-sectional study of patients from the university hospital, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey. METHOD(S): The medical records of 64 children with WD were evaluated, focusing on clinical, laboratory and liver biopsy findings in different clinical presentations. RESULT(S): The mean age at diagnosis was 8.6 +/- 3.26 years (range 3.5-17) and the mean duration of follow-up was 2.49 years (range 0-9 ). There were 18 cases (28.1%), 12 (18.8%), 9 (14.1%) and 6 (9.4%) of chronic liver disease, fulminant liver failure, neurological WD and acute hepatitis, respectively. Nineteen (29.7%) were asymptomatic. The most common signs and laboratory findings were jaundice (45.3%) and hypertransaminasemia (85.9%), respectively. The lowest serum zinc level was found in the fulminant hepatic failure group (P = 0.035). Hepatosteatosis was detected in 35% of the 20 patients who underwent liver biopsy. Among those with hepatosteatosis, 57.1% were asymptomatic. While 35% had copper staining, 25% had iron accumulation on liver biopsies. Nine cases underwent liver transplantation and seven of them presented fulminant liver failure (77.8%). CONCLUSION(S): The presentation, symptoms and signs of our cases were similar to those of previously reported series, except for the high proportion of cases of fulminant WE. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between zinc levels and the development of a fulminant course and between iron status and WD.

3283,Copper(I) binding properties of anti-copper drugs for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Alpha-lipoic acid as a potential anti-copper agent,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the P-type copper ATPase, ATP7B, leading to toxic accumulation of copper primarily in the liver and brain. Wilson's disease is treatable, primarily by copper chelation therapy, which promotes copper excretion. Although several drugs are currently available to remove copper, their binding affinities for Cu(I) have not been quantitatively characterized. Here we determine the Cu(I) binding affinities of five major copper-scavenging drugs: D-penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate, and tetrathiomolybdate, by exploring their ability to extract Cu(I) ions from two Cu(I)-binding proteins, the copper chaperone for cytochrome c oxidase, Cox17, and metallothionein. We report that the Cu(I) binding affinity of these drugs varies by four orders of magnitude and correlates positively with the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule and negatively with the number of atoms separating two SH groups. Based on the analysis of the structure-activity relationship and the determined Cu(I) binding affinity, we hypothesize that the endogenous biologically active substance, alpha-lipoic acid, may be suitable for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Our hypothesis is supported by cell culture experiments in which alpha-lipoic acid protected liver cells from copper toxicity. These results provide a basis for the development of new generation drugs that can provide better therapeutic results.",,"Smirnova, J.;Kabin, E.;Jarving, I.;Bragina, O.;Tougu, V.;Plitz, T.;Palumaa, P.",2018,2022-01-23 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-19873-2,0,0,

A review of publicly available information on rare disease policies and HTA processes was conducted. Experts were consulted in case of unclear or scarce information. Russia has a five times higher frequency threshold for its rare disease definition than Poland and the Netherlands (both with the EU definition). The Netherlands has greatly increased its disease registries by instituting 300 expert centers through its National Plan, in Poland there are only 6 registries, while in Russia there is a central registry. All 3 countries have an HTA process, however, the Russian one is relatively underdeveloped. Access to OD in the Netherlands is the widest with 80 of 83 EMA-approved ODs reimbursed in 2015; Poland repaid 49, while Russia repaid 4 at the federal level and 43 in the Moscow region. In all countries, new rare disease policies are being developed. The availability of health system solutions and OD reimbursement differs greatly between the 3 countries. Although both states are members of the EU with common regulations and access to EMA-approved medicines, there are marked differences between Poland and the Netherlands in the range of policies, access to treatment and screening programmes.

3285,Predictors of seizures in Wilson's disease: a clinical-radiological and biomarker study,"Background: There is a paucity of studies on predictors of seizures in Wilson's disease with neurological manifestations (WDNM), and none have evaluated the role of copper (Cu)-induced oxidative stress, proinflammation, and excitotoxicity in seizure genesis. Objective(s): To report the frequency, refractoriness, and outcome of seizures in WDNM. We also evaluated the role of Cu-induced oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and cytokines in seizure prediction. Method(s): Diagnosis of WDNM was based on clinical symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging, KF ring, and 24-h urinary Cu. A detailed clinical examination was recorded, including severity of WD, occurrence of seizures, seizure semiology, antiepileptic drug (AED), and breakthrough seizures. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography findings were observed. Serum free Cu, oxidative stress markers (glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde), glutamate, and cytokines (interleukin 6, 8, and 10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, spectrophotometer, fluorometer, and flow cytometer. respectively, and correlated with seizures. Patients were treated with zinc with or without penicillamine, and those with epilepsy received second-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Result(s): Of 110 patients with WDNM, 16 (14.5%) had seizures; focal in 11 (68.7%) and generalized in 5 (31.3%). Seizure patients had higher serum free Cu (35.87 +/- 1.34 vs. 31.72 +/- 0.68; P = 0.02), severe dystonia (P = 0.04), and more cortical frequent (100% vs. 6.4%; P < 0.01) and subcortical lesions (81.3% vs. 20.2%; P < 0.01) on MRI compared with those without seizures. Oxidative stress markers (glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde), cytokines, and glutamate were elevated in WDNM compared to controls. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, cortical involvement (OR = 105.49, 95% CI = 8.74-1272.39, P < 0.01) and number of lesions on MRI (OR = 1, 99, 95% CI = 1.11-3.57, P = 0.02) were independent predictors of seizure. Seizures were controlled with single and double AEDs in seven patients each, with two patients requiring three AEDs. All patients had seizure remission during a median follow-up of 66 (24-180) months. Conclusion(s): About one-sixth of WDNM patients have seizures, especially those with extensive cortical lesions on MRI. Seizures are easily controlled with AEDs.

3287,Advances in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder resulting in excessive copper deposition in the liver and brain, affecting children and young adults. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal. Although treatments for WD have been available since the 1950s, the disease continues to be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality due to lack of diagnosis and late or inadequate treatment. In this article, we examine the WD-related literature to review recent advances in the treatment of WD. Method(s): We conducted a literature search using the PubMed database for articles related to WD and his medical treatment. We reviewed articles and cross-referenced relevant articles to summarize current practices for the treatment of WD. Result(s): The survey shows that if WD is properly treated, the liver can be stabilized in most patients, including reversing severe neurological disability, and patients can resume their normal lives. Discussion(s): Medical treatment for WD includes the use of copper chelators (penicillamine, trientine, dimercaprol, dimercaptopropane sulfonate, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and medications that decrease gastrointestinal absorption of copper. Our understanding of treatment approaches has benefited from the large systematic clinical studies that have been conducted over the last decade. For each drug used to treat WD, we examine its development, indication for use, dosage, efficacy, and adverse effects.

Methods The study was conducted at the Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Gob. Stanley Medical College, Chennai, October 2017 to July 2018. Sixteen patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease were included in the study. Patients were analyzed based on their clinical characteristics at presentation and followed up to determine clinical response to treatment. Results The age distribution was from 11 to 61 years, with the majority in the age group of 15 to 30 years. Most of the patients (68.7%) presented hepatic manifestations. Twenty-five percent of the patients had neuropsychiatric manifestation. Two patients (13%) had both neurological and hepatic manifestations, both presenting with tremor. Three patients were asymptomatic and were diagnosed in family screening. Nine patients (56%) were born from consanguineous marriage. The Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring was found in 56% of the patients. All patients with neurological characteristics, 2 of the 3 asymptomatic patients and 3 patients with only hepatic characteristics had a KF ring. Ten patients were treated with penicillamine, 2 patients with zinc, and 4 patients were treated with zinc and penicillamine. Nine patients noted improvement with chelation therapy in the form of enhanced LFT and decreased 24-hour urine copper. Two patients with DCLD underwent liver transplantation and did well on follow-up after liver transplantation. Fifty-six percent had stable disease and 25% deteriorated, now undergoing liver transplantation. Conclusion Family screening is important for early diagnosis.

Here, we describe adult cases of Wilson's liver disease diagnosed at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, between September 2004 and August 2016. METHOD(S): Clinical manifestations, diagnostic test results, management and Outcomes of adult patients with Wilson's liver disease were evaluated based on standardized medical records. In addition, liver histology was reviewed and lesion patterns were recorded. RESULT(S): Ten new adult cases of Wilson's liver disease were diagnosed at our center between September 2004 and August 2016. The male:female ratio was 1:1 and the median age at diagnosis was 26 (range 18-56) years. Four patients presented acute liver failure, four with persistently elevated liver function tests and two with decompensated cirrhosis; none had neurological manifestations. Only one patient had a Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring. Median ceruloplasmin level at diagnosis was 0.13 (range <0.03-0.30) g/l, median 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 2.8 (range 0 .3-77.3) Âµmol and the median hepatic copper concentration was 789 (range 284-77.3) Âµmol. 1677) Âµg/g.

Copper concentrations in both blood and urine were higher than in healthy cats. The patient responded well to penicillamine treatment. Clinicopathologic abnormalities and clinical signs improved within 2 months, and the patient was alive for > 9 months after starting treatment. Genetic screening determined that the patient and her littermates had a single nucleotide variation (SNV, p. T1297R) that affected the function of the ATP7B gene product; the gene that is mutated in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). The accumulation of copper in the liver was believed to be associated with the SNV of the ATP7B gene, and the patient had a genetic disorder of copper metabolism equivalent to WD in humans.

3294,Wilson's Disease Pediatric Case Series,"Wilson's disease in children has a varied presentation and can be difficult to diagnose. At Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, from 2010 to 2015, three children in the age group of 9 to 11 years presented with hepatic, neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Investigations in all three cases revealed defects in copper metabolism consistent with those of Wilson's disease. Therefore, this disease should be strongly suspected in children presenting with hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms, as it is potentially curable.

3295,Epigenetic changes of the thioredoxin system in the tx-j mouse model and in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B, leading to accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Excess copper inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, leading to variable WD phenotypes from systemic alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression. Previously, we showed that maternal choline supplementation in the toxic milk (tx-j) Jackson mouse model of WD corrected higher levels of thioredoxin 1 (TNX1) transcript in fetal liver. Here, we investigated the effect of maternal choline supplementation on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in tx-j fetal liver using genome-wide bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Tx-j Atp7b genotype-dependent differences in DNA methylation were corrected for with choline for genes including, but not exclusively, oxidative stress pathways. To examine the phenotypic effects of postnatal choline supplementation, tx-j mice were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: with or without maternal and/or continuous choline supplementation, and with or without copper chelation treatment. with penicillamine (PCA). Hepatic transcript levels of TXN1 and peroxyredoxin 1 (Prdx1) were significantly higher in mice receiving maternal and continuous choline with or without PCA treatment compared to untreated mice. A comparison of WGBS from human WD liver and tx-j mouse liver demonstrated significant overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with ATP7B deficiency. Furthermore, eight genes in the thioredoxin (TXN) pathway were differentially methylated in human WD liver samples. In summary, Atp7b deficiency and choline supplementation have a genome-wide impact, including genes related to the TXN system, in tx-j mice. These findings could explain the variability of the WD phenotype and suggest new adjunctive treatment options for WD. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

3296,Provision of trace elements in parenteral nutrition in children: one size does not fit all,"Routine administration of trace elements is recognized as a standard of care in children requiring parenteral nutrition. However, there is a lack of global consensus regarding the provision and dosage of trace elements in pediatric parenteral nutrition. This review provides an overview of the available evidence on the supply and dosage of trace elements in parenteral nutrition in neonates and children. The provision of trace elements in children should be adapted to the weight and clinical condition of the child, with emphasis on those at risk of toxicity or deficiency. Based on current evidence, there is a need to review the formulation of commercial solutions containing multiple trace elements and to allow individual trace element additives to be made available for specific indications. The literature supports the elimination of chromium provision while supplementation with manganese and molybdenum is debated. Preterm infants may have higher parenteral requirements for iodine, selenium, and copper than previously recommended. There is increasing support for the routine provision of iron in long-term parenteral nutrition. Further studies on trace element contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions are needed for a variety of trace elements. Copyright Â© 2018 by the authors.

3297,Recovery from severe acute liver failure without transplantation in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism that leads to liver cirrhosis. WD patients with an NWIS > 11 should receive LT; however, we found 2 WD patients with an NWIS > 11 who recovered from ALF without LT. The present report aimed to analyze cases of WD patients with a high NWIS who recovered from severe ALF and discuss the clinical manifestations of the patients and the effects of treatments, including zinc (Zn) therapy, chelation therapy, PE, CHDF and LT. . We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of five patients (male, 2; female, 3) diagnosed with WD along with severe ALF. In cases 1, 2 and 3, complete recovery of ALF without LT was observed. In case 4, initial ALF recovery was seen without LT; however, ALF worsened due to bleeding from the esophageal varix. Therefore, the patient ultimately required HT. In case 5, recovery of ALF was observed with LT. All cases, except case 2, presented AHI with maximum PELD/MELD scores >=26 and NWISs >= 11, and had an indication for LT. In cases of severe ALF with grade I or II encephalopathy, we recommend evaluation of the effects of Zn and chelation treatments while preparing for HT, as the condition may not improve without HT, and pediatricians or physicians may request transplant surgeons who perform urgent LT if required.

3298,Wilson's disease: a 2017 update,"Wilson's disease (WD) is characterized by a damaging buildup of copper in the liver and brain. It is one of those rare genetic disorders that benefits from lifelong and effective treatments that have dramatically transformed the prognosis of the disease. In Europe, its clinical prevalence is estimated between 1.2 and 2/100,000, but the genetic prevalence is higher, around 1/7,000. Incomplete gene penetrance or the presence of modifier genes may explain the difference between the calculated genetic prevalence and the number of patients diagnosed with WD. The clinical spectrum of WD is broader, as expected, with mild clinical presentations and late onset of disease after 40 years in 6% of patients. WD is generally suspected when ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels are low and the 24-h urinary copper excretion is elevated. Recently, a diagnostic breakthrough was achieved with the implementation of the direct ""free copper"" or exchangeable copper (CuEXC) assay. The relative exchangeable copper (REC) that corresponds to the ratio between CuEXC and total serum copper allows a diagnosis of WD with high sensitivity and specificity when REC > 18.5%. In addition, CuEXC values at diagnosis are a marker of extrahepatic involvement and its severity. A value of >2.08 mumol/L suggests corneal and brain involvement (Se = 86%, Sp = 94%), with disease becoming more clinically and radiologically severe as values increase. . The use of FibroScan<sup></sup> is becoming more widespread to assess liver stiffness measurements in patients with WD. 6.6 kPa is considered a threshold value between mild and moderate fibrosis, while a value greater than 8.4 is indicative of severe fibrosis. Further studies are now needed to confirm the usefulness of Fibroscan<sup></sup> in the management of chronic therapy for WD patients. The treatment of this disease is based on an initial active and prolonged chelation phase (with D-Penicillamine or Trientine) followed by maintenance with Trientine or zinc salt. The two major problems that can be found are neurological worsening during the initial phase and noncompliance with treatment during maintenance therapy. Liver transplantation is the recommended therapeutic option in WD with acute liver failure or end-stage liver cirrhosis; its indication should be considered when the neurological status deteriorates rapidly despite effective chelation. Periodic clinical, biological and ultrasound monitoring of the liver is essential to assess the efficacy, tolerance and compliance with treatment, but also to detect the appearance of hepatocarcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. There is hope in the near future with the introduction of a new copper chelator and absorption inhibitor, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), and the development of gene therapy.

3299,Copper chelators are also relatively potent zinc chelators.,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential metal that is involved in numerous physiological processes. It is required for the catalytic activity of approximately 100 enzymes and plays a role in protein and DNA synthesis, cell division, wound healing, and immunity. Zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation, loss of appetite, suppressed immune function, diabetes, etc. One of the causes of zinc deficiency can be the long-term use of metal chelators, which are mostly non-selective. Such an example is copper chelators used in rare hereditary disorders that result in too much copper in the body: Wilson's disease. The objective of this work was to study the possible capacity of D-penicillamine, trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATM) to bind zinc by means of a spectrophotometric method based on the competition between the tested compound and dithizone as indicator. Various physiologically relevant pH levels ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 were tested. compound and dithizone as indicator. Various physiologically relevant pH levels ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 were tested. All compounds showed non-selectivity for copper and the ability to bind zinc. Experiments showed that the most potent Zn chelator was trientine. It can bind about 65% Zn when mixed with zinc ions in a 1:1 molar ratio at pH 7.5. D-penicillamine and ATM showed lower chelating capacity. Surprisingly, all compounds tested showed a higher ability to form a complex with the Zn ion compared to the ability of D-penicillamine to chelate Cu ions. Clinically used copper chelators, as well as ATM, are also relatively potent zinc chelators and therefore their long-term use may result in toxicity associated with zinc deficiency.",,"Tvrdy, V.;Karlickova, J.;Hanuscinova, L.;Mladenka, P.",2018,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/intox-2018-0006,0,0,
3300,"Wilson's disease in children: the patient's perspective on diagnosis, treatment, adherence and follow-up","Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disorder that can present in childhood with a wide spectrum of presentations (hepatic, neurological and/or psychiatric). Treatment requires lifelong adherence to diet and medical treatment. The aims of the study were to assess patient-reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis and treatment. An electronic survey was distributed to 877 WD patients in the WD Association patient network. Of the 124 respondents, 34 were under 21 years old: 10 were under 10 years old and 65% were women. The majority of patients were from North America (79%) and had private insurance (65%). The diagnosis of WD was established before one year of age in two, between 1-5 years in 9, between 6-10 years in 12, and between 11-19 years in 11 cases. Presenting symptoms were primarily hepatic (56%), neurological (21%), and psychiatric (9%). 6/7 patients with neurological disease had concurrent liver involvement and in 2 cases it was reported as severe liver disease. All patients with a psychiatric presentation had liver disease. Patients currently report receiving treatment with trientine (44%), zinc salts (29%), D-penicillamine (1 patient), and combined zinc and chelation therapy (24%). Only about a third, 32%, continued with the same treatment they initially started for their WD. In 41% the medication was changed once and in another 27% the treatment was changed more than once. Regarding treatment adherence, 59% reported never missing a dose, 20% once a week, and 21% reported missing doses more than twice a week, primarily the evening dose (82%). The most common cause of nonadherence was forgetfulness (74%), although 41% reported medication side effects as the reason for missed doses. Medications were obtained at the local pharmacy (44%), by mail (29%), and at one specialty pharmacy (21%) and another (6%). Of interest, 53% reported that the pharmacy did not have the medication available on time and 38% had problems with insurance approval for their medication. The median monthly out-of-pocket expense was $25-50. Adherence to a strict low-copper diet was reported by 56%, 36% were somewhat compliant, while 8% reported not restricting the diet at all. Medical follow-up was performed only by a gastroenterologist in 26%, by a hepatologist in 21%, and by primary care physicians in 15% and a combination of specialists in 48%. To monitor therapy, blood tests were performed every 3 months in 44% and every 6 months in another 44%, and annually in 12%. The majority (68%) were seen by their MD at least every 6 months. Quality of life of affected WD patients was reported in 62%. Conclusion(s): WD diagnosed in childhood may present primarily with liver symptoms, however, neurological or psychiatric symptoms were also present at diagnosis in a minority. Medical therapies changed from initial therapy in most patients, and the reasons for this need to be explored. Medication adherence was challenging for approximately 40% of patients due to patient-related and other issues. Therefore, improving medication adherence must address patient forgetfulness, treatment side effects, and medication access.",,"Miloh, T.;Schilsky, S.;Graper, M.;Gonzalez-Peralta, R.;Schilsky, M.",2018,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000002164,0,0,
3301,Chelating Principles in Menkes and Wilson Diseases: Choosing the Right Compounds in the Right Combinations at the Right Time,"Dysregulation of copper homeostasis in humans is mainly found in two genetic diseases of copper transport, Menkes and Wilson diseases, which show symptoms of copper deficiency or overload, respectively. However, both diseases are copper storage disorders despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by copper deficiency secondary to a poor load of copper-requiring enzymes, even though there is sufficient copper in the body. Copper accumulates in nonhepatic tissues, but is deficient in the blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson's disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity secondary to copper accumulation in various organs, particularly the brain and liver, and a copper-saturated blood pool. Correcting copper dyshomeostasis in either disease is challenging, although copper depletion in Menkes disease is the most challenging. Both diseases are caused by defective export of copper from different cells, and we seek to provide new angles and guidelines to improve the treatment of these two complementary diseases. Therapy of Menkes disease with copper-histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate, or lipoic acid is discussed. In Wilson's disease, the combination of a hydrophilic chelator, eg, trientine or dimercaptosuccinate, with a brain shuttle, eg, thiomolybdate or lipoate, is discussed. New chelation principles for copper removal or supply are described. Copyright Â© 2018",,"Horn, N.;Moller, L. B.;Nurchi, V.

3302,Quantitative mapping of trace elements in liver tissue of patients with Wilson's disease determined by X-ray microfluorescence,"Objectives: of this research were to quantify copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) together with sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) in hepatocytes and connective tissue in liver sections of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) by synchrotron X-ray microfluorescence (mu-SRXRF). Second, to establish two-dimensional mappings of mu-SRXRF elements for comparison with histologically prepared sections, and third, to assess whether the elemental distributions are associated. Method(s): Archival liver tissues from twelve patients with terminal cirrhosis or fulminant WD were investigated. Mutations in ATP7B have been classified before. For control, seven archived normal liver tissues were investigated. The mu-SRXRF measurements were performed in the DORIS III storage ring at HASYLAB/DESY (Hamburg, Germany). The distribution of two-dimensional elements was compared with histologically prepared sections about 20-30 mm apart from those investigated by mu-SRXRF. Result(s): Elemental copper (Cu) could be demonstrated in all simultaneously investigated liver sections with Fe, Zn, P and S. In WD, mean Cu increased 20-fold in hepatocytes and tripled in fibrotic areas compared to controls. In the regeneration nodules, Cu was surprisingly non-homogeneous distributed. Cu concentrations measured by mu-SRXRF correlated with those measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. There were strong associations in their regional distribution between Zn and Cu or Fe and S. Furthermore, differences in Cu/S were found between hepatocytes and fibrotic areas. An increase in Fe could only be documented in hepatocytes compared to fibrotic areas. With a beam size of 15 x 15 mm, the two-dimensional distributions of these elements are morphologically comparable with the histological section at approximately 25x magnification in the light microscope. Conclusion(s): mu-SRXRF investigations are a valuable tool to quantify element concentrations in biological tissues and furthermore provide two-dimensional information of element distribution and elemental association in biological tissues, thus accelerating basic knowledge into a synopsis. with biological and clinical data. data.

3303,Altered zinc balance in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse reveals a mechanism of copper toxicity in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that affects copper transport in the body. The ATP7B mutation impairs copper transporter function, ultimately resulting in excessive copper accumulation and subsequent toxicity in both the liver and brain. However, the mechanisms of copper toxicity are not well defined. The Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model is well characterized and exhibits a liver phenotype consistent with WD. In this study, we found that untreated Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice accumulate approximately 2-fold more hepatic zinc compared to wild-type. We used specific transcriptomics and proteomics to analyze the molecular events associated with zinc and copper accumulation in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver. Altered gene expression of zinc transporters Zip5 and ZnT1 indicated a transcriptional homeostatic response, while increased copper/zinc ratios associated with elevated levels of metallothioneins 1 and 2 indicated altered Zn availability in cells. These data suggest that copper toxicity in Wilson's disease includes effects on zinc-dependent proteins. Transcriptional network analysis of RNA-seq data reveals an interconnected network of transcriptional activators with an overrepresentation of zinc-dependent and -sensitive transcription factors. In the context of previous research, these observations support the hypothesis that mechanisms of copper toxicity include disruption of intracellular zinc distribution in liver cells. The translational importance of this work lies in the oral administration of zinc supplementation in the treatment of WD, which is thought to mediate protective effects through the induction of metallothionein synthesis in the intestine. This work indicates broader impacts of altered zinc-copper balance in WD, including global transcriptional responses and altered liver zinc balance.

3304,Value of serum zinc in the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of liver disease in children with Wilson's disease,"Objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inborn error of copper metabolism with various manifestations. To date, no study of zinc (Zn), the copper antagonist, in the diagnosis and severity of WD has been conducted. Our objectives were to assess serum Zn in WD and its correlation with disease severity score (revised WD index). Although ATP7B mutation testing is highly accurate for the diagnosis of WD, it may not be available in a resource-limited setting. We proposed a disease diagnostic score (proposed WD diagnostic score) that incorporates serum Zn. Method(s): Medical records of children with WD and without WD cared for at King's College Hospital from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed for selected parameters using the proposed WD diagnostic score. Available data on serum Zn in children with WD prior to disease diagnosis and calculated severity score were statistically analyzed. The diagnostic values of the proposed WD diagnostic score were evaluated. Result(s): Serum Zn level was significantly lower in 8 WD-acute liver failure (ALF) (5.8 [4.1-8.3] mumol/L) compared to 18 WD-non-ALF ( 13.5 [6.1-22.2] mumol/L) and 9 ALF of undetermined cause (9.8 [7.0-12.1] mumol/L) (P < 0.001). Serum Zn was significantly correlated with the revised WD index (r = -0.554, P = 0.004). The proposed WD diagnostic score that included serum Zn level as one of the parameters had a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Serum Zn is a novel parameter for diagnosis and correlates with the severity of WD. The proposed WD diagnostic score is useful while awaiting ATP7B mutation analysis.

3305,Characteristics and prevalence of Wilson's disease: a 2013 observational population-based study in France,"Background and objectives: Few epidemiological studies of the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) have been conducted to date, and results vary widely depending on reports. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, outpatient care, and treatments of WD patients in France. Method(s): Among the 58 million beneficiaries of the general health plan (86% of the French population), people managed by ET in 2013 were identified by diagnosis of hospitalization in 2011-2013 or specific long-term disease status. with 100% reimbursement for specific healthcare in 2013. Data was derived from Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). Prevalence was calculated by age and sex. Result(s): In 2013, 906 prevalent cases were identified, yielding a gross prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 in men and 1.44 per 100,000 in women. This prevalence is comparable to that reported in other population-based studies in European countries and to a study that used a similar method. Almost 40% of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc acetate. Trientine, compassionate release, was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients underwent liver transplantation and 4% had already undergone liver transplantation in previous years. Fifteen percent of patients received antidepressants, a higher rate than in the general population.

3306,Low serum alkaline phosphatase activity in an adolescent,"Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone mineralization. There are currently six forms of PPH that vary in age of onset and severity: perinatal (fatal), benign perinatal, infantile, infantile, adult, and odontohypophosphatasia. Perinatal PPH is the most severe and results in death in utero, while adult PPH is milder and presents with pain and osteomalacia. PPH is caused by mutations in the ALPL gene that encodes non-tissue-specific alkaline phosphatase. One of the cardinal features of PPH is low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Recognition of PPH and differentiation from other causes of ALP activity is required for proper diagnosis and treatment. Below we present a clinical case of a 17-year-old girl who went to her annual medical examination with fatigue. Results from an outside lab showed a low concentration of cortisol during the day. She was referred to endocrinology for chronic fatigue and possible adrenal insufficiency at the request of her father. Family history was notable for hypothyroidism and chronic fatigue syndrome. His medical history highlighted the presence of anti-TPO antibodies below the diagnostic threshold and normal TSH. Of note, he was taking folic acid, vitamin B12, and multivitamins. During his initial evaluation, laboratory results were notable for low ALP activity (24 units/L; reference range 55 to 140 units/L). Low ALP activity may be due to Wilson's disease, hypophosphatasia, pernicious anemia, and severe hypothyroidism. Magnesium and zinc deficiencies were once sources of falsely low ALP measurements, but current testing formulations incorporate magnesium and zinc to circumvent this problem. Method(s): To differentiate the cause of their low serum ALP activity, new samples were collected and ALP activity was repeated. In addition, ALP-isoenzyme analysis, sequencing of the ATP7B gene, ceruloplasmin, vitamin B6 (P5P) and quantification of phosphoethanolamine in urine were performed. Result(s): Repeated analysis of ALP activity in the patient's serum was 23 units/L. Analysis of the ALP isoenzyme was not possible due to insufficient ALP activity. Initial results showed elevated vitamin B12 concentration and normal thyroid function, eliminating pernicious anemia and hypothyroidism from the differential. The patient's ceruloplasmin level was measured at 16.5 mg/dL (reference range 16 to 45 mg/dL), prompting further evaluation for Wilson's disease by sequencing the ATP7B gene, which did not reveal any deleterious mutation. The concentrations of vitamin B6 and PEA were 95 ug/L; 5-50 mug/L) and (80 mmol/mg Cr; <88 mmol/mg Cr), respectively, values compatible with hypophosphatasia. Conclusion(s): Due to the absence of bone abnormalities and growth problems, PPH was initially considered unlikely; however, the combination of low ALP activity and high vitamin B6 and PEA are consistent with a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia. Its clinical features suggest a mild form of childhood or adult PPH. This case was complicated by ceruloplasmin concentration at the lower limit of the reference interval. The diagnosis was also complicated by a later admission that the patient was receiving cortisol from her father to treat her fatigue. The family was advised to stop giving exogenous cortisol and the patient successfully tapered off without any signs of acute adrenal crisis. The family refused genetic testing for the ALPL gene.",,"Shajani-Yi, Z.;Casella, S. J.;Cervinski, M. A.",2017,,,0,0,
3307,Update on the diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease,"Purpose of review: There have been exciting advances related to Wilson's disease (WD) with respect to basic biological and clinical research. This review critically examines some of these findings and considers their implications for current thinking about WD. It is not a comprehensive review of WD as a clinical disorder.

Recent population studies raise the possibility that WD shows incomplete penetrance. Innovative detection techniques can increase verification. New strategies are being developed to diagnose and treat WD. Several disorders have been identified that could qualify as WD mimics. Summary: WD can be difficult to diagnose and treat.

3310,Dietary copper restriction in Wilson's disease review article,"Dietary copper restriction has long been considered an important aspect of the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). However, the evidence supporting this approach is limited. There are no published randomized controlled trials examining this recommendation due to the rarity of the disease and variable presentation. This review summarizes current knowledge on copper absorption and regulation in humans and its relevance to patients with WD. Studies have shown that as the level of copper in the diet increases, the proportion absorbed decreases. This observation implies that the ""high copper"" foods that WD patients are generally advised to avoid should be consumed in large quantities to markedly impact the amount absorbed. Dietary copper restriction is unlikely to significantly reduce the amount absorbed and is not only difficult to manage, but unnecessarily restricts food groups, detracting from the provision of essential substrates for improving nutritional status in a patient. nutritionally compromised group. Medical treatment of WD is effective in compliant patients, allowing for stabilization of liver disease. Based on current evidence, dietary copper restrictions in patients with stable WD who adhere to medical therapy are unnecessary with two food exceptions (shellfish and liver).

3311,The hidden face of Wilson's disease,"In summary, the classic form of Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive condition with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, and systemic manifestations. However, the diagnosis should not be excluded due to a family history consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. Recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies have shown a gap between phenotype and genetic prevalences, and also suggest that WD may still be underdiagnosed. In most WD patients, early recognition and appropriate treatment can result in resolution of symptoms and/or improved quality of life. Therefore, finding WE in patients older than 40 years or with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, unexplained bone pain, amenorrhea, recurrent spontaneous abortion, or kidney stones is of great importance. All of these symptoms can be found alone or in association with mild to disabling neurological and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. While brain lesions of the lentiform, midbrain, and dentate nuclei are classic, white matter changes and cortical lesions can also be seen: they are often asymmetric with a predilection for the frontal lobe and, when extensive, are associated with poor brain function. forecast. These lesions are primarily due to copper deposition, but may also be related to focal accumulation of other metals, such as iron and manganese. A new biological marker called 'relative exchangeable copper' (REC) facilitates diagnosis and familial detection. Patient follow-up is important to ensure treatment compliance, efficacy, and tolerability, and to detect rare complications, such as chronic copper chelation-induced copper deficiency and hepatocarcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. The treatments currently used are copper chelators and zinc salts. Therapeutic prospects are liver transplantation, new copper chelators such as tetrathiomolybdate, hepatocyte/tissue transfer, and gene therapy.

3312,Results of treatment with WTX101 in an extension and phase 2 study in Wilson's disease: Comparison of subjects with and without cirrhosis,"Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper protein-binding agent that reduces plasma ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in Wilson's disease (WD) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increasing biliary excretion coppermade. In a 24-week, single-arm, prospective Phase 2 study in WD, once-daily oral WTX101 rapidly reduced NCC, improved neurologic status, and stabilized liver function. Our objective was to compare baseline characteristics and the efficacy and safety of the 48-week extension in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic study participants. Methods: Of 28 WD subjects (18 to 64 years, 15 women) enrolled in the phase 2 study, 13 (46%) were classified as cirrhotic based on medical history (biopsy or imaging) or estimates of the ratio of AST to platelets. Of 22 subjects who continued WTX101 into the extension, 12 were cirrhotic and 10 non-cirrhotic. Key parameters monitored through 48 weeks included NCC<inf>corrected</inf> (corrected for copper binding in tripartite complexes), liver status, disability, and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The mean NCC at study entry was 3.9 muM for non-cirrhotics versus 3.2 muM for cirrhotic subjects. At week 48, the mean <inf>corrected</inf> NCC improved to 0.6 and 0.5 muM, respectively. Mean INR was initially higher and albumin lower for cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotic subjects, but improved to within normal range in both groups at week 48. For cirrhotic subjects, mean MELD score improved from 8 0.4 to 7.5 at week 48, and the mean modified Nazer score improved from 1.9 to 0.6. In non-cirrhotic subjects, scores were stable from study entry through week 48 for MELD (7.0 to 7.1) and Modified Nazer (1.0 to 0.8). UWDRS neurological and disability scores improved through week 48 regardless of cirrhosis. Eight serious adverse events possibly or probably related to WTX101 at week 48 were similarly distributed between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic subjects. Reversible ALT elevations requiring dose adjustments were observed in 5 subjects with cirrhosis and 6 without cirrhosis and led to discontinuation in 3 non-cirrhotic subjects before week 24. No ALT elevations requiring dose adjustments were observed in the extension . Conclusion: In summary, after 48 weeks, WTX101 treatment improved copper control with improved or unchanged liver function and a favorable tolerability profile, whether or not liver cirrhosis was present. Therefore, we conclude that the long-term efficacy and safety of WTX101 treatment were not influenced by the presence or absence of compensated cirrhosis in WD subjects.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F.

3313,Contribution of the French registry to the understanding of Wilson's disease,"Objective: To describe the patients of the French registry of Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WD is a rare genetic disorder caused by loss of function of the ATP7B protein, resulting in toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Due to its rarity, patient data is difficult to collect. In France, the WD National Reference Center has a network dedicated to the disease, which makes it possible to collect a maximum of data from these patients. Methods: Patients with WD residing in France are included in the registry. Data were analyzed at the time of diagnosis and at the last follow-up. The mean age and clinical forms at diagnosis and initial prescribed treatments were reported. In the last follow-up, the average duration of the disease, the evolution of clinical symptoms and the modification of treatments were examined. Results: 619 patients (49.1% male) whose diagnosis was made between 1959 and 2017 were included in the registry. The mean age at diagnosis was 18.5 Â± 11 years (min. 1; max. 64). 45.8% had a hepatic phenotype, 33.5% had a neurological presentation, and 20.7% were diagnosed in family screening. In the hepatic group, the main initial clinical symptoms were jaundice (49%), ascites (12.7%), and edema (6.9%). Among neurological patients, the main initial symptoms were tremor (52.6%), dysarthria (52%), difficulty writing (31%), dystonia (27%), gait disturbance (27%), drooling (23 %) and dysphagia (14%). Among the living patients (95.2%), the mean time between diagnosis and last follow-up was 15 +/- 13 years (min. 1, max. 58). 12.8% of neurological patients did not present symptoms again. Persistent symptoms were dysarthria (45.2%), dystonia (40.9%), writing difficulty (23.4%), tremor (21.8%), gait disturbance (19.7%), and drooling (13.3%). Between the diagnosis and the last follow-up, 42% of the patients modified their treatment. D-penicillamine prescription decreased from 79% to 37% while zinc and trientine salts increased from 9% to 32% and from 6% to 20% respectively. Bitherapy remained stable (3% vs 2%), 8.5% had a liver transplant. Side effects that led to a change in treatment were present, respectively, in 33.7% with D-penicillamine and 14.3% with zinc salts. Conclusions: This cohort is the largest in Europe and corresponds to two thirds of the patients with WD identified in France, since 906 prevalent cases were reported in this country in a recent epidemiological study1. These data are essential for a better understanding of the disease and for improving patient care.",,"Poujois, A.;Girardot, N.;Brunet, A. S.;Lachaux, A.;Woimant, F.",2018,October,,0,0,
3314,Chinese patients with Wilson's disease and treatments: example with intravenous infusion of unithiol (DMPS),"Objective: The authors performed a retrospective analysis on the effects and side effects of a series of 136 Chinese patients with Wilson's disease, treated with intravenous infusion of Unithiol (DMPS), at the University Hospital, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Shanghai Jiaotong University. Background: In Europe and America, therapeutic drugs approved for the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) mainly include penicillamine and trientine. But in China, trientine is not available because its price is especially high for patients. WD patients with allergy or intolerance to penicillamine are recommended to take dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) orally in mainland China more safely and cheaply. Leading WD specialists in China administer Unithiol (DMPS) intravenous infusion for a few weeks. The authors noted that data on the effects of DMPS infusion on blood routine (WBC,N,Hb, Plt) and liver function (ALT,AST,GGT,Alb) are insufficient. Our aim was to find effects using single center data at Shanghai University Hospital. Methods: All of these 136 patients had blood tests (WBC,N,Hb, Plt) before and after DMPS, and liver function tests (ALT,AST, GGT,Alb) before and after DMPS infusion. We did analyzes with SPSS 20.0. Results: 1. Blood routine (WBC, N, Hb, Plt) had no significant changes before and after DMPS treatment (P>0.05); 2. Liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb) had no significant changes before and after DMPS treatment (P>0.05); 3. The copper content in the urine increased 5.5 times. Conclusions: DMPS infusion therapy has an effect on the blood routine of patients with WD (WBC,N,Hb,Plt) and liver function (ALT,AST,GGT,Alb). Generally, DMPS is a safe and beneficial type of treatment for this series of WD patients. However, rare serious side effects have been reported.",,"Wang, X. P.",2018,October,,0,0,
3315,Orientation to GPi: DBS in the treatment of dystonia in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The main objective is to determine the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) directed at the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in the treatment of dystonia associated with Wilson's disease (WD). Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of GPi DBS on cognitive aspects of the disease and to assess the safety of GPi DBS in the specific context of WD. Background: WD is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease resulting from mutations affecting the copper transporter ATP7B, leading to copper accumulation in the brain and liver. Common neurological manifestations of WD include dystonia, tremor, ataxia, chorea, and parkinsonism. Of these, dystonia is one of the most difficult to manage. Although GPi DBS is a therapy option to treat dystonic symptoms, there are limited data on the use of this therapy to treat dystonia in WD. In order to assess the clinical efficacy of bilateral GPi DBS in the management of WD with dystonia, we present the case of a patient with DCS who underwent bilateral GPi DBS implantation and was assessed with the Unified Disease Assessment Scale. of Wilson (UWDRS). The patient's dystonia had not improved with zinc acetate treatment given two years before DBS surgery. Methods: Baseline UWDRS scores were assessed preoperatively and at 1 and 2 months postoperatively. Post-surgical UWDRS scores were compared to baseline scores, and analysis was performed on neurological, hepatic, and psychiatric subscales. In addition, he underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation as part of his DBS clearance process and will be re-evaluated 6 months after surgery to address our secondary outcome measure of cognition. Results: Compared to baseline UWDRS scores, their total UWDRS scores improved by 34.48% at their 1-month postoperative evaluation and 45.98% at their 2-month postoperative evaluation. The neurological subscore improved by 30.99% and 43.66%, respectively. In addition, the patient's hepatic subscale improved by 37.5% and 50%, respectively. At the 1-month postoperative visit, the patient's psychiatric subscale improved by 62.5% and remained stable at the 2-month postoperative follow-up evaluation. Conclusions: Although it demonstrated significant improvement in its neurological subscales, the improvement in its hepatic and psychiatric subscales likely represents variability in patient self-report rather than a response to DBS. In particular, their responses on the hepatic subscale likely reflect their overall improved sense of well-being rather than liver-specific improvement. The use of bilateral GPi DBS to treat WD with prominent dystonia may be effective in improving neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Further clinical investigations should be conducted to further validate the clinical efficacy of bilateral GPi DBS in patients with WD dystonia.",,"Sperry, L.;Duan, X.;Girgis, F.;Denny, K.;Farias, S.;Kahn, D.;Medici, V.;Zhang, L.;Shahlaie, K.",2018,October,,0,0,
3316,Tics in Wilson's disease and review of the literature,"Objective: We present a case with tics in a patient with Wilson's Disease (WD). Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism, leading to liver failure and neurological deficits. The most common neurological manifestations are midline cerebellar disorders (dysarthria, gait disturbances), movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor), and a host of psychiatric disorders. Tics and stereotypic movements are extremely rare in WD. This article presents a 23-year-old man with WD who exhibited stereotypical movements. We reviewed all previous cases of WD in the literature presenting with tics (five cases) and stereotypic movements. Methods: Case report and literature review. Results: A 23-year-old man was referred to our clinic due to speech disturbances, difficulty chewing, gait disturbances, and involuntary movements (Featured Figure). His mother is his father's first cousin. He has two sisters who were healthy and their blood ceruloplasmin levels were normal. He had stereotypical movements including raising his left hand and touching his forehead and bending his elbow, shaking his right hand, raising his left foot, and making circular movements that were voluntarily suppressible for a time (video). In addition, there were occasional dystonic movements of his right upper limb. Bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings were observed. Blood tests were notable for low levels of ceruloplasmin (<0.02 g/LN: 0.22-0.58 g/L). The 24-hour urine copper excretion was 102 ug/day and 55.9 ug/day (N: 3-35 ug/day), and on the fourth day after the use of trientine 300 mg twice daily, copper in urine it was 818 ug/day. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensity of the external capsule on T2/FLAIR (figure 1), and hypointensity of the lentiform nucleus, caudate nucleus, and bilateral substantia nigra on SWI (figure 2). Wilson's disease was diagnosed and treatment with trientine 300 mg three times a day was started. [figure 1] [figure 2] Conclusions: Tics are very rare in WD. There are five other cases with stereotypic movements and tics, in the literature summarized in Table. Table 1: Characteristics of the patients in the literature. [Table 1]. Stereotypic movements and tics are very rare in WD, and knowledge of this situation is important, since diagnosing and starting treatment earlier can improve the outcome.",,"Yilmaz, A.

3317,Explosive burst of seizures and new-onset cortico-subcortical lesions in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: We report a patient with neurologically stable Wilson's disease (WD) who developed repeated seizures and new-onset corticosubcortical lesions, and discuss possible causes of the changes. Background: Cortico-subcortical lesions and seizures have been reported in 5-10% and 4-8% of patients with WD, respectively, and are often seen simultaneously. However, its appearance in a stable patient under treatment has not been reported. Methods: An eight-year-old boy developed progressive dysarthria, gait imbalance, and behavioral changes over 18 months. Examination also revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings, Wilsonian faces, and generalized dystonia. He was able to walk independently and maintain high grades in school. WD was diagnosed. T2W and FLAIR brain MRIs showed symmetrical basal ganglia and thalamic lesions; no cortical lesions were observed [figure 1]. With copper chelation (penicillamine increased gradually from 125 mg/d to 1 g/d) there was significant neurological improvement over the next 10 months. At that time, although he developed recurrent seizures; initially once every few weeks but, despite antiepileptics, increases to multiple seizures per day after two months. He became bored, sleepy and unstable. Repeat brain MRI one year after the first scan showed new-onset patchy lesions in the frontal and parietal cortical-subcortical areas [figure 2]. Video EEG showed clinical and electrical seizures in the frontal lobe. Benzodiazepines and levetiracetam were given intravenously and pulsed methylprednisolone (to decrease brain swelling) and seizures were rapidly controlled. Longer-term antiepileptic treatment was also intensified. Penicillamine was maintained at 1 g/d. Cognition and balance recovered over the next several weeks. Results: Very frequent or prolonged seizures (in diseases other than WD) have been shown to lead to acute postictal cortical lesions. Such changes are thought to be the result of seizure-induced neuronal hyperexcitation, increased cellular metabolic demand, and failure of the sodium/potassium ATP pump. In WD, copper deposits in cortical gray matter increase cellular metabolic stress. We hypothesize that repeated seizures markedly increase this stress, precipitate cell injury and death, and may cause new-onset cortical-subcortical injury and even induce new seizures. Conclusions: Late-onset seizures and concurrent cortical lesions can develop in patients with stable WD undergoing treatment. Our hypothesis is that seizures may contribute to the development of lesions. If true, this would suggest that rapid seizure control may limit such corticosubcortical lesions.",,"Aggarwal, A.;Munshi, M.;Gadgil, P.;Sanghvi, D.;Bhatt, M.",2018,October,,0,0,
3318,Neurological Wilson's disease: case series on a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency,"Objective: To present two cases of Neurological Wilson's Disease with two different clinical pictures. Review important diagnoses and tests to ensure the rare condition. Emphasize the different medications that can be used in patients with Neurological Wilson's Disease. Background: Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disease that results in pathological deposition of copper in the liver, brain, cornea, kidneys, and heart muscle. Wilson's disease has a prevalence rate of 30 cases per million, which qualifies as a rare disease according to the criteria of the European Commission of Public Health. Methods: Two cases of Wilson's neurological disease were reviewed. The first with ataxia and parkinsonian symptoms and the other with a dystonic form. Results: Two cases of neurological Wilson's disease presenting with progressive movement disorder and Kayser-Fleischer rings with low serum copper levels, low ceruloplasmin levels, and increased 24-hour urine copper in a liver enzyme setting were reviewed. normal. Cranial images revealed symmetric hyperintensities of the basal ganglia on T2/FLAIR. The Eighth International Meeting on the Wilson's Disease Scoring System and the Unified Wilson's Disease Grading Scale were also helpful in diagnosing and monitoring patients. For both cases, the low-copper diet was a main treatment. Zinc supplementation was also started with a note of marked improvements in speech, tremors, and limb stiffness. The first case underwent treatment with D-penicillamine with a slow titration of the drug to avoid hematological consequences and control paradoxical neurological deterioration, while in the second case, the patient was maintained with zinc supplements due to an initial neurological state. relatively serious. Treatment still needs to be individualized as no two patients with Wilson's disease are alike. For patients with a debilitating movement disorder refractory to chelation and medical treatment, botulinum toxin injection may be offered. Screening for the patient's siblings and monitoring their serum ceruloplasmin is an important part of treatment. Conclusions: Most of the time, these cases go unnoticed and misdiagnosed due to their rarity and varied presentation. A thorough study is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. To date, there is no test except genetic methods that can be considered diagnostic on their own. Regarding management, the sooner the intervention is started, the better the prognosis for recovery. There are several treatment options and they should be tailored to each patient with neurologic Wilson's disease. Since Wilson's neurologic disease is considered copper toxicity, prompt diagnostic evaluation and early initiation of treatment is imperative.",,"Porlas, R.;De Castillo, L.;Dioquino, C.",2018,October,,0,0,
3319,"Neurologic improvement with WTX101 treatment in an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study in Wilson's disease","Objective: The objective of this study was to characterize the neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) and to describe specific neurological changes after 24 weeks of treatment with WTX101. Background: Substantial unmet needs exist regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of WD treatments. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an oral, once-daily dosed, investigational first-in-class copper protein-binding agent that rapidly improved disability and neurological status in a prospective 24-week phase 2 trial in W.D. Methods: Adult patients with WD (treatment-naÃ¯ve or <= 2 years with chelation or zinc therapy) received response-guided single doses of WTX101 (15-120 mg once daily) for 24 weeks. Changes in neurological status were characterized using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: Of the 28 patients included, 25 presented neurological manifestations. The mean baseline UWDRS Part II (disability) and III (neurological status) scores were 6.6 (SD 10.0, range 0-35) and 22.8 (SD 21.0, range 0-83), respectively. At week 24, both the mean [SD] UWDRS Part II score (4.1 [8.2]; p<0.001) and Part III score (16.6 [17.7]; p <0.0001) improved. There was a highly significant predictive relationship between Part II and Part III total scores over time (p<0.0001). The most common UWDRS Part III abnormalities at baseline were postural arm tremor (71%), dysarthria (68%), gait (61%), and Coordination and Dexterity scale items. extremities, eg reciprocating hand movements (71%), finger tapping (57%). , calligraphy (54%) and leg agility (54%). The most severely affected items were handwriting and dysarthria (mean [SD] scores 2.0 [0.8] and 1.8 [0.9], respectively). The largest mean improvements (% change) over 24 weeks were seen in handwriting (51.4%), leg agility (40.8%), arm postural tremor (39.5%) and alternative movements of the hands (35.0%). Grouping total tremor or limb dexterity and coordination items showed similar improvements (34.2% and 29.2%, respectively). WTX101 was generally well tolerated and no early drug-induced neurological worsening was observed. Conclusions: Neurological manifestations were common in this cohort of patients with WD. Improved neurological status after WTX101 treatment correlated with reduced patient-reported disability. Along with its simplified dosing and favorable safety profile, WTX101 has the potential to address unmet needs at WD.",,"Bega, D.;Bronstein, J.;Nicholl, D.;Askari, F.;Ala, A.;Ferenci, P.;Bjartmar, C.;Weiss, K.

3320,Copper deposition in oligodendroglial cells in an autopsy case of hepatolenticular degeneration,"We present a case of hepatolenticular degeneration, called Wilson's disease (WD), in a 31-year-old Japanese man with more extensive copper deposition in the liver, kidney, and brain. The liver showed severe cirrhotic changes with macronodular pseudolobe formation, but there was little difference in the immunohistochemical expression patterns of the copper transporter ATP7B between the control and the present case. In the brain, there were WD-related lesions, such as Opalski cell scattering, and changes caused by hepatic encephalopathy, including the appearance of Alzheimer's type II glia. Of note, we identified copper deposits in systemic organs, including hepatocytes, renal tubules, and in broad areas of the brain. Surprisingly, as a result of further searching, brain copper accumulation was rarely identified in neuronal cells, but was identified in Olig2-positive glial cells with double immunohistochemical staining. Together, this rare autopsy case suggests a new candidate cell affected by abnormal copper metabolism and the need for systemic screening for copper deposition in WD.

3321,Exome sequencing of an adolescent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease identifies a clinically actionable case of Wilson's disease,"Diagnostic whole exome sequencing has proven highly successful in a variety of rare diseases, particularly early-onset genetic conditions. However, in more common conditions, exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes remains the exception. Here we describe a patient initially diagnosed with a complex and common liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who was determined to have Wilson's disease (WD).

The patient presented as a 14.5-year-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin, and histological examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. He was enrolled in a large longitudinal study of NAFLD patients and was found to have WD by exome sequencing performed 4 years later. This new diagnosis, confirmed clinically by 24-h urinary copper quantification, led to a change in therapy from lifestyle counseling to targeted treatment with D-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, the probability of making the correct diagnosis and thus choosing the appropriate treatment was increased by exome sequencing and careful interpretation. This example illustrates the utility of exome sequencing for diagnosis in more common conditions not currently considered targets for genome-wide screening and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common conditions often they have rarer genetically determined syndromes that have escaped clinical detection. .

3322,Pregnancy in Wilson's disease: management and outcome,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes a toxic hepatic and neural copper accumulation. Clinical symptoms vary widely, from asymptomatic disease to acute liver failure or chronic liver disease with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Continuation of WD-specific medical therapy during pregnancy is recommended, but reports on pregnancy outcomes in WD patients are sparse. In a retrospective multicenter study, 282 pregnancies in 136 WD patients were reviewed. Age at disease onset, age at conception, and specific treatments for WD were recorded. Maternal complications during pregnancy, miscarriage rate, and birth defects were analyzed with respect to medical treatment during pregnancy. Worsening of liver function tests was evident during 16 of 282 (6%) pregnancies and occurred in undiagnosed patients as well as those under medical treatment. Liver test abnormalities resolved in all cases after delivery. Aggravation of neurological symptoms during pregnancy was rare (1%), but tended to persist after delivery. The overall miscarriage rate in the study cohort was 73 of 282 (26%). Patients with an established diagnosis of WD who received medical treatment experienced significantly fewer miscarriages than patients with undiagnosed WD (odds ratio, 2.853 [95% confidence interval, 1.634-4.982]). Birth defects occurred in 7 of 209 (3%) live births. Conclusion: Pregnancy in patients with WD on anti-copper therapy is safe. The spontaneous abortion rate in treated patients was lower than in previously untreated patients. Although the teratogenic potential of copper binders is of concern, the rate of birth defects in our cohort was low. Treatment for WD should be continued throughout pregnancy, and patients should be closely monitored for liver and neurological symptoms. (Hepatology 2018;67:1261-1269).

3323,High spatial resolution LA-ICP-MS demonstrates massive liver copper depletion in rats with Wilson's disease after methanobactin treatment,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism that leads to systemic accumulation of copper, predominantly in the liver. The therapeutic approach in patients with WD is the generation of a negative copper balance and the maintenance of copper homeostasis, currently through the use of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine (D-PA). However, in circumstances of late diagnosis, poor treatment compliance, or treatment failure, mortality is almost certain without liver transplantation. Furthermore, even after years of D-PA treatment, WD patients have high levels of copper in the liver. We recently suggested the use of the bacterial peptide Methanobactin (MB), which has excellent binding affinity for copper, as a potentially effective and patient-friendly remedy against copper damage in WD. Here we substantiate these findings considerably, by demonstrating a significant depletion of copper from liver samples of WD rats in short MB treatments of only one week. Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with a spatial resolution of up to 4 mum, we show that only small copper hot spots remain in the livers of MB-treated animals. In addition, we demonstrated in WD rat liver, seven weeks after stopping MB treatment, a lower liver copper concentration compared to untreated control animals. Therefore, MB very efficiently reduces liver copper overload with a sustained therapeutic effect. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH",,"Muller, J.

3324,Steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease.,"Objective: To determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in children (>= 12 years of age) and adult patients who had been receiving trientine dihydrochloride treatment prior to the study. Methods: Twenty patients were exposed to trientine (trientine dihydrochloride capsules supplied by Univar) after standard oral dosing as part of ongoing therapy. Plasma trientine concentration was determined pre-dose and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h post-dose. Plasma trientine concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS using a validated bioanalytical method with stable labeled trientine as the internal standard. Results: Trientine was generally fairly rapidly absorbed with a median T<inf>max</inf> of 1.49 h (range, 0.48-4.08 h). There was some variability in exposure, with a 10-fold range in C<inf>max</inf> and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly less when pharmacokinetic parameters were dose-normalized (6.7-fold range in C<inf>max</inf>/D and 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). The terminal half-life, which could be defined in 14 of the 20 patients, was broadly consistent between patients (range 2.33 to 6.99 h). There were no marked differences in pharmacokinetics between adult patients (n = 16) and children (n = 4). The range of C<inf>max</inf> was 506 to 3100 ng/mL in adults and 309 to 1940 ng/mL in children; the equivalent ranges for AUC0-t were 1240 to 17,100 ng/mL h and 1500 to 8060 ng/mL h. When pharmacokinetic parameters were normalized for the administered dose, the C<inf>max</inf>/D and AUC0-t/D for children remained within the ranges for adult patients. Conclusions: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease were very similar to those reported in healthy subjects.

3325,A case report of a successful pregnancy in a woman with Wilson's disease on zinc sulfate.,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Untreated disease usually causes subfertility and, in cases where pregnancy does occur, often results in miscarriages. However, medications such as zinc salts and penicillamine have resulted in successful pregnancy outcomes. We present a case of successful pregnancy in a woman with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate. Case: A 19-year-old woman with Wilson's disease, diagnosed a year ago, presented to us in her first pregnancy. At diagnosis, her serum ceruloplasmin was 27 Âµmol/L and 24-h urinary Cu was 2.28 Âµmol. AST and ALT were 47 U/L and 54 U/L. Penicillamine was initially started and then converted to zinc acetate 50 mg tds, 06 months before presentation. OGTT, liver profile and 2D ECO at the time of booking (17 + 1) were normal. USS of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoechoic nodules in the liver consistent with changes in Wilson's disease, without portal hypertension. Morphological examination was normal. Zinc sulfate and folic acid were continued. Her liver profile and fetal growth were normal throughout the pregnancy. She underwent a cesarean section at 37 weeks due to breech presentation. The infant (girl) weighed 3650 g and was healthy. Discussion: Zinc is increasingly used in the management of Wilson's disease due to its low side effects. Interferes with the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract; prevent serous transfer of copper to the blood. It is commonly used in pregnancy due to its very low teratogenicity. Patients with Wilson's disease on regular treatment without symptoms can usually conceive and have successful pregnancies.",,"Gunathilaka, S.;Lanerolle, S.;Jayalath, J.;Siriwardena, D.;Kodithuwakku, K.;Sumanathissa, R.;Weerakoon, W.",2018,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12874,0,0,
3326,Inborn errors of metabolism with movement disorders: defects in metal transport and neurotransmitter metabolism,"Movement disorders in the pediatric age group are largely of the hyperkinetic type. The accumulation of metal ions in the central nervous system occurs predominantly with movement disorders and eventually leads to psychomotor impairment. Abnormalities in the metabolism of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters present in individuals with a combination of abnormal movements, epilepsy, and cognitive and motor delay. A detailed medical history, a thorough examination, an appropriate diagnostic work-up with metabolic tests, neurotransmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid, and targeted genetic testing help to achieve an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This article provides an overview of movement disorders in childhood secondary to inborn errors of metal transport and neurotransmitter metabolism.

ELISA was performed to analyze the expression of vascular injury factors. Pathological changes of cerebral vessels were observed by HE staining. Immunohistochemical assays were performed to analyze the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and GRP78. Western blot was measured to analyze the expression of caspase-3, caspase-12, PERK, eIF2alpha and CHOP. Apoptosis was detected with the TUNEL assay. The expression of vascular injury factors and ICAM-1, VCAM-1 was significantly increased with WD and markedly decreased in the GanDouLing-Penicillamine group. Expression of caspase-3, caspase-12, PERK, eIF2alpha and CHOP were obviously expressed in Wilson's group, GanDouLing-Penicillamine suppressed apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our findings suggested that GanDouLing-Penicillamine ameliorated cerebrovascular injury through the PERK/eIF2alpha/CHOP ER stress pathway in the mouse model of WD.

3328,"Wilson's Disease: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver, the Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, and the Movement Disorders Society of India","Clinical practice guidelines for Wilson's disease (WD) have been published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 2008 and 2012, respectively. His attention was focused on the hepatic aspects of the disease. Recently, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition published a position paper on pediatric WD. The need was felt to harmonize guidelines for hepatic, pediatric and neurological aspects of the disease and contextualize them to resource-limited settings. Therefore, experts from national societies of India representing 3 disciplines, hepatology (Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver), pediatric hepatology (Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) and neurology (Movement Disorders Society of India ) met to develop new guidelines. A literature search on retrospective and prospective studies of WD was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed). Members voted on each recommendation, using the roll-call technique. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to determine the quality of the evidence. Questions were raised regarding the diagnostic tests, the scoring system, and its modification to a version suitable for resource-limited settings. Although 24-h urine ceruloplasmin and copper remain important, the penicillamine challenge test and serum copper have little role in the diagnostic algorithm. A new scoring system has been suggested: the modified Leipzig score with the addition of additional points for family history and serum ceruloplasmin less than 5 mg/dl has been suggested. Liver dry copper estimation and penicillamine challenge have been removed from the scoring system. Differences in the pharmacological approach to neurological and liver disease and global follow-up scales have been included. Increased bilirubin and worsening of encephalopathy are suggested as indicators that predict the need for liver transplantation, but need to be validated. The clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for comprehensive management of WD that will be of value to all specialties.

3332,Treatment Modality and Potential Outcome of Wilson's Disease in Taiwan: A Population-Based Longitudinal Study,"Background/Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, drug preference, and potential outcome of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Our goal was to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson's disease based on the data generated from this study. Methods: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores the clinical records of nearly 99% of Taiwan residents. The database used is a random sample of two million of Taiwan's 23 million NHIRD beneficiaries in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected between 2000 and 2011. Subjects with Wilson's disease were identified such as those with international disease. Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in inpatient or outpatient records. Results: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were identified. The male:female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was established mainly at 20-24 and 10-14 years, followed by 25-29 years. Fifty-four of all subjects (81.8%) started treatment with D-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation for liver failure. Conclusion: D-penicillamine remains the most popular prescription for Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a potential favorable outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study. Copyright Â© 2017",,"Tai, C. S.;Wu, J. F.;Chen, H. L.;Hsu, H.

3333,Wilson's disease combined with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and review of the literature,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder in which defective biliary excretion of copper leads to its accumulation, particularly in the liver and brain. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disorder that can manifest in any system. Rare cases have been reported with concomitant WD and SLE, unrelated to penicillamine treatment. Case presentation: We present the case of a young woman who presented with typical neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results of WD. He also had concomitant massive hematuria and proteinuria, fever, multiple positive autoimmune antibodies, hypocomplementemia, abnormal lumbar puncture findings, and evidence of Sjogren's syndrome, which are all rare in WD. Therefore, we consider the diagnosis of SLE. Gradual reduction of the steroid dose also confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion: Wilson's disease and SLE have varied clinical manifestations. Here, we report a rare case in which the two conditions existed concomitantly. In clinical practice, differential diagnosis of the two diseases is necessary for patients with hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric manifestations.

3334,Modulation of tumor chemosensitivity to platinum-based antitumor drugs by transcriptional regulation of copper homeostasis,"Platinum (Pt)-based antitumor agents have been effective in treating many human malignancies. Import, intracellular shuffling, and export of drugs, performed by the high-affinity copper (Cu) transporter (hCtr1), Cu chaperone (Ato x1), and Cu exporters (ATP7A and ATP7B), respectively, contribute cumulatively to Pt chemosensitivity drugs including cisplatin and carboplatin, but not oxaliplatin. This entire system can also handle Pt drugs through interactions between Pt and the thiol-containing amino acid residues in these proteins; the interactions are strongly influenced by cellular redox regulators such as glutathione. hCtr1 expression is induced by acute Cu deprivation, and induction is regulated by transcription factor-specific protein 1 (Sp1), which itself is also regulated by variations in Cu concentration. Copper displaces zinc (Zn) coordination in the zinc finger (ZF) domains of Sp1 and inactivates its DNA binding, while Cu deprivation enhances Sp1-DNA interactions and increases Sp1 expression, which a in turn upregulates hCtr1. Due to the shared transport system, the chemosensitivity of Pt drugs can be modulated by targeting Cu transporters. A Cu-lowering agent (trientine) has been used in combination with a Pt drug (carboplatin) in clinical studies to overcome Pt resistance. Future research should point to further development of effective Pt drug retention strategies to improve resistance. treatment efficacy. Copyright Â© 2018 by the authors.

3335,Are there genetic variants that explain the phenomenon of donor cell survival after a blood transfusion?,"Background/Case Studies: Despite the introduction of leukocyte-depleted blood components, donor leukocyte engraftment (transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM)) has been shown to remain a long-term consequence of leukocyte transfusion. red blood cells (RBC) in some groups of patients. The mechanism by which donor leukocytes survive after blood transfusion is unclear and genetic factors have been speculated as a possible reason. This study was conducted to determine if there is any association between the genetic profile of an individual and the establishment of MAT in recipients of blood transfusions. Study Design/Method: Australian trauma patients (n = 86) transfused with RBC units between 2000 and 2012, with an injury severity score greater than 15, were recruited. Twelve of these patients were found to have TMA. To date, whole exome sequencing has been performed in four patients with TAM and four patients without TAM. Alignment of exome data with the GRCh37 human genome reference sequence assembly was performed and analysis of differential genetic variations was performed. Variations unique to at least 50% of patients in each group were further investigated, focusing primarily on genes associated with immune regulation. Results/Findings: A preliminary analysis has been carried out. Many of the changes found in 2 of the 4 TMA patients were present in highly heterogeneous genes, including zinc finger protein genes and human leukocyte antigen (HLA-B and HLD-DRB1) genes. Some of the most interesting changes were found in genes with unknown function, such as the Chr4 70257329 variant ID248066. In addition, changes were found in the following genes, the BTN3A1 gene (Chr6 26405815 variant ID 340887) which has a role in the regulation and proliferation of T cells and in the CCL8 gene (chr 17 32647356 variant ID 847320), which is a chemokine that contributes to the elimination of tumor-associated leukocytes. Conclusion: Next-generation (whole exome) sequencing technologies allow the exploration of genetic variations in different population groups, which may provide clues to potential indications of the mechanisms by which TAM may become established in certain patients. This preliminary analysis provides potential genetic changes that could involve genes that have a role in T-cell regulation and proliferation. Further analysis with larger numbers of patients is expected to explore these genomic data in more detail.

3338,Wilson's disease in 2018,"Wilson's disease (WD) is characterized by the damaging accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. It is one of those rare genetic disorders that benefits from effective treatments that have drastically transformed the prognosis. The creation of a national reference center in 2005 that was recertified this year and the inclusion of patients in a national registry allowed us to advance in the knowledge and management of this rare disease. In France, the clinical prevalence is estimated at 1.5/100,000, but the genetic prevalence is higher, around 1/7,000. Incomplete penetration of the gene or the presence of modifier genes may explain the difference. The clinical spectrum of WD is broader than expected with pauci-symptomatic presentations and late onset of the disease above 40 years of age in 6% of patients. WD is suspected when ceruloplasminemia is low and 24-hour urinary copper excretion is high. Recently, a diagnostic breakthrough has been achieved with the implementation of direct dosing of toxic-free copper, called exchangeable copper. The exchangeable copper/total copper (REC) ratio > 18.5% provides the diagnosis of WD with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, exchangeable copper > 2.08 mumol/L at the time of diagnosis is indicative of the severity of extrahepatic involvement (brain and retina). Treatment of WD is based on an initial active and prolonged chelation phase (by Trolovol<sup></sup> or Trientine<sup></sup>) followed by a maintenance phase with Trientine<sup></sup> or zinc salt. The two major problems that can be found are neurological worsening during the initial phase and non-compliance with treatment during the maintenance phase. Liver transplantation is the recommended therapeutic option in WD with acute liver failure or end-stage liver cirrhosis; Its indication should be considered when rapid neurological worsening occurs despite effective chelation. Periodic clinical, biological and ultrasound monitoring of the liver is essential to assess efficacy, tolerance and adherence to treatment, but also to detect the appearance of hepatocarcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. The near future is promising with the arrival of a new chelator, tetrathiomolybdate, and with the development of gene therapy.

3340,Associations between zinc deficiency and metabolic abnormalities in patients with chronic liver disease,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element that has favorable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects. The liver primarily plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic Zn homeostasis. Therefore, the occurrence of chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis or fatty liver, results in impaired Zn metabolism and subsequently Zn deficiency. Zn deficiency causes many metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Conversely, metabolic abnormalities such as hypoalbuminemia in patients with liver cirrhosis often result in Zn deficiency. Recent studies have revealed the putative mechanisms by which Zn deficiency evokes a variety of metabolic abnormalities in chronic liver disease. Zn supplementation has shown beneficial effects on these metabolic abnormalities in experimental models and in real patients with chronic liver disease. This review summarizes the pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities resulting from Zn deficiency and the favorable effects of Zn administration in patients with chronic liver disease. Furthermore, we also highlight the interactions between Zn and other trace elements, vitamins, amino acids or hormones in such patients. Copyright Â© 2018 by the authors.

3342,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a potentially treatable inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by pathological accumulation of copper. WD is caused by mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a transmembrane copper transporter ATPase, leading to impaired copper homeostasis and copper overload in the liver, brain, and other organs. The clinical course of WD can vary in the type and severity of symptoms, but progressive liver disease is a common feature. Patients may also present with neurological disorders and psychiatric symptoms. WD is diagnosed using diagnostic algorithms that incorporate clinical symptoms and signs, measurements of copper metabolism, and ATP7B DNA analysis. Available treatments include chelation therapy and zinc salts, which reverse copper overload by different mechanisms. In addition, liver transplantation is indicated in selected cases. New agents, such as tetrathiomolybdate salts, are currently being investigated in clinical trials, and gene therapies are being tested in animal models. With early diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis is good; however, an important issue is diagnosing patients before the onset of severe symptoms. Therefore, advances in WD detection may bring earlier diagnosis and improvements for WD patients.

Surgical splenectomy is a conventional treatment for this condition; however, emotional and neurological deterioration may follow splenectomy. In recent years, partial splenic embolization (PSE) has been increasingly performed as an alternative non-surgical treatment for hypersplenism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PES compared to splenectomy in the treatment of hypersplenism in patients with WD. Methods: Fifty patients with WD with hypersplenism were randomly divided into two groups (group A and group B), each with 25 patients. Patients in groups A and B were treated with PSE and splenectomy, respectively. Data on the clinical efficacy of each procedure, adverse reactions, haematological and blood chemistry test results, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings (group A only) were collected. Results: Marked improvements in platelet and white blood cell counts were observed after PSE and splenectomy in all patients. PSE was associated with improved liver function without serious complications, and no significant changes in emotional and neurological symptoms were observed. In contrast, seven patients with WD suffered neurological deterioration after splenectomy. Conclusions: Hypersplenism in WD patients was successfully treated by PSE, which appears to be a safe and effective alternative treatment for WD-induced hypersplenism.

Liver function tests at the time of referral were; Total bilirubin: 39.26+/-15.66 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 27+/-11.76 mg/dL, AST: 513.66+/-943.6 U/L, ALT: 164.6 +/-331.8 U/L, GGT: 78.4+/-71.8 U/L, ALP: 234+/-250.6 U/L, albumin 2.8+/-0.73 g/ dL, prothrombin time 36.44+/-16.29 sec, INR 4+/-2.25. The mean creatinine value was 0.83+/-0.24mg/dl, the mean glomerular filtration rate was 77.66+/-64.84ml/min/1.73m2, and 5 patients had tubulopathy during the study. follow-up. 9 patients had low seruloplasmin levels. Seruloplasmin levels ranged from 5.9-26 mg/dL (mean 13.8+/-7.4 mg/dL). Twenty-four-hour urine copper was measured in 4 patients and the mean level was 430+/-600 Î¼g/dL. The provocation test was performed in another 4 patients and the mean urinary copper was 3155+/-2490 mugr/dL. The mean values of PELD, Child Pugh scores and new Wilson indices were 32.1+/-11.5 (range: 16-48), 11.44+/-1.66 (range: 10-15 ) and 15.44+/-1.94 (range: 12-18), respectively. There was only 1 patient older than 11 years with a MELD value of 40. Plasmapheresis was used in all patients, while D-penicillamine was also administered in 3 patients, D-penicillamine, zinc and steroids in 2; trientine, zinc and steroids to 2 patients. 4 patients died, 6 underwent liver transplantation and 2 survived spontaneously. Histopathologic examinations of explanted livers or post-mortem liver necropsy specimens were evaluated in 9 patients. 7 patients had cirrhosis, 1 chronic active hepatitis and 1 diffuse microvesicular steatosis. The mean level of tissue copper was 440+/-347 Âµg/g of dry liver tissue. 5 patients who underwent liver transplantation had living related donors and 1 patient had a deceased donor. They were followed for 9+/-3.3 years (range: 4.5-12 years) after transplantation. Conclusion: Fulminant WD is extremely fatal if liver transplantation cannot be performed. The introduction of plasmapheresis and chelation therapy can save lives in low-risk patients. Most patients have findings of cirrhosis on histopathologic examination of the liver at the time of arrival.",,"Ozcay, F.;Baris, Z.;Sezer, O. B.;Haberal, M.",2018,July,,0,0,
3346,Wilson's disease: A case report. [Portuguese],"Objectives: This report describes a rare genetic disorder, called Wilson's disease, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with symptoms that are very easily confused with other diseases. The underlying cause of the clinical manifestations is the accumulation of copper in various compartments of the human body, especially in places such as the liver, brain, kidneys and corneas, due to mutations in the ATP7B gene that encodes Cu+2 ATPase, a copper transporter protein. found in the Golgi complex of hepatocytes. Liver changes can present as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and more rarely, fulminant hepatitis. Neurological changes are variable, predominantly extrapyramidal symptoms, tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, mood swings, and psychiatric symptoms, if left untreated, progressive decline in intellectual capacity. One of the most extraordinary features of this syndrome is the great variability of phenotypic manifestations in patients with the same mutation. In the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, several biochemical parameters are analyzed: serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper concentration. In addition, an ophthalmological examination is performed with observation of Kayser-Fleischer rings. To complement and facilitate the diagnosis, genetic studies can be carried out, since the symptoms and laboratory abnormalities can often be associated with other diseases. Treatment is based on the use of copper chelating drugs. D-penicillamine is the drug of choice, despite the risk of neurological worsening in up to 50% of patients and the various side effects associated with its use. Trientine and tetrathiomolybdate are alternative drugs, the latter being chosen for people with neurological symptoms. Zinc is indicated for asymptomatic or maintenance therapy. Early treatment prevents serious complications. Case report: 14-year-old patient from Poco Fundo-MG who goes to the doctor for frequent episodes of facial paralysis, especially in the mandibular region, which present with dysphagia and dysphonia, as well as irritability and gait disturbances. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed ""symmetrical signal changes in the bilateral striatum, with signs of edema of the caudate nuclei and nuclei caudates, and atrophy of the globus pallidus."" Given the family history of Wilson's syndrome, a differential diagnosis was made by serum concentration of ceruloplasmin and serum and urinary copper, which showed typical changes of Wilson's syndrome and ocular biomicroscopy, which verified the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring. The patient had no previous liver disease, which shows that the disease does not always present as expected, and reflects the difficulty of establishing an early diagnosis that prevents the appearance of the first symptoms. All patients with Wilson syndrome require multidisciplinary care as it is a disease that can significantly affect various organs and systems.

3347,Challenges in diagnosing Wilson's disease in a resource-limited country,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, with reduced excretion of copper in the bile, resulting in an accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and kidneys. eyes. Signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, such as liver dysfunction, musculoskeletal manifestations, and neuropsychiatric features, can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases. Objective: To describe the challenges of the first Wilson's disease diagnosed at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Case: A 13-year-old boy, born of a non-consanguineous marriage, presented with anemia a year ago. He was suspected of having thalassemia and then leukemia, but subsequent diagnostic procedures came back negative. He had a history of melena due to grade 3 esophageal varices and underwent variceal ligation. Six months later, he was referred to the Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases Clinic with suspicion of inherited metabolic diseases due to involuntary movements of the limbs and dysarthria. On physical examination, the patient was severely malnourished with skin pigmentation, Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated liver transaminases, serum electrolytes, plasma glucose, and normal renal function. Brain MRI T2-weighted images revealed high signal hyperintensities in bilateral basal ganglia. Wilson's disease was one of our differential diagnoses, so we took blood and urine samples abroad. The results showed low serum ceruloplasmin and elevated urinary copper. Based on the above investigations, we diagnosed Wilson's disease and then treated him with D-penicillamine, zinc, and diazepam. Conclusion: Suspicion is required to diagnose Wilson's disease, especially in a child with liver disease and neurological manifestations. It is still a challenge to diagnose Wilson's disease due to lack of knowledge and limited diagnostic methods in our country.",,"Pratita, W.;Rachmawati, N.;Sjarif, D.

3348,Fulminant late-onset Wilson's disease without clinically diagnosed cirrhosis: a case report,"64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with jaundice of the bulbar conjunctiva and general fatigue. After admission, he developed hepatic encephalopathy and was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) position paper. Later, additional laboratory findings revealed that serum ceruloplasmin levels were reduced, urine copper levels were greatly elevated, and routine Wilson's disease (WD)-specific tests were positive, but the Kayser-Fleischer ring it was not clear. Based on the AASLD practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of WD, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with fulminant WD. Then the administration of penicillamine and zinc acetate was started; however, unfortunately the patient died of acute pneumonia on day 28 of hospitalization. At autopsy, the liver did not show a bridging pattern of fibrosis suggestive of chronic liver damage.

3349,Modelos animales de la enfermedad de Wilson,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that manifests with hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. The limitations of currently available therapy for WD (particularly in the management of neuropsychiatric disease), coupled with our limited understanding of key aspects of this disease (eg, neurological versus hepatic presentation) justify the continued need to study WD in models. suitable animals. Four animal models of WD have been established: the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, the toxic milk mouse, the Atp7b knockout mouse, and the Labrador retriever. All existing models of WD show good similarity to human hepatic WD and have been helpful in developing a better understanding of the human disease. As mammals, the mouse, rat, and canine models also benefit from high homology to the human genome. However, there are important differences between these mammalian models and human disease, notably the absence of a convincing neurological phenotype. This review will first provide an overview of our current knowledge of the orthologous genes encoding ATP7B and the closely related ATP7A protein in C. elegans, Drosophila, and the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and then summarize the key features of deficiency models.

3350,High frequency of genetic carriers of Wilson's disease in France: discrepancies with clinical prevalence,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that cause excessively high levels of copper, particularly in the liver and brain. The WD phenotype varies in its clinical presentation and intensity. The diagnosis of this metabolic disorder is important since a lifelong treatment, based on the use of copper chelators or zinc salts, is more effective if it is started early. The worldwide prevalence of WD is variable, averaging 1/30,000. In France, a recent study based on French health insurance data estimated the clinical prevalence of the disease to be around 3/200,000. Methods: To estimate the genetic prevalence of WD in France, we analyzed the ATP7B gene by next-generation sequencing of a large French cohort of indiscriminate subjects. Results: We observed a high frequency of ATP7B heterozygous carriers in France. Among the 697 subjects studied, 18 variants classified as pathogenic or probably pathogenic at the heterozygous level were found in 22 subjects (22 alleles/1394 alleles), yielding a prevalence of 0.032 or 1/31 subjects. Conclusions: This considerable and unexplained discrepancy between the frequency of heterozygous carriers and the clinical prevalence of WD can be explained by clinical variability, incomplete penetrance, and the existence of modifier genes. It suggests that the molecular analysis of ATP7B should be interpreted with caution, always in conjunction with copper assays (ceruloplasmin, relative exchangeable copper, 24-h urinary copper excretion) with particular regard to exome sequencing.

3352,A Follow-up Study of Symptomatic Pediatric Wilson's Disease from a Non-Transplant Tertiary Center,"Background and objectives: There is a paucity of data on the outcome of hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease in children. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 90 patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease (according to the Ferenci criteria) was performed. Liver outcome was classified as resolution (R = normal and asymptomatic LFT), partial resolution (P = near-normal and asymptomatic LFT), worsening or deterioration (W/D), and need for transplantation (OLT). Results: Hepatic (M) 75.5%, neurological (N) 16.6% and combined hepatic and neurological (H+N) 7.7% diseases were observed at a mean age of 9.5 years in M and 10, 9 years in N&H&N. The mean duration of symptoms was 5.2 months in H & H+N and 8.76 months in N. 14.4% had a history of consanguinity. 38.8% had a family history. Hepatic manifestations were: acute hepatitis-16%; acute liver failure-6.6%; acute on chronic liver failure-26.6%; compensated chronic liver disease (CLD C)-5.3%; decompensated cirrhosis (D CLD)-45%. 38.8% had varices &75% H and 90.9% H+N &N had KF rings. The mean ceruloplasmin was 9.89 mg% in H and 6.6 mg% in H+N &N. The initial mean 24-hour urine copper was 275 mcg/24 hours in H and 253 mcg/24 hours in H+N &N. Mean dry liver copper was 276 mcg/g. 46.1% had histological evidence of cirrhosis. The patients were treated with penicillamine D (D), Zinc (Z) or a combination of both (D+Z).

Methods: The study was carried out in the Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Gob. Stanley medical college Chennai, October 2017 to May 2018. 16 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease were included in the study. Wilson's disease was diagnosed based on the modified Leipzig score using serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urine copper, KF ring, neurological features, liver biopsy, etc. patients were analyzed based on their clinical characteristics at the time of presentation. Results: Most of the patients were in the age group of 15 to 30 years (56%). 9 patients were men and 7 women. Most of the patients presented hepatic manifestations (68.7%); jaundice was found in 63% of patients and ascites in 50% of patients. 25% of patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations and 13% of patients had both hepatic and neurological features. KF ring present in 56% of patients and all patients with neurological features had KF ring. 3 patients were asymptomatic and were diagnosed in family screening. 56% of the patients were born of consanguineous marriage. Conclusions: Consanguinity plays an important role in the high frequency of disease among the affected family. Family screening is important for early diagnosis. Hepatic manifestations were found to be more common. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat Wilson's disease with liver symptoms.

3354,A case of Wilson's disease presenting as acute pancreatitis,"Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with hepatic or neurological presentation. Wilson's disease presenting as pancreatitis was previously described in only two case reports and was attributed to copper deposition in the pancreas or gallstone formation. Here we report a case of Wilson's disease in a young adult presenting as acute pancreatitis and associated with gallstones. Case Summary: A 17-year-old female presented with upper abdominal pain, jaundice for 2 days, and nonbilious vomiting for 1 day. He had no similar episodes in the past. The patient had no significant addictions and no contributory family or perinatal history. She had normal school skills. Clinical examination revealed the presence of jaundice, pallor, and mild epigastric pain. Investigations showed hemolytic anemia, abnormal liver function test in the form of mild hyperbilirubenimia, and transaminitis. Pancreatic enzymes were markedly elevated (amylase 816U/L/lipase 906U/L). Imaging showed features of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis, calculous cholecystitis, thick liver parenchyma with splenomegaly, and mild ascites. She was treated conservatively for biliary pancreatitis and showed good improvement. The study for chronic liver disease was performed simultaneously, which revealed a low serum ceruloplasmin level (0.05 g/l), elevated 24-h urinary copper (1123.8 mcg/day), and a positive KF ring. After confirming the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, therapy with d-penicillamine and zinc was started. At follow-up, his biochemical parameters improved and his 24-hour urine copper gradually decreased to 168 mcg/day. The patient is currently completely asymptomatic and had no recurrence of pancreatitis. Conclusions: This case highlights an unusual presentation of Wilson's disease as gallstone pancreatitis. Therefore, it emphasizes the evaluation of liver diseases, especially Wilson's disease, in young individuals with jaundice and pancreatitis.",,"Tarkeshwari, R.

3355,Stroke in a young patient with Wilson's disease: the spectrum of 'rebalanced haemostasis',"Background: Coagulopathy is an essential component of liver cell failure and reflects the central role of liver function in hemostasis. Case Summary: We present a 7-year-old boy, a known case of Wilson's disease, who presented with jaundice and bloating for two weeks, with a history of repeated episodes of hypoglycemia during the last five days. He was taking penicillamine 500 mg three times a day. On examination, he was found to have chronic, decompensated liver disease with grade I hepatic encephalopathy and minimal ascites. Laboratory investigations showed thrombocytopenia (64,000/mm3), blood sugar 52 mg/dl, serum albumin; 2.5 mg/dl, Bilirubin; 17 mg/dl, serum alanine transaminase; 52 IU/L, aspartate transaminase; 153 IU/L, Alkaline phosphatase; 211IU/L, and international normalized ratio of 3.1. The patient was listed as a priority for liver transplantation with a PELD value of 32 and Na MELD of 30, the donor being his mother. However, within 7 days of inclusion, the patient developed a sudden onset of decerebrate posturing. Computed tomography of the head showed an acute frontal lobe venous infarction with midline shift. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died the next day probably due to a brain herniation, despite all intensive care measures. Conclusions: The previous case describes the dynamic state of ""hemostatic rebalancing"" in a patient with liver cirrhosis with significant coagulopathy. The risk of cerebrovascular events, especially heart attacks in cirrhosis, has not been clearly determined. The restored balance of hemostasis provided by the concomitant reduction of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors could explain arterial and venous thrombotic events, challenging the old dogma/paradox of increased bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.",,"Javid, K.;Cg, S.;Khan, J.;Ts, R.

3356,Wilson's Disease Update: Focus on WTX-101,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment is lifelong with the goal of restoring copper homeostasis. Current treatments are limited by multiple daily doses and side effects, as well as a rare but serious risk of neurological impairment when starting chelation therapy. Excess free copper is believed to be responsible for copper toxicity and early neurological deterioration. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (WTX-101) is currently one of the new emerging therapies that appears to fill an unmet need by providing a once-daily dosing option and the absence of significant unwanted effects. It also appears to have a low risk of causing early neurological deterioration. WTX-101 reduces free copper levels by forming a tight complex with copper.

3357,Mowat-Wilson syndrome presenting with seizures associated with fever,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a disorder caused by mutations or deletions of the homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene that binds to the zinc finger E-box. The diagnosis of MWS can be a challenge for neurologists, because its manifestations are diverse and the spectrum of genetic mutations is wide. Here, we describe two patients with MWS who initially displayed atypical forms of fever-triggered seizures during childhood. Both had characteristic facial features, cognitive impairment, and genitourinary abnormalities consistent with MWS. Through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a panel of epilepsy genes, we were able to identify a missense mutation (c.1965C>A) in the ZEB2 gene of one patient and a frameshift mutation (c.2348dupC ) in the other patient Fever-induced seizures may exhibit signs of MWS. MWS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever-induced seizures, especially when the patient has distinctive facial features and multiple abnormalities, including cardiac, genitourinary, and ocular defects.

Here, we present preliminary 72-week data from the ongoing extension of a phase 2 study in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: The 22 patients who completed the 24-week, open-label, single-arm study elected to continue once-daily WTX101 treatment in the extension. Assessments up to 72 weeks included disability and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), copper control, liver status, and safety. Results: At study entry, 86% of patients had varying degrees of neurological symptoms related to WD. From baseline to week 72, mean (SD) UWDRS disability score improved from 6.6 (10.0) to 1.2 (2.1) and neurological score from 22.8 (21.0) to 9.9 (10.7). The UWDRS neurological score improved by >=4 points in 12 patients, stabilized (+/-3 points) in 5 patients, and worsened by >=4 points in 2 patients. The mean (SD) level of NCC corrected for copper in tripartite complexes was 3.6 (2.1) muM at baseline and decreased to 0.5 (0.7) muM at week 72. Liver function tests and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores improved or remained unchanged at week 72. Two discontinuations were considered unrelated to WTX101 treatment. Conclusion: Once-daily treatment with WTX101 improved neurological status and disability, and controlled free copper in WD patients for 72 weeks. WTX101 was generally well tolerated, and along with its simplified dosing, WTX101 has the potential to address unmet needs in WD.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Schilsky, M.;Askari, F.;Ferenci, P.;Bronstein, J.;Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

3359,Metallothionein is elevated in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice.,"Different mutations in the copper transporter gene Atp7b are identified as the main cause of Wilson's disease. These changes result in high concentrations of copper, especially in the liver and brain, and consequently lead to dysfunction of these organs. The Atp7<sup>(-/-)</sup> mouse is an established animal model for Wilson's disease and is characterized by abnormal copper accumulation, low serum oxidase activity, and increased urine copper excretion. Metallothionein (MT) proteins are low molecular weight metal-binding proteins and are essential for zinc homeostasis, but also play a role in the regulation of other metals, eg copper. However, the molecular mechanisms of MT with respect to Atp7b remain elusive. In this study we investigated MT expression in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice and wild-type mice. Hepatic and duodenal expression of MT was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and post-translational expression was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. MT expression in liver and duodenum was significantly higher in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice than in controls. Hepatic and duodenal content of copper, iron and zinc were also studied. Compared to control, liver copper and iron content were significantly higher, while liver zinc content was significantly lower in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice. In the duodenum, the copper and zinc content of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice was significantly lower than controls. Duodenal iron content was also lower in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice, but did not reach statistical significance. The results of our study suggest that metallothionein is elevated in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice. Copyright Â© 2018, The author(s).",,"Zhang, C.

3360,Wilson's disease and copper-related disorders,"Copper is a necessary cofactor for enzymes in critical metabolic pathways. Mutations in copper metabolism genes or abnormalities in copper metabolism result in copper deficiency or excess disease. Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that encodes a copper transporter ATPase. More than 500 different WD mutations have been described in the ATP7B gene, most of which are missense mutations. Mutations in both ATP7B alleles result in abnormal copper metabolism and subsequent toxic accumulation of copper. The clinical manifestations of neurological WD include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, and choreoathetosis. Misdiagnosis and delay in treatment are clinically relevant because untreated WD progresses to liver failure or severe neurological disability and death. Treatment can prevent and cure WD. Mutations in a second closely related copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7A, cause a spectrum of copper deficiency disorders including Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy. Two important non-genetic causes of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy are copper deficiency after gastric bypass or due to excessive zinc intake, both of which can cause a myeloneuropathy similar to vitamin B12 deficiency. Copper deficiency after gastric bypass can be prevented, and identification and removal of the source of excess zinc, most commonly toothpaste, can result in recovery.

3362,CCDC115-CDG: A New Rare and Misleading Hereditary Cause of Liver Disease,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) related to defects in Golgi homeostasis constitute a growing part of these rare inherited diseases. Among them, COG-CDG, ATP6V0A2-CDG, TMEM199-CDG, and CCDC115-CDG have been shown to alter Golgi vesicular trafficking and/or lumen pH acidification. Here, we report 3 new unrelated cases of CCDC115-CDG with an emphasis on diagnostic difficulties related to strong phenotypic similarities to mitochondriopathies, Niemann-Pick C disease, and Wilson disease. In fact, while two individuals clinically presented early and severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis associated with neurological symptoms, the other ""only"" showed isolated and late severe liver involvement. Biological findings were similar to previously described patients, including hypercholesterolemia, elevated alkaline phosphatases, and defects in copper metabolism. The CDG detection and glycosylation study finally led to the molecular diagnosis of CCDC115-CDG. In addition to pointing out the importance of CDG detection in patients with severe and unexplained liver disease, these reports extend the clinical and molecular phenotypes of CCDC115-CDG. Liver involvement is especially addressed. In addition, hypotheses about the pathogenesis of liver disease and the main biological abnormalities are proposed.

3363,Cerebral accumulation of metals and neurodegenerative trastornos-causal relationship?,"Metal ions are necessary for life as cofactors for various metalloproteins, but are toxic in excess. Based on their abundance in the human body, biogenic metals can be divided into bulk (eg, calcium, magnesium), trace (eg, iron, zinc), and ultratrace (eg, manganese, zinc) elements. copper, cobalt, molybdenum). Various other metals, such as mercury or lead, can enter the brain and induce neurotoxicity. Mutations in proteins involved in metal homeostasis cause systemic metal accumulation disorders with an increase in tissue metal concentration by a factor of 5 or more. These genetic disorders can be considered model diseases of metal neurotoxicity. Mutation in the copper transporter ATP7B causes Wilson's disease, mutations in SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 cause deficiencies in the manganese transporter, and mutations in genes encoding ceruloplasmin and ferritin lead to neurodegeneration with iron accumulation in the brain. Environmental exposure to metals can also give rise to a distinct neuropathology with a severe clinical phenotype, as has been documented for mercury in Minamata Bay, Japan during 1930-1960 and for manganese during the epidemic of methcathinone abuse via the intravenously in Eastern Europe in 1990-2010. Alterations in brain homeostasis of metals, specifically iron, copper and manganese, have also been found in common sporadic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Dysregulated transition metals in the brain may contribute to neurodegeneration by mediating oxidative stress, altering enzyme functions, inducing protein aggregation, and triggering neuronal death. Remaining questions for research in the metallobiology of neurodegeneration are 1) whether exposure to low-level environmental metals can induce neurotoxicity, and 2) whether correction of impaired metal homeostasis, for example by chelation, might have an effect. neuroprotective.",,"Dusek, P.",2018,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.12449,0,0,
3364,Wilson's disease: The eponymous eminence of careful knowledge!,"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a rare autosomal disorder with a genetic abnormality identified on chromosome arm 13q and a resulting defect in the hepatic copper transporter ATPase gene (ATP7B) [1]. The central abnormality is a dysfunction of copper metabolism with abnormal biliary excretion of copper and resulting accumulation of this toxic chemical in classically identified structures (ie, cornea, liver, brain, others) [1], [2]. Several puzzling presentations can be seen making accurate diagnosis difficult; classically there is the triad of liver disease, neuropsychiatric conditions and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Kayser-Fleischer rings are copper deposits in the cornea in which ophthalmologic examination reveals a golden discoloration of Descemet's membrane in the limbic regions. The hepatic presentation can be similar to that of chronic active hepatitis, including cirrhosis [2]. Neuropsychiatric presentations may include symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, or parkinsonism with involvement of the basal ganglia. In addition, there may be incoordination, ""wing flapping,"" dystonia, and/or dystonic posturing. Dysarthria is seen in most, and dysphagia may also occur. Clinical confusion is seen in the encephalopathy seen in this condition, either due to liver failure or copper toxicity itself [5]. Diagnosis involves blood tests (including low serum ceruloplasmin) as well as urine tests (including increased urine copper levels), along with a liver biopsy (revealing increased copper deposits) and genetic testing [2], [6]. It is a fatal disease without treatment that includes early diagnosis, placing the patient on a low-copper diet (avoiding copper cooking utensils), and the use of copper chelation with D-penicillamine or trientine, as well as zinc supplementation.

3365,Long-term evaluation of urinary excretion of copper and copper not associated with ceruloplasmin in patients with Wilson's disease under medical treatment,"Objective: Urinary copper excretion rates and non-ceruloplasmin-associated copper concentrations are increased in patients with Wilson's disease. However, there is little literature describing long-term follow-up of these parameters. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study that includes data collected between 2003 and 2015 from 321 patients with Wilson's disease through chart review. The patients were receiving treatment with D-penicillamine, trientine or zinc. Rates of 24-hour urinary copper excretion, non-ceruloplasmin-associated copper, and total serum copper concentrations were determined at the start of therapy, as well as 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and >=60 months later. from the start of therapy. . For patients taking chelating agents, all parameters were measured while continuing therapy, as well as after a 48-hour dose interruption. A mathematical formula was established to predict 24-hour urinary copper excretion rates under different treatments. Results: In all treatment groups, urinary copper excretion rates decreased over time, but interindividual variation in results was high. Non-ceruloplasmin-associated copper concentrations tended to decrease over time, but with greater variation in results than was observed for urinary copper excretion rates. Conclusion: Due to their variability, urinary copper excretion rates and serum copper concentrations are less than ideal parameters for monitoring the benefit of copper-reducing therapy. Urinary copper excretion rates appear to be more suitable than non-ceruloplasmin-associated copper concentrations for this purpose. Copyright Â© 2018 SSIEM",,"Pfeiffenberger, J.;Lohse, C.

3366,Wilson's disease and lupus nephritis: coincidence or real association?,"12-year-old girl born to consanguineous parents in the third degree presented with recurrent episodes of hematuria of 8 months' duration in association with periorbital and lower limb edema of 20 days' duration. There was no jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurologic abnormality at presentation. An older brother had died after jaundice at 10 years of age. Urinalysis showed multiple dysmorphic erythrocytes without proteinuria and there was leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia (23 g/L). The C<inf>3</inf> component of complement was low and antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were strongly positive by immunofluorescence. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered, but severe hypoalbuminemia was not explained. During the study prior to the renal biopsy, an altered coagulation profile with elevated transaminases led to the evaluation of chronic liver disease that culminated in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Treatment with penicillamine and immunosuppressants was started, but there was neurological deterioration on day 30 of admission and he died due to worsening liver failure on day 41. Post-mortem liver biopsy showed cirrhosis and post-mortem kidney biopsy showed features of class II nephritis. lupic Autoimmune antibodies and autoimmune disorders have been reported in Wilson's disease, and there are anecdotal reports of an association of SLE with Wilson's disease. However, this case is unique in that lupus nephritis was the presenting feature before Wilson's disease was diagnosed. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this association require further investigation.

3367,Metabolic disposition of WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) in a rat model of Wilson's disease,"1. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational copper (Cu) protein-binding agent developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Cu transporter ATP7B and that produces toxic Cu accumulation. 2. The mass balance of a single intravenous dose of WTX101, measured as molybdenum (Mo), was evaluated over 168 h in control (Long Evans Agouti [LEA]) and Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, a WD model. . 3. In LEC rats, Mo was partially excreted (up to 45%); 29% due to renal clearance, and fecal clearance, still ongoing at 168h, accounted for 16%. In contrast, in LEA rats, Mo was almost completely excreted (~87%); 79% was eliminated via the kidney with only 7% faecal excretion. 4. In LEC rats, the ratio of fecal to renal Mo excretion was increased (4:6) compared to controls (1:9). 5. Substantially more Mo was found in LEC liver and kidney compared to LEA tissues, in line with the tissue distribution of Cu. 6. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of WTX101: in the WD model, excess Cu is removed from hepatic metallothionein and retained within the stable tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin tripartite complex, preventing tetrathiomolybdate degradation and results in less urinary elimination and greater fecal quantity. excretion than in controls.

3369,WTX101: an investigational drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder in which excess toxic copper accumulates in the liver, brain and other tissues, causing severe and life-threatening symptoms. Copper overload can be assessed as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in blood. Current therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple daily dosing. Areas Covered: This article reviews the literature on WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), a first-in-class oral copper protein-binding agent in development for the treatment of WD. Expert Opinion: In a proof-of-concept phase II trial, once-daily administration of WTX101 for 24 weeks rapidly reduced NCC levels and this was accompanied by improvement in neurological status without apparent paradoxical drug-induced worsening. initial drug, reduced disability, stable liver function, with a favorable safety profile. WTX101 directly removes excess copper from intracellular hepatic copper stores and also forms an inert tripartite complex with copper and albumin in the circulation and promotes biliary excretion of copper. These mechanisms may explain the rapid biochemical and clinical improvements observed. A Phase III trial of WTX101 is underway and results are eagerly awaited to confirm whether WTX101 can improve the treatment of this devastating disease.

3370,Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"Background and objective: Few studies of zinc monotherapy for presymptomatic Wilson's disease have focused on young children. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for these children and established benchmarks for maintenance therapy. Methods: We retrospectively and prospectively examined children younger than 10 years with presymptomatic Wilson's disease who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. Results: Twenty-four patients met the admission criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly from 1 month after the start of treatment and generally remained below 50 U/L from 1 to 8 years of treatment. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and generally remained below 75 cups/day and between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc and none became symptomatic. In patients younger than 6 years who received 50 mg/day of zinc as an initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly decreased one month after starting treatment, as were gamma-glutamyltransferase and 24-h urinary copper at 6 months . Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease. Such monotherapy proved to be highly effective and safe. Maintaining normal transaminase values (or less than 50 U/L when normalization is difficult) and a 24-h urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 Âµg/kg/day and below 75 Âµg/day is a reasonable goal. An initial dose of 50 mg/day is suitable for patients under 6 years of age.

3371,Copper dyshomeostasis in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as shown by serum and urine copper indicators,"Abnormal handling of copper is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare disorder characterized by elevated levels of plasma copper not bound to ceruloplasmin (nCp-Cu, also known as ""free"" copper). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analyses show that copper is decreased in brain but increased in serum, due to an increase in the nCp Cu component. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been carried out. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu, and Cu:Cp in 385 CE and 336 previously investigated healthy controls who were compared with 9 newly diagnosed WD patients. We then evaluated urinary copper excretion over 24 h in 24 WD patients treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) and in 35 healthy controls, and compared the results with those of AD patients who participated in a clinical trial of phase II with D-pen previously published. After adjusting for sex and age, serum nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp were higher in AD and WD than in healthy controls (both p < 0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p < 0.016). The 24-h urinary copper excretion in patients with AD (12.05 ug/day) was higher than in healthy controls (4.82 ug/day; p < 0.001). 77.8% of AD patients treated with D-pen had a 24-h urinary excretion greater than 200 ug/day, suggesting a failure of copper control. This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of copper homeostasis in AD, showing a failure to control copper and the Cu:Cp ratio as an eligible marker.

3372,Recent advances in understanding liver fibrosis: bridging basic science and individualized treatment concepts [version 1; referees: 2 approved],"Liver fibrosis is characterized by the formation and deposition of excess fibrous connective tissue, leading to progressive remodeling of the architectural tissue. Regardless of the underlying noxious trigger, tissue damage induces an inflammatory response involving the local vascular and immune systems and a systemic mobilization of endocrine and neurological mediators, ultimately leading to the activation of matrix-producing cell populations. Genetic disorders, chronic viral infection, alcohol abuse, autoimmune attacks, metabolic disorders, cholestasis, alterations in bile acid composition or concentration, venous obstruction, and parasitic infections are well-established predisposing factors. to liver fibrosis. In addition, excess fat and other lipotoxic mediators that cause endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and changes in the microbiota are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and, subsequently, with the onset and progression of liver disease. hepatic fibrosis. Multidisciplinary panels of experts have developed practice guidelines, including recommendations for preferred therapeutic approaches for a specific cause of liver disease, stage of fibrosis, or comorbidities associated with ongoing loss of liver function.

Objective: To study the efficacy of penicillamine followed by zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD for whom disease severity scores (Child, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), Nazer, and New Wilson Index (NWI) score )) and 24-hour urinary copper were compared at 3 time points: baseline at presentation, at transition from penicillamine to zinc, and at final follow-up. Results: Thirty-one patients (median age 11 [5-24] years) with symptomatic hepatic WD were studied; ten had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was changed to zinc sulfate due to financial constraints (28 patients) or due to adverse effects of penicillamine (3 patients). At presentation (baseline), six patients were in Child's class A, five in Child's B, and 17 in Child's C. 728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Child, MELD, Nazer, and NWI scores) on transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement was maintained until the end of the study period with 90% survival at 10 (2-20) years. Fifteen of 17 Child's C cirrhotic patients showed significant improvement in disease severity scores from baseline to final follow-up. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in a resource-limited setting for patients with symptomatic hepatic WD in all degrees of initial disease severity.

3374,Current and promising therapies in autosomal recessive ataxias,"Background and objective: Ataxia is clinically characterized by an unsteady and unbalanced gait. Cerebellar disorders can arise from many causes, including metabolic diseases, strokes, or genetic mutations. Genetic causes are classified according to the mode of inheritance and include autosomal dominant, X-linked, and autosomal recessive ataxias. Many years have passed since the description of Friedreich's ataxia, the most common autosomal recessive ataxia, and mutations in many other genes have now been described. Genetic mutations mostly result in the accumulation of toxic metabolites that cause Purkinje neuron loss and eventual cerebellar dysfunction. Unfortunately, recessive ataxias remain a poorly understood group of diseases and most of them are still untreatable. Conclusion: The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive clinical profile and review currently available therapies. We review the pathophysiology, neurological features, and diagnostic approach of common recessive ataxias. Emphasis is also placed on potential drugs that are currently or will soon be in clinical trials.

A punch biopsy revealed transepidermal removal of abnormal thick elastic fibers with perpendicular buds. Movat's staining outlined coarse, tortuous elastic fibers throughout the dermis in a ""bramble"" configuration. She was diagnosed with elastosis perforans serpignosa (EPS) induced by penicillamine. EPS is a rare condition that is often seen in the setting of underlying conditions such as Down or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but also after penicillamine therapy. Penicillamine, a heavy metal chelator, is used to treat various diseases, including cystinuria, Wilson's disease, and systemic sclerosis. Long-term administration has been associated with cutaneous adverse events in 20-50% of patients. Penicillamine-induced dermatoses include EPS, cutis laxa, or pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The treatment of EPS is difficult and consists of intralesional corticosteroids, retinoids, destruction and isolated cases of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The patient failed numerous injections of intralesional corticosteroids and topical retinoids. She developed significant neck strictures and wrinkles that caused physical discomfort and social anxiety. Study: The patient was treated with PDT with aminolevulinic acid (PDT-ALA) once a week for 4 treatments. 1.5 ml of 20% ALA was applied to the neck and occluded with plastic wrap for two hours. The patient was then irradiated with a narrow band LED at 630 nm at 15 cm from her neck. The exposure dose of the first treatment was 99 J/cm2 and the doses of the remaining three treatments were 130 J/cm2. Pain was evaluated during and after the procedure on a numerical scale. Clinical images were taken before and after each treatment session. Results: Clinical images revealed a significant improvement in disease activity and patient satisfaction.

Two (patients #1 and #2) were later diagnosed with phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency. Objectives: Here we present long-term follow-up of the other two children (#3 and #4), and present data on a third unrelated child (#5), all diagnosed with TMEM199 deficiency. Patients: Patients #3 and #4 are healthy Italian young adults who were investigated for hypertransaminasemia when they were 2 years old. They also had elevated total and LDL cholesterol, creatinine kinase, and alkaline phosphatase. Ceruloplasmin and serum copper were low despite a normal urinary baseline and after penicillamine excretion. Liver biopsy confirmed mild ultrasonographic fibrosis/steatosis, with slightly increased copper content; Wilson's disease and aceruloplasminemia were ruled out by appropriate tests. Transferrin glycosylation was consistent with a CDG-II. Patient #5 (Italian, now 2 years old) presented a similar picture already at the age of 1 year; he did not undergo liver biopsy. Results: Exome sequencing was identified in all compound heterozygous mutations in TMEM199 (frameshift with a premature stop and nonsense switch, respectively). Western blot analysis showed the absence of the TMEM199 protein in the fibroblasts of the patients. Conclusions: Our patients present Wilson's disease mimicking a recently described rare disease with chronically elevated transaminases, low serum ceruloplasmin and copper, caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the transmembrane protein TMEM199. The mechanisms potentially involve at least partial loss of one or both of the copper transport proteins ATP7A and ATP7B.",,"Poeta, M.;Zielinska, K.;Maccarana, M.;Mandato, C.;Ng, B.

3381,Causes of metallic taste in the mouth,"Learning Objective #1: Evaluate a patient who reports a metallic taste in her mouth Learning Objective #2: Review the differential for elevated copper in an adult CASE: Patient is a 45-year-old female years old with PMH of lumbar radiculopathy and Tourette's syndrome who presented to the physician's office complaining of 3 weeks of metallic taste in mouth. She works as a flight attendant but was denied recent international travel. She denied any new medication. Her medications included naproxen, oral contraceptives, and Botox injections for Tourette's syndrome. The patient denied the possibility of pregnancy. The patient has already been seen by a dentist, an ER doctor and an otolaryngologist for evaluation. Since the symptoms were thought to be attributed to a sinus infection, he had completed a course of azithromycin. Symptoms improved after the first two tablets, but then returned. At the ER the metallic taste was thought to be related to allergies, so she had taken loratadine with no relief. The otolaryngologist advised the patient to suck lemon drops, but these did not help either. The patient reported consuming pine nuts, which she thought might be a contributing factor. The clinical pharmacist was consulted to explore possible drug-induced causes of the metallic taste. Previous literature included a case report of a patient who experienced a metallic taste after initial injections of botulinum toxin A, but symptoms abated after subsequent injections. This was thought to be due to its effects on zinc metabolism. After checking routine labs and heavy metals (eg, lead, copper, and mercury), our patient was found to have an elevated copper level of 197 ug/dL, compared to a normal level of 72- 166ug/dL. The level of repetition was similar. BMP, CBC and TSH were normal. Wilson's disease was ruled out. It was found that the copper elevation could be contributed to the oral contraceptive, which the patient did not want to discontinue. The physician also consulted with poison control and occupational medicine to rule out occupational exposure. A recommendation was made against treating the elevated copper level. IMPACT: This case added to the literature on medication-induced metallic taste and highlights the value of a pharmacist in conducting a medication review to assess possible causes. DISCUSSION: Most taste disturbances are the result of loss of smell, which can commonly contribute to allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, or upper respiratory infection. Therefore, examination of the nose, mouth, and cranial nerves is key. Metallic taste can also be attributed to external exposure, pregnancy (which should be ruled out when appropriate), or medications that affect the metabolism of metals such as zinc or copper, the levels of which should also be assessed. In our case, botulinum injections and oral contraceptives were considered as possible causes of the patient's symptoms. A third possibility was pine nut syndrome, as the symptoms correlated with the patient's self-reported consumption of pine nuts.",,"Lu, C.;Lee, J.;Marrast, L. M.",2018,,,0,0,
3382,Unusual presentation of Wilson's disease in a pediatric patient: a case report,"Objective: To review a case of unusual primary neuropsychiatric presentation of Wilson's disease in a pediatric patient. Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that affects both children and adults and usually presents with neuropsychiatric and/or liver symptoms due to copper deposition. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical findings, including the presence of Keyser-Flescher (KF) rings and biochemical tests, and is confirmed by ATP7B gene testing. Neurologic manifestations include choreoathetosis, dystonia, dysmetria, ataxia, and dysarthria. Psychiatric manifestations include mood disorders, behavioral changes including compulsions, or disinhibition. KF rings are present in approximately 90% of patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations. Pediatric patients typically present with liver symptoms and rarely present with neuropsychiatric symptoms alone. The treatment is copper chelation (Weiss, GeneReviews, 2016). Design/Methods: NA Results: We present the case of a 10-year-old girl with subacute onset of dysarthria and ataxia with falls. Examination was notable for flat affect, disinhibition, and findings localizing to the cerebellum with smooth, jerky searches on extraocular movements without nystagmus, motor impersistence, dysmetria, ataxia, broad-based shuffling, positive Romberg and inability to perform stress marches. There was no choreoathetosis or dystonia, although the patient had dysarthria with unusual, slow, hesitant speech. Laboratory work revealed elevated transaminases. Neuroimaging was normal and ophthalmological examination did not reveal KF rings. Detection of serum and urinary ceruloplasmin and copper was worrisome for Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by ATP7B sequencing due to the presence of two pathological variants, c.3955C>T. Liver biopsy showed an elevated copper content. Oral zinc treatment was started and she had a rapid improvement in neurological symptoms, becoming ambulatory within a few weeks, with an almost complete return to baseline within a few months. Conclusions: This case presentation demonstrates a unique presentation of Wilson's disease in a child with predominantly neuropsychiatric symptoms who responded to therapy.",,"DiSano, M.;Friedman, N.;Parikh, S.",2018,,,0,0,
3383,Wilson's disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The genetic defect is caused by several mutations in the copper transport enzyme ATP7B, which is found primarily in the liver and brain. Clinical symptoms are highly variable, with any combination of hepatic and/or neurological or psychiatric manifestations. The age of onset varies from early childhood to young adulthood and can even manifest at later ages. Clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical and molecular markers. Treatment with chelating agents and zinc salts is effective when started early or even better in presymptomatic stages of the disease.

3384,Indian Childhood Cirrhosis - Down But Not Out: A Rare Case Report With A Practical Clinicopathological Diagnostic Approach,"Indian childhood cirrhosis is an entity that is believed to be on the verge of extinction. We present the case of a 13-month-old girl who consulted acutely due to jaundice, fever and a persistent increase in bilirubin. Investigations revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, anemia, blood with few schistocytes, positive direct Coombs' test, and altered prothrombin time. The viral, autoimmune and metabolic study was normal. Ultrasound showed chronic liver disease, portal hypertension, and ascites. Due to numerous confounding factors and a low index of suspicion, the diagnosis of Indian childhood cirrhosis remained elusive and was only confirmed by liver biopsy, albeit more than three weeks later, shortly after which the child died. The timing and technique of liver biopsy can have a profound impact on the final clinical outcome. Close coordination between clinical and pathology teams is essential to decipher acute presentations where the etiology is uncertain. We highlight clinical considerations, various morphological indicators, and offer a diagnostic algorithm that facilitates consideration of this disease.

3385,Identification and characterization of a novel 43 bp deletion mutation of the ATP7B gene in a Chinese patient with Wilson's disease: a case report,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation. Mutations of the ATP7B gene lead to dysfunction of the ATP7B protein, which in turn causes Wilson's disease. Case Presentation: We describe a male case of Wilson's disease diagnosed at age 10 years after routine biochemical testing showed low serum ceruloplasmin levels and Kayser-Fleischer rings in both corneas. Analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the proband, including the reported c.3517G>A mutation and a new c.532_574del mutation. The c.532_574del mutation covered a 43 bp region in exon 2 and resulted in a frameshift mutation (p.Leu178PhefsX10). By base sequence analysis, two microhomologies (TCTCA) were observed at both deletion breakpoints in the ATP7B gene. Meanwhile, the presence of some sequence motifs associated with DNA breakage near the deletion region promoted DNA strand breakage. Conclusions: In comparison, a replication-based mechanism called hairpin blockade and template switching/microhomology-mediated breakage-induced replication (FoSTeS/MMBIR) was used to explain the formation of this new deletion mutation.

3386,Clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a monocentric cohort from a liver referral center,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, leading to liver cirrhosis and neurological disorders. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low frequency of the disease. The objective is to determine the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with WD in a cohort of patients from a French liver reference center. Method: This is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with WD in a hepatic referral center (Paul-Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France). The patients were evaluated clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Liver involvement was assessed with liver biopsy and/or measurement of liver stiffness. Results: 107 patients with liver symptoms of WD were included, 54 (50.5%) women and 53 (49.5%) men, from 1974 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 15 years [extr: 1-44 years ]. Fifty-seven (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed neurological and hepatic symptoms) at admission. The mean age at diagnosis was 20.1 (+/- 10.54) years, with a difference between the age of patients with liver symptoms (17 +/- 8.6 years) and mixed (23 +/- 11.4 years) (p = 0.0081). Liver pathology study was performed on 65 patients (70%) and liver stiffness measurement was performed on 72 (67%). Seventy-three patients (68%) had cirrhosis at diagnosis of the disease. Forty-three patients (77%) had cirrhosis among patients with mixed symptoms and 30 (61%) among patients with isolated liver symptoms. Thirty-four patients (32%) received transplants, with a mean age of 27 (+/- 12.2) years. Among the patients who required liver transplantation, 18 (52%) had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) severe neurological disease, and 5 (14%) liver cancer. Chelating treatment was very predominantly D Penicillamine, in 104 (97%) patients. A change in treatment was necessary in 37 (35%) patients due to adverse events to trientine or zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke and one after liver transplant due to severe neurological symptoms. Conclusion: When presenting with WD, two thirds of the patients referred to a liver reference center had cirrhosis and one third required liver transplantation. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 77% of patients presenting with neurological symptoms of the disease.

3387,Phenotypic characteristics and liver stiffness measurement improvement during follow-up in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to hepatic and neurological failure. The objective of our study was to evaluate the phenotypic and therapeutic characteristics of patients with WD treated at a tertiary care hospital between 2012-2016. Method: A retrospective study has been carried out including 88 patients diagnosed with WD during the defined period. Results: An age at diagnosis of less than 7 years was found in 12.9% of the cases, between 7-18 years in 44.7%, 18-35 years in 37.6% and >35 years in the 7%. At the time of diagnosis, liver disease was found in 67%, liver and neurological disease in 27.3%, exclusive neurological disease in 5.7%. In patients with liver WD, 30.3% had compensated liver cirrhosis (LC) and 14.2% decompensated, 50% chronic hepatitis and 5.3% acute liver failure. In patients with hepatic and neurological insufficiency, 66.6% had compensated PC and 11% decompensated PC and 22.2% chronic hepatitis. Exclusive liver disease was found in 77.7% of children compared to only 50% of adults (p = 0.02). At the last follow-up visit, the treatment consisted of D-penicillamine 32.1%, trientine 8.3%, zinc 5.9%, D-penicillamine and zinc 41.7%, trientine and zinc 3.6%, performing a liver transplant in 8.4% of cases. In patients with liver disease, clinical improvement was established in 65.8% of patients while disease worsening in only 20.3%. In patients with liver and neurological disease, clinical improvement was found in 59.1%, while worsening in 22.7%. Patients with isolated neurological deterioration had a favorable clinical evolution in 75% of cases and the rest worsened. Liver stiffness measured in all patients with compensated liver disease at diagnosis decreased significantly after 12 months of chelation therapy (14.6 +/- 10.9 vs 8.4 +/- 5.1 kPa, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In a Romanian tertiary center, WD with hepatic phenotype is the most frequent, especially in children, and exclusive neurological disease is rare. A favorable course of the disease could be confirmed in >60% of cases in all phenotypes, with a significant decrease in liver stiffness. During the study period, liver transplantation was performed in <9% of cases due to timely diagnosis and effective chelation therapy.",,"Iacob, R.;Iacob, S.;Oana, A.;Cristina, A.

3388,Long-term results of trientine treatment in Wilson's disease: final results of a multicenter study in patients who discontinued d-penicillamine therapy.,"Background and objectives: Trientine dihydrochloride (Trientine; UNIVAR BV) is a common treatment for Wilson's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the results of efficacy, safety and tolerability of treatment based on a trientine chelator after discontinuation of d-penicillamine. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02426905. METHOD: In a multicenter retrospective cohort study, assessments were performed at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months and at the latest available follow-up after initiation of Trientine. A total of 81 patients were enrolled in the study, with 77 (95.1%) patients included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint was investigator-rated outcome of liver and neurological symptoms, additional efficacy analysis included the copper parameter, LFT. Safety reports included SAE and outage rate. Results: Of the 77 patients included in the ITT population, 16 (20.8%) patients were younger than 18 years. Reasons for discontinuation of D-penicillamine were adverse events (58 [75.3%] patients) or lack of clinical improvement (12 [15.6%] patients). On average, patients were treated with trientine for 73.3 (+/-74.76) months. The mean total dose per day during treatment was 1005.7 (+/-425.32) mg. Trientine treatment improved liver symptoms in 49.4% of patients, with 35.1% asymptomatic, 10.4% unchanged, and 5.2% worsened, while neurological symptoms remained unchanged in 36.4% of the patients, with 46.8% asymptomatic, 14.3% improved and 2.6% worsened. Overall, the median NCC concentration showed a decrease from baseline to last follow-up (n = 35 [-0.613 +/- 1.7318]). A total of 17 (22.1%) patients experienced a severe TEAE. Most of these TEAEs resolved, resolved with sequelae, or improved. Only two serious TEAEs were considered trientine-related and both resolved. Treatment with trientine was definitively discontinued due to TEAEs in 1 (1.3%) patient (anaemia). Two (2.6%) patients discontinued trientine due to inadequate hepatic response. Conclusion: Anti-copper therapy with trientine was effective after withdrawal of d-penicillamine treatment. Trientine was well tolerated and rates of symptomatic deterioration were lower than those reported in previous series. These findings support the prominent role of Trientine in the management of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Manolaki, N.;Zuin, M. G.;Kruse, C.;Dhawan, A.",2018,April,,0,0,
3389,Long-term efficacy and safety of WTX101 in Wilson's disease: data from an ongoing extension of a phase 2 study (WTX101-201),"Background and objectives: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper protein-binding agent that reduces plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by forming tripartite complexes with albumin and increases biliary excretion of copper. In a phase 2 study in Wilson's disease (WD), once-daily oral administration of WTX101 rapidly reduced corrected NCC (corrected for copper in tripartite complexes), improved disability and neurological status, and stabilized liver function for 24 weeks. We present preliminary 72-week efficacy and safety data from an ongoing Phase 2 study extension, the first prospective report on long-term disease control with WTX101 in WD. Method: The 22 patients who completed the 24-week, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study elected to continue once-daily response-guided treatment with WTX101 in the extension. Key parameters reviewed at 72 weeks included liver status, corrected NCC, neurological status, safety, and tolerability. Results: Mean ALT, international normalized ratio, albumin, and End-Stage Liver Disease Model score improved or remained stable between weeks 24 and 72. Reversible ALT elevations requiring dose adjustments were observed in 39% of patients. patients (at >=30 mg/day) at week 24, were not seen in the extension. The elevated mean (SD) NCC corrected at baseline (3.6 [2.1] muM) was reduced and controlled at week 24 (0.9 [1.0] muM) and remained controlled at week 72 ( 0.5 [0.7] muM) with continued improvements in disability and neurology. been in most patients. Low platelet (56%) and neutrophil (32%) counts were common at baseline, with similar reports throughout follow-up; low hemoglobin was rare. Most of the cytopenias were not accompanied by low NCC levels and are unlikely to reflect copper deficiency. Two subjects had evidence of neutropenia accompanied by mild anemia and low NCC potentially consistent with copper deficiency at weeks 36 and 72, respectively; both responded rapidly to dose reduction. Overall, the number of reported adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) decreased by more than 50% from weeks 1 to 24 (175 AEs and 11 SAEs) to weeks 25 to 72 (71 AEs and 4 SAEs) . Between week 24 and week 72, 89% of AEs were mild or moderate, and 89% were considered unrelated or unlikely to be related to treatment. Conclusion: Once-daily treatment of WD patients with WTX101 for up to 72 weeks provided long-term disease control, as evidenced by sustained improvements in NCC, disability, and stable neurological status and liver function, with a favorable tolerability profile.",,"Weiss, K.

The clinical presentation of patients can be ambiguous and initial misdiagnosis is not unusual. This case report describes a 31-year-old male patient who was referred to our hematology-oncology service with pancytopenia and suspected malignant liver disease. Subsequent history revealed a history of progressive muscle weakness, ataxia, and gait disturbance in the past 4 years. These findings had previously been interpreted as dissociative movement disorder and adjustment disorder and psychiatric medication had been started. Consecutive diagnostic investigations showed no evidence of underlying hematologic disease, despite proven pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Elevated liver enzymes and history of progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms increased our awareness for further diagnosis beyond hematologic malignancies. Ultimately, a slit-lamp ophthalmologic examination revealed a Kayser-Fleischer ring, leading to a suspected diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which was later confirmed by liver biopsy.

3392,Pediatric Wilson's disease: a clinical profile and treatment outcome study from a tertiary care center in North India,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. Its protein hepatic presentations include acute hepatitis, acute liver failure, acute or chronic liver failure, portal hypertension, asymptomatic hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and gallstones. Extrahepatic manifestations are also well known. There is a paucity of data on this disease and its outcome. Here we present one of the largest cohorts of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease managed at our center. Method: The clinical profile and outcome of 107 pediatric cases of Wilson's disease from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. standard cut +/- hepatic histology. Cases with at least 12 months of follow-up after chelation were analyzed. Outcome was classified as (1) Complete improvement: asymptomatic with normal synthetic function (2) Partial improvement: AST/ALT elevation and synthetic dysfunction resolving (3) Impairment: worsening synthetic function or neurological status and (4) ) Death. Result: Of the 107 patients between the ages of 3 and 18 treated at our center, the presenting symptoms were jaundice in 60 (56.07%), ascites in 49 (45.7%), cola-colored urine in 5 (4.6%), encephalopathy in 11 (10.2%), GI bleeding in 18 (16.8%), and extraGI bleeding (cutaneous, hematuria, epistaxis) in 13 (12.1%). Neurological presentation was observed in 23 (21.4%) and psychiatric presentation in 5 (4.6%) patients. Consanguinity was present in 15 (14%) while Wilson's family history (hepatic/neurological/hepatic with neuro) was observed in 44 (41.1%) patients. Clinical examination showed hepatomegaly in 88 (82.2%), splenomegaly in 69 (64.4%), ascites in 40 (37.3%), signs of cirrhosis (including clubbing, spider angioma, skin changes) in 39 (36.4%) and sunflower cataract in 4 (3.7% patient-s). Gallstones were also observed in 2 (1.8%), nephrolithiasis in 3 (2.8%), MPGN and pancreatic involvement in 1 (0.9%). Familial Wilson's disease was present in 13 (12%). 4 (3.7%) of the patients' parents (3 men and 1 woman) were subsequently diagnosed. The type of presentation was hepatic in 87 (81.3%) or hepatolenticular in 20 (18.7%). The PELD score at admission ranged from 0 to 45.8 (mean 11.36). The Child Pugh score was A in 53 (49.5%), B in 13 (12.1%) and C in 41 (38.3%) patients. The KF ring was present in 63 (72.4%) of the hepatic Wilson patients and in 18 (90%) of the hepatolenticular Wilson patients. Serum ceruloplamin was low (20 mg/dl) in 81 (93%) of the hepatic Wilsons and 19 (95%) of the hepatolenticulars. 67.2% of them had a value of 10 mg/dl. 66 (73.3%) with a value of [100 Î¼g/24 hours and 11 (12.2%) with a value of [40 Î¼g/24 hours.

3393,Renal involvement in children with Wilson's disease,"Background: Although renal involvement in Wilson's disease (WD) is rare, it is of great importance due to the associated morbidity. Initially thought to be uncommon, recent data point to a more frequent occurrence of kidney disease in children with Wilson's disease. However, very few studies have been conducted to elaborate on this finding. The objective of our study is to describe the prevalence of associated renal disorders in children with WD. Method: This is a prospective observational study including patients aged 1 to 18 years, previously diagnosed with WD, visiting the Liver clinic or admitted to the Pediatric ward of KEM Hospital, Pune. Patients with preexisting kidney disease were excluded. Demographic details, laboratory data, and sonographic findings were recorded. Standard definitions were used to define proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypercalciuria. The data was analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test and the z-score was calculated to determine the importance of the difference between the group with and without renal abnormalities. Result: Of the 70 patients enrolled in our study, 4 children were excluded for having pre-existing kidney disease. Of the 66 patients finally evaluated, 24 were girls and 42 boys. Kidney involvement usually occurred early in the course of the disease and seemed to occur more frequently in children who had WD at a younger age. 60% of WD patients with renal manifestations had a positive Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring. RTA was observed in 11 (16.6%), hematuria in 8 (12%), proteinuria (non-nephrotic) in 6 (9%), stones in 5 (7.5%), and isolated hypercalciuria in 4 (6%). patients. There were no significant differences between WD patients who had renal involvement and those who did not, with respect to hepatic, neurological, or combined hepatic and neurological presentation of WD. All children were receiving penicillamine except two who were on zinc maintenance therapy due to allergy to penicillamine. Despite an extensive literature search, we found only two pediatric studies worldwide, which highlighted the renal aspect of WD. The most commonly reported associated renal abnormalities in these studies were hematuria, proteinuria, and renal tubular acidosis with or without hypercalciuria. Conclusion: Ours is the only study from India that sheds light on the unexplored renal aspect of WD in children. Further studies are required to formulate guidelines for screening for renal abnormalities in children with WD. [Chart presented].",,"Shah, V.

Our objective was to evaluate liver stiffness by means of fibroscan in patients with hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. Method: Twenty-five patients with well-characterized WD underwent ET using FibroscanR, Echosens 402, Paris, France, software-B21). ET was performed in a right intercostal space in the respiratory position at rest. The diagnosis of WD was made according to the Leipzig criteria. All patients were under follow-up and stable on treatment with D-penicillamine +/- zinc. Fibroscan values differed between hepatic and neurological Wilson with respect to treatment and disease duration. Continuous variables between groups were compared using unpaired t-test. The value of p\0.05 was considered significant. Result: Twenty-five patients (13 with hepatic and 10 with neurological and 2 with both) underwent ET 3-4 hours after breakfast. Seventeen were men. The mean age of the patients was 20 years and the mean duration of the disease was 7.2 years. Demographic and laboratory characteristics between hepatic and neurological WD are shown in the table. There was no statistical significance between the two in all variables except fibroscan scores. FibroScan values in patients with neurological WD were 12.94+/-5.03 (range 7-22) kPa and in those with hepatic WD it was 26.7.6+/-16.06 (range 12.2-75). kKa (p-value = 0.003). Scores above 8.4 kPa are considered severe in WD. Conclusion: Patients with WD have advanced liver fibrosis in ET. Hepatic WD patients have significantly higher scores suggestive of cirrhosis, whereas neurological WD patients have scores suggestive of severe fibrosis.",,"Joseph, T.

3395,Pediatric hepatic Wilson's disease: effect of chelation therapy and outcome in a large cohort,"BACKGROUND: As there is a paucity of exclusive literature on pediatric hepatic Wilson's disease (WD), this study aimed to assess the clinical presentation and outcome of children with hepatic WD. Method: children with WD who meet > 2 of 3 criteria (serum ceruloplasmin < 20 mg/dl, positive Kayser-Fleischer ring, 24-hour urine copper > 40 jg) +/- liver histology managed in our department since January 2007 to June 2016 were analyzed. Response to chelation therapy was evaluated in patients with >9 months of adequate follow-up. They were analyzed in the following categories: a) complete improvement (asymptomatic + normalization of transaminases, serum albumin and coagulation); b) partial improvement (asymptomatic + almost normalization of transaminases + serum albumin or coagulation) c) progression (deterioration of synthetic functions, decompensation or death); d) drug toxicity. To determine the prognostic factors of the outcome, the follow-up cohort was divided into 2 groups a) Good outcome (>9 months of follow-up with total or partial improvement) and b) Poor outcome defined by worsening of liver synthetic functions, need for transplant liver disease, loss to follow-up within 9 months of starting therapy, or death. Outcome: 111 WD children aged 108 (36-180) months and global PELD score 16 (-11 to 60). Liver histology was compatible with WD in 68% (n = 27/40). Figure 1 shows the presentation and the result. Chelation was started in 84% (n = 94). 14% (n = 16) of the patients died in hospital due to advanced disease. The results of 65 with a follow-up of 43 (9-144) months were analyzed. Ninety-two percent (n = 60) received D-penicillamine monotherapy and 6% (n = 4) with additional severe neurological presentation received D-penicillamine and zinc. Among those receiving D-penicillamine monotherapy, favorable outcomes were seen in 58% (n = 35). Thirteen percent (n = 8) had drug toxicity and 12% (n = 7) required the addition of zinc due to disease progression. 6% (n = 4) started trientine. An overall favorable outcome was seen in 70% (n = 46). Table 1 shows the comparison of patients with good and poor results. In the logistic regression analysis, of all the variables, the PELD score and the Nazar score were the best predictors of outcome (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this great pediatric experience with hepatic WD, we have shown extended clinical forms with various manifestations. Most were manageable with D-penicillamine monotherapy. The addition or change of chelation is required in select situations of drug toxicity and neurological presentation. [Chart presented].",,"Sarma, M. S.;Das, M. C.;Yachha, S.

3396,"High efficacy of D-penicillamine in Wilson's disease: Contribution of nonadherence to the occurrence of ""failure"" of D-penicillamine treatment","Background: Wilson's disease (WD), a genetic disorder of copper metabolism due to the mutant enzyme ATP7B, is characterized by reduced excretion, disordered accumulation, and abnormal copper deposition causing toxic damage to various organs. D-penicillamine (D-PCA) is an effective oral chelating agent for WD. Method: N/A. Result: One patient with WD with clinical manifestations was reversed by D-PCA. However, the patient thought he was healthy enough to end the penicillamine administration. Recurrence of many manifestations of Wilson's disease was reported, but regular visits were also discontinued. In addition, his liver function after drinking alcohol began to deteriorate with symptoms such as progressive jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, migraines, lower extremity edema, and diarrhea. There were no signs of relief from Wilson's disease after taking a few pairs of Chinese herbs. Approximately 4 months after administration of D-PCA treatment, improvement in jaundice and dysphoria, reduced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and elevated ceruloplasmin, as well as stabilization in radiographic, neurological and hepatic examination were observed.

3397,Phenotypic characteristics and multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in Romanian patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to hepatic and neurological failure. The objective of our study was to evaluate the phenotypic and therapeutic characteristics of patients with WD treated at a tertiary care hospital between 2012-2016. Methods: A retrospective study has been carried out including 88 patients diagnosed with WD during the defined period. Results: An age at diagnosis of less than 7 years was found in 12.9% of the cases, between 7-18 years in 44.7%, 18-35 years in 37.6% and >35 years in the 7%. At the time of diagnosis, liver disease was found in 67%, liver and neurological disease in 27.3%, exclusive neurological disease in 5.7%. In patients with liver WD, 30.3% had compensated liver cirrhosis (LC) and 14.2% decompensated, 50% chronic hepatitis and 5.3% acute liver failure. In patients with hepatic and neurological insufficiency, 66.6% had compensated PC and 11% decompensated PC and 22.2% chronic hepatitis. Exclusive liver disease was found in 77.7% of children compared to only 50% of adults (p = 0.02). In the last control visit, the treatment consisted of D-penicillamine 32.1%, trientine 8.3%, zinc 5.9%, D-penicillamine and zinc 41.7%, trientine and zinc 3.6%, performing a transplant hepatic in 8.4% of cases. In patients with liver disease, clinical improvement was established in 65.8% of patients while disease worsening in only 20.3%. In patients with liver and neurological disease, clinical improvement was found in 59.1%, while worsening in 22.7%. Patients with isolated neurological deterioration had a favorable clinical evolution in 75% of cases and the rest worsened. Conclusions: In a Romanian tertiary center, WD with hepatic phenotype is the most frequent, especially in children, and exclusive neurological disease is rare. A favorable course of the disease could be confirmed in >60% of cases in all phenotypes. During the study period, liver transplantation was performed in <9% of cases due to timely diagnosis and effective chelation therapy.",,"Iacob, R.;Oana, A.;Iacob, S.;Anghel, D.;Constantinescu, A.;Lupescu, I.;Popescu, I.;Gheorghe, L.",2017,,,0,0,
3398,Long-term outcome of neurological Wilson's disease,"Introduction: The objective of the study was to characterize the clinical spectrum of patients treated long-term with Wilson's disease (WD) and to identify the risk factors that influence long-term outcome. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 30 WD patients who received treatment for at least 2.5 years and up to 31 years underwent detailed clinical investigation, the clinical findings score produced 7 motor and 3 non-motor subscores, as well as Lab tests. Factor analysis of these subscores and laboratory parameters was performed to detect those items with the greatest influence on outcome, ANOVA and subgroup analysis tested the influence of age, age at diagnosis onset, and duration of treatment on the result. Correlation analysis between clinical subscores and laboratory findings was performed. Results: Three factors (F1-F3) characterized the clinical outcome (F1: tremor and pathological reflexes; F2: dystonia and dysarthria; F3: cerebellar and gait abnormalities), and three factors the laboratory findings (LF1: serum level of ceruloplasmin; LF2: liver enzymes; LF3: INR). Mildly affected patients had elevated urinary copper excretion in 24 h, more affected patients had elevated liver enzymes. Six of the 7 motor subscores did not change with treatment duration, while tremor (p < 0.04), total score (p < 0.02), and especially non-motor items (p < 0.001) increased significantly with treatment. the duration of treatment. treatment. The evolution of patients with neuropsychiatric abnormalities was significantly worse (p < 0.01) compared to the rest of the patients.

3400,Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive neuropsychiatric disease characterized by excessive accumulation of copper predominantly in the liver and in different parts of the brain, namely the basal ganglia, midbrain, and pons. The genetic defect is attributed to a membrane-bound copper-binding protein gene ATP7B (on chromosome 13), which incorporates copper into ceruloplasmin. Poor removal of copper leads to its accumulation and resulting clinical features. The patient may present with tremors, dystonia, rigidity, dysarthria, jerky reflexes, and psychological and behavioral disorders. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms can occur at any time during the course of the disease. We present a case of Wilson's disease in a 26-year-old woman with psychiatric symptoms. Case Summary: A 26-year-old woman with a history of tremors, difficulty walking and speaking since the age of 10, complaining of feeling naked despite wearing clothes, sensation of touch when alone, and disturbed sleep since the age of 4 months . Mental status examination revealed tactile hallucinations, ideas of reference, anxiety, and dysphoric mood. Neurologic examination revealed tremors, upper extremity stiffness, dysarthria, incoordination, and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed prominent Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. The patient had a ceruloplasmin level of <0. 08 g/L, serum copper level of 29.3 mcg/dl, liver function test revealed alkaline phosphatase levels of 144 U/L. Brain MRI reported focal areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving bilateral thalamus, midbrain, and pons, and significant mild brain atrophy for age.

3401,Case report: Wilson's disease presenting as a psychiatric disorder,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that involves copper metabolism and is associated with abnormal liver functions. It is a genetic disorder with hepatic, neurological and psychiatric manifestations. The most common psychiatric manifestations in patients with Wilson's disease include sudden and changing mood swings, angry outbursts, personality changes, depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. when the patient initially presents with psychiatric manifestations, it may obscure the primary diagnosis and therefore the diagnosis of Wilson's disease should be considered. Here we present the case of a 22-year-old man who initially presented with behavioral abnormalities and was later diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Introduction: Dr. Wilson published the description of 12 patients who presented extrapyramidal motor disease and an autopsy that showed softening of the lentiform nucleus and cirrhosis. In the initial description of 12 cases of the illness, Dr. Wilson described the presence of schizophrenia-like psychosis in two of his cases. Psychiatric symptoms ranging from major depression, mania, antisocial behavior to psychosis were observed in cases with Wilson's disease. It is later discovered that it is a genetic disorder transmitted through an autosomal recessive manner and that it involves copper metabolism characterized by excessive deposition of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. The genetic defect was located on the short arm of chromosome 13 affecting the ATPase (ATP7B) 1 gene in the liver and presents with hepatic manifestations (40%), neurological manifestations (40%), psychiatric manifestations occurring in a ffth2. Neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders are commonly reported in patients with Wilson's disease with an estimated lifetime prevalence in the range of 20-100%. We present a case report in which the patient initially presented with psychotic features, who was found to have Wilson's disease on investigation. Case Report: A 22-year-old man born to a non-consanguineous marriage from a rural setting was taken to the psychiatric outpatient department of Government Hospital for Mental Care, Visakhapatnam with complaints of behavioral abnormalities since one week with exacerbation of symptoms since 3 days ago. Behavioral abnormalities present in the form of decreased sleep, decreased appetite, increased irritability, excessive talking, excessive socializing, loud self-talk, increased religiosity, increased patriotism, abusive and aggressive behavior. He was reportedly treated for assault with inj. Haloperidol the day before it came to us. Birth and development were normal, with no significant history. In the family history, his older brother was found dead in the field at the age of 10 and was presumed dead due to a snake bite. His younger sister died of jaundice and ascites at the age of 13. Prior to the illness, he was a happy boy, with average school performance and regular at school. General physical examination revealed normal vital parameters without jaundice, a ring around the cornea, tattoo of an Indian map with a cross inside it on the left forearm. Higher mental functions revealed impaired attention span. He is well oriented to time, place, person and his recent/immediate/remote memory was found to be intact with deficits in abstract skills. his neurological examination revealed no abnormalities in the cranial nerves, sensory system and no cerebellar signs with the motor system revealing tremors in the outstretched hand. At the time of admission, the mental status examination revealed a male of medium build, who was wearing a dirty white uniform with a tie and greeted the examiner as a teacher and greeted the examiner. He was conscious, uncooperative, did not maintain eye contact with increased psychomotor activity with decreased reaction time, talking excessively loudly. Delusions of grandiosity and second-person auditory hallucinations are present. He was found to be irritable throughout the interview. Routine blood investigations like CBC, LFT, S. Creatine, urine routine were done and found to be normal. He was provisionally diagnosed as a case of bipolar affective disorder-mania and was initially started on oral olanzapine and injectable antipsychotics. Subsequently, the patient developed tremors and difficulty speaking, so trihexyphenidyl was added and lithium carbonate was added to improve the affective symptoms. In view of the significant family history and the acute onset of behavioral abnormalities, further study of the case was performed with the differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease. On the developmental screening test, his IQ was 84 with normal and subdued intellectual functioning. Bilateral KF rings are found on slit-lamp examination. Her sonographic abdomen showed chronic hepatic parenchymal disease. Her brain MRI showed subcortical white matter hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, calcified granuloma in the right upper parietal lobe, and bilateral T2 lentiform nucleus and FLAIR hyperintensity suggestive of Wilson's disease. Urinalysis revealed elevated copper levels of 108 Âµg/24 hours and serum ceruloplasmin levels of . 46g/l. she was maintained with olanzapine 15 mg, trihexyphenidyl 6 mg, lithium carbonate 900 mg, and zinc sulfate 400 mg. Symptomatically improved with treatment, he was discharged with the same treatment. Discussion: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability of the liver to transport and store normally absorbed dietary copper, resulting in abnormal copper deposition in the basal ganglia, eyes, liver, and other tissues. . This is an unusual presentation of Wilson's disease, here the patient had a history of abnormal behavior for 7 days and significant family history and was considered a differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease and on further evaluation was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Wilson. The patient was controlled with olanzapine 15 mg and lithium carbonate 900 mg. Some authorities believe that neurological and behavioral symptoms may be relieved by the use of penylamine (mosai et al 1985). some reports declared the use of antipsychotics inadvisable. There are reports of the efficacy of clozapine in the treatment of Wilson's disease (krim et al 2001). There is a further need to study the efficacy of various antipsychotics and chelating agents in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Jetty, R. R.;Suresh Kumar, G.;Himakar, P.",2018,February,,0,0,
3402,"Copper chelation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; open-label pilot study evaluating the effects of trientine on LV mass, myocardial fibrosis, performance, and metabolism","Background: HCM is the most inherited cardiomyopathy, but to date no pharmacological intervention has been shown to alter the natural history or outcome of the disease, making it urgently necessary for a new impetus in this field. Furthermore, CMR appears to be in an ideal position to characterize many of the key pathophysiological processes that dominate the disease. Copper (Cu) is an essential cofactor for a variety of metabolic functions, and while regulation of systemic Cu metabolism is critical to human health, free Cu ions are extremely redox active and therefore potentially toxic. . We previously reported abnormal copper homeostasis in HCM patients. In summary, we found significantly elevated serum (free) copper and coeruloplasmin levels in HCM patients compared to controls. Since disturbances of Cu homeostasis can lead to hypertrophic forms of heart disease (eg, in Wilson's disease) and since we previously showed that Cu chelation in the absence of Cu deficiency is capable of reversing the LVH and organ fibrosis via a Cu-dependent mechanism in both animal and human studies, we hypothesized that Cu-selective chelation with trientine would delay disease progression in HCM. Methods: This open-label pilot study explored the clinical efficacy and tolerability of trientine dihydrochloride in a group of 20 patients with HCM, over a 6-month period. Predefined endpoints included changes in LVM, LV fibrosis markers, LV performance markers, and myocardial energy. An additional 10 HCM patients matched as controls were studied. The patients underwent a complex evaluation program during 6 visits that included separate CMR and CMR 31P-spectroscopy at the beginning and at the end of therapy. Results: Trientine did not induce significant changes in BP, HR or BMI. LV mass decreased significantly in the treatment arm compared to the control group (-4.2 gv 1.8 g, p = 0.03). A trend towards an absolute decrease in mass was observed in the treatment group (p=0.06). These changes were associated with a reduction in native T1 (1060+/-47ms vs 1049+/-42ms, p=0.06) and a reduction in CVD (30.0+/-4.5% v 29.5+/-4.0%, p=0.06 ). In addition, significant improvements in global longitudinal strain were observed using Echo and CMR feature tracking-based technologies (-16.6+/-4.3 vs. -18.9+/-4.4, p=0, 01 and -18.3+/-3.4 vs. -19.4 +/-3.4, p=0.03 respectively). Similarly, significant improvements in atrial tension parameters were observed, again with mirror changes between both imaging technologies. There was a trend towards an increase in the PCr/ATP ratio with trientine therapy (1.27+/-0.44 vs. 1.4+/-0.39), however this did not reach statistical significance. No significant increase in exercise time, VO2max, or AT was observed. Conclusion: Selective chelation of Cu with trientine in a controlled setting is safe and appears to have beneficial effects on several disease imaging biomarkers. In fact, it seems to at least slow the progression of the disease. A larger Phase 2b double-blind randomized trial is now warranted.",,"Reid, A.;Miller, C.;Cooper, G.;Schmitt, M.",2017,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx502.P4503,0,0,
3403,WTX101 in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Wilson's Disease: Final Results of a Global Prospective Phase 2 Trial,"Background and objectives: Current therapies for Wilson's disease, a disorder of copper metabolism resulting from the absence or dysfunction of the ATP7B protein, are limited by efficacy, safety, and multiple daily dosing. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-class oral copper-modulating agent that acts by increasing biliary excretion of copper and reducing serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by complexing with albumin. Methods: In a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study, 28 newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease (age 18 to 64 years, 46% male, 89% with some degree of neurologic symptoms, and about 50% with cirrhosis at baseline) received WTX101 monotherapy using a response-guided dosing regimen with individualized doses of 15-120 mg/day, primarily once daily. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to 24 weeks in copper-corrected NCC levels in tripartite tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes in treated patients (NCCc). The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and the modified Nazer score were used to monitor liver disease stability and safety. Neurological status was assessed using the Wilson's Unified Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At 24 weeks, 71% of WTX101-treated patients achieved or maintained normalized NCCc levels or experienced >=25% reduction from baseline in NCCc (p < 0.001). Mean NCCc was significantly reduced from 3.6 uM at baseline to 0.9 uM at week 24 (p < 0.0001). Mean MELD score and modified Nazer score remained stable over the course of treatment, indicating stabilization of liver function. Reversible asymptomatic elevations in liver tests, observed in 39% of patients (at a dose of 30 mg/day or more), were generally mild to moderate and normalized with dose adjustments. Compared to baseline, patients showed significant improvements at week 24 in mean UWDRS disability score (6.6 vs. 4.1, p < 0.001) and neurological symptom score (22.8 vs. to 16.6, p < 0.0001). No initial drug-induced neurological worsening was observed. Conclusions: Final data from the world's first prospective clinical trial in Wilson's disease indicate that WTX101 rapidly reduced and controlled NCCc, resulting in improved disability and neurological status, with stable liver function and a safety profile. favorable. These findings, along with its simple dosing regimen, indicate that WTX101 has the potential to address several unmet needs in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

3404,"Prediction of ""Poor Outcomes"" in Decompensated Wilson's Disease: Does the New Wilson Index Help?","Background and objectives: Recently, there have been conflicting reports on the efficacy of the New Wilson index (NWI) in predicting the outcome of Wilson's disease (WD), which is the only available prognostic model in WD. Therefore, our aim was to study the prognostic value of NWI. Methods: A retrospective evaluation of eighty cases of WD that presented in this center from 2011 to 2016 was carried out, of which 71 were acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) or decompensated CLD. They were managed with supportive care along with a combination of D Pencillamine and Zinc. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to see the association of risk factors with a poor outcome (liver transplant or death) at any time during the hospital stay. Results: Of the 71 cases of WD, 43 survived with medical management: 7 of 22 ACLF and 36 of 49 decompensated CLD. Fifteen of 22 decompensated ACLFs and 13 of 49 CLDs had a poor outcome. On univariate analysis, bilirubin (mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p=0.00), AST (mean difference 160.8, 95% CI 64.8- 256, p=0.001), INR (mean difference 1.63, 95% CI 0.93-2.33, p=0.00), NWI (mean difference 5.37, 95% CI 3, 67-7.08, p=0.00), pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) score (mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p=0.00), presentation as ACLF (odd's ratio or OR 5.93, 95% CI 1.97-17.8, p = 0.001) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade 3 or 4 (OR 48.5, 95% CI 5.8- 402.7, p = 0.00) were significantly associated with poor outcome. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association with poor outcome with HE grade 3/4 (adjusted OR 33.47, 95% CI 3.6-310.4, p = 0.002) and PELD score (adjusted OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.9-35.1, p = 0.004). After subjecting the group without HE or grade 1 or 2 HE to binary logistic analysis, the PELD score was significantly associated (adjusted OR 11.4, 95% CI 2.2-59.2, p = 0.004) with a poor result. ROC analysis revealed the best PELD score cutoff of 17.5 to identify a poor outcome with a sensitivity of 84.5% and a specificity of 69% in patients with (AUROC = 0.843) or without HE (AUROC = 0.812). Conclusions: HE grade 3/4 and elevated PELD (>17.5) are independently associated with poor outcome in decompensated WD. NWI did not show a significant independent association with poor outcome.

WD patients with neurological symptoms were divided into two groups: a treatment group (n=53) and a control group (n=50). The treatment group received anti-copper therapy with a combination of Gandouling and low-dose D-penicillamine (10 mg/kg), while the control group received conventional-dose D-penicillamine monotherapy (20 mg/kg). Clinical efficacies, adverse reactions, and the results of various hematological and biochemical investigations were recorded and statistically analyzed. Overall, 98.11% of WD patients treated with the combination therapy experienced relief of their neurological status (in parallel with a significantly improved global rating scale score or remained stable). His white blood cell and platelet counts stabilized, and his liver function improved or remained stable. The combination therapy obviously also promoted better 24-hour urine copper excretion. Only 15.09% of WD patients on combination therapy experienced adverse reactions, including neurological deterioration in one case (1.89%) and hepatic worsening in one case (1.89%), which was less common than in the control group that received the conventional dose D-penicillamine monotherapy.

Serum levels of AFP were normal, while the study for Wilson's disease was negative. Fibroscan showed F4 fibrosis. CT scan of the abdomen showed an enlarged left lobe of the liver along with an enlarged spleen. His EGD revealed varices. Therefore, a liver biopsy was performed which suggested chronic granulomatous disease with negative ZN staining for TB. PPD, urine for AFB were both negative. Serum ACE levels were elevated.

3408,A case of acquired hepatocerebral degeneration that presented as post-liver transplant hemichorea,"Acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (AHCD) is a rare but morbid neurological manifestation of decompensated cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunting leads to manganese deposition in the basal ganglia that is identified as bilateral hyperintense signals on T1-weighted MRI. The resulting neuronal loss leads to involuntary movements, cognitive dysfunction, parkinsonism, or cerebellar ataxia in the absence of hepatic encephalopathy. We present a case of AHCD with several unique features: 1) initial presentation after liver transplantation (OLT), 2) no clinical or radiographic evidence of portosystemic shunting, and 3) unilateral basal ganglia hyperintensity. A 57-year-old man with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (stage III) underwent OLT for hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis 3 years before presentation. His post-transplant course was complicated by continued alcohol abuse, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and acute cellular rejection without fibrosis 4 months earlier. Prescriptions included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, nifedipine, and insulin with questionable adherence. He had no personal or family history of movement disorders. His main complaint was a month of progressive and uncontrollable movements of the arm and leg on the right side in a writhing and non-rhythmic pattern. I was afebrile. Physical examination revealed right hemichorea with normal strength, finger-to-nose test, reflexes, and sensitivity. He had no altered mental status, asterixis, nystagmus, hepatosplenomegaly, or ascites. The laboratories stood out for total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, Alk Phos 43 U/L, AST/ALT 117/65 U/L, blood alcohol level 103 mg/dL. INR 1.0 and platelets 141 x103/mu L. Normal electrolytes, glucose and creatinine. HgbA1c 6.0%. Tacrolimus level undetectable. Serum levels of iron, zinc, lead, and manganese were normal. Brain MRI notable for T1 hyperintensities in the left globus pallidus with no evidence of hemorrhage or acute ischemia (Figure 1). He was treated with haloperidol 1 mg twice daily, which slightly suppressed hemichorea and allowed discharge with close neurological follow-up. ACHD symptoms often improve with resolution of the post-OLT portosystemic shunt. However, we present a case of new-onset ACHD in a post-transplant patient with no evidence of portosystemic shunt. This illustrates that ACHD remains a poorly understood disorder that should be considered in patients with typical findings and a history of cirrhosis, even after liver transplantation.

3409,Incidental diagnosis of Wilson's disease: A case report,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by the complete absence or dysfunction of a copper transport enzyme that is a transmembrane protein ATPase (ATP7B) encoded on chromosome 13. The incidence of this condition is seen in 1 in 30,000 people. . The presentation of WD is variable and generally involves the hepatic and neuropsychiatric systems with symptoms ranging from chronic liver disease, compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, fulminant liver failure, dystonia, choreiform movements, tremors, gait disturbances, personality changes, and cognitive disorders that are attributed to copper accumulation. We present a case in which routine imaging for a persistent problem considered chronic pelvic pain led to a diagnosis of WD. A 28-year-old woman with a history of long-standing depression and type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted with recurrent abdominopelvic pain. She had been hospitalized several times for evaluation of recurrent abdominopelvic pain. Her initial episode of abdominopelvic pain was evaluated with an abdominal CT scan that showed a pelvic abscess that was managed surgically with complete resolution and she has since had an extensive evaluation including serial imaging during subsequent hospitalizations that were negative for any acute process. During this admission, a repeat abdominal CT scan showed new-onset liver cirrhosis that was not present on previous imaging studies. The patient denied alcohol use and after a negative infectious, autoimmune, and hematologic workup, further laboratory evaluation showed low serum ceruloplasmin levels (5.4 mg/dL) and elevated 24-hour urinary copper excretion ( 302ug/d). Slit-light examination of the eyes was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings. Brain MRI showed high T2 signal intensity in the pons. He started empirically with zinc gluconate. Genetic testing showed a heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene, and a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. The patient continues to receive zinc treatment and is closely followed as an outpatient for liver transplant evaluation. The diagnosis of WD can be easily missed and, if diagnosed early, could prevent or reverse many of its serious manifestations. Despite the involvement of the hepatic and neurological system in the images, our patient was completely asymptomatic, which makes this case unique. Our case further reiterates the importance of always keeping WD in the differential when evaluating patients with cirrhosis.

3410,Deployed sailor with an acute presentation of Wilson's disease,"previously healthy 23-year-old American sailor was evacuated from Bahrain after presenting to a local hospital with dyspnea on exertion, abdominal swelling, jaundice, cognitive impairment and months of fatigue. The patient had no medical or surgical history and drank infrequently. Family history was remarkable for an uncle with schizophrenia who died of cirrhosis suspected to be alcohol-related at age 40. Examination revealed hypomimia, bradyphrenia, bradykinesia, Kayser-Fleischer rings, jaundice, new ascites, but no asterixis. Laboratory tests were noted for pancytopenia with 37K platelets, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 111, and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Alkaline phosphatase was 133, aspartate aminotransferase was 81, alanine aminotransferase was 57, and total bilirubin was 1.9. The INR at presentation was 2.8, with a calculated sodium MELD of 26. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed multiple basal ganglia signal abnormalities. Upon arrival in Germany, ceruloplasmin was low at 8 mg/dL. A 24-hour urine copper collection was performed and treatment with oral zinc was subsequently started based on a presumptive diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Subsequently, a transjugular liver biopsy was performed with an elevated HVPG of 12, which confirmed portal hypertension. Small esophageal varices were noted on EGD. Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease with a worldwide incidence of about 1 in 30,000 that results from copper accumulation and damage to affected tissues. Defects in the ATP7B gene, which encodes transmembrane copper transport within hepatocytes, play a role in the disease. Key clinical features include liver disease, neuropsychiatric changes, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. However, given the significant variability in disease presentation, both the European Association for the Study of Liver Disease (EASL) and the American Association for the Surgery of Liver Disease (AASLD) have proposed criteria to aid in diagnosis. . Using the EASL criteria, the diagnosis was made approximately 8 days earlier, although the patient ultimately met the requirements of both societies. This atypical presentation of jaundice and constitutional symptoms in a deployed Sailor highlights the potential advantages of the EASL criteria not requiring 24-hour urine copper, which is not readily accessible in a deployed setting.",,"Bridges, E.

Meta-analyses also show copper abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, a direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been carried out. An investigation of serum copper status (copper, ceruloplasmin, non-Cp Cu and Cu:Cp, adjusting for sex and age) and a 24-hour urine copper assessment of AD, WD patients (nine WD patients at baseline and 24 WD patients under treatment with D-penicillamine [D-pen])], and healthy controls (35 healthy controls).

Twenty-four-hour urine copper concentrations in 35 healthy controls were compared with those at baseline in a group of AD patients analyzed in a previous study on the effect of D-pen on disease progression. AD patients at baseline had higher 24-hour urinary copper concentrations (P < 0.001; AD 12.05 ug/day [median, interquartile range 7.85-22.50]) than healthy controls (4, 82 ug/day (median, interquartile range: 3.31-7.43]) 24-hour urine copper values greater than the cutoff of 200 cups/day were found in 87% of WD patients and 78% of AD patients Direct comparison of AD and WD patients shows copper failure affecting both diseases, but to a different degree, with Cu:Cp signifying a more severe degree in WD.",,"Rongioletti, M.;Squitti, R.;Ghidoni, R.;Ivanova, I.;Benussi, L.;Binetti, G.;Siotto, M.;Papa, F.",2018,January,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqx115.025,0,0,
3412,When medication is not to blame: abnormal liver function in a patient with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Background: Hepatotoxicity is a well-recognized side effect of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), transient elevations in transaminases are common in those receiving methotrexate and some anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha drugs. There is little evidence to guide optimal monitoring, interpretation of results, further investigation, or intervention. Objectives: We present an 8-year-old girl with polyarticular JIA and persistently elevated liver enzymes during the first eighteen months of treatment, which led to further investigation and subsequent diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of cases. Results: A diagnosis of JIA was made at 6 years. He received steroid injections into multiple joints and was started on methotrexate. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was marginally elevated at diagnosis (59 U/L, normal range <50), but normalized before starting treatment. ALT levels increased shortly after starting methotrexate and remained elevated. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was occasionally marginally elevated, but other liver functions remained normal. During the following months, elevated ALT often coincided with upper respiratory tract infections. Methotrexate was withheld on several occasions due to ALT levels >4 times the upper limit of normal. The dose was reduced and extended to biweekly, with improvement but not normalization of ALT. Infliximab was started at eight months due to ongoing active JIA. Liver function remained abnormal (high ALT 433 U/l) and at 12 months was associated with a new development of worsening abdominal pain and nausea. The decision was made to discontinue methotrexate and infliximab. Initial investigations for other causes of ongoing hepatitis and abdominal pain were normal. Control of JIA disease became increasingly difficult and he started with adalimumab. She was discussed with gastroenterology colleagues eighteen months after diagnosis. Further investigation revealed a low ceruloplasmin content and an alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) carrier phenotype. Repeat ultrasound showed mild hepatic inflammation and fatty infiltration. Serum copper level and urine penicillamine challenge were highly suggestive of Wilson's disease. Liver biopsy showed elevated copper content and steatosis. Genetic testing is still pending. He was started on zinc acetate, with normalization of liver function within weeks. Abatacept was chosen for the continuous treatment of JIA, with a reduced risk of associated liver distress that could interfere with follow-up of Wilson's disease. Conclusions: Wilson's disease is rare and transaminase abnormalities vary considerably. Early diagnosis and management, before organ damage occurs, will optimize outcome. As in this case, however, children are often asymptomatic and transaminase abnormalities are noted incidentally. Interpretation of blood results from pediatric methotrexate patients is challenging, with little evidence to guide intervention. In our case, there was no improvement in liver function with alterations in drug therapy, triggering further investigations for underlying pathology. The case illustrates the importance of considering other causes of hepatic transaminase elevations during methotrexate control and highlights the value of an early discussion with gastroenterology.",,"Bertram, L.;Kelly, I.;Raimondo, V.;Brennan, M.;Henderson, P.;Davidson, J.",2017,October,,0,0,
3413,Wilson's disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The genetic defect is caused by several mutations in the copper transport enzyme ATP7B, which is found primarily in the liver and brain. Clinical symptoms are highly variable, with any combination of hepatic and/or neurological or psychiatric manifestations. The age of onset varies from early childhood to young adulthood and can even manifest at later ages. Clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical and molecular markers. Treatment with chelating agents and zinc salts is effective when started early or even better in presymptomatic stages of the disease.

3414,"The early history of manganese and the recognition of its neurotoxicity, 1837-1936","The history of biomedical recognition of manganese neurotoxicity reflects changing technologies as well as the ontology of parkinsonism. The initial 1837 report of manganese-induced neurological injury was by John Couper, a Scottish university physician. He clarified that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach factory near Glasgow. The relatively new technology of chlorine generation using manganese accounted for the new exposure involved. At the time, this factory was the largest producer of hypochlorite bleaching powder in the world. As the 19th century progressed, technological change in steelmaking requiring higher manganese content greatly increased the demand for the metal. However, more than six decades elapsed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity emerged. Two unrelated outbreaks (both in continental Europe) were reported within weeks of each other in 1901, one by von Jaksch and the other by Embden. All cabinets were heavily exposed to dust containing manganese. On the eve of World War I, a total of 9 patients with neurological diseases caused by manganese had been reported in five separate publications from continental Europe. Meanwhile, new technology led to another source of exposure. Magnetic separation techniques allowed the extraction of zinc from mixed ores that also contained iron and manganese, leading to the exploitation of a unique source of high-manganese ores found in New Jersey. Not long after the introduction of that technology, in 1912 Casamajor reported the first cases of manganism in the US, detailing classic findings. Additional cases from the same cohort were reported a few years later, with continued exposure fueled by World War I-driven demand for manganese for use in weaponry. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity remained in flux, with considerable emphasis on shared attributes with Wilson's disease, a newly described syndrome at the time. A landmark study of primates in 1924 by Mella showed manganese-induced basal ganglia damage; Human autopsy study data in subsequent years further supported the view that manganese toxicity represented a Parkinsonian syndrome. As the 1937 centennial of Couper's first report approached, newer technologies (electric arc welding and battery manufacturing) were being linked to illnesses caused by manganese, even as mineral extraction was expanding as a global source. of exposition.

3415,"Wilson's disease in children: position paper of the Hepatology Committee of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition","Background: Clinical presentations of Wilson's disease (WD) in childhood range from asymptomatic liver disease to cirrhosis or acute liver failure, while neurological and psychiatric symptoms are rare. The basic diagnostic approach includes serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper excretion. The final diagnosis of WD can be established using a symptom-based diagnostic scoring system, biochemical tests that assess copper metabolism, and molecular analysis of mutations in the ATP7B gene. Pharmacological treatment is lifelong and aims to eliminate excess copper through chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, trientine or inhibition of intestinal absorption of copper with zinc salts. Acute liver failure often requires a liver transplant. This publication aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of WD in children. Methods: A core group of ESPGHAN members asked questions about the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of WD in children. A systematic literature search on WD was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database from 1990 to 2016, focusing on prospective and retrospective studies in children. The quality of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE system. Expert opinion supported the recommendations where the evidence was considered weak. The ESPGHAN Core Group and ESPGHAN Hepatology Committee members voted on each recommendation, using the roll-call technique.

3416,Genotype and clinical course in 2 Han Chinese brothers with Wilson's disease presenting with isolated disabling premature osteoarthritis,"Rationale: Premature osteoarthritis (POA) is a rare condition in Wilson's disease (WD). Particularly when POA is the only complaint of a WD patient for a long time, there would be a misdiagnosis or a misdiagnosis and then a delay in treatment. Patient Concerns and Diagnosis: Two Han Chinese brothers were diagnosed with WD by KF corneal rings, laboratory tests, and mutation analysis. They presented with isolated POA during the first 2 decades or more of their disease course, and were misdiagnosed during that long time. The affected older brother became disabled due to his severe osteoarthritis when he was only 38 years old. Two compound heterozygous pathogenic variants c.2790-2792del and c.2621C>T in the ATP7B gene were revealed through next-generation targeted sequencing (NGS). Lessons: Adolescent-onset POA could be the WD individual's only complaint for at least 2 decades. Prolonged delay in treatment of WD POA could lead to disability in early adulthood. Detailed physical examination, special biochemical testing, and targeted NGS genotyping should greatly reduce the delay in diagnosis in patients with atypical WD with isolated POA phenotype.

Objective Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: A 43-year-old woman with a 3-week history of severe, rapidly progressive ataxic gait, paraparesis, dysarthria, admitted to our Neurology service. Clinical examination revealed marked anxiety, finger dystonia, bilateral pyramidal signs, and clonus. Within two weeks, the patient became bedridden due to severe gait apraxia. Blood serum transaminases were normal, ceruloplasmin levels were low, and urine copper levels were high. Brain MRI showed symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the pons, thalamus, and putamen with a second MRI two weeks later, which also showed bilateral caudate nucleus involvement and supported the clinical deterioration observed in the first two weeks after from the register. Kayser-Fleischer rings were present on ophthalmologic examination. As the abdominal computed tomography showed a normal hepatic structure, a liver fibroscan was performed, which showed progressive cirrhosis. Genetic studies showed a Glu1064Ala mutation in the ATP7B gene, consistent with Wilson's disease. Penicillamine treatment was started with a slow and gradual improvement of the patient's neurological status.

3418,Copper and zinc homeostasis: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,"Maintenance of metal homeostasis is crucial for many different enzyme activities and, in turn, for cell function and survival. In addition, the cells show mechanisms of detoxification and protection against the toxic accumulation of metals. Disruption of any of these processes normally leads to cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death. In recent years, loss of metal regulation has been described as a common pathological feature in many human neurodegenerative diseases. However, in most cases, it is still a matter of debate whether such dyshomeostasis is a primary or secondary downstream defect. In this review, we will summarize and critically appraise the contribution of Drosophila to modeling human diseases that involve altered metal metabolism or in which metal dyshomeostasis influences their pathobiology. As a prerequisite for using Drosophila as a model, we will recapitulate and describe the main features of core genes involved in copper and zinc metabolism that are conserved between mammals and flies. Drosophila presents some unique strengths to be at the forefront of neurobiological studies. The number of genetic tools, the ability to easily test genetic interactions in vivo, and the feasibility of unbiased genetic and pharmacological analysis are some of the most notable advantages of the fruit fly. In this work we will pay special attention to the most important results reported in fly models to reveal the role of copper and zinc in cell degeneration and their influence on the development and progression of human neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's or Menkes' ataxia, and Wilson's diseases. Finally, we show how these studies carried out in the fly have allowed us to delve into the influence of copper and zinc on the molecular and cellular causes and consequences that underlie these diseases, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic strategies, which had not yet been studied. . described in other model systems.

3419,Wilson's disease in a cohort of pediatric patients in Slovakia. [Slovak],"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare metabolic and genetically conditioned disease. Patients may remain asymptomatic for variable periods of time or the disease may present with nonspecific symptoms to organ-specific disability. The diagnosis of the disease is confirmed by an analysis of the clinical signs and the results of specific tests. If diagnosed early, the disease is treatable, with chelation therapy the main approach. Patients with acute liver failure are indicated for liver transplantation. Material and Methods: The authors retrospectively evaluated a group of 17 patients with WD diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. Results: WD was confirmed in 17 patients aged between 3 and 18 years in the 1st Department of Pediatrics at the Faculty of Medicine and Children's University Hospital in Bratislava in the period from 2000 to 2015. The most common presentation of WD was in the liver (n = 13 patients; 77%). In two patients, WD manifested with acute liver failure in adolescence. A long-term increase in aminotransferase activity was detected in nine patients. In two patients we identified WD in the cirrhosis stage. Neurological symptoms were observed in two patients. The most commonly confirmed genetic mutation in the Central European region, H1069Q, was confirmed in 6 homozygous carriers, while 10 patients were compound heterozygous carriers. In one patient, the pathological mutation could not be confirmed even by extensive genetic testing. Three patients from the cohort of 17 children underwent liver transplantation, 2 asymptomatic children are treated with zinc, 11 patients are treated with penicillamine and 1 patient with trientine dihydrochloride. Conclusion: WD is a rare childhood disease. Its most common manifestation is the hepatic form in the second decade. Establishing the diagnosis can be very difficult. There is no single highly sensitive and specific parameter that clearly indicates the diagnosis. The serum ceruloplasmin level is the primary screening test. Plasma copper levels and renal copper excretion serve as ancillary tests. The gold standard to confirm the diagnosis is to determine liver copper concentrations in dry liver tissue. Genetic testing is beneficial in confirming the diagnosis of WD, particularly in first degree relatives, asymptomatic individuals. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent disease progression. If left untreated, the disease is fatal.",,"Kosnacova, J.;Podracka, L.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14735/amgh2017476,0,0,

Here, we discuss a patient with hyperammonaemic encephalopathy secondary to RYGB surgery and small bowel resection, complicated by new-onset seizures. Methods: A 45-year-old woman who underwent RYGB surgery 15 years ago and small bowel resection 5 years earlier presented with decreased oral intake, weakness, and altered mental status (AMS). She had a 7-month history of frequent admissions for elevated ammonia and AMS, previously treated with rifaximin and lactulose. She was intubated for airway protection. On admission to our ICU, he was found to have an elevated ammonia level of 140 mcg/dL (15-45 mcg/dL) after receiving rifaximin and lactulose for 4 days. Transaminase levels were normal. It was noted that the previous liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis, but showed changes in the fatty liver. A previous study for Wilson's disease was negative. These results raised the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder. Serum amino acid and urinary orotic acid levels were analyzed, revealing elevated urinary orotic acid at 2.4 mmol/mol Cr (0.4-1.2) and low serum citrulline at 9 nmol/ml (17-46), arginine at 24 nmol/mL (32-120) and ornithine at 21 nmol/mL (38-130), indicative of partial ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. After treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, and a low-protein parenteral diet, ammonia levels normalized by hospital day (HD) 8. Mental status improved and she was extubated and demoted to hospital floors. On HD10, she was readmitted to the ICU after new-onset tonic-clonic seizures, which resolved with Ativan. Micronutrient deficiency was suspected as the cause. Serum electrolyte levels were not consistent with refeeding syndrome. Serum laboratory values showed low levels of zinc, selenium, and vitamin B6. Phenytoin, lamotrigine, and clozabam were prescribed. With the supplementation of these micronutrients, she has remained free of seizures. Results: Although rare, partial OTC deficiency can cause serious complications after RYGB and small bowel resection surgeries, even years after the procedures.

3422,[52] Follow-up of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in children with Wilson's disease by transient elastography (Fibroscan),"Introduction: Liver damage in Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fbrosis. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens) has been applied in many chronic liver diseases for non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness/fbrosis and steatosis. Our aim was to assess the change in liver stiffness/fbrosis and steatosis and liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease using Fibroscan. Material and methods: 33 children with a mean age of 11.5 years with Wilson's disease, treated with zinc or d-penicillamine were included. At baseline and after a median period of 1.5 years, all patients underwent median probe Fibroscans (M) to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter, CAP). At the same time, repeated laboratory tests of liver function were performed. Results: at baseline, our patients had slightly elevated liver enzymes ALT-49.5 U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5 U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26 U /I (19.5-35.5) and well preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial examination with Fibros-can showed a normal mean liver stiffness of 4.4 kPa (M probe) (4.0-5.4) and slightly elevated hepatic steatosis CAP-257 dB/m (235-283) [middle quartile , inferior and superior]. After a period of 1.5 years, we found a decrease, but not statistically significant, in ALT, AST, and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than the reference results (p = 0.02). Similarly, we have not observed a marked difference in hepatic steatosis (HEAP) or hepatic stiffness by Fibroscan when comparing baseline and repeat measurements. Conclusion: Liver stiffness/fbrosis and steatosis do not appear to improve significantly in the short-term follow-up observation period of children with Wilson's disease, as measured by Fibroscan. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) can be readily used in children with Wilson's disease to monitor for liver stiffness/fbrosis and steatosis.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2017,,,0,0,
3423,"[45] LiverMultiScan: New Noninvasive Method for Assessing Liver Inflammation, Steatosis, and Fibrosis: Preliminary Report","Introduction: Liver biopsy (LB) is an invasive procedure used for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of liver diseases. We present a preliminary experience with a new non-invasive method LiverMultiScan (LMS) that evaluates hepatic fbrosis, steatosis and inflammation. Material and methods: Two children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and one with Wilson's disease underwent diagnostic or control liver biopsy (LB) and LMS. We compared the degree of liver fbrosis, inflammation, and steatosis (based on LB) with the LIF score (based on multiparametric NMR, liver fat and iron content measurements). LMS analysis was also performed on a healthy child (as a control). Results: In a 12-year-old male (recently diagnosed with HAI, who was not receiving treatment), BL revealed 3rd grade fbrosis and 3rd grade portal and lobular inflammation. . -mation. The LMS analysis reports closely correspond to these findings: fat 0.7%, iron 0.9 mg/g, LIF score 3.08%. In a 16-year-old woman with AIH (in treatment with Azathioprine), the biopsy showed: fbrosis 1c, portal inflammation (2nd grade) and lobular inflammation (1st grade). In LMS: fat 3.2%, iron 0.8 mg/g, LIF score 1.97%. In a 7.5-year-old woman with Wilson's disease (in Zincteral) in BL: 3<sup>rd</sup> grade steatosis, 2<sup>nd</sup> grade ballooning, 2<sup>nd< fbrosis /sup> sup> grade, portal and lobular inflammation 1<sup>st</sup> grade. In LMS: fat 32.6%, iron 1.4 mg/g, LIF score 3.08%. LMS analysis in a healthy 17-year-old girl with no liver disease revealed: fat 1.2%, iron 1.2 mg/g, LIF score 1.73%. Based on experience in adults, LIF < 2% appears to be normal, with higher levels correlating with fbrosis and inflammation. Conclusions: The LIF score corresponds closely to the degree of fbrosis and inflammation in liver biopsy, and hepatic steatosis described by MRI is also confirmed by liver histopathology. LiverMultiScan is a promising new non-invasive method that can be used to monitor liver diseases in children. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm and further delineate these findings.",,"Banerjee, R.;Janowski, K.;Wozniak, M.;Janczyk, W.;Chelstowska, S.;Jurkiewicz, E.;Grajkowska, W.;Pronicki, M.;Socha, P.",2017,,,0,0,
3424,Quantitative Transcranial Ultrasound in Wilson's Disease and Healthy Controls: Cutoff Values and Functional Correlations,"To compare transcranial ultrasound (TCS) findings in patients with predominantly neurological Wilson's disease (WD) with those of controls, and to correlate TCS data with the clinical profile of WD. WD patients (n = 40/f = 18) and matched healthy controls (n = 49/f = 20) were assessed in terms of TCS, serum copper and iron parameters, and clinical scales, such as the Unified Classification of Wilson's disease. Scale (UWDRS), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Test-Revised (ACE-R), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Beck Depression Inventory. The cut-off values of the echogenic area of the lentiform nuclei and substantia nigra clearly differentiated WD patients from controls (area under the curve: 95.4% and 79.4%). The echogenic area of the substantia nigra was significantly greater in male patients than in female patients (p = 0.001). Compared with controls, patients also showed hyperechogenicity in the thalamus and midbrain tegmentum/tectum; The width of the third ventricle was increased and the axial area of the midbrain was reduced. In the WD group, male gender was correlated with substantia nigra echogenic area (r = 0.515, p = 0.0007) and serum ferritin levels (r = 0.479, p = 0.002); hyperechogenicity of the lenticular nuclei correlated with dystonia (r = 0.326, p = 0.04) and dysarthria (r = 0.334, p = 0.035); width of the third ventricle correlated with dystonia (r = 0.439, p = 0.005), dysarthria (r = 0.449, p = 0.004), parkinsonism (r = 0.527, p < 0.001), UWDRS neurological and total scores (both r = 0.504, p = 0.0009), MMSE (r = -0.496, p = 0.001), and ACE-R (r = -0.534, p = 0.0004). The echogenic area of the lenticular nuclei allowed a very precise discrimination between patients and controls. Gender differences in substantia nigra echogenicity and iron metabolism are of interest for future studies in WD. TCS reflects different dimensions of WD pathology that are clearly distinguishable from healthy controls and that correlate with various clinical features of WD.

3426,First case of double-auxiliary crossed domino donor liver transplant,"We present a case of double domino liver transplantation in a 32-year-old woman diagnosed with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and liver dysfunction. A two-stage surgical plan was designed and a domino graft was implanted at each stage. During the first stage, an auxiliary domino liver transplant was performed using a domino graft from a 4-year-old girl with Wilson's disease. After removing the right lobe of the liver from the FAP patient, the graft was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and placed along the right side of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The orifices of the left, middle, and right hepatic veins were reconstructed using an iliac vein patch and then anastomosed to the right side of the IVC. Thirty days later, a second domino liver graft was implanted. The second domino graft was from a 3-year-old girl with a carbamyl ornithine enzyme defect and replaced the residual native liver (left lobe). To balance function and blood flow between the two grafts, selective percutaneous transcatheter portal vein embolization was performed and ""the left portal vein"" of the first graft was blocked 9 months after the second transplant. Liver function indices, blood ammonia, and 24-hour urine copper levels were normal at the end of a 3-year follow-up. These two domino donor grafts from donors with different metabolic disorders restored normal liver function. Our experience demonstrated a new approach to resolve metabolic disorders with domino grafts and using livers explanted from children. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2017.

3427,Zeb2: inhibition of inhibitors in Schwann cells,"Schwann cell development is tightly regulated by the concerted action of activating and inhibitory factors. Most of the regulatory feedback loops identified to date are transcriptional activators that promote the induction of genes encoding integral myelin proteins and lipids. The mechanisms by which inhibitory factors are silenced during Schwann cell maturation are less well understood. We were recently able to show a critical role for the transcription factor homeobox 2 (Zeb2) that binds to the zinc finger E-box during Schwann cell development and myelination as a transcriptional repressor of maturation inhibitors. Zeb2 belongs to a family of highly conserved 2-handed zinc finger proteins and represses gene transcription by binding to E-box sequences in the regulatory region of target genes. The protein is known to repress E-cadherin during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor malignancy and mediate its functions by interacting with multiple cofactors. During the development of the nervous system, Zeb2 is expressed in neural crest cells, precursors of Schwann cells, the myelinating glial cells of peripheral nerves. Schwann cells that lack Zeb2 fail to fully differentiate and cannot sort and myelinate peripheral nerve axons. The maturation inhibitors Sox2, Ednrb, and Hey2 emerge as targets for Zeb2-mediated transcriptional repression and show persistent aberrant expression in Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells. Although dispensable for adult Schwann cells, Zeb2 reactivation is essential after nerve injury to allow for remyelination and functional recovery. In summary, Zeb2 emerges as an ""inhibitor of inhibitors"", a novel concept in Schwann cell development and nerve repair. Copyright Â© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,"Brinkmann, B.

3431,Clinical profile of patients with simultaneous presentation of Wilson's disease and autoimmune liver disease in a rural tertiary care center,"Background and Objective: The coexistence of Wilson's disease and autoimmune liver disease in the same patient is a rare entity. In this situation, combined treatment with steroids and D-penicillamine may be effective. Methods: The clinical, histological and laboratory profiles of patients with chronic liver disease were analyzed in order to find the etiology of the disease after ruling out common causes such as alcohol, viruses and drugs. Results: Of 10 patients, 6 were men and 4 women. The most frequent clinical presentation was abdominal distention (80%), abdominal pain (30%), foot edema (60%), splenomegaly (40%) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (40%). Laboratory investigation revealed anemia (50%), thrombocytopenia (70%), prothrombin time prolongation in (60%), normal liver function in 60%, abnormal liver function in (40%). Hepatitis A, B, C and E were negative in all cases. Serum cereloplasmin <20 mg% in (30%), normal level in (70%). 24-hour urine copper level range from >200 in (40%), 100 to 200 in (40%), and 90 to 100 in (20%). Autoimmune markers revealed strong ANA positivity in (40%), mild positivity in (60%). AMA, ASMA, Anti-LKM-1 were negative in all cases (100%). Liver biopsy showed features of autoimmune liver disease and PERIPORTAL copper deposition in 80% of cases, while 20% showed features of liver copper deposition.

3432,Zinc maintenance therapy after initial penicillamine chelation to treat symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease in a resource-limited setting,"Background and objective: Experience with zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. The study was conducted to assess the efficacy of penicillamine followed by zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD in whom disease severity scores (Child, MELD, Nazer, and New Wilson index score) and 3-point 24-hour urinary copper were compared. time: baseline at presentation, at transition from penicillamine to zinc, and at the end of follow-up. Results: Of the 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD studied, 10 had neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with WD. Penicillamine was changed to zinc sulfate due to financial constraints (in 28 patients) or due to adverse effects of penicillamine (in 3). Child's grade was A in 6 patients, B in 5, and C in 17 at presentation (baseline). The duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, median (range) and subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was a significant improvement in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer, New Wilson Index, Child, and MELD score) on transition from penicillamine to zinc compared to baseline. This improvement was maintained until the end of the study period. 17 patients with Child C cirrhosis at presentation were treated with penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks followed by zinc for 344 (41-652) weeks, of whom 15 had significant improvement in liver function and liver function. disease severity scores to end of follow-up. Three of the 31 patients in the study died at 284, 112 and 437 weeks. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: Penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment in a resource-limited setting for patients with symptomatic hepatic WD in all degrees of initial disease severity.

Response to chelation therapy was evaluated in patients with >=9 months of adequate follow-up. They were analyzed in the following categories: (a) complete improvement (asymptomatic+normalization of transaminases, serum albumin and coagulation); (b) partial improvement (asymptomatic+almost normalization of transaminases+serum albumin or coagulation); (c) progression (impairment of synthetic functions, decompensation, or death); (d) drug toxicity Results: 111 WD children aged 108 (36-180) months had a global PELD score of 16 (-11 to 60). Liver histology was compatible with WD in 68% (n=27/40). Figure 1 shows the presentation and the result. Chelation was started in 84% (n=94). 14% (n=16) of the patients died in hospital due to advanced disease. Sixty-six with a follow-up of 43 (9-144) months were analyzed for the outcome. 92% (n=60) received D-penicillamine monotherapy and 6% (n=4) with additional severe neurological presentation received D-penicillamine and zinc. Among those receiving D-penicillamine monotherapy, favorable outcomes were seen in 58% (n=35). Thirteen percent (n=8) had drug toxicity and 12% (n=7) required the addition of zinc due to disease progression. 6% (n=4) started trientine. An overall favorable outcome was seen in 70% (n = 46).

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 107 children diagnosed with Wilson's disease over a 10-year period was performed. Results: The symptoms were jaundice in 56.07%, ascites in 45.7%, encephalopathy in 10.2%, bleeding in 29%, neurological manifestation in 21.4% and psychiatric manifestation in 4. 6% of patients. Consanguinity was present in 14%, while a family history of Wilson's disease could be traced in 41.1% of patients. Examination showed hepatomegaly in 82.2%, splenomegaly in 64.4%, and ascites in 37.3% of patients. Presentation was hepatic in 81.3% and hepatolenticular in 18.6%. Other causes of liver disease such as hepatitis A, E, B, C, AIH, PSC, overlap were excluded. KF rings were present in 72.4% of hepatic Wilsons and 90% of hepatolenticular Wilsonians.

3435,Wilsonian Fulminant Hepatic Failure in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review of 274 Cases,"Background: Fulminant Wilsonian liver failure (WFHF) is a serious condition, usually requiring liver transplantation (LT). As a result of its relative rarity, WFHF has been difficult to study in depth. Data in pediatric populations (<18 years) are sparse and limited to case reports and small case series. The objectives of this systematic review were to examine the clinical and biochemical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of children and adolescents with WFHF. Methods: Database searches were performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was restricted to articles published in English, between January 1984 and March 1, 2017. Articles were excluded if pediatric data could not be extracted. Wilson's disease (WD) was defined according to the AASLD guidelines. Due to the heterogeneity of the definition of acute liver failure (AHF) in the literature, subjects were included if the authors of the article defined them as having AHF. The following data points were extracted from the articles: study design, baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics, genetic mutations, treatment, and clinical outcome. If not reported, the following ratios were calculated: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to total bilirubin (TBIL) < 2 and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 4. Results: A total of 56 (case reports ( 30), case series (23), and cohort studies (3)) manuscripts involving 274 participants met the study inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were conducted in Asia (21), followed by 19 in North America, 15 in Europe, and 1 in Australia. The studies ranged in size from 1 to 61 subjects with a median age of 12.9 years at presentation (range 4.0 to 17.6 years). Women represented 74% (202/274) of all patients. Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen in 80% (153/191), and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia was reported in 98% (61/62). ALP/TBIL and AST/ALT ratios were assessed in 60 (22%) and 63 (23%) of the participants, respectively, and were found to be <2 and >4 in less than 55% of the subjects. Forty-seven percent (128/274) of reported subjects underwent HT. Of these, 58% (74/128) underwent cadaveric donor LT and 20% (25/128) received living donor LT. Graft type was not reported in the remaining subjects. Spontaneous liver recovery was achieved in 24% (65/274) of reported cases with the help of extracorporeal liver support systems. Plasmapheresis was the most used extracorporeal system and D-penicillamine was the most used chelating agent in subjects who survived with their original liver. ATP7B mutations were only reported in 21 participants, limiting the assessment of genotype-phenotype relationships. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review examining WFHF in a substantial cohort of children and adolescents. The female preponderance of WFHF is clearly demonstrated in this analysis. Of note, only half of the reported subjects required LT and the remainder responded to medical therapy. This finding may be due to biased case reports describing the use of liver support systems. It may also reflect subtle variations in the definition of WFHF disease. Prospective studies are required to explore the true frequency and need for LT in WFHF.",,"Vandriel, S.;Ayoub, M.;Ling, S.;Ng, V.;Roberts, E.;Kamath, B.",2017,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000001805,0,1,
3436,A copper sensor for in vivo MRI,"Copper is the third most abundant transition metal in the body and a necessary nutrient for human growth and development.1 Copper binds to a number of proteins and enzymes where it performs critical structural and catalytic roles.2 As a consequence of its redox activity, Cellular copper homeostasis is tightly regulated and its disruption causes a number of diseases, including: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Prion, Menkes and Wilson.3 These diseases lead to variation in the local concentration of copper ions from about few mM to several mM.4 Although the relationship between the dynamic concentration of copper and its physiological or pathological role has been extensively studied, information on the structural behavior under relevant biological conditions remains poorly understood due to the lack of techniques. detection of copper in real time.5 Magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) is a valuable technical medical tool. a diagnostic tool that allows non-invasive three-dimensional visualization of whole organisms with high spatial and temporal resolution. The design of contrast agents that change the T1 relaxation times of water protons in response to a given analyte is of great importance for MRI. Several sensitive sensors have been reported in the literature, including sensors for enzyme activity, pH, pO2, glucose, lactate, and nitric oxide.6 Specifically for copper detection, Que, et al.7 reported the first generation of MR sensors activated by copper. ,8 Although promising, reported copper-sensitive MRI agents demonstrated interference by excess Zn<sup>2+</sup>, limiting their use in diagnostic MRI applications for Cu<sup>2+</sup > .7 Here, we introduce a new copper-sensitive MR sensor, with a copper-selective recognition motif (L). This sensor shows high selectivity to copper ions, exhibits high relaxation (r1) with a 42% increase in relaxation when bound to 1 equivalent of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, only when fully bound to Cu<sup>2+</sup> does the sensor exhibit a 310% increase in r1 (21 mM-1.s-1) in the presence of physiological concentrations of human serum albumin ( HSA). Using biochemical techniques, we have also shown that GdL forms a ternary complex mediated by Cu<sup>2+</sup> with HSA (GdL-Cu<sup>2+</sup>-HSA). Initial in vivo studies were performed to confirm the ability of GdL to detect variations in liver copper levels using wild-type C57bl/6 mice (FIG. 1). We observed significant contrast enhancement (~30%) in the liver of GdL mice, suggesting hepatobiliary clearance. When treated with a copper chelator (ATN-224) 2 hours before GdL injection, liver contrast was significantly reduced (~50%) as shown in Figure 1. For the first time, a copper sensor was able to detect differences in extracellular copper levels in the liver. Our results could pave the way for unique opportunities to explore the role of copper in the progression of many neurological disorders, including Wilson's disease.",,"Paranawithana, N.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-01-017-1138-y,0,0,
3437,Functional characterization of the ZEB2 regulatory landscape,"Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is a key regulator of central nervous system (CNS) development. Although transcriptional regulation of ZEB2 is essential for CNS development, the elements that regulate ZEB2 expression have not yet been identified. Here, we identify a proximal regulatory region of ZEB2 and characterize transcriptional enhancers during neuronal development. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for active (H3K27ac) and repressed (H3K27me3) chromatin regions in human neuronal progenitors, combined with an in vivo zebrafish enhancer assay, we functionally characterized 18 candidate enhancers at the ZEB2 locus. Eight enhancers drove expression patterns that were specific to distinct regions of the midbrain/hindbrain (ZEB2#e3 and 5), trigeminal-like ganglia (ZEB2#e6 and 7), notochord (ZEB2#e2, 4 and 12), and cerebrum. complete (ZEB2# e14). Furthermore, we dissected the minimal sequences that drive specific enhancer activity in the mid/hindbrain and notochord. Using a reporter assay in human cells, we showed increased activity of the minimal notochord enhancer ZEB2#e2 in response to expressions of AP-1 and DLX1/2, whereas repressed activity of this enhancer was observed in response to expressions of ZEB2 and TFAP2. We show that Dlx1 but not Zeb2 and Tfap2 interact with the Zeb2#e2 enhancer sequence in the mouse notochord at embryonic day 11.5. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we deleted the ZEB2#e2 region, leading to reduced ZEB2 expression in human cells. Therefore, we characterized the distal transcriptional enhancers and trans-acting elements that govern the regulation of ZEB2 expression during neuronal development. These findings pave the way for future analyzes of the role of ZEB2 regulatory elements in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",,"Yaacov, R.

However, cases of immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease are very rare. A 20-year-old Japanese man presented with microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. A renal biopsy showed mesangial cell proliferation, immunoglobulin A deposition, and electron-dense deposition in mesangial areas, all of which are consistent with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Abdominal computed tomography showed hepatic atrophy and splenomegaly, and the diagnosis of hepatic disease. Wilson's disease was confirmed with decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and copper deposition on liver biopsy. The patient was successfully treated with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate and showed improvement in renal manifestations. Wilson's disease is a rare cause of secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy. We recommend that Wilson's disease be considered the cause of secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy in juvenile patients with hematuria, proteinuria, and splenomegaly and suggest measuring serum ceruloplasmin concentrations, urinary copper excretion, and evaluating Kayser-Fleischer rings in these patients. patients.",,"Shimamura, Y.;Maeda, T.;Gocho, Y.;Ogawa, Y.;Tsuji, K.;Takizawa, H.",2018,2025-09-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13730-018-0365-7,0,0,
3439,[Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration],"Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration Summary. Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The most common clinical presentations are liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. Pathophysiologically, Wilson's disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, leading to defective biliary excretion of copper and subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. Its prevalence is approximately 1:30,000, yet its penetrance, clinical presentation, and disease severity vary widely, from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to cirrhosis or acute liver failure with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. For this reason, Wilson's disease should be suspected and ruled out in cases of undetermined liver disease or neuropsychiatric disturbances. Diagnostic algorithms are complex and involve clinical testing, ophthalmologic examination (Kayser-Fleischer rings on split-lamp examination), blood and urine tests, genetic testing, imaging, and histology. In compensated liver disease, treatment of Wilson's disease by copper depletion (chelating agents, zinc) is usually effective. In case of liver failure, a liver transplant may be necessary, which corrects the underlying error of copper metabolism. New drugs with improved efficacy and tolerability are in clinical development.",,"Mensing, B.;Nowak, A.;Zweifel, S.;Terracciano, L.;Bernsmeier, C.;Filipowicz Sinnreich, M.",2018,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0040-5930/a000995,0,0,
3440,Copper complexes in cancer therapy,"Copper homeostasis is tightly regulated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to ensure sufficient amounts for cuproprotein biosynthesis while limiting the production and toxicity of oxidative stress. Over the last century, copper complexes have been developed as antimicrobials and for the treatment of diseases involving copper dyshomeostasis (eg, Wilson's disease). There is now a repertoire of copper complexes that can regulate body copper through a myriad of mechanisms. In addition, many copper complexes are now being evaluated for a variety of therapeutic indications (eg, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) that require a variety of copper-related pharmacological effects. Cancer therapy is also attracting considerable attention, as copper has been recognized as a limiting factor for multiple aspects of cancer progression, including growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Consequently, 'ancient copper complexes' (eg, tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol) have been repurposed for cancer therapy and have shown anticancer activity in vitro and in preclinical models. Likewise, new tailor-made copper complexes have been designed based on ideal structural and biological characteristics for their anticancer activity. Human clinical trials continue to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of copper complexes as anticancer agents and considerable progress has been made in understanding their pharmacological requirements. In this chapter, we present a historical perspective on the major copper complexes currently being repurposed for cancer therapy and detail several of the more recently developed compounds that have emerged as promising anticancer agents. Additionally, we provide an overview of known mechanisms of action, including molecular targets, and discuss associated clinical trials.",,"Denoyer, D.;Clatworthy, S. A. S.;Cater, M.

3441,D-penicillamine combined with hydroperoxide metabolism inhibitors enhances breast and lung cancer cell responses to radiation and carboplatin through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2< mediated oxidative stress /sub>,"D-penicillamine (DPEN), a copper chelator, has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent evidence suggests that DPEN in combination with biologically relevant concentrations of copper (Cu) generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cultured cancer cells, but the effects of this on responses from cancer cells to ionization radiation and chemotherapy are unknown. Elevated steady-state levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were detected in MB231 and H1299 breast cancer cells after treatment with DPEN (100 microM) and copper sulfate ( 15 microM). Clonogenic survival demonstrated that DPEN-induced cancer cell toxicity was Cu-dependent and significantly ameliorated by glutathione depletion [using butionine sulfoximine (BSO)] as well as inhibition of thioredoxin reductase [using Auranofin (Au)] before of the exhibition. Catalase treatment inhibited DPEN toxicity, confirming that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was the toxic species. Furthermore, pretreatment of cancer cells with iron sucrose enhanced DPEN toxicity while treatment with desferrioxamine, an Fe chelator that inhibits the redox cycle, inhibited DPEN toxicity. Importantly, DPEN also demonstrated selective toxicity in human breast and lung cancer cells, relative to normal untransformed human breast or lung epithelial cells, and increased cancer cell killing when combined with ionizing radiation or carboplatin. Consistent with the selective toxicity of cancer cells, normal untransformed human lung epithelial cells had significantly lower labile iron stores than lung cancer cells. These results support the hypothesis that DPEN mediates the selective killing of cancer cells as well as radiochemosensitization through a mechanism involving H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> catalyzed oxidative stress. by metal ions and suggest that DPEN could be reused as an adjuvant in conventional cancer therapy.",,"Sciegienka, S.

WD patients with neurological symptoms were divided into two groups: a treatment group (n=53) and a control group (n=50). The treatment group received anti-copper therapy with a combination of Gandouling and low-dose penicillamine D (10 mg/kg), while the control group received conventional-dose penicillamine D monotherapy (20 mg/kg). Clinical efficacies, adverse reactions, and the results of various hematological and biochemical investigations were recorded and statistically analyzed. Overall, 98.11% of WD patients treated with the combination therapy experienced relief of their neurological status (in parallel with a significantly improved global rating scale score or remained stable). His white blood cell and platelet counts stabilized, and his liver function improved or remained stable. The combined therapy obviously also promoted a better excretion of copper in the 24-hour urine. Only 15.09% of WD patients on combination therapy experienced adverse reactions, including neurological deterioration in one case (1.89%) and hepatic worsening in one case (1.89%), which was less common than the control group that received the conventional dose.

3443,"Safety, Efficacy, and Biomarker Findings of PBT2 Targeting Abeta as Modifying Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease: A Phase IIa, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: PBT2 is a metal protein quenching compound (MPAC) that affects the Cu2(+) and Zn2(+)-mediated toxic oligomerization of Abeta that is observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strong preclinical efficacy data and the completion of early clinical safety studies preceded this phase IIa study, which aimed to assess the effects of PBT2 on safety, efficacy, and biomarkers of AD. METHODS: Between December 6, 2006, and September 21, 2007, community-dwelling patients older than 55 years were recruited for this 12-week, double-blind, randomized trial of PBT2. Patients were randomly assigned to receive PBT2 50 mg, PBT2 250 mg, or placebo. Inclusion criteria were early AD (mini-mental state examination [MMSE] score between 20 and 26 points or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) cognitive subscale score between 10 and 25 points), taking a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) for at least 4 months, a modified Hachinski score of 4 points or less, and CT or MRI findings consistent with AD. The main outcomes were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were plasma and CSF biomarkers and cognition. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471211. RESULTS: 78 patients were randomized (29 to placebo, 20 to PBT2 50 mg, and 29 to PBT2 250 mg) and 74 (95%) completed the study. 42 (54%) patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (10 [50%] on PBT2 50 mg, 18 [62%] on PBT2 250 mg, and 14 [48%] on placebo). PBT2 patients reported no serious adverse events. Patients treated with 250 mg PBT2 had a significant and dose-dependent reduction (p = 0.023) in CSF Abeta(42) concentration compared with those treated with placebo (the difference in least squares mean change from baseline was 56.0 pg/mL, 95% CI Ã¢â¬101.5 to Ã¢â¬11.0, p=0.006). PBT2 had no effect on plasma AD biomarkers or serum concentrations of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+). Cognition tests included ADAS' cog, MMSE, and a neuropsychological test battery (NTB). Of these tests, two tests of the executive function component of the NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group: category fluency test (2.8 words, 0.1 to 5.4; p =0.041) and part B test (Ã¢â¬48.0 s, 83.0 to 13.0, p=0.009). INTERPRETATION: The safety profile is favorable for the continued development of PBT2. The effect on putative AD biomarkers in CSF, but not in plasma, suggests a central effect of the drug on Abeta metabolism. Cognitive efficacy was restricted to two measures of executive function. Future trials that are larger and longer will establish whether the effects of PBT2 on biomarkers and cognition reported here translate to clinical effectiveness.",,"Lannfelt, L.;Blennow, K.;Zetterberg, H.;Batsman, S.;Ames, D.;Harrison, J.;Masters, C.

3444,DASH for asthma: a pilot study of the DASH diet in poorly controlled adult asthma,"This pilot study aims to provide effect size confidence intervals, intervention and clinical trial feasibility data, and procedural materials for a large-scale randomized controlled trial that will determine the efficacy of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). ) as adjunctive therapy to standard care for adults with uncontrolled asthma. The DASH diet includes foods (eg, fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts) and antioxidant nutrients (eg, vitamins A, C, E, and zinc) with potential benefits for people with asthma, but it is unknown whether complete diet is beneficial . Participants (n = 90) will be randomized to receive usual care alone or combined with a DASH intervention consisting of 8 group and 3 individual sessions for the first 3 months, followed by at least monthly telephone consultations for another 3 months. Follow-up evaluations will be performed at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is the 7-item Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire, a validated composite measure of daytime and nighttime symptoms, activity limitations, rescue medication use, and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second. We will explore changes in inflammatory markers important to the pathophysiology of asthma (eg, fractional exhaled nitric oxide) and their potential to mediate the effect of intervention on disease control. We will also perform prespecified subgroup analyzes by genotype (eg, polymorphisms in the glutathione S transferase gene) and phenotype (eg, atopy, obesity). By evaluating a dietary pattern approach to improve asthma control, this study could advance the evidence base for refining clinical guidelines and public health recommendations regarding the role of dietary modifications in asthma management.",,"Ma, J.;Strub, P.;Lavori, P.

3445,Complementary Naturopathic Medicine for Periodontitis,"This study aims to evaluate selected naturopathic medications for periodontitis in adults and to identify the variables that influence successful outcomes when traditional and alternative approaches are combined to prevent and treat periodontal diseases. The collaboration between Kaiser Permanente, Oregon Health Sciences University, and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine provides an unparalleled environment for this type of research. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss and has a negative impact on systemic health. The limitations of traditional periodontal treatment have forced scientists and physicians to investigate new remedies, and naturopathic medicine has several promising interventions. Because they are used to enhance elements of host resistance known to be important in periodontal health and disease, three naturopathic medicines are potential adjuncts to prevent and treat periodontitis. Connective tissue components are enzymatically degraded in periodontitis. In naturopathy, Connective Tissue Nutrient Formula (CTNF) (vitamins A, C, and D, glucosamine sulfate, oligoproanthocyanidins, copper, zinc, manganese, boron, silicon, magnesium, and calcium) is specifically prescribed to enhance the integrity of the key elements of connective tissue and improve its resistance to degradation. Periodontitis begins when the permeability of the oral sulcular epithelium allows pathogenic bacterial components to invade the deeper periodontal connective tissues. In naturopathy, glutamine is prescribed to reduce the permeability of the oral and intestinal epithelial membrane. Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during the stress response is a risk factor for periodontitis. Adaptogenic herbs (AH) (Panax ginseng, Withania somnifera, and Eleutherococcus senticosus) are prescribed by naturopathic physicians to reverse the impact of bacterial and psychosocial stressors. Because glutamine, CTNF, and HA target pathophysiologic mechanisms known to underlie periodontitis, they are compelling candidates in clinical and mechanistic investigations of complementary medicine approaches to the treatment of periodontitis. Kaiser Permanente adult periodontitis patients will serve as subjects and receive standard periodontal treatment. Three of the four randomized groups will also receive glutamine, CTNF, or HA supplementation. We will determine the effects of these supplements on clinical outcomes (attachment loss, pocket depth, indicators of inflammation, plaque composition, need for periodontal surgery, acute periodontal problems, tooth loss). In addition to completing the battery of self-report measures (stress, coping, quality of life), study subjects will provide samples of blood, saliva, gingival cervical fluid, and bacterial dental plaque. These samples will be screened as part of the laboratory core to identify biological and genetic characteristics that correlate with successful outcomes. Storage of portions of the samples will allow for future examination of additional variables as part of the Development Projects carried out as the Complementary and Alternative Craniofacial Center is established and Phase III trials are carried out.",,Nct,2001,,,0,0,
3446,The effect of a nutritional supplement in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pilot study,"The prevalence of type 2 DM and related complications continues to increase. Diet is an important factor in the etiology of type 2 DM. The intake of zinc and omega 3 fatty acids can modulate glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes in the disease. Zinc is involved in many biological processes including enzymatic action, stabilization of cell membranes, regulation of gene expression, and cell signaling. Zinc supplementation has been shown to improve glycemic control in both animals and humans. The normalizing effect of zinc on glucose homeostasis may be related to its involvement in insulin metabolism. Zinc functions in the synthesis, storage, secretion and action of insulin. OmegaÃ¢â¬ 3 also improves glycemic control and dietary supplementation with omegaÃ¢â¬ 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in subjects with DM. Both zinc and omegaÃ¢â¬ 3 function to mediate lipid metabolism. Zinc supplementation has been found to be associated with a beneficial increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations in people with type 2 DM. The mechanism may again involve insulin, which has been proposed as an independent predictor of plasma HDL. OmegaÃ¢â¬ 3 directly activates transcription factors that regulate lipid metabolism and is known to lower serum triglyceride levels in DM. Zinc appears to have a beneficial impact on parameters related to oxidative stress in DM through a variety of mechanisms, including regulation of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, metallothionein, NFÃÂºB, and nitric oxide signaling. . The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the effect of zinc and omega-3 supplementation on hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress in a type 2 DM population. This study will recruit 48 postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. 2. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups over a 12-week period: placebo, zinc, omega 3, or zinc + omega 3 supplementation.

WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-class oral copper-modulating agent that acts by increasing biliary excretion of copper and reducing serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by complexing with albumin. Methods: In a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study, 28 newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease (ages 18 to 64 years, 46% men, 89% with some degree of neurologic symptoms, and about 50% with cirrhosis at baseline) received WTX101 monotherapy using a response-guided dosing regimen with individualized doses ranging from 15 to 120 mg/day, primarily once daily. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to 24 weeks in NCC levels corrected for copper in tripartite complexes of tetrathiomolybdate, copper and albumin in treated patients (NCCc). The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and the modified Nazer score were used to monitor liver disease stability and safety. Neurological status was assessed using the Wilson's Unified Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At 24 weeks, 71% of WTX101-treated patients achieved or maintained normalized NCCc levels or experienced >=25% reduction from baseline in NCCc (p < 0.001). Mean NCCc was significantly reduced from 3.6 uM at baseline to 0.9 uM at week 24 (p < 0.0001). Mean MELD score and modified Nazer score remained stable over the course of treatment, indicating stabilization of liver function. Reversible asymptomatic elevations in liver tests, observed in 39% of patients (at a dose of 30 mg/day or more), were generally mild to moderate and normalized with dose adjustments. Compared to baseline, patients showed significant improvements at week 24 in mean UWDRS disability score (6.6 vs. 4.1, p < 0.001) and neurological symptom score (22.8 vs. to 16.6, p < 0.0001). No initial drug-induced neurological worsening was observed. Conclusions: Final data from the world's first prospective clinical trial in Wilson's disease indicate that WTX101 rapidly reduced and controlled NCCc, resulting in improved disability and neurological status, with stable liver function and a safety profile. favorable.

3451,A two-centre randomized controlled feasibility trial of insulin pump therapy in young children with diabetes.,"OBJECTIVE: Our goals were to determine whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), compared with continuous multiple daily injections (MDI), can be used safely in young children, whether those receiving CSII will have superior glycemic control, whether subjects using CSII have less hypoglycemia for their control level, and whether families using CSII will report better quality of life. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 1-year randomized feasibility trial comparing CSII with continuous MDIs in preschool children with a history of type 1 diabetes of at least 6 months' duration. Prospective outcomes included measures of overall glycemic control (HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring system), incidence of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, percentage of glucose values below 3.9 mmol/l, and reported quality of life. parental. RESULTS: The ages of the 19 subjects ranged from 1.7 to 6.1 (mean 3.6) years, the duration of diabetes ranged from 0.6 to 2.6 (mean 1.4) years, and baseline HbA1c it ranged between 6.7 and 9.6% (mean 7.9%). Seven subjects were men. Nine subjects were randomized to start CSII and 10 to continue MDI. All the initial characteristics were well balanced. Overall metabolic control, diabetes quality of life, and incidence of hypoglycemia were similar in the two groups. No subject had diabetic ketoacidosis, while one subject in each group had an episode of severe hypoglycemia. No CSII subjects stopped using the pump during or after the study.
