3,"Recommendations for Standardized Avian Coronavirus (AvCoV) Nomenclature: Outcomes of Discussions in the Framework of European Union COST Action FA1207: ""Towards the Control of Avian Coronaviruses: Vaccination, Diagnosis and Surveillance Strategies""","Viruses within the family Coronaviridae show variations within their genome sequences, particularly within the main structural protein, the Spike (S) glycoprotein gene. Therefore, many different antigenic forms, serotypes or variant strains of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) exist worldwide. Only a few of these, the so-called protective types, provide cross-protection against different serotypes. New serotypes arise by recombination or spontaneous mutations. From time to time, antigenic virus variants appear that differ significantly from known serotypes. The result of this variability is an inconsistent nomenclature and classification of virus strains. In addition, there is currently no defined standard classification method. Within the framework of COST Action FA1207 ""Towards the control of avian coronaviruses: diagnostic, surveillance and vaccination strategies"" (working groups ""Molecular virology"" and ""Epidemiology""), we aimed to define and develop a unified and internationally standardized terminology. Classification of AvCoVs. We recommend using ""CoV Species/AvCov/host/country/sample ID/year"" to refer to AvCoV strains.",,,2016.0,,10.1637/0005-2086-60.2.411,0

The proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of BLV was isolated from the peripheral blood of animals naturally infected with this virus. Subsequent amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the env-gene 444 pairs nucleotide (pn) long made it possible to classify the studied isolates as genotypes 4 and 6. Apart from the isolate clusters of all eight known genotypes, this made it possible to classify it as atypical. During the sequencing of a portion of the env gene of BLV provirus isolates separated in this area, the presence of 31 point mutations, 11 of which were significant, was detected at the examined locus: 2 transversions and 9 passages.",,"Abakin, S.

6,"Identification and phylogenetic analysis of sheep pox during a sheep epidemic in Sharkia province, Egypt","Sheeppox virus (SPPV) is one of the listed and notifiable diseases affecting sheep production, which greatly affects the trade in new breed sheep. This study was conducted to identify sheep pox using cell culture, electron microscopy (EM), and open reading frame (ORF) 103 gene during an outbreak in local breed sheep in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, in April 2017. Skin pox lesion on face, inner lips, inner thigh and under tail. In young lambs aged 3 to 6 months, the incidence of infection was 23.5% and the mortality rate was 8.2%. Forty-three shell and tissue samples were collected from clinically diseased adult sheep and dead lambs and cultured in Vero cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in 40 samples within 3 to 7 days. A typical Poxvirus was a brick-like shape with rounded ends on negative staining of EM and oval-like structure with dumbbell-shaped DNA cores with concave body edges on positive staining of EM. Conventional PCR using the ORF103 gene and the resulting bands of about 570 bp referred to SPPV. The sequence amplicon was analyzed by NCBI-BLAST and registered in the GeneBank under the N. MG873537 entry, and phylogenetic tree was designed revealing that the isolated SPPV strain is similar to other SPPV strains isolated in Egypt, India, China, and the USA. Finally, both EM and PCR are considered sensitive, fast and powerful methods to identify SPPV from tissue and shell samples without the need for further culture, in addition to the convenient and easy use of the ORF103 gene to distinguish SPPV from other Capripox viruses. . .",,"Abd-Elfatah, E.

7,Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Novel Infectious Bronchitis Virus Variants from Vaccinated Broiler Flocks in Egypt,"This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains circulating in vaccinated broiler flocks in Giza and Fayoum provinces. Thirty-four isolates were collected and egg dispersal revealed their ability to induce typical IBV lesions after three to five consecutive passages. Three selected isolates were identified as IBV using a real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and further characterized by partial spike (S) gene sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed their clustering in two variable groups. Group I consisted of a variant (VSVRI_F3) with 99.1% nucleotide sequence identity to the Q1 reference strain. Group II consisted of variants VSVRI_G4 and VSVRI_G9 showing 92.8%-94.3% nucleotide identity with the Egyptian variants Eg/12120S/2012, Eg/12197B/2012 and Eg/1265B/2012. Regarding the deduced amino acid sequence, the three variants had 77.1%-85.2% similarity to the vaccine strains currently used in Egypt. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring the prevalence of IBV variants in vaccinated broiler flocks as well as adopting an appropriate vaccination strategy.",,"Abdel-Sabour, M.

8,"Retrotransposable elements in the W chromosome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori","The sex chromosomes of the silkworm Bombyxmori are named ZW(XY) for females and ZZ(XX) for males. The W chromosome of B. mori does not recombine with the Z chromosome and autosomes, and no genes for morphological characters have yet been mapped to the W chromosome. Also, femininity is determined by the presence of a single W chromosome, regardless of the number of autosomes or Z chromosomes. To understand these interesting features of the W chromosome, it is necessary to analyze the W chromosome at the level of molecular biology. To initially isolate W chromosome-specific DNA sequences as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, we compared genomic DNAs between males and females by PCR with random 10-mer primers. So far, we have identified 12 W-specific RAPD markers, and with the exception of one RAPD marker, all of the deduced amino acid sequences of these W-specific RAPD markers are similar to previously reported amino acid sequences of reversible elements from various sources. organisms. After constructing a genomic DNA lambda phage library of B. mori, we obtained two lambda phage clones, one containing the W-Kabuki RAPD sequence and one containing the W-Samurai RAPD sequence, and found that these DNA sequences contain nested structures of many retrotransposable elements. To further analyze the W chromosome, we obtained 14 W-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from three BAC libraries and subjected these clones to shotgun sequencing. Combining the resulting sequences did not produce a single contiguous sequence due to the availability of many reversible elements. Therefore, we combined PCR with shotgun sequencing. Through these analyses, we found that many long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, retroposons, DNA transposons and their derivatives accumulate as a layer on the W chromosome. These results strongly suggest that retrotransposable elements are the major structural component of the W chromosome.",,"Abe, H.;Mita, K.;Yasukochi, Y.;Oshiki, T.;Shimada, T.",2005.0,,,0

10,Genomic and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of infectious bronchitis coronavirus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammakoronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analyzed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing, and genetic diversity across the entire viral genome was investigated at the sub-consensus level by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the 5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR sequence were predicted. Missense: the relative frequencies of silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. In descending order, the most variable ORFs were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. Protein products E and 3b play key roles in coronavirus virulence and RNA folding showed that mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs of 0.67% in the spike (S) protein ORF was below the genomic mean of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was significantly more variable, comprising 87% of the polymorphisms detected throughout the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and four sequentially mutated amino acid sequences that mapped to the stem region of the spike protein. Template-based modeling of protein structure produced the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the sub-consensus level, the principle that HVRs in the S1 subunit are very tolerant to amino acid changes produced by genetic drift is questioned.",,"Abolnik, C.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.033,0
11,Evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza of H5: sequence data show gradual changes at the cleavage site,"The genetic composition of an H5 subtype hemagglutinin gene quasitype obtained from ostrich tissues infected with the H5 subtype influenza virus was analyzed using a next-generation sequencing approach. First evidence has been provided for the repeated duplication of a poly(U) stretch in the binding peptide region of the hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Multiple non-consensus-dependent RNA strains were detected in the infected host, corresponding to possible intermediate sequences between the putative low pathogenic precursor nucleotide sequence of the H5 influenza strain and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus gene sequence. In silico analysis of identified RNA sequences predicted that the intermediate H5 sequence PQREKRGLF plays an important role in subsequent mutational events that reposition the HACS coding region from stable base-pair RNA regions into a single-stranded overhang, thereby preparing the junction peptide coding region.

12,Outbreaks of avian influenza H6N2 viruses in chickens resulted from the reclassification of H6N8 and H9N2 ostrich viruses.,"The first recorded avian influenza (AI) outbreak (low pathogenicity H6N2) in South African chickens occurred in Camperdown, KwaZulu/Natal Province (KZN) in June 2002. We identified phylogenetic relationships among the various H6N2s to identify the source of the outbreak. isolates and previously unpublished gene sequences of an H6N8 virus isolated from ostriches in the Leeu Gamka region in 1998 (A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98). We show that two distinct genetic H6N2 strains (sublineage I and II) circulate in the Camperdown region and then spread to other regions. Sublines I and II shared a recent common H6N2 ancestry that emerged from a reclassification event between two South African ostrich isolates A/Ostrich/South Africa/9508103/95 and (H9N2) A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 ( H6N8). In addition, H6N2 sublineage I viruses had a variety of molecular genetic markers, including a 22 amino acid stem deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, a predicted increase of N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the HA protein gene. Associated with the adaptation of AI viruses to chickens. The H6N2 NS1 and PB1 genes shared recent common ancestry with those of contemporary Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses.

13,Phylogenetic analysis (2001-2005) of low pathogenic avian influenza H6N2 viruses from chicken outbreaks indicates that they are reassortants of historical ostrich low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 and H6N8 viruses.,"Low pathogenicity (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) avian influenza viruses are periodically isolated from South African ostriches, but in 2002 the first recorded LPAI (H6N2) outbreak in South African chickens occurred on commercial farms in the Camperdown region of KwaZulu. /Natal (KZN) Province. Sequence analysis of all eight genes was performed and phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidas sequences. Results from phylogenetic analyzes showed that H6N2 chicken viruses most likely arose from a reclassification between two South African LPAI ostrich isolates: an H9N2 virus isolated in 1995 and an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998. last common ancestor. One of these sublines was confined to the KZN province. The neuraminidase gene contains deletions of 22 amino acids associated with adaptation to growth in chickens in the NA stem region, while the other group lacks the NA stem deletion but has spread to commercial farms in other provinces. The persistence of certain H6N2 types in some regions for at least 2 years supports reports suggesting that H6N2 viruses from Asia and Southern California can form stable strains in chickens. It is likely that the ostrich H6N8 and H9N2 progenitors of chicken H6N2 viruses were introduced into ostriches by wild birds. Ostriches, where AI infections are often subclinical, can serve as mixing vessels for LPAI strains that occasionally spread to other poultry.",,"Abolnik, C.;Bisschop, S. P. R.;Gerdes, G.

15,Characterization of pigeon paramyxoviruses (Newcastle disease virus) isolated in South Africa from 2001 to 2006,"Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), a variant of the Newcastle disease virus that primarily affects pigeons and pigeons, has been isolated in South Africa since the mid-1980s. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 viruses have been introduced multiple times to South Africa, based on the existence of two distinct lineages, 4bi and 4bii, which have been circulating in Europe and the Far East since the early 1990s. In 2006, a PPMV-1 virus was isolated from an African black hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which was acutely infected with PPMV-1 and died, possibly after clearing infected pigeon carcasses in the area, because a closely related strain of PPMV-1 was from pigeons collected nearby. has also been isolated.

16,"Characterization of the highly pathogenic influenza A virus of the H5N2 subtype, isolated from ostriches in South Africa in 2004.","Objectives: The strain HPAI H5N2, which caused an epidemic in ostriches in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa in 2004, was characterized. Design: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and intravenous pathogenicity (IVPI) tests, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid were applied in sera from ostrich farms in the epidemic region. Sequencing and phylogenetic comparisons were performed on HPAI H5N2 virus isolated during the epidemic. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence at the HA0 cleavage site, determined by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing, was PQREKRRKKRGLF, and thus the virus entered the definition of a highly pathogenic virus, but the virus isolated from the index is in an IVPI test condition in chickens and is highly pathogenic in this in vivo test. A value of 0.63 was recorded, which was below the criterion for viruses. A second IVPI was performed after another pass in embryonated eggs, yielding a high value of 1.19. Cloak swabs were taken from the first IVPI birds, inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs, and then a third IVPI was performed on the resulting hemagglutination, infective allantoic fluid. An index of 2.73 was recorded. Results: When testing antibodies to avian influenza in serum, HI tests appeared to be more sensitive as compared to AGID.

18,Avian influenza: Global assessment of the potential pandemic of the twenty-first century,"The emergence and subsequent spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) from Asian ancestry, and the continued spread of the Eurasian-African H5N1 epidemic to domestic, wild birds and humans, have generated unprecedented interest and threat in recent times. potential pandemic through bird-human connection. Historically, from 1878 to 1955, poultry plaque was described as a disease with high mortality in poultry in many countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Africa, and its etiology proved to be a filterable virus. From the 1930s to the 1950s, poultry plaque disappeared as an endemic disease in most parts of the world. In 1949, the first report of low virulent disease in chickens caused by the LPAI virus was reported. In 1955, the etiology of poultry plaque was determined as influenza A virus, which was later identified as the H7 subtype. In 1959, a ""chicken plaque-like"" outbreak in chickens was described, the first report of poultry plaque caused by a non-H7 AI virus, namely the first poultry plaque outbreak from the H5 subtype of AI virus. In 1961, the first wild bird infection and deaths were reported in South African ordinary terns. The first H5 and H7 LPAI viruses were identified in 1966 and 1971, respectively; before this period, only HPAI viruses had H5 and H7 subtypes. In 1970, the AGID serological test was introduced, allowing easy and rapid identification of AI virus-infected poultry flocks. In 1972, the first isolation of LPAI viruses was made in asymptomatic wild birds: ducks in the United States and shorebirds in Australia. In 1981 the term ""highly pathogenic avian flu"" was adopted as the standard nomenclature for poultry plaques and related synonyms. In 1983, LPAI virus was observed to mutate into HPAI virus during the LPAI field epidemic, and specific genomic changes were identified in the proteolytic cleavage site of hemagglutinin responsible for the virulence change. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, recognition molecular criteria were added for the classification of an AI virus as HPAI. In 2002, there were the first reported infections and deaths from the AI virus H5N1 HPAI virus in a wide variety of wild bird species. The primary purpose of this review is to highlight the global status of HPAI and provide essential information to illustrate the potential pandemic nature of the virus so that control and prevention strategies can be developed.",,"Abubakar, M.

19,Phylogenetic and molecular characterization of the coronavirus affecting bovine and avian species in Cuba.,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are veterinary important pathogens affecting birds and cattle in Cuba; however, the molecular characteristics and genetic diversity of these viruses are unknown. This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and genetic diversity of both agents based on the spike S gene. A molecular analysis was performed from BCoV field strains collected between 2009 and 2011, and phylogenetic studies were performed using partial or complete S gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. In addition, phylogenetic inference studies have been carried out recently in the S1 region of IBV isolates. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were placed in a single cluster supported by 100% bootstrap and posterior probability values of 1.00. Cuban BCoV sequences were also clustered with US BCoV strains corresponding to GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common source for these viruses. This phylogenetic cluster was also the only sequence group in which no recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in Cuban strains, four were unique. On the other hand, two putative genotypes that were genetically different from the Massachusetts genotype H120 used in the Cuban vaccination program were found in the evaluated herds. Also, a potential nephropathogenic IBV isolate has been found for the first time in Cuba. This research won the 2012 Prize of the Cuban National Academy of Sciences.

20,Viromic Analysis of Incoming Wastewater Input into a River Basin Reveals Diverse RNA Viruses Community,"Detection of viruses in the medium is highly dependent on PCR-based approaches that require reference sequences for primer design. While this strategy can accurately detect known viruses, it will not find new genotypes or emerging and invasive viral strains. In this study, we investigated the use of viromics, such as high-throughput sequencing of the viral fraction of the biosphere, to detect human/animal pathogenic RNA viruses in the Conwy river basin in Wales, UK. Using a combination of filtration and nuclease treatment, we extracted the viral fraction from wastewater and estuarine river water and sediment, followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on the Illumina HiSeq platform for the discovery of RNA virus genomes. We found a higher RNA virus richness in wastewater samples than in river water and sediment, and we generated a complete norovirus genotype GI.2 genome from wastewater effluents, which was not detected simultaneously by conventional reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). . The simultaneous presence of various rotavirus signatures in wastewater demonstrated the potential for zoonotic infection in the region and suggested streams from pig farms as a possible source of these viruses. Our results suggest that viromics can be an important tool in the discovery of pathogenic viruses in the environment and can be used to inform and optimize reference-based detection methods provided appropriate and rigorous controls are included. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Enteric viruses cause gastrointestinal disease and are usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route. When wastewater is released into river systems, these viruses can contaminate the environment. Our results suggest that we can use viromics to find the range of potentially pathogenic viruses found in the environment and identify common genotypes. The ultimate goal is to inform reference-based detection methods and water quality management by tracking the fate of these pathogenic viruses from the source to the point where they pose a threat to human health.",,"Adriaenssens, E.

21,Prevalence of swine parvoviruses in some South African pig herds with a history of swine circovirus type 2 infection,"Classical swine parvovirus is an important pathogen of reproductive disorders in pigs with a confirmed history of global distribution. However, detection of many new porcine parvoviruses has been increasing over the past few years, but there is a lack of information about the occurrence and prevalence of these viruses in South Africa. Molecular detection of some known parvoviruses, namely porcine parvoviruses (PPVs) - 1, 2, 3 and 4, porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV1/2) was carried out from 110 randomly selected archived pigs. Samples were collected in 2015 and 2016. Samples were obtained from farms previously screened and confirmed infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), with incidence at farm level ranging from 5.6% to 60%. The findings showed that all parvoviruses screened were present as: PPV1 (29.1%), PPV2 (21.8%), PPV3 (5.5%), PPV4 (43.6%), PBo-likeV (21.8%), and PBoV1/2 (44.6). %). The frequency of double infections of viruses was as high as 18.2% of PPV2/PPV4 and PPV4/PBoVs; 17.3% and 7.3% of the scanned samples showed multiple infections of three and four viruses, respectively. Further phylogenetic analyzes of the partial sequences PPV1, 2 and PBoV1/2 showed two major divisions for each of the viruses.

Studies by different researchers showed some similarity to myxoma virus and swine pox virus, while another study characterized COTV SPAn232 as a strain of vaccinia virus. Due to the lack of consensus, we performed an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximum efficiency at approximately 24 to 48 hours, accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic early/late viral protein synthesis pattern. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells until 4 days after infection and only formed viral plaques 8 days later. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV using a combination of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies 454 and Illumina. A unique contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp was obtained, containing 185 genes, including 90 conserved in all cordopoxviruses. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) related to host defense evasion, including two novel genes encoding CC chemokine-like proteins, each in duplicate. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest amino acid identity scores with Cervidpoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus. However, COTV was grouped as an independent branch within this branch, which clearly excludes its classification as an Orthopoxvirus. Therefore, our data suggest that COTV may represent a new genus of smallpox virus. Â© 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Afonso, P. P.;Silva, P. M.;Schnellrath, L. C.;Jesus, D.

23,"Implementation of emergency immunization and genetic differentiation between rough skin disease outbreaks, field isolates and vaccine virus strains in Greece during 2015-16","The aim of this study is to present epizootiological data on tuberous skin disease (LSD) outbreaks in Greece in 2015-16, together with laboratory data on genetic differentiation among field isolates after emergency vaccination and complete eradication. and live attenuated vaccine virus strains. Descriptive geographic chronology analysis was performed to present the progressive westward shift of outbreaks as well as the absence of other outbreaks in previously affected regional units where high vaccination coverage was achieved. Isolation and molecular characterization of LSDV was performed from the first case recorded in Greece (Evros/GR/1 isolate). Two live attenuated LSD vaccinia viruses currently used for emergency immunization in Greece were sequenced and compared to the Evros/GR/15 isolate at 3 genomic regions (GPCR gene, RPO30 gene and partial LSDV126/LSDV127 genes). Sequence comparisons revealed significant differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and vaccine strains. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in the Evros/GR/15 isolate being classified in the same sequence as all field LSDV isolates, while the vaccine strains were grouped in a separate cluster within the LSDV sequence. Additional samples from animals presenting skin nodules (NÂ =Â 13) were characterized by sequencing in the 3 genomic regions mentioned above. Among them, attenuated vaccine virus was detected in 5 vaccinated animals. A PCR-RFLP method targeting the LSDV127 gene was developed and proved to be able to discriminate between the characterized area and the vaccine strains. The findings of this study confirm the importance of timely and intensive vaccines for epizootic control of LSDV and the genetic differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and vaccine strains. This provides the basis for the development of PCR-based DIVA assays that will be of paramount importance for effective disease surveillance and stigma during LSD vaccination campaigns.",,"Agianniotaki, E.

24,Spread of newly emerging infectious laryngotracheitis viruses in Australia,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an important viral disease of chickens in many countries around the world. In this report, the status of ILT in Australia was used as a model to assess the evolution of ILT viruses (ILTVs). Due to its geographic isolation, Australia was home to a distinct lineage of ILT viruses (ILTV) until 2007. However, an examination of the ILT viruses (ILTV) involved in the outbreaks between 2007 and 2009 revealed that two new viral viruses were responsible for most of the outbreaks. genotypes, class 8 and class 9. These two recombinant viruses were found to arise as a result of recombination between previously existing live vaccine strains (SA2 and A20) and another live vaccine strain (Serva), which was introduced to the country in 2007. recombinant ILTVs were also shown to have significantly higher virulence and replication capacity compared to the previously dominant ILTV, class 2. In the current study, examination of multiple ILTVs isolated from outbreaks between 2009 and 2015 revealed the emergence of another recombinant virus. (class 10) It appears to have become a dominant genotype in New South Wales. But in Victoria, recombinant class 9 gradually became the dominant virus, replacing class 2. Therefore, there was an unusual pattern in the geographic spread of newly emerging viruses in different states of the country. These results show that ILTV is rapidly evolving towards greater transmittance and hence its capacity to diffuse into ILTV-free areas.",,"Agnew-Crumpton, R.;Vaz, P. K.;Devlin, J.

25,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of Orf virus in the Kashmir Himalayas,"Orf virus (ORFV) is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily infects sheep and goats and is responsible for significant economic losses. ORFV is endemic in all major sheep and goat breeding regions of the world, including the Indian subcontinent. However, the nature of ORFV circulating among sheep and goats in the Kashmir Himalayas has not yet been characterized. In this study, we described natural outbreaks of ORFV in sheep and goats of the Kashmir Himalayas. We detected the presence of ORFV in the crustal lesion by PCR amplification of the major envelope protein (B2L) gene. We sequenced the virus interferon resistance (VIR) gene and determined their phylogenetic relationships to published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VIR gene revealed that ORFV isolated from the Kashmir Himalayas split into two main clusters. Sheep isolates showed genetic homology with sheep strains reported from Greece and Italy, while the goat-specific strain showed homology with goat strains reported from China. This study demonstrates the presence of ORFV infection in sheep and goats and reports the first phylogenetic analysis of ORFV strains common in the Kashmir Himalayas.",,"Ahanger, S.

26,"Host-parasite relationships of bacteria and phages can be revealed by Oligostickiness, a measure of relaxed sequence similarity.","Motivation: Recent metagenome analysis produces large numbers of host unassigned viruses. Assigning viruses to their hosts has been a painstaking and difficult task to date, although fundamentally important not only for virology but also for the prevention of epidemics. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in the same microscopic appearance. We have now tried a computational approach based on genome sequences of bacteria and phages and introduced a physicochemical parameter, the oligo-adhesiveness-derived SOSS (oligo-adhesiveness similarity score set), a measure of the binding affinity of the oligonucleotides to template DNA. Results: We were able to confirm host-parasite associations and phages of bacteria by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a significantly higher SOSS than host-unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, based on SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have markedly higher similarity to their host than non-lysogenic (jumping or virulent) ones such as fd and T4. (host: E. coli) or phage gamma and PZA (host: B.subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning unknown viruses to the host. We also investigated the association in codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, and obtained evidence supporting the hypothesis that higher SOSS values are the result of co-existence in the same environment and may cause common-bias mutation. . Thus, lysogenic phages that stay inside for a longer period of time become host-like. Â© Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

27,Genetic diversity and comparison of diagnostic tests for characterization of foot and mouth disease virus strains from Pakistan 2008–2012,"We report the laboratory analysis of 125 clinical samples from suspected cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in cattle and Asian buffaloes collected in Pakistan between 2008 and 2012. Of these samples, 89 were found to contain viral RNA by rRT-PCR. It was found that 88 of them contained virus isolation (VI) and infectious FMD virus (FMDV), and there was a strong correlation between these tests (ÎºÂ =Â 0.96). Samples that were VI-positive were serotyped by antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence collection and analysis. Sequence data identified FMDV serotypes A (nÂ =Â 13), O (nÂ =Â 36) and Asia-1 (nÂ =Â 41), including three samples in which both Asia-1 and O serotypes were detected. Serotype A viruses were classified into three different Iran-05 subsets: HER-10, FAR-11 and ESF-10. All serotype Asia-1 were in Group VII (Sindh-08 strain) in a genetic clade different from viruses isolated before 2010. All serotypes O were classified as PanAsia-2 in two distinct subsets: ANT-10 and BAL-09. Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotype determination, the overall sensitivity of Ag-ELISA to accurately detect serotype was 74%, and the serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% for Asia-1, and 89% for O. The serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 93% for Asia-1, and 94% for O. Interestingly, 12 of the 13 serotype A viruses were not detected by Ag-ELISA. This study confirms previous accounts of regional genetic diversity of FMDV in Pakistan and highlights the importance of continued validation of diagnostic tests for rapidly evolving pathogens such as FMDV.",,"Ahmed, Z.;Pauszek, S.

29,Whole genome analysis of porcine cobuviruses from pig feces in Japan,"Porcine cobuviruses (PoKoVs) are ubiquitous in pig populations worldwide and are thought to be enteric viruses in pigs. Although PoKoVs have been detected in pigs from Japan, complete genome data are not available for Japanese PoKoVs. In this study, close to 24 complete or complete sequences of the PoKoV genome from 10 diarrheal stools and 14 non-diarrheal stools of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomic approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2%-100% identity with their full coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and 85.1%-98.3% closest association with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of the 24 Japanese PoKoVs performed a 90 nt deletion in the 2D coding region. Phylogenetic tree analyzes revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to geographic origin regions and phylogenetic trees of L, P1, P2 and P3 genetic regions showed divergent topologies. Similarity plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed somewhat different patterns of similarity between strains from the same farm origins, suggesting that recombination events occurred. These results suggest that various strains of PoKoV are common and not geographically restricted in pig farms worldwide, and coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs.",,"Akagami, M.;Ito, M.;Niira, K.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Kishimoto, M.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Oka, T.;Ichimaru, T.;Yamasato, H.;Ouchi, Y.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1464-9,1
30,Two new 'legumoviruses' (Begomovirus genus) naturally infecting soybeans in Nigeria,"Two novel 'legumoviruses' (genus Begomovirus; family Geminiviridae) that naturally infect soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Nigeria were molecularly characterized. Based on the characteristic symptoms in Soybean, the two viruses are tentatively named Soybean mild speck virus (SbMMV) and Soybean chlorotic spot virus (SbCBV). SbCBV has a bipartite genome, whereas SbMMV has only one DNA A component. The DNA A component of SbMMV is 2,768 nucleotides (nt) long, and the DNA A and DNA B components of SbCBV are 2,708 and 2,647 nt in length, respectively. In pairwise comparisons, the DNA component of SbMMV and SbCBV showed 62% nt sequence identity, indicating that these two viruses were different. DNA A of SbMMV contains two virions and four complementary-sense open reading frames, while that of SbCBV lacks virus-sense AV2, a signature gene found in 'Old World' begomoviruses. A pairwise comparison with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of other begomoviruses in the databases showed that SbCBV had a maximum identity of 74% with cowpea golden mosaic virus, and SbMMV had a maximum identity of 65% with mungbean yellow mosaic India virus and kudzu mosaic virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA A component of SbCBV and SbMMV along with those of other begomoviruses found in databases showed clustering of the two viruses within the 'legumovirus' clade of the begomovirus phylogenetic tree. In addition, the DNA A and B components of SbCBV from Centrosema pubescens Benth were found to be identical to those from soybean, suggesting that the legume wild species is a potential alternative host for the virus. As soybeans are an promoted crop, the identification of two different begomoviruses that naturally infect soybeans in Nigeria suggests the emergence of 'legumoviruses' in plant species native to Africa and underlines potential threats to sustainable soybean cultivation on the African continent. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",,"Alabi, O.

31,Serological and Antigenic Characteristics of Malaysian Orf Virus Isolates - An In-Vitro Comparative Study,"Three Malaysian orf virus isolates from goats (GV1, GV2 and GV3) were compared with three orf viruses from sheep (LBV Malaysia isolate, ORFII and NZ2 reference strains) for serological properties and protein profiles. Serological tests such as the cross-agar gel precipitation test (AGPT), serum neutralization test (SNT), ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence test (IIF), and indirect immunoperoxidase test (IIP) revealed that the viruses were highly correlated. However, serotyping of these isolates using homologous and heterologous titration of hyperimmune sera (HIS) in SNT and ELISA showed opposite results and did not allow classification of these viruses as of goat and sheep origin. Protein analysis of these isolates was performed using SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot and physical staining, and immunodetection of blotted protein profiles. The results revealed that these isolates differed mainly in the 41.5, 39.5 and 37.5 kD polypeptide bands. These analytical techniques allowed these isolates to be classified into four groups, GV1 and GV2 in the first, GV3 in the second, LBV and ORFII in the third, and NZ2 in the fourth.",,"Alajeeli, K.

However, the virus has been associated with multiple fatal outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in non-human primates (NHPs), particularly cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) originating in the Philippines. In addition, Reston virus has been isolated from domestic pigs in the Philippines. To better understand virus spread events and potential adaptation to novel hosts, whole genome sequences of representative Reston virus isolates were obtained using next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach, and comparative genomic analysis and virus fitness analyzes were performed.

These were compared with the sequences of 164 isolates published in GenBank, and the resulting alignment was analyzed phylogenetically using maximum likelihood. The results are presented as unrooted phylogenetic trees. In summary, the isolates were broadly divided into six distinct groups (lineage 1 to 6). Lines 3 and 4 are further subdivided into four sublines (a through d) and line 5 into five lineages (a through e). Significant genetic heterogeneity was detected in avian paramyxoviruses type 1, which appears to be affected by host, time, and geographic origin.

Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in the feces of diseased piglets, while no other pathogens were identified. Clinical disease was reproduced in experimentally infected piglets, yielding 11 RVB gene segments for strain Buryat15 with the RVB genotype constellation G12-P[4]-I13-R4-C4-M4-A8-N10-T4-E4-H7. This genotype constellation has also been described in the United States.

35,Long view: a selective review of 40 years of Newcastle disease research,"This review was written for the series, which celebrates its 40th anniversary since the first issue of Avian Pathology. The authors' aim was to cover the advances in Newcastle disease (ND) research that they have deemed important over the past 40 years. During these 40 years there have been various panzootics of this serious disease in poultry, and for the last 30 years there has been a continuous panzootic spread to wild birds and poultry in domestic pigeons. The 40-year period began with severe worldwide epidemics of ND, which served as a major impetus for ND research work. Although early studies were concerned with controlling disease, particularly by developing and developing new vaccines and vaccine regimens, even before the 1970s the ND virus was seen as a useful laboratory virus for replication and virulence studies. This review covers historical developments in the following areas: understanding the molecular basis of virulence; epidemiology and relationship of both antigenic and genetically different ND strains; emergence of virulent strains and their relationship to low virulence viruses; sequencing and understanding the viral genome and genes; development of rapid molecular-based diagnostic tests; and the phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of the ND virus.

Recently, reproducible (substrate-to-substrate), spatially homogeneous (over large areas) SERS active substrates have been commercialized and are now commercially available. We used these patterned surfaces to obtain SERS spectral signatures of intact bovine papular stomatitis, pseudocowpox and Yaba monkey tumor viruses. The distinctive spectral signature features make it possible to distinguish between these genetically distinct Poxviridae-Chordopoxvirinae virions. In addition, partial least squares, a multivariate calibration method, has been used to develop useful personal computer-derived algorithms for the classification of unknown Parapoxvirus (for example, bovine papular stomatitis virus and pseudocowpox virus) samples based on SERS spectral signatures alone. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing the application of commercially available (COTS) SERS active substrates to the identification of intact pox viruses.",,"Alexander, T.

Here, we investigate the role of AI H5N1 in the acute respiratory disease outbreaks that occurred in several commercial poultry farms in Egypt in 2011 and describe the pathology caused by the virus during the epidemic. 21 poultry farms with a history of acute respiratory symptoms and high mortality rates were screened for AI H5N1. Virus identification was based on the hemagglutination inhibition test and PCR detection and sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Virus distribution was determined by immunohistochemical staining of AI antigens in the organs of infected birds. Standard H&E staining was performed for histological examination of the affected organs. 81% of the birds examined, representing 100% of the screened farms, were positive for AI H5N1 virus.

38,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyzes of the complete genomes of two novel field isolates of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus,"Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV, family Bromoviridae) is found worldwide and has long been used as a model virus, but there is no data on the genetic diversity of field isolates. Recently, two new field isolates of CCMV from cowpea (Car1 and Car2) showed distinct phenotypic symptoms when inoculated into cowpea. CCMV-Car1 induced severe mosaic and intervascular chlorosis, while CCMV-Car2 produced mild mottling and leaf curl. Both isolates produced asymptomatic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. The complete genomes of both isolates were amplified, cloned and sequenced by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers against the CCMV sequences available in the GenBank database. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared between novel sequenced CCMV isolates and three previously characterized CCMV strains (T, M1 and R). Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA 1 sequence showed that CCMV-Car1 was in a separate branch from the rest of the CCMV isolates, while CCMV-Car2 was grouped together with CCMV-R. Two main groupings were obtained on the basis of RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences. One group contained isolates CCMV-Car1 and CCMV-Car2, while the other contained strains CCMV-T, CCMV-M1 and CCMV-R. Recombination programs detected a potential recombination event in the RNA 1 sequence of the CCMV-Car2 isolate, but not in the RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences. The results showed that both mutations and recombination play an important role in the genetic diversity of these two novel CCMV isolates. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Ali, A.;Shafiekhani, M.;Olsen, J.",2011.0,,10.1007/s11262-011-0613-9,0

We developed a system for large-scale molecular virus screening of clinical samples based on host DNA depletion, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to pooled human respiratory samples. Initial experiments detected seven human virus strains without the use of any specific reagents. Among the viruses detected were a coronavirus and a parvovirus, both of which were unidentified at the time. Parvovirus, provisionally termed human bocavirus, was in a retrospective clinical study that was detected in 17 additional patients and was associated with lower respiratory tract infections in children. The molecular virus screening procedure provides a culture-independent solution to the problem of detecting unknown virus strains in single or pooled samples.

43,Estimation of viral richness from shotgun metagenomes using a frequency counting approach,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are important drivers of ecosystem functions, but little is known about the vast majority of viruses. Viral shotgun metagenomics enables exploration of broad ecological questions in phage communities. An ecological feature is species richness, which is the number of different species in a community. Viruses do not have a similar phylogenetic mark to the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to predict richness, and thus contiguous spectra are used to quantify the number of virus taxa in a given community. A contig spectrum is constructed from a viral shotgun metagenome by pooling random sequence reads into groups of overlapping (contig) sequences and counting the number of sequences grouped in each contig. Available tools for analyzing adjacent spectra to estimate phage richness are limited based on sequencing abundance data. RESULTS: We present statistical estimates of virus richness from contig spectra. The CatchAll program (http://www.northeastern.edu/catchall/) was used to analyze adjacent spectra for frequency number data rather than sequencing abundance, thus making formal statistical analyzes possible. Also, the effect of potentially spurious low-frequency counts on wealth estimates was minimized by two methods, empirical and statistical. The results show higher viral richness estimates than previous calculations in almost all media analyzed, including pig feces and purified fresh water. RESULTS: CatchAll yielded consistent richness estimates among viral metagenomes from the same or similar environments. In addition, analysis of pooled viral metagenomes from different environments via mixed contiguous spectra resulted in greater richness estimates than that of component metagenomes. Using CatchAll to analyze contig spectra will provide statistical richness measures, improving richness estimates from viral shotgun metagenomes, particularly large datasets.",,"Allen, H.

44,Antibiotics in feed induce prophages in pig fecal microbiomes,"Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool to improve feed efficiency and prevent disease in agricultural animals, but the full extent of their side effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, a side effect may be prophage induction in the gut microbiome in general. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sul-famethazine and penicillin]) on porcine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug-resistant efflux pumps, were identified in viromes, but in-feed antibiotics did not cause significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in medicated porcine viromes than in unmedicated porcine viromes, suggesting that prophages were induced by antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacteria population dynamics were also examined. We observed a reduction in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the ""kill the winner"" ecological model of population dynamics in the pig fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are affected by phages and prophage induction is a side effect of in-feed antibiotics. Â© 2011 Allen et al.",,"Allen, H. K.;Looft, T.;Bayles, D.

47,Epidemiological study of air filtration systems to prevent PRRSV infection in large herds of pigs,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most economically important pathogen in the US swine industry. Aerosol transmission between flocks is a major concern in pig-dense areas, and filtration of incoming air along with standard biosecurity procedures has been shown to prevent PRRSV from infecting sensitive flocks. To quantify the effect of air filtration on reducing the risk of PRRSV outbreaks, we compared the incidence rate of new PRRSV entries in 20 filtered and 17 unfiltered control pig herds in a pig-dense region of North America during a 7-year study period. Novel virus entry events were detected by phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV ORF5 gene sequences. Putative novel viruses were identified as exogenous (introduced) based on ORF5 nucleotide sequence differences compared to previous farm isolates. The effect of rank difference cut-off values between 2% and 10% on case definition and relative risk was evaluated. Unfiltered farms suffered about 0.5 outbreaks per year with a seasonal increase in risk during cold periods. Prior to filtration, the baseline risk was about 0.75 per year on treatment farms, about 50% higher than on control farms. Air filtration significantly reduced the risk of PRRSV entry events to 0.06-0.22 outbreaks per year, depending on the thresholds used to classify a virus isolate as new to the flock. Overall, air filtration resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in the risk of introduction of new PRRSV; this suggests that in large pig farms with good biosecurity in pig-dominated areas, about four-fifths of PRRSV outbreaks can be attributed to aerosol transmission. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Alonso, C.;Murtaugh, M.

48,Characterization of the H5N1 influenza a virus that caused the first highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in Saudi Arabia,"Introduction: Saudi Arabia (SA) experienced a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in domestic birds in 2007. Methodology: 43 hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes of HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. Fully sequenced genes were made for comparison with other viral HA and NA gene sequences found in public databases. Results: Molecular characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct segments of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene showed that the virus of 2.2.2 contained the sequence SPQGERRRK-R/G at the cleavage site, while the virus of 2.3.1 contained the sequence SPQRERRRK-R/G. In addition, several mutations with amino acid substitutions, such as M226I, at the N-bond glycosylation site were detected in two of these isolates. The amino acid sequence of the NA gene showed a deletion of 20 amino acids in the NA stem region, which is essential for increased virulence of influenza viruses and their adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. Because close contact between humans and birds is inevitable, a thorough understanding of virus epidemiology, factors influencing virus spread, and molecular characterization, such as the phylogeny and substitution rates of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region, is needed. Conclusion: Two genetically distinct clades were found circulating in the country, possibly leading to recombination and the emergence of more virulent viral strains. These findings could help authorities develop control measures against these viruses.",,"Al-Qahtani, A. A.;Mubin, M.;Almajhdi, F. N.;Alarifi, S.;Cruz, D. M. D.;ul Rehman, M. S. N.;Ismail, M.

50,Molecular characterization of the first strains of bovine herpes virus 4 (BoHV-4) isolated from in vitro bovine embryo production in Argentina,"Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is increasingly recognized as responsible for various problems of the reproductive system. The virus mainly infects blood mononuclear cells and shows specific tropism for vascular endothelium, reproductive and fetal tissues. Epidemiological studies reveal its impact on reproductive performance, and its presence at various sites in the reproductive system highlights its potential contamination in transfer-stage embryos. This study describes the biological and genetic characterization of BoHV-4 strains isolated from an in vitro bovine embryo production system. BoHV-4 strains were isolated in 2011 and 2013 from granulosa cells and bovine oocytes from batches of ovaries collected at a local abattoir, which were used as ""starting material"" for the in vitro production of bovine embryos. Compatible BoHV-4-CPE was observed in co-culture of MDBK cells with granulosa cells and oocytes. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR experiments targeting the three ORFs of the viral genome. Phylogenetic analyzes of the strains show that they are evolutionarily unrelated. Thus, it is possible, at least in Argentina, that BoHV-4 ovarian infections have occurred regularly throughout the evolution of the virus, and this may have implications for in vitro embryo production systems. Thus, although BoHV-4 does not appear to be a common risk factor for in vitro embryo production, data are still limited. This study demonstrates the potential for BoHV-4 transmission through embryo transfer. Furthermore, the high variability among BoHV-4 strains isolated from cows aborted in Argentina highlights the importance of further research into the role of this virus as a potential agent to cause reproductive disease in cattle. Genetic characterization of isolated strains provides data to better understand the pathogenesis of BoHV-4 infections. It will also lead to fundamental understandings of the molecular aspects of the virus and the circulatory pathways of these strains in flocks.",,"Altamiranda, E. G.;Manrique, J. M.;PÃ©rez, S.

54,"Broad-spectrum, single-step reverse transcription PCR amplification of the neuraminidase gene from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus.","BACKGROUND: The emergence of highly pathogenic strains of Influenza A virus in a variety of human and animal hosts with wide geographic distribution has highlighted the importance of rapid identification and subtyping of the virus for epidemic management and treatment. Type A virus can be subtyped according to viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Here, we review the current specificity and amplification of published primers for the subtype of neuraminidase genes and describe a novel broad-spectrum primer pair capable of detecting all 9 neuraminidase subtypes. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers with M13 tags, NA8F-M13 and NA10R-M13, were designed from these regions and used to construct a 253 bp cDNA product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) cases using a contact protocol with RNA from more than 32 different cultured influenza A virus strains representing 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Frozen blind clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates were also tested and mostly belonged to the N2 subtype. The amplified region was directly sequenced and then used in database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. The generated RT-PCR fragment contains H274Y, one of the mutation sites associated with oseltamivir resistance. CONCLUSION: Our one-step RT-PCR assay after sequencing is a fast, accurate and specific method for detecting and subtyping different neuraminidase subtypes from a range of host species and different geographic locations.",,"Alvarez, A.

55,Double-stranded RNA high-throughput sequencing reveals a novel cytorhabdovirus in the common bean transgenic line resistant to bean gold mosaic virus.,"Using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) high-throughput sequencing, we identified five RNA viruses in a common bean transgenic line resistant to bean gold mosaic virus (BGMV) with symptoms of viral infection. Of the viruses identified, four have already been identified as infecting beans (cowpea mild spot virus, bean rugose mosaic virus, Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 1 and Phaseolus vulgaris alphaendornavirus 2), and one is a new plant rhabdovirus (genus Cytorhabdovirus), tentatively named. bean-associated cytorhabdovirus (BaCV). The BaCV genome presented all five open reading frames (ORFs) found in most rhabdoviruses: nucleoprotein (N) (ORF1) (451 amino acids, aa), phosphoprotein (P) (ORF2) (445 aa), matrix (M) (ORF4) (287 aa), glycoprotein (G) (ORF5) (520 aa), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (ORF6) (114 aa), as well as a putative movement protein (P3) (ORF3) (189 aa) and the hypothetical small protein P4. The predicted BaCV proteins were compared with homologous proteins from the closest cytorhabdoviruses, and a low level of sequence identity (15%-39%) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis shows that BaCV clusters with yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus (YmCaV) and rice strip mosaic virus (RSMV). Overall, our results provide strong evidence that BaCV is indeed a new strain of virus from the genus Cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), which was the first rhabdovirus to infect beans.",,"Alves-Freitas, D.

57,Bovine-like coronaviruses in domestic and wild ruminants,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide range of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are recognized for their ability to alter tissue tropism, overcome interspecies barriers, and adapt to ecological variations. The natural genetic diversity of CoVs, caused by the accumulation of point mutations and the high frequency of homologous recombination, is predicted to be the main determinant of these competencies. Various CoVs (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been noted to cross the interspecies barrier and induce different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is the leading cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows, and transport fever pneumonia in livestock cattle. Although long recognized as a restrictive bovine pathogen, CoVs closely related to BCoV have been identified in dogs, humans, and other ruminant species. Biological, antigenic and genetic analyzes of the so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' suggested that these viruses be classified as host-range variants rather than distinct virus strains. This review discusses the different bovine-like CoVs identified in domesticated ruminants (buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary, llama, and alpaca) and wild ruminant animals (deer, buffalo, antelope, giraffe, and wild goat). in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data demonstrate the importance of these viruses in the survival of BCoV in the wild, its spread to new geographic areas, and the continued emergence of disease outbreaks in cattle farms.",,"Amer, H.

58,Metagenomic analysis shows the diversity of fecal virome in asymptomatic pigs from East Africa.,"Pigs harbor a variety of viruses closely related to human viruses and suspected of having zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of viruses on small farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides insight into the prevalence and characteristics of viral communities and enteric viral coinfections in small farm pigs from East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to metagenomic analysis of viruses in faeces collected from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were generated and compared to sequences in the GenBank database. Blastx search results revealed that 1039 contigs (>200Â nt) were associated with viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa as they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most common contigs associated with mammalian viruses similar to members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members of the Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus genera. This is the first report of the fecal virus diversity of pig populations in East Africa. The findings of this study help to elucidate the etiology of diarrheal diseases in pigs and to identify potential zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region. More research is needed to compare the incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs to better elucidate their pathogenic role.",,"Amimo, J. O.;El Zowalaty, M.

59,Association of increased condemnation of broiler carcasses due to liver abnormalities and immunosuppressive diseases in the broiler industry in Saskatchewan,"The aim of this study was to determine the hepatitis agents observed during processing in broiler chickens. Livers of chickens with severe hepatitis lesions were collected during processing from 16 broiler farms in Saskatchewan. In addition to routine bacterial isolation and histopathological examination, serological studies for infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and Chicken anemia virus (CAV), calculation of the ratio of Fabricius (BF) bursa weight to body weight (BBW), and histopathological examination of BF were performed. Of 264 livers with large lesions, 83% had confluent multifocal necrotizing hepatitis, 16% had perihepatitis and 1% had bleeding. No definitive causative microorganisms were isolated from the hepatic lesions; however, no significant bacterial isolation has been performed. Bursal atrophy, low BBW rate, and high antibody titer to IBDV correlated with overall rejection rate (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0073, respectively). The nucleotide sequence of IBDV isolated from BF identified Delaware-E and 586 variant strains. Conflict due to hepatic lesions correlated with antibody titer to IBDV and BBW (P = 0.016 and P = 0.027). The results of this study suggest that hepatic lesions in Saskatchewan chickens are currently not caused by a primary bacterial pathogen, but are associated with indicators of immunosuppression, possibly due to variant IBDV.",,"Amini, K.;Zachar, T.;Popowich, S.;Knezacek, T.;Goodhope, B.;Willson, P.;Gomis, S.",2015.0,,,0

62,"Genetic characterization of 2008 reassortant influenza A virus (H5N1), Thailand","In January and November 2008, avian influenza outbreaks were reported in 4 provinces of Thailand. Eight Influenza A H5N1 viruses were rescued from these 2008 AI outbreaks and were extensively characterized and analyzed for nucleotide identity, genetic kinship, virulence determinants and possible reclassification sites. The results show that 2008 H5N1 viruses exhibit genetic drift features (genetic differences of less than 3%) as commonly found in influenza A viruses. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the 1st division viruses in Thailand were divided into 3 distinct clades (subdivisions 1, 1.1 and 1.2). Six of the 8 H5N1 isolates were identified as reclassified H5N1 viruses, while the other isolates belonged to an original H5N1 strain. These viruses have undergone interlinear reclassification between subgroups 1.1 and 1.2 and thus represent the newly reclassified 2008 H5N1 viruses. The reclassified viruses acquired gene segments from H5N1, subsection 1.1 (PA, HA, NP, and M) and subsection 1.2 (PB2, PB1, NA, and NS) in Thailand. Bootscan analysis of the combined whole genome sequences of 2008 H5N1 viruses supported reclassification regions between subdivision 1.1 and 1.2 viruses. Based on an estimation of the time of the most recent common ancestor of the 2008 H5N1 viruses, the potential point of genetic reclassification of viruses can be traced back to 2006. Genetic analysis of 2008 H5N1 viruses showed that it was the most virulence determinant of all 8 viruses. genes of viruses remained unchanged. In summary, two dominant H5N1 strains were in circulation in 2008. The original CUK2-like lineage circulated mainly in central Thailand, and the reclassified lineage (sub-clans 1.1 and 1.2) circulated predominantly in sub-northern Thailand. To avoid reclassification, consideration should be given to the prevention of H5N1 viruses circulating in high-risk areas. In addition, surveillance and whole genome sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be routinely performed to monitor genetic drift of the virus and newly reclassified strains, particularly in light of the potential reclassification between avian and mammalian H5N1 viruses.",,"Amonsin, A.;Lapkuntod, J.;Suwannakarn, K.;Kitikoon, P.;Suradhat, S.;Tantilertcharoen, R.;Boonyapisitsopa, S.;Bunpapong, N.;Wongphatcharachai, M.;Wisedchanwet, T.;Theamboonlers, A.;Poovorawan, Y.;Sasipreeyajan, J.;Thanawongnuwech, R.",2010.0,2016-09-01 00:00:00,,0
63,"Multi-year evolutionary dynamics of West Nile virus in suburb of Chicago, USA, 2005-2007","West Nile virus evolved in concert with its spread in North America, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the virus at the local scale. We analyzed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected from a known transmission 'hotspot' in the suburbs of Chicago, USA in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Within this approximately 11 × 14 km area, the viral envelope gene increased in genetic diversity at the nucleotide level by about 0.1% per year. Each year, viral diversity was higher in 'residential' areas characterized by dense housing than in more open 'urban green space' areas such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyzes showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Recent analyzes of common ancestry suggest that WNV in 2005 and 2006 may have predominantly originated from viruses present in 2004 and 2005, respectively, but WNV in 2007 had an older common ancestry, perhaps predominantly mixed. or indicates an external origin.

In contrast, nucleotide and amino acid phylogenetic tree analyzes of the M RNA segment were in agreement with topologies obtained using the BI and NJ methods. Therefore, differential genogrouping of Akabane virus isolates should be performed using the M RNA segment.

66,Whole genome analysis of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus identifies restricted genome constellations and preferential reclassification,"Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is an orbivirus transmitted by Culicoides that causes hemorrhagic disease in wild and domestic ruminants. A collection of 44 EHDVs isolated from 2008 to 2012 were fully sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype in all years except 2012, when serotype 6 viruses represented 63% of the isolates. High genetic similarity (>94% identity) between serotype 1 and 2 virus VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2 and NS3 segments precluded the identification of reclassification events for these segments. In addition, there was little genetic variation (>96% identity) within the VP2, VP5 and VP7 serotypes. Preferential reassortment within homologous serotype was observed for VP2, VP5 and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic type 6, and the remaining segments were most similar to type 2 viruses. These results show that reclassification between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires preservation of the VP2, VP5, and VP7 segment constellation, while type 6 viruses only require VP2 and VP5 and are limited to the type 2 lineage VP7. Because type 6 VP2 and VP5 segments are specifically identified in viruses with type 2-derived VP7, these results indicate functional complementation between type 2 and type 6 VP7 proteins. © 2014 SGM.",,"Anbalagan, S.;Cooper, E.;Klumper, P.;Simonson, R.

67,Dietary energy drives dynamic response of bovine rumen viral communities,"BACKGROUND: Rumen microbes play a greater role in host energy gain than gut-associated microbes in monogastric animals. While genome-powered developments provide access to a wide variety of uncultivated microbes, our understanding of the variables that shape rumen microbial communities is in its infancy. Viruses have been shown to affect microbial populations through numerous processes, including cell lysis and reprogramming of host metabolism. However, little is known about the processes that shape the distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses modulate microbial-driven processes in the rumen. To this end, we investigated how rumen bacterial and viral community structure and function responded in five cattle fed four randomized dietary treatments in a crossover design. RESULTS: Total digestible nutrients (TDN), a measure of dietary energy, best explained variation in bacterial and viral communities. Additional ecological drivers of viral communities included dietary zinc content and microbial functional diversity. Using partial least squares regression, we demonstrated significant associations between the abundance of 267 viral populations and the variables that drive variation in rumen viral communities. While rumen viruses were dynamic, 14 almost ubiquitous viral populations were identified, suggesting the existence of a core rumen virus composed largely of novel viruses. Furthermore, analysis of virally encoded accessory metabolic genes (AMGs) indicates that rumen viruses have glycosidic hydrolases to potentially increase the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to increase energy production. Other identified AMGs have a role in reorienting carbon to the pentose phosphate pathway and a carbon pool with folate to increase viral replication. RESULTS: We showed that rumen bacteria and viruses have differential responses and ecological drivers to dietary disruption. Our results demonstrate that rumen viruses have implications for understanding the configuration of the predefined core rumen microbiota and influencing microbial metabolism through a wide variety of AMGs. AMGs in the rumen appear to have results that are largely consistent with the established paradigm for microbial metabolism in marine systems. This work provides a basis for future hypotheses regarding the dynamics of viral-mediated processes in the rumen.",,"Anderson, C. L.;Sullivan, M. B.;Fernando, S.

This diversity has evolved through repeated transmission of IAVs from humans to pigs followed by antigenic drift in pigs. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of these diverse HA lineages in North American pigs, we performed phylogenetic analysis of 1576 H1 and 607 H3 HA gene segments, as well as 834 N1 and 1293 N2 NA gene segments and 2126 M gene segments. These data revealed annual co-circulation of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 viruses with three HA sequences representing the majority of HA sequences: 42% of H1 viruses were classified as H1Î´1 and 40.6% as H1Î³, and H3 viruses 53%, cluster IV. -A is classified as H3N2. We identified a genetically distinct minor segment, which we classified as H1Î³-2, consisting of 37 H1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013. We estimated that this clade has been circulating in pigs since about 1995, but was not detected in pigs until 2003. Although this guideline represents only 1.07% of porcine H1 sequences reported over the last 10 years, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays show that this group of viruses is antigenically distinct and is about 7 antigenic units from other H1Î³ viruses when measured using antigenic cartography. Therefore, vaccines against contemporary H1Î³ viruses are unlikely to provide cross-protection against Î³-2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these Î³-2 viruses, given their long branch lengths and gaps in detection, suggests that small virus populations may be underreported in the national dataset. The identification of these Î³-2 viruses illustrates the need for robust surveillance to capture the full range of IAVs in pigs in the USA and the importance of antigenic drift in diversification and the emergence of new antigenic variants, which complicates vaccine design in pigs.",,"Anderson, T.

69,Phylogeny-Based Global Naming System and Automated Annotation Tool for H1 Hemagglutinin Genes from Swine Flu A Viruses,"The H1 subtype of influenza A viruses (IAVs) has been circulating in pigs since the 1918 human influenza pandemic. Over time and with the aid of additional inputs from non-swine hosts, porcine H1 viruses have diversified into three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 strains were named according to colloquial context, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose strict phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of the evolution of the porcine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA). These criteria, applied to a dataset of 7,070 H1 HA sequences, gave rise to 28 different sequences as the basis for terminology. We have developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can assign these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined dataset of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct sequence more than 99% of the time. Our analyzes showed that 87% of porcine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present have HAs from 7 contemporary common circulations. Our nomenclature and web-accessible classification tool provides researchers, diagnosticians, and paramedics with an accurate method for assigning clade assignments to HA sequences. The tool can be easily updated to keep track of evolving terminology as new branches emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparison of IAVs infecting humans and pigs within and between regions and may provide insight into the diversity of swine H1 influenza virus and its impact on vaccine strain selection, diagnostic reagents and test performance, thereby simplifying such communication. data. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A basic purpose in biological sciences is to identify groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and to name these groups. For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in pigs, understanding the genetic lineage of the hemagglutinin (HA) of a circulating strain aids vaccine antigen selection and allows inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reports of the H1 virus HA in swine often relied on incriminating and stigmatizing geographic place names and colloquial names, making comparisons between studies difficult. To overcome this, we developed an adaptive terminology using quantifiable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 globular porcine IAVs. We've also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this terminology. This classification system provides terminology to aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of significant changes in swine IAVs, and allows swine IAVs to be discussed in a common context between animal and human health initiatives.",,"Anderson, T.

70,Genetic classification of 'Norwalk-like viruses',"The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction has been used worldwide for the diagnosis of Norwalk-like virus (NLV) infection, but a generally accepted genetic classification scheme has not been established. Amino acid sequences from four regions of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) were used to analyze 101 NLV strains, including 2 bovine strains. On the basis of this analysis, a genetic classification scheme is proposed that divides 99 human strains into 2 main genetic groups consisting of 5 and 10 genetic clusters, respectively. The 2 cattle strains form a newly identified third major genetic group consisting of 2 putative clusters represented by each strain. This classification scheme is well supported by analysis of all ORF2 sequences from the 38 strains selected to represent the genetic diversity of the human strains used above. This scheme should provide a solid scientific basis for the unified classification of NLV strains detected worldwide.",,"Ando, T.;Noel, J. S.;Fankhauser, R. L.",2000.0,,10.1086/315589,0

72,Molecular epidemiology and phylogeny of Nipah virus infection: a mini-review.,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family, which is endemic in South Asia and is characterized by high pathogenicity. It is classified as a Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) substance. The case fatality rate ranges from 40% to 70%, depending on the severity of the disease and the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. There are currently no antiviral drugs available for NiV disease and treatment is only supportive. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyzes can be used to aid understanding of the epidemiology and temporal origin of this virus. This review provides an overview of evolutionary studies on Nipah viruses circulating in different countries.

Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) was detected in 514/2,230 (23%) of HFMD patients admitted to 3 major hospitals in South Vietnam between 2011 and 2015. 93 (18%) of these patients had severe CHF. Phylogenetic analysis of 98 genome sequences revealed that they belonged to cluster A and circulated in Vietnam for 2 years before appearing. While CV-A6 movement among settlements in Vietnam occurred frequently, viral movement across international borders seemed rare. Skyline plots identified fluctuations in the relative genetic diversity of CV-A6, corresponding to major CV-A6-associated HFMD outbreaks worldwide.

74,Origin of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus examined by codon usage patterns and phylogenetic analysis,"The 1918 pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus, a negative-strand RNA virus; however, little is known about the nature of their direct ancestral lineage. Here, we performed a broad genetic and phylogenetic analysis of a wide variety of influenza virus genes, particularly the PB1 gene, to gain insight into the phylogenetic relevance of the 1918 H1N1 virus. We compared the RNA genome of the 1918 strain with many other influenza strains of different origins in various ways, including relative synonym codon usage (RSCU), effective codon number (ENC) and phylogenetic relationship. We found that the PB1 gene of the 1918 pandemic virus had ENC values similar to H1N1 classical porcine and human viruses, but different ENC values from avian as well as H2N2 and H3N2 human viruses. Furthermore, according to the RSCU of the PB1 gene, the 1918 virus is grouped with all human isolates and ""classic"" porcine H1N1 viruses. Phylogenetic studies of all eight RNA gene segments of influenza A viruses may indicate that they originated from the 1918 pandemic strain. an H1N1 swine virus that may itself have been derived from an H1N1 avian precursor that long ago separated from the bulk of other avian viruses.

75,Characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus from Egyptian domestic waterfowl in 2017,"In 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus was detected in wild birds for the first time in Egypt. In this study, we identified the HPAI virus H5N8 of clade 2.3.4.4 from domestic waterfowl in Egypt and suggested transmission of this virus from migratory birds to domestic poultry. Based on the partial hemagglutinin gene sequence, this virus has a close genetic relationship with subtype H5N8 viruses circulating in Asia and Europe. Pathologically, in the hybrid duck, the H5N8 virus caused neural manifestations accompanied by encephalomalacia, hemorrhages, nonsuppurative encephalitis, and nonsuppurative vasculitis. The granular layer of the cerebellum showed areas of multifocal hydropic degeneration and Purkinje cell neurons necrotized or disappeared. There was also lung, kidney, and spleen obstruction, and necrotizing pancreatitis was also observed. The co-circulation of both HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 subtypes with the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 subtype complicates the control of avian influenza in Egypt with the possibility of emergence of new reassortant viruses. Therefore, continuous monitoring with the implementation of strict control measures is necessary. Research highlights: HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 was detected in domestic ducks and geese in Egypt in 2017. Phylogenetically, the virus was closely related to HPAI H5N8 viruses identified in Asia and Europe. Nonsuppurative encephalitis was commonly observed in ducks infected with HPAI H5N8 virus. Degeneration of the cerebellar granular layer was found in most of the brain tissues examined.",,"Anis, A.;AboElkhair, M.;Ibrahim, M.",2018.0,,10.1080/03079457.2018.1470606,0
76,Two new strains of bocaparvovirus identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"Bocaparvovirus (BOV) is a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses and is a possible cause of respiratory, enteric and neurological diseases in humans and animals. Here, two highly different BOVs (provisionally named Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild Himalayan marmots in China by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1, and five of 99 stool samples from these animals were positive for HMBOV2. The nearly complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing the protein coding motifs typical of BOVs. NS1, NP1 and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (about 77.0/50.0%, 50.0/53.0 and 79.0/54.0% amino acid identity, respectively) . ). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 form two separate independent branches in BOVs. According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different new species within the genus Bocaparvovirus. Their identification expands our knowledge of the genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs.

77,Various novel astroviruses identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"With advances in viral surveillance and next-generation sequencing, a wide variety of new astroviruses (AstVs) and different animal hosts have been discovered in recent years. However, the presence of AstVs in marmots has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we identified two highly different strains of AstV (provisionally named Qinghai Himalayanmarmot AstVs, HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2) by viral metagenomic analysis in liver tissues isolated from wild Marmota himalaya in China. Overall, 12 (12.1%) of 99 M. himalaya stool samples were positive for the presence of genetically diverse AstVs, with only HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 identified in 300 liver samples. The complete genomic sequences of HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were 6681 and 6610 nt in length, respectively, with the typical genomic organization of AstVs. Analysis of the complete ORF 2 sequence showed that these novel AstVs were most closely related to rabbit AstV, mamastrovirus 23 (with common amino acid identity of 31.0% and 48.0%, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 indicated that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 form two distinct clusters among mamastroviruses and may share a common ancestor with rabbit-specific mamastrovirus 23. These results indicate that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 are two novelties. Species of the Mamastrovirus genus in Astroviridae.

Linking epidemiological and sequencing data is important for understanding the transmission, persistence, and evolution of the virus. This study describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on molecular characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from isolates collected from February 2006 to May 2014. Methods: Full-length HA sequences of 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and genetically analyzed. evolution. They were collected from different poultry species, production sectors and geographic locations in Egypt. The Bayes Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method was applied to estimate the evolution rates between different virus clusters; In addition, an analysis of selection pressures in the HA gene was performed using the Single Likelihood Assignment Counting (SLAC) method. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 showed the presence of a virus entry in the classical clade (2.2.1) from which two major subgroups originated, the variant subgroup further subdivided into 2 (2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.1a) and endemic subgroup (2.2.1.2). The 2.2.1.2 sequence showed a high rate of evolution over a 6-year period (6.9 × 10-3 sub/domain/year) compared to the variable set 2.2.1.1a (7.2 × 10-3). 4 years). These two clusters are under positive selection because they have 5 positively selected regions in the HA gene. Mutations in HA antigenic regions 120, 154, and 162, and two other mutations occurring between 2009-14 (129Î”, I151T) were found to be stable in the 2.2.1.2 guideline. In addition, 13 groups of H5N1 HPAI viruses were identified based on their amino acid sequences at the cleavage site, with ""EKRRKKR"" becoming the dominant pattern from 2013. Results: Continuous evolution of H5N1 HPAI viruses was observed in all poultry and poultry farming in Egypt. Production systems in almost all regions of the country.

84,Migratory birds in southern Brazil are the source of multiple avian influenza virus subtypes.,"BACKGROUND: There is insufficient information about the relationship of avian influenza virus (AIV) with migratory birds in South America. Accordingly, we examined specimens obtained from wild birds over a 4-year period (2009-2012) at a large wintering site in southern Brazil. METHODS: We obtained 1212 oropharyngeal/cloacal specimens from wild birds in Lagoa do Peixe National Park and screened them for influenza A virus by RT-PCR amplification of the matrix gene. Virus isolates were subjected to genomic sequencing and antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Forty-eight samples (3.96%) of 1212 contained detectable influenza virus RNA. Partial viral sequences were obtained from 12 of these samples, indicating the presence of H2N2 (1), H6Nx (1), H6N1 (8), H9N2 (1) and H12N5 (1) viruses. As H6 viruses predominate, we generated complete genomes from all 9 H6 viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that they were most similar to viruses of South American ancestry. H6N1 viruses caused no signs of disease in infected ferrets and were antigenically similar to North American isolates despite genetic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Lagoa do Peixe National Park is the source of several AIV subtypes, with avian influenza virus levels being highest in this region at the end of the overwintering period.

The outbreak was related to the widespread circulation of closely related branches or groups of West Nile virus (WNV). ) to multiple situations where they have not been before. Whether the invasive 2012 strains circulate and overwinter in states with their own endemic WNV population is unknown, and the impact of viral genetics on adaptation and persistence in a new ecological niche is uncertain. In this study, we sequenced 70 mosquito isolates from multiple counties of Texas between 2012 and 2015. We identified isolates representative of the previously identified 2012 WNV groups (Groups 8–10) and discovered a new group we named Group 11. ) were related to the invasive 2012 strains, of which Group 10 (45/68) predominated. We also observed differences in genotypes among 2012 WNV groups. Group 10 WNV in Texas, carrying two putative positive selected variants, had strong evidence of limited entries into Texas, extensive circulation, and continued persistence, perhaps indicative of overwintering. In contrast, Groups 8 and 11 had multiple entries into Texas, limited circulation, and limited persistence, without positively selected variants. Finally, we identified a potential transmission source in New York for Group 8 WNV arriving in Texas. Altogether, our study suggests that mutations in the WNV genome may affect the range and dynamics of WNV circulation and the ability of different strains to persist in new ecological niches.",,"Aroh, C.;Liang, C.;Raj, P.;Wakeland, B.;Yan, N.;Wakeland, E.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.08.025,0

91,Identification of a Different Lineage Pig Pestivirus in Nursing Piglets with Congenital Tremor and Reproduction of Diseases Following Experimental Vaccination,"Congenital tremors is a sporadic disease of neonatal pigs characterized by action-related recurrent myoclonus. Most outbreaks of congenital tremors have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were to 1) detect potential pathogen(s) in samples from piglets with congenital tremor, and 2) develop a model of infection to propagate the disease. Using next-generation sequencing, a different strain pestivirus was detected in piglets with congenital tremors. The virus was originally most closely related to a bat pestivirus, but is now more closely related to a recently published new porcine pestivirus, tentatively referred to as atypical porcine pestivirus. A quantitative real-time PCR detected the virus in samples from newborn piglets with congenital tremors from two separate farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To achieve the latter objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with serum containing pestivirus or PBS (control) intravenously and intranasally simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic vesicles by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. Vaccines were given on days 45 or 62 of pregnancy. Control piglets vaccinated with PBS were unaffected, while piglets vaccinated with the novel pestivirus were all affected by congenital tremors. Shivering severity for each piglet was scored from videos taken at 0, 1, and 2 days after calving. For most piglets, tremor severity remained relatively constant from 0 to 2 days post rearing. The prevalence of congenital shivering in pestivirus-vaccinated litter ranges from 57% (4 out of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 out of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors, but not in control piglets. Specimens that were positive by PCR in over 90% of piglets sampled included brainstem (37 out of 41), mesenteric lymph node (37 out of 41), tracheobronchial lymph node (37 out of 41), and complete blood (19 out of 20) is found. . Although the first description of congenital tremors was in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremors following experimental vaccination with a different strain swine pestivirus. Studies investigating the disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors associated with this pestivirus.",,"Arruda, B.

92,Genetic ancestor of external antigens of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The aim of this research is to discover the genetic relationships of the 2009 pandemic novel influenza A/H1N1 virus (NIV) external antigens Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) with other influenza viruses by performing phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analyzes. Phylogenetic trees of these two antigens show that the sequences of NIV viruses are relatively homogeneous and that they are derived from several viruses circulating in the pig. The phylogenetic tree of HA shows that NIV has the closest relationship with North American pig lines, while NA is with European pig lines. In both segments, NIVs had the closest genetic relationship to swine flu virus strains. It strongly suggests that pigs are the most likely animal reservoir. Comparative analysis shows that among clade A, NIVs have high similarity as well as very low genetic diversity and also undergo strong purification selection, while neighboring clade B shows intermediate values when compared with CF branches. Indicates that the classical swine flu viruses found in part B may be the ancestor of the external antigens of NIVs. There has been a re-diversification process in the classic swine flu viruses. Specifically fixed mutation sites in the NIV of pig and human along with the vaccine strain provide an important recommendation for disease diagnosis and vaccine research.",,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,,10.1007/s12539-012-0136-7,0
93,Phylogenetic analysis of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The principle of this study was to determine the evolution of the pandemic novel influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (NIV) by phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analysis. Phylogenetic trees of the eight genomic segments show that so far, the sequences of NIVs (outbreak group A) are relatively homogeneous and obtained by multiple genetic reclassifications of Eurasian and North American swine, avian and human viruses (group B). . This means that some group B influenza viruses have a higher potential for human-to-human transmission and development after animal-to-human interspecies transmission. The second analysis shows that NIV attempted minor evolutionary change among humans and had a long evolutionary history before meeting humans. Statistical analysis shows that viruses from both the epidemic and the closest group have homologous genes in their genomes, which may reflect the phylogenetic relationship of the strains, and also that the presence of unique mutations between AB groups may be associated with increased virulence of NIVs. Both phylogenetic and cluster analyzes confirm that gene exchange occurs between viruses originating from different species and that NIV with unpredictable pandemic potential can be generated. Therefore, we conclude that extensive work is required to recognize which reclassification groups are closely related to NIVs and to identify regions in NIV genes under the greatest or lowest selection pressure; this will ultimately be important in effective design.

94,Subgroup determination of group a rotaviruses from piglets in Nigeria,"Subgroup analysis using subgroup-specific monoclonal ELISA revealed that subgroup 2-specific antigens of group A porcine rotaviruses were more predominant than subgroup 1. (39.8%) were determined to have subgroup 1 and 2 specificities, respectively. However, 37 (32.7%) test specimens could not be classified into any of the known subgroups of group A rotaviruses. These 'unclassifiable' samples likely lacked neither subgroup 1 nor 2 specificity in the ELISA, or may belong to a third subgroup that was not known or investigated in this study. Subgroup 1 and 2 specific antigens were common in all age groups studied. This was also observed after annual analysis of subgroup specificity; however, a higher prevalence of subgroup 2 specificity was observed in 1990 and 1991. Subgroup 1 rotaviruses were found in all 4 States sampled (Plateau, Benue, Oyo, and Cross River), while subgroup 2 rotaviruses were detected only in Plateau State. All rotaviruses obtained in this study had long genome electrophoretic migration patterns regardless of subgroup. Thus, the genomic diversity of group A rotaviruses does not necessarily reflect antigenic diversity, as there is no imperative correlation between the genome electropherotype pattern and subgroup specificity.",,"Atii, D.

97,Effects of orally administered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on welfare and Salmonella colonization of young chicks,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a bacterium that preys on and kills Gram-negative bacteria, including the zoonotic pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, but no reports of testing in live animals have been published and no data are available on whether Bdellovibrio can spread among animals. In this study, we attempted to fill this knowledge gap by using B. bacteriovorus HD100 doses in birds with normal gut microbiota or pre-dosed with a colonized Salmonella strain. In both cases, Bdellovibrio was given orally in combination with antacids. After administering a dose of Bdellovibrio to non-Salmonella-infected birds, we measured the birds' health and well-being and any changes in their intestinal pathology and culturable microbiota, but found that a dose of Bdellovibrio at 2 days of age changed the birds' overall diversity. The natural gut microbiota in 28-day-old birds showed no adverse effects on their growth and health. Drinking water and fecal matter in bird houses did not show any contamination by Bdellovibrio after dosing. Predatory Bdellovibrio administered orally to birds pre-dosed with a gut-colonizing strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 4 (an important zoonotic pathogen) significantly reduced Salmonella numbers in the cecum content of the avian gut and reduced abnormal cecum morphology, indicating reduced cecum inflammation. dependent on the ceca of untreated controls or a non-predatory Î”pilA strain, suggesting that these effects are due to predatory action.

To better understand its complex epidemiology, which includes multiple virus serotypes and host species, we characterized viruses recovered from FMD epidemics in Ethiopia between 1981 and 2007. We detected 5 out of 7 FMDV serotypes (O, A, C, South African Soils [SAT] 1 and SAT 2). Serotype O was dominant, followed by serotype A; Type C was not recognized after 1983. Phylogenetic analysis of virus protein 1 sequences showed the emergence of a new topotype in the East African serotype 4. In 2007, serotype SAT 1 was detected in Ethiopia and formed a new distinct topotype (IX), and serotype SAT 2 re-emerged after a significant 16-year hiatus.

Applications of such sensors range from providing environmental monitoring to providing human health diagnostic measures to early warning systems for bioterrorism. Some viruses and bacterial pathogens are of particular concern due to their ability to spread rapidly in human populations during a pandemic, and it is difficult to detect emerging variants of these pathogens. This article provides a reliable detection strategy to classify viruses from harmless proteins. Our new instrumentation is based on pyrolysis gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS) and combines a microfabricated solid-state biosensor with a genetic algorithm-based machine learning method for pattern recognition. Together, this hardware and software combination allowed an extremely high classification accuracy (94%) among T4 bacteriophage from an unrelated protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA).

The causative agent of the disease is the bluetongue virus (BTV), which is classified in the Reoviridae family Orbivirus. OBJECTIVE AND AIM: The aim of this study was to detect serum malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant stress (TAS), total sialic acid (TSA), ceruloplasmin, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-bluetongue and blue mute sheep. glutamyltransferase (GGT), cholesterol, creatinine, albumin and total protein levels (BT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The control group consisting of 13 Chios crossbred sheep and 10 healthy sheep aged 1-4 years and generally in the last stage of pregnancy were included in the study as the CT group. All sheep were clinically examined before blood samples were taken. Serum ALT, AST, cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin, GGT, total protein, creatinine and TAS levels were measured using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations using a Biochemistry Auto Analyzer (Sinnowa D280, China). Serum lipid peroxidation was predicted by a method previously described where MDA reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to form a colored complex at a maximum absorbance of 535 nm. The TSA value was measured at 549 nm using the method described by Warren (1959): sialic acid was oxidized to formyl-pyruvic acid, which reacted with TBA to form a pink product. Ceruloplasmin concentration was measured according to Sunderman and Nomoto (1970): ceruloplasmin and p-phenylenediamine formed a colored oxidation product proportional to serum ceruloplasmin concentration. Real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR were performed as described by Shaw et al. (2007). RESULTS: Biochemistry analysis of serum showed that TSA, MDA, triglyceride, and ALT and AST were higher in the CT group, and ceruloplasmin and TAS were lower in the control group. Serum albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, total protein and GGT did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Serum triglyceride, ceruloplasmin, TSA, MDA and TAS concentrations may be useful in diagnosis, prognosis and biochemical analysis of CT.",,"Aytekin, I.;Aksit, H.;Sait, A.;Kaya, F.;Aksit, D.;Gokmen, M.;Baca, A.

101,"Shift of Enterovirus species among children in Cameroon - identification of a new enterovirus, EV-A119","Background: Infections by human enteroviruses (EVs) are usually asymptomatic or mild, although they can cause more serious diseases such as meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis. EVs pose a threat to children globally, and outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and hand, foot, and mouth disease are frequently reported. OBJECTIVE: To identify EV strains circulating among healthy children in a small community of Limbe, Cameroon, two years apart. STUDY DESIGN: Species and EV types were obtained by partial 5'UTR-VP4 and VP1 sequencing of RNA from stool samples collected in October 2009 and September 2011 from 150 children in Cameroon. RESULTS: A total of 74 children (49%) were infected with 28 different types of EV. There were 29 (54%) infected children in 2009 and 45 (47%) children in 2011. In 2009, 15 (47%) children were infected with EV-A and 22 (71%) with EV-B in 2011 (p=0.0001). In 2009, a child was infected with a different EV, most similar to the EV-A90. Based on the full VP1 lineup, a new EV has been shown to be called the EV-A119. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a high heterogeneity of circulating EV types among children in Limbe, Cameroon and a previously undescribed shift in dominant EV types.",,"Ayukekbong, J.;Kabayiza, J.

In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses and dogs, suggesting that hepaciviruses are widely distributed among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a new virus of the genus Hepacivirus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly yielded an almost full-length genome encoding a 2,779 amino acid polyprotein. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a new species within the genus Hepacivirus. Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals in Germany and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 cattle herds studied were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyzes of animals from a dairy herd proved that a significant percentage of cows were infected and some were viremic for more than 6 months. Clinical and post-mortem examination showed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues combined with the presence of a miR-122 binding site in the viral genome strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans. .",,"Baechlein, C.;Fischer, N.;Grundhoff, A.;Alawi, M.;Indenbirken, D.;Postel, A.;Baron, A.

108,Surveillance and characterization of low pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from wild migratory birds in Korea,"Migratory waterfowl are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses. However, interspecies transmission has occasionally caused outbreaks in various hosts, including humans. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to characterize the genetic origins of H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory birds in South Korea. A total of 53 H5 viruses were isolated between October 2005 and November 2008. Full genetic characterization showed that most of these viruses belonged to the Eurasian-like avian lineage. However, portions of the AB/Korea/W235/07 and AB/Korea/W236/07 isolates clustered with viruses of the North American rather than Eurasian lineage, suggesting that reclassification has occurred between these two avian virus lineages. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that H5N2 and H5N3 virus isolates were in the low pathogenicity H5 phenotype. The H5 viruses appear to be antigenically similar, but can be distinguished from a recent HPAI H5N1 (EM/Korea/W149/06) virus by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays. Experimental vaccination of representative viruses has shown that certain isolates, particularly AB/Korea/W163/07 (H5N2), can be detected in the trachea and lungs of chickens, but none are transmitted by direct contact. Furthermore, all viruses can be detected in the mouse lung without prior adaptation, indicative of their pathogenic potential in a mammalian host.

This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 major production regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of major circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiration, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical specimens suggestive of IBV infection were collected from 432 different commercial poultry flocks (1998 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the above 3 physiological systems obtained from farms in 3 key production regions: midwest, northeast and south. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by reverse transcription, real-time PCR of 5â€² untranslated regions. Results showed 179 IBV positive flocks (41.4% of flocks), 107 (24.8%) from broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. Farms in different parts of the country had similar IBV-positive flocks, mostly broilers (average 54%) compared to breeders (average 30.8%). Reverse transcription was detected more frequently in the digestive tract of breeders (40%), in the digestive tract of chickens (43.5%) and respiratory systems (37.7%). Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by reverse transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene selected from 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 broilers and 34 broilers). Most herds were infected with the Brazilian variant genotype rather than the Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results indicate that the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric duct) predominates in commercial poultry flocks from 3 major production regions in Brazil.

115,Full-length genome sequence analysis of Hungarian swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolated from a pig with severe respiratory disease.,"Here, we report the isolation of a type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain from a clinical outbreak of severe respiratory problems and high fever. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the complete genome sequence of the isolate (9625/2012). The virus belongs to a new branch in subtype 1, branch D and shows the highest similarity to the PRRSV Olot/1991 and Amervac vaccine strain. Mutation analysis 9625/2012 showed no evidence of recombination, but high amino acid substitutions in putative neutralizing epitopes, suggesting an important role of selective immune pressure in the evolution of PRRSV 9625/2012.",,"BÃ¡lint, Ã;Balka, G.;HorvÃ¡th, P.;KecskemÃ©ti, S.;DÃ¡n, Ã;Farsang, A.;Szeredi, L.;BÃ¡nyai, K.;Bartha, D.;Olasz, F.;BelÃ¡k, S.;ZÃ¡dori, Z.",2015.0,,10.1007/s00705-014-2265-2,0
116,"Whole genome sequence analysis of a wild, non-MLV-associated type 2 Hungarian PRRSV variant isolated in Europe","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a common swine pathogen that causes significant economic losses to the swine industry. The expanding diversity of PRRSV strains makes the diagnosis, control and eradication of the disease increasingly difficult. In this study, the authors report the complete genome sequencing of a type 2 PRRSV strain isolated from piglet carcasses in Hungary. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the complete genome sequence of the isolate (PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012). Recombination analysis with available full-length genome sequences showed no evidence of such an event with other known PRRSV. Unique deletions and an insertion were found in the nsp2 region of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012 compared to the highly virulent VR2332 and JXA-1 prototype strains. Most of the amino acid changes in GP4 and GP5 of the virus were in known antigenic regions, suggesting an important role for immunological pressure in the evolution of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that it belongs to 1 or 2 lineages of type 2 PRRSV. Given the lack of relevant PRRSV in Europe, the progenitor of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012 was most likely transferred from North America, except for a partial sequence from Slovakia. Ingelvac is the first documented type 2 PRRSV isolated in Europe, not related to MLV.",,"Balka, G.;Wang, X.;Olasz, F.;Balint, A.;Kiss, I.;Banyai, K.;Rusvai, M.;Stadejek, T.;Marthaler, D.;Murtaugh, M.

117,Two amino acid changes at the N-terminus of the infectious gastroenteritis coronavirus spike protein cause loss of enteric tropism,"To examine the molecular basis of TGEV tropism, a recombinant collection was created between the enteric- and respiratory tract-infecting infectious gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) PUR46-MAD strain and the respiratory-only PTV strain. The frequency of recombinant isolation was about 10-9 recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7 times higher at the 5'-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single passage and inherited the 5'- and 3'-half of their genomes from enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were divided into three groups named 1 to 3 according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had crossover in the S gene, while Groups 2 and 3 had crossovers in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Group 1 recombinants had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory tract but not the enteric tract. The viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may in principle be responsible for the loss of enteric tropism, but only the change at nucleotide 655 was found specifically in respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change is due to loss of enteric tropism in closely related PUR46 isolates, leading to a substitution at amino acid 219 of the S protein. was responsible. Available data indicate the involvement of two different domains of the S protein, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, to infect enteric system cells with TGEV. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. In the other domain map, a second factor is mapped that has undefined structure but may be the binding site for a coreceptor required for enteric tropism of TGEV.",,"Ballesteros, M. L.;SÃ¡nchez, C.

118,Investigation of foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Mbala and Kazungula districts of Zambia.,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of domestic and wild ungulates. It is known to be endemic in Zambia, with periodic outbreaks occurring in different geographical regions of the country. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of FMD virus (FMDV) in cases of suspected FMD reported in cattle from Kazungula and Mbala regions of Zambia. Sixty epithelial tissues or esophageal-pharyngeal (OP) scrapes (probang samples) were collected from Mbala (n = 51) and Kazungula (n = 9) and examined for FMDV. FMDV viral RNA and serotypes were examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and antigen Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Twenty-two samples (36.7%) were positive for the FMDV genome by qRT-PCR with Cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 13 to 31. FMDV-positive samples from epithelial tissues showed relatively higher Ct values compared to those from OP. scrapes regardless of geographic location. Forty percent (40%; n = 4) of epithelial tissues from Mbala were serotyped to the SAT 2 serotype by antigen ELISA. Kazungula samples were serotyped to SAT 1. These findings indicated that Mbala and Kazungula regions had at least FMD outbreaks in 2012 attributed to FMDV serotypes SAT 2 and SAT 1 field strains. Also, regular interaction between buffaloes from Mosi-o Tunya Park and domestic animals from surrounding areas may contribute to the emergence of regular FMD outbreaks in Kazungula, while uncontrolled animal movements along the borders between Mbala and Nsumbawanga may be responsible for disease outbreaks in Mbala. . In-depth molecular biological studies, including the sequencing and phylogeny of viruses, should be conducted to elucidate the complex epidemiology of FMD in Zambia, thereby providing valuable information needed for a rational control strategy of FMD in Zambia and neighboring countries.",,"Banda, F.;Kasanga, C.

119,Isolation and Metagenomic Identification of Avian Leukosis Virus Associated with Mortality in Broilers,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) belongs to the Retroviridae family and causes significant economic losses in the poultry industry. Following an outbreak associated with high mortality in a broiler flock in northern Malaysia, kidney tissues from affected chickens were sent for virus isolation and identification in chicken embryonated eggs and MDCK cells. Evidence of virus growth was demonstrated by bleeding and embryo death in egg culture. Viral growth in cell culture has been demonstrated by the development of cytopathic effects. The isolated virus was purified by sucrose gradient and identified using negative staining transmission electron microscopy. Further validation was achieved through next-generation sequencing and nucleotide sequence homology search. Analysis of viral sequences using the NCBI BLAST tool revealed 99-100% sequence homology with the exogenous ALV viral envelope protein. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial envelope sequences showed that the Malaysian isolate clustered with ALV subgroup J, ALV subgroup E, and Taiwanese and Japanese ALV strains more closely related to recombinant A/E isolates. Based on these findings, it was concluded that ALV is associated with the current epidemic. Further studies on the molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity of the identified virus isolate were recommended.",,"Bande, F.;Arshad, S. S.;Omar, A. R.",2016.0,,,0
120,Unique genomic organization of a new Avipox virus detected in Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"Avipoxviruses are emerging pathogens that affect more than 200 bird species worldwide. Genetic characterization of avipoxviruses is performed by analysis of genomic regions encoding 4b and DNA polymerase. Whole genome sequence data are limited to a few avipoxvirus isolates. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, three main genetic branches are distinguished. In this study, a new avipoxvirus strain causing skin lesions in domestic turkey was reported. The virus was detected in a herd of turkeys vaccinated against avipoxvirus infection in Hungary in 2011. The genome of the isolated strain, TKPV-HU1124/2011, was uniquely short (~188.5 kbp) and expected to encode a reduced number of proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of genes encoding 4b and DNA polymerase distinguished TKPV-HU1124/2011 from other turkey-derived avipox viruses and classified it into a new genetic branch.

However, the in-depth evolutionary dynamics of PPRV during an epidemic are not well understood. We performed phylogenetic analysis on the genomic sequences of 25 PPRV strains from the Chinese 2013-2014 outbreaks. All these strains clustered in a new clade in lineage 4. Dating the most recent common ancestor of the PPRV China 2013-2014 strains to early August 2013, the evolutionary rate of 2.61 × 10âˆ'6 nucleotide substitutions per day per site was estimated. Transmission network analysis revealed that all virus sequences can be grouped into five infection clusters; This suggested that long-distance animal transmission played an important role in the spread of PPRV in China. These results expanded our knowledge of PPRV evolution to achieve effective control measures.",,"Bao, J.;Wang, Q.;Li, L.;Liu, C.;Zhang, Z.;Li, J.;Wang, S.;Wu, X.;Wang, Z.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.018,0

123,Isolation and whole genome sequence of two reticuloendotheliosis virus strains from mixed infections with Marek's disease virus in China.,"Classified as gammaretrovirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) has a variety of hosts, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and wild birds. REV causes immunosuppression of the host, which can lead to a number of pathological syndromes, in particular an increased susceptibility to other pathogens, thereby causing great harm to the poultry industry. Mixed infections of REV and Marek's disease virus (MDV) have been reported in many countries, including China. Previous reports have revealed that MDV vaccines are not effective and that even less virulent MDV strains will cause some losses due to mixed infections with REV. In addition, contaminants in the MDV vaccine may be the main source of REV. In this study, two clinical specimens were collected from two chicken flocks diagnosed with MDV. Two REV isolates were then obtained from clinical specimens. Isolates designated CY1111 and SY1209 were further confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Whole genome sequences of the two REV strains were determined to test the relationship between them and other REV strains. Phylogenetic trees showed that the two REV strains were closely related to most REV strains isolated from various hosts. Therefore, REVs can spread freely among these hosts under natural conditions. In addition, most REV strains in China were in the same branch. The present study provides some insights into REV in China.",,"Bao, K. Y.;Zhang, Y. P.;Zheng, H. W.;Lv, H. C.;Gao, Y. L.;Wang, J.

124,"Blood feeding, susceptibility to infection with Schmallenberg virus and phylogenetics of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) from the UK","Background: Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are responsible for the biological transmission of internationally important arboviruses of livestock. In 2011, a new Orthobunyavirus was discovered that causes congenital malformations and miscarriages in ruminant animals in northern Europe. From field studies, Culicoides has been implicated in the transmission of this virus, later named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but to date no assessment of the susceptibility of field populations to infection has been made under standard laboratory conditions. We evaluated the effect of membrane type (chick skin, collagen, Parafilm MÂ®) on field-collected Culicoides blood supply rates when presented with an artificial blood supply system (Hemotek, UK). Susceptibility to infection with SBV was then compared following blood feeding on an SBV-blood suspension delivered via (i) the Hemotek system or (ii) a saturated cotton wool padglet. Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was identified by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions of head homogenates and related haplotype identifications based on the DNA barcode region of Culicoides species and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) gene. Results: Culicoides blood feeding rates were low across all membrane types tested (7.5% chick skin, 0.0% for collagen, 4.4% Parafilm MÂ®, 6029 female Culicoides total blood meal offered). For obsoletus complex, infection with SBV via membrane blood supply (8 out of 109 tested) and pledged blood supply (1 out of 94 tested) with both C. obsoletus (Meigen) and C. scoticus Downes & sensitivity has been demonstrated. Kettle susceptible to infection with SBV via oral feeding. Phylogenetic analyzes of cox1 DNA barcodes of 74 individuals evaluated from a single field site found potential evidence of cryptic species within UK populations for the Obsoletus complex. Conclusions: The methods described in this work provide tools for blood-feeding Palaearctic Culicoides for vector proficiency studies and colonization attempts. Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the subgenus Avaritia and 1.1% for pledglet-fed members. Both C. obsoletus and C. scoticus were confirmed to be susceptible to infection with SBV, and potential evidence of cryptic species was found within samples of the UK Obsoletus complex, but the effects of cryptic diversity in the Obsoletus complex on arbovirus transmission are unknown.",,"Barber, J.;Harrup, L.

125,Persistence mechanisms in tick-borne diseases,"The use of new, highly sensitive diagnostic methods has revealed that persistent infections are a common feature of different tick-borne diseases such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis and heart juice. Antigenic variation may contribute to disease persistence through the continued development of new surface structures, and we know in a few cases how this is achieved. Known or suspected persistence mechanisms in Babesia parasites include cytoadhesion and rapid variation of the adhesive ligand in Babesia bovis and different Babesia spp. In Anaplasma, wide diversity in the pfam01617 gene family accompanies cycling of organism levels in chronic infection. One conclusion from pioneering research at Onderstepoort is the identification of a related family of polymorphic genes likely involved in immunity to heart disease. We are beginning to understand the dimensions of the antigenic repertoires, and with the possibility of applying simultaneous high-throughput sequencing to 1000 small genome sequences, the full description is close. We may also consider for the first time modifying these genomes and looking at the effects on persistence and virulence. However, important biological questions remain unanswered; for example, why we see an emerging Anaplasma infection in humans and that infection of endothelial cells by Anaplasma is important for in vivo persistence.",,"Barbet, A.

Immune Histochemical (IHC) techniques are applied to the PCV-2 antigen detected in animal tissue injuries. However, pigs infected with asymptomatic or sub-clinical PCV-2 can spread the virus in the herd. Serological research on apparently healthy pigs may suggest a risk of virus transmission. In this study, antigens and antibodies to PCVS-2 were investigated in pigs from commercial farms in seven and eight mesor regions of Minas Gerais State (MG). Thirty-two pigs aged five to eleven weeks showing clinical signs of SMDS were autopsied. PCV-2 antigens were investigated by IHC from either sacrificed pigs (Group I) and diagnostic claim samples (Group II). 7.60% and more than 60% of the first and second groups, respectively, were positive for viral antigen. Intense labeling of macrophages and histiocytes in both, particularly in the lymph nodes and lung, proved antigens to CVS-2. In parallel, the Immunoperoxidase Monolayer Assay (IPMA) was applied to the antibody against PCV-2 screened in 955 pigs from 35 full-cycle commercial farms in the same mesorregions. All pig herds (100%) showed positive animals (confidence level 90 to 100%), and the frequency of pigs reacting varied by 96.6% (confidence level 94.7% to 98.6%).

Comments are made on the structure, classification, pathogenicity, symptoms and treatment of the virus. The immunological response of the host in prevention from wild virus disease is reviewed and shows how re-infection becomes progressively less severe as severe diarrheal disease is prevented after initial infection. Briefly, the epidemiology and disease burden are described, showing that rotavirus is the cause of more than 600,000 deaths per year in underdeveloped countries, the high number of hospitalizations, outpatient visits and nosocomial infections, and the resulting high morbidity and mortality it represents. Public health. Hygienic conditions of health care, drinking water, access to oral rehydration, etc. The only possible intervention is preventive intervention, since the improvement achieved with the disease did not lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of the disease in both industrialized and developing countries. those. The most common rotavirus serotypes and genotypes known in the world and in our country are explained. Emphasis is placed on the immediate serotypes available. A comprehensive review of the major recent studies in the scientific literature on novel 2nd generation vaccines against rotavirus in the United States, authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), was also conducted. Although the two vaccines authorized in Spain come from different active ingredients, they have a common purpose, preventing severe diarrhea in the child due to rotavirus. Given the events with RotashieldÂ® (the first human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine used in the United States and now withdrawn from the market) and its association with intestinal intussusception, large safety study designs involving more than 70,000 children were required. With both vaccines, RotarixÂ® and RotaTeqâ„¢, there is ample evidence that there is no increased risk of vaccination-related bowel intussusception. Efficacy, immunogenicity, adverse events, etc. related experiments were also reviewed. These are statistically significant and have been adequately tested within the allowable ranges in relation to placebos. A list of recent ACID (Advisory Board Immunization Practices) recommendations for RotaTeqâ„¢ is provided. Brief comments have been made on some of the pharmacoeconomic studies found in the literature, some of which are cost effective, but more advanced ones will be required once vaccines become operational and vaccination prices are determined for the public health system. Finally, the opportunities, challenges, and perspectives of current 2nd generation vaccines are discussed. In some of the future, the difficulties they will face are indicated. It was concluded on the importance of convincing pediatricians for the use of these new vaccines, raising awareness of parents, and including them in common routine vaccination practices by providing health education to both the regulatory authorities and them. This requires pharmacoeconomic studies that include current and real costs of the disease.",,"Barrio Corrales, F.;Cuenca Burgos, M. J.;GarcÃ­a FernÃ¡ndez, M. A.;Trillo BelizÃ³n, C.",2006.0,,,0
133,Molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus in Portugal during the 2004-2006 epidemic.,"After 44 years of epidemiological silence, the bluetongue virus (BTV) was reintroduced in Portugal in the fall of 2004. The first clinical cases of bluetongue (BT) were reported on sheep farms in the south of Portugal, close to the Spanish border. A total of six BTVs, five serotype 4 and one serotype 2 were isolated from sheep and cattle during the 2004-2006 epizootics. The nucleotide sequence of the L2, S7 and S10 gene segments of the BTV-4 prototype strain (BTV4/22045/PT04) from the first outbreak and BTV-2 (BTV2/26629/PT05) was precisely determined and compared with those of the others. parts of the world.

134,Infection of macrophages with a lymphotropic herpes virus: a new tropism for Marek's disease virus.,"Marek's disease virus (MDV) is classified as an oncogenic lymphotropic herpes virus of chickens. MDV infects B, Î±Î²T, and Î³Î´T lymphocytes productively and cytolytically and latently infects T helper lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to determine whether MDV infects macrophages in vivo and, if so, whether quantitative differences in macrophage infection are associated with MDV strain virulence. Chickens were infected with either lethal MDV (HPRS-16) or 'hypervirulent' MDV (C12/130). Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies recognizing MDV pp38 antigen and leukocyte antigens was used to identify MDV lytically infected cells. Macrophages from chickens infected with HPRS-16- and C12/130 were pp38+. Macrophages were shown to be pp38+, as assessed by confocal microscopy using antibodies that recognize MDV antigens of the three herpes virus kinetic classes: infected cell protein 4 (ICP4, immediate early), pp38 (early), and glycoprotein B (gB, late). Spleen macrophages from MDV-infected chickens were ICP4+, pp38+ and gB+, with nuclear localization in ICP4 indicating infection. Finally, MDV pp38+ macrophages had high natural death rates, confirming cytolytic MDV infection, although production of virus particles has not yet been detected. These results have two key implications for understanding the pathogenesis of MDV: (i) MDV has evolved to disrupt innate in addition to acquired immunity, and (ii) macrophages are excellent candidates for transporting MDV to primary lymphoid organs during the earliest stages of pathogenesis.",,"Barrow, A.

135,Tick-borne viruses,"Tick-borne viruses (TBVs) belong to the largest biological group known as arboviruses, which have a unique mode of transmission from blood-feeding arthropods (ticks, mosquitoes, sandflies, biting midges, etc.) to a susceptible vertebrate host. Taxonomically, they are a heterogeneous group of vertebrate viruses that exist in several viral families. With only one exception, African swine fever virus, all TBVs have an RNA genome. At least 160 tick-borne viruses are known to date, some of which pose a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recently, a number of established TBVs have reemerged and spread to new geographic areas due to the impact of anthropogenic activities and few available vaccines. In addition, emerging tick-borne diseases are constantly being reported. Major advances in molecular biotechnologies have led to the discovery of new TBVs and further genetic characterization of unclassified viruses, leading to changes in the TBV classification established by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. Although TBVs spend more than 95% of their lifecycles in tick vectors and the role of ticks as vectors has been known for over 100 years, our knowledge of TBVs and the molecular processes involved in virus-tick interactions is very scarce.",,"BartÃ­kovÃ¡, P.;HolÃ­kovÃ¡, V.;KazimÃ­rovÃ¡, M.;Å tibrÃ¡niovÃ¡, I.",2017.0,,10.4149/av_2017_403,0

Since 2010, cases have been recorded in the nearby northern regions, and both lineages 1a and 2 were identified in 2011. Here, we describe two novel WNV whole genome sequences from cases of human WNV infection that occurred in 2011 in the Veneto Region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both genome sequences belong to lineage 1a and are related to WNV strains of the Western Mediterranean subtype. The new WNV genomes had high nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation from each other and from the WNV strain circulated in Italy in 2008-2009.

138,Swine flu viruses in North Vietnam in 2013-2014 article,"Pigs are an important intermediate host for the emergence of pandemic influenza. Vietnam is the largest pork producer in South East Asia. Systematic virological and serological surveillance of swine flu viruses was conducted in North Vietnam from May 2013 to June 2014 with monthly pig sampling at local and large mass slaughterhouses and the live pig market. Seroprevalence of Influenza A in local abattoirs and large mass abattoirs was 48.7% and 29.1%, respectively. Seventy-seven influenza A viruses were isolated from the large mass slaughterhouse. Genetic analysis revealed six virus genotypes, including H1N1 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) viruses, H1 human-induced H1N2, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 reassortants, and triple reassortant H3N2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of porcine and human H1N1pdm09 viruses showed evidence of repeated transmission from humans to pigs rather than the long-term establishment of H1N1pdm09 as a long-term divergent lineage in pigs.

139,A new type of bovine papillomavirus in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus,"Papillomaviruses are a diverse group of viruses known to infect a wide variety of animal species. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are divided into at least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21); Â Most BPV isolates/strains identified to date belong to one of four genera, including Deltapapillomavirus, Xipapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus and Dyoxipapillomavirus. Here, we describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new type of BPV in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in New York state, USA, reported cases of chronic vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab samples from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic examination. Conventional diagnostic assays yielded negative results and vaginal swab samples were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. In particular, BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome with a length of 7480 bp (67% nt sequence identity to BPV16). In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene of the papillomavirus (tentatively designated BPV22) described herein revealed that it clusters with members of the Dyokappapapillomavirus genus. Interestingly, the recently identified BPV16 detected in fibropapilloma lesions in cattle also clusters within the Dyocappapillomavirus group. However, each virus forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. These results indicate that putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus.",,"Bauermann, F.

140,Pig circovirus type 1 analysis detected in Rotarix vaccine,"metagenomic analysis of live human vaccines recently demonstrated the presence of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) DNA in the pediatric vaccine Rotarix, used for the prevention of acute gastroenteritis. Using real-time PCR for PCV1, several Rotarix series have found PCV1 DNA titers of the order of 6-7log10 copies per dose. Pretreatment of the reconstituted vaccine with the nuclease Benzonase followed by nucleic acid extraction and quantification of PCV1 DNA by real-time PCR revealed no loss of PCV1 DNA titer compared to untreated controls, suggesting that porcine viral DNA was present in the vaccine in an encapsulated form. PCV1 allowed PS cells, human HEK293 and Vero cells used for vaccine production were infected with Rotarix or PCV1, respectively, and subjected to immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Viral genomes were present in cells incubated with Rotarix and also infected with PCV1, while viral transcription was seen only in cells infected with PCV1. Similarly, PCV1-specific protein expression was observed in PCV1-infected cells, but not in Rotarix-treated cells. Passage of the supernatant demonstrated productive infection in PCV1-infected PS cells, but not in HEK293 and Vero cells or any of the cell lines incubated with Rotarix. PCV1 DNA in Rotarix was protected from Benzonase digestion; however, PCV1 was not recognized by immune electron microscopy and was unable to infect PS, HEK293 or Vero cells, suggesting that the high amount of PCV1 DNA found in Rotarix does not reflect a corresponding proportion of biologically active virus particles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Baylis, S.

In this study, the identification and genetic characterization of bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated from a calf with diarrhea is described. Two different next-generation sequencing platforms were used. Shotgun metagenomics performed by MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) allowed the identification of BEV RNA from a cell culture isolate. BEV was then confirmed by a specific real-time RT-PCR assay. To obtain the entire genome of this isolate, sequence reads obtained by MinION were combined with those originating from NextSeq500 (Illumina).

143,Genetic and antigenic characterization of novel pestivirus genotypes: Implications for classification,"Currently, the Pestivirus genus consists of four confirmed strains of Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Border disease virus (BDV) and a transient fifth strain represented by a single strain. (H138) was isolated from a giraffe in Kenya more than 30 years ago. To further address the heterogeneity of pestiviruses, we identified all Npro and E2 coding sequences for several novel pestivirus isolates. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that a pestivirus isolated in Africa in the 1990s was closely related to strain H138. Moreover, several novel pestiviruses isolated from the sheep group differ significantly from all previously described pestiviruses, including a sheep pestivirus strain (Gifhorn), BDV, together with the previously described V60 strain (Reindeer-1) isolated from a reindeer. . We propose to call these mainly sheep-derived pestiviruses BDV-2 (V60-like isolates) and BDV-3 (Gifhorn); as a result, ""classical"" BDV isolates should be designated BDV-1. As an additional criterion for the separation of pestiviruses, the antigenic relationship of pestivirus isolates covering all the major genotypes observed was examined by cross-neutralization experiments. Analysis of antigenic similarities revealed the presence of seven major antigenic groups corresponding to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2, BDV-3 and ""giraffe"". We suggest that BDV-1, BDV-2 and BDV-3 should be considered as the main genotypes, given the absence of differences in host origin, disease course, and the results of our genetic and antigenic analyzes. species BDV. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

BVDV was detected in 13 persistently infected (PI) cattle with a non-cytopathogenic biotype, while isolates from spleen samples in five animals with fatal mucosal disease were of the cytopathogenic biotype. To reveal genetic typing of Croatian BVDV isolates, viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures and amplified by RT-PCR, primers targeting the 5'-UTR and Npro gene, followed by direct sequencing of purified PCR products. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR genome region determined that all Croatian isolates belong to BVDV genotype 1; 11 isolates were grouped with BVDV-lb and 7 isolates with BVDV-If viruses. Phylogenetic tree extracted by Bayesian approach using combined 5'-UTR/Npro favored clustering of Croatian isolates into two subgroups.

Molecular dating suggests that reclassification events most likely occurred in wild birds from Russia or Mongolia. In addition, 2 genetically distinct H5N5 reassortant viruses were detected in wild birds in the Netherlands.

In developed countries such as the USA, Japan, and Taiwan, viruses that infect humans and pigs share the same genotype with high sequence similarity. Genotype 1 circulates in humans, while genotype 4 is found in pigs in India. This study was designed to investigate the presence of anti-HEV antibodies and HEV-RNA in the swine population from northern India, to investigate the genotype prevalent in this population, and to compare it with other swine and human HEV strains from India. Methods: A Indian A total of 67 serum samples were collected from aged (1-6 months) pigs from the Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareily and subjected to anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA detection. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and evaluated using the internal branch test method with MEGA 4 software. Results: Anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA were found in 38.8 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, of the porcine samples examined. The above samples were observed to be genotype 4e. The three new sequences had nucleotide similarity with other pig sequences in genotype 4 ranging from 80 to 98 percent.

148,Relationships and history of live Newcastle disease vaccine strains,"NDV (Newcastle disease virus) strains used to be classified solely on the basis of virulence, but recently grouping based on genetic associations of strains is the preferred method. Live vaccine strains belong to the categories of mild (lentogenic) or moderately virulent (mesogenic), in contrast to the highly pathogenic epidemic viruses of the velogenic group. Insertion of vaccine strains into the 'NDV world' using their genetic traits and ancestry can be visualized as described below (Figure 1). 1. Lentogenic vaccine strains are found in two of the dozen or so NDV genotypes resident in chickens. One is American group 11 (includes vaccine strains B-1, LaSota, and F), and the other is genotype I (with strains Ulster 2C, V4/Queensland and NDV-6/10), also in wild waterfowl. 2. Mesogenic strains are also found in only two genotypes: group 11 (Roakin and Komarov strains) and Asian genogroup III (H and Mukteswar strains). 3. Vaccine strains of Groups I and 11 were of natural origin, while strains H, Mukteswar and Komarov were artificially attenuated, as claimed in reports in the 1940s. However, differences were seen between the true genetic identity and the putative origin of the mesogenic vaccine strains (Fig. 2). a) Since the mesogenic strain H is unrelated to its apparent parent, the virulent Herts'33, the reduced virulence of H cannot be attributed to egg-passing procedures performed in the UK, and its very existence is a puzzle. b) Strains H and Mukteswar with less than 0.3% nucleotide distance between them must be derived from the same isolate and thus cannot be the result of independent developments in the UK and India. c) The reduced virulence (mesogenic) of the H/Mukteswar strain cannot be associated with attenuation either; most likely a naturally occurring Indian field isolate. d) The mesogenic Komarov strain, which is said to be attenuated by intracerebral transmission of a local velogenic virus in ducklings in Palestine, is identical to Roakin, the American (genotype 11) vaccine strain for which no scientific explanation can be given.",,"Bela, L.",2008.0,Jun,,0
149,New viruses detected by metagenomic approaches in veterinary medicine,"In our world today, facing extraordinary environmental changes and dramatically intensifying globalization, we are facing challenges due to many new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of hitherto ""unknown"" infectious diseases. Although we have a large arsenal of diagnostic methods at our disposal, most conventional diagnostic tests are highly virus-specific or target only a limited group of infectious agents. This specificity makes it difficult or even inhibits the detection of new or unexpected pathogens, such as new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or new viral variants. Recently developed viral metagenomic approaches provide an effective new way to screen samples and detect viruses without prior knowledge of the infectious agent, thus enabling better diagnosis and disease control in line with the principles of ""One World, One Health"" (www. oneworldonehealth). .organ). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently identified a wide variety of novel viruses, such as novel bocaviruses, Torque Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and cobuviruses, novel virus variants in honeybee populations, and a number of other infectious agents in swine disease syndromes. in other host species.

150,Advances in viral disease diagnosis and molecular epidemiological technologies,"The early and rapid detection and characterization of specific nucleic acids of medical-veterinary pathogens has proven invaluable for diagnostic purposes. The integration of amplification and signal detection systems, including online real-time instruments, has increased speed and sensitivity and greatly facilitated the quantification of target nucleic acids. They also allowed sequence characterization using melting or hybridization curves. Next-generation molecular diagnostic technologies offer hitherto unique detection and discrimination methodologies vital for the positive detection and identification of pathogenic agents, as well as the effects of pathogens on antibody production. The development phase of new technologies requires a thorough understanding of the accurate diagnosis and differentiation of existing and emerging diseases. The development of new technologies can only be successful if they are transferred and used in the field with a sustainable quality-assured practice to allow for optimal detection and effective control of diseases. The purpose of these new tools is to detect the presence of a pathogenic agent before disease begins.

152,Propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) improve DNA sequencing and high-throughput sequencing of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus identification,"Pan-viral DNA sequencing (PVDA) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) are useful tools for identifying novel viruses of emerging diseases. However, both techniques have difficulties in identifying viruses in clinical samples due to the host genomic nucleic acid content (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) have free DNA/RNA binding capacity, but the cell membrane is not permeable. Therefore, both are unable to bind conserved nucleic acids like viral genomes within intact virions. However, genetic material modified with EMA/PMA cannot be amplified by enzymes. To evaluate the potential of EMA/PMA to reduce the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in samples and improve virus detection, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) was added to serum and lung tissue homogenates and treated with EMA/PMA. In addition, clinical samples positive for PRRSV RT-qPCR were also tested. EMA/PMA treatments significantly reduced amplified hg/cont and significantly increased the number of PVDA positive probes and their signal intensity compared to untreated spike lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased the sensitivity of HTS by increasing the number of specific PRRSV readings and the percentage of PRRSV coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two of the three clinical tissue samples. Therefore, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to lower amplified hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS in identifying viruses.",,"Bellehumeur, C.;Boyle, B.;Charette, S.

156,Genotype Diversity of Newcastle Disease Virus in Nigeria: Disease Control Challenges and Looking Ahead,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important avian diseases threatening poultry productivity worldwide. The disease is associated with severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological lesions in chickens that lead to high mortality and some other production-related losses. The etiology of the disease is an avian paramyxovirus type-1 or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whose isolates are serologically grouped into a single serotype, but genetically classified into a total of 19 genotypes due to the continued emergence and evolution of the virus. In Nigeria, molecular characterization of NDV is generally minimal and largely focuses on amplification of the partial F gene for genotype assignment. However, with the introduction of the most objective NDV genotyping criteria using whole fusion protein coding sequences in phylogenetic taxonomy, the enormous genetic diversity of the virus in Nigeria has become very remarkable. In this review, we examine the current ecological distribution of various NDV genotypes in Nigeria based on available complete fusion protein nucleotide sequences (1662 bp) in the NCBI database. Next, we will discuss the challenges of ND control as a result of the wide genetic distance between currently circulating NDV isolates and the most common vaccines used in the country to combat the disease.

157,"Novel polyphenol oxidase extracted from the metagenome expression library of bovine rumen: Biochemical properties, structural analysis and phylogenetic relationships","RL5, a gene encoding a novel polyphenol oxidase, was identified by activity screening of a metagenome expression library from bovine rumen microflora. Characterization of the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed a multipotent capacity to oxidize a wide variety of substrates (syringaldazin > 2,6-dimethoxyphenol > veratryl alcohol > guaiacol > tetramethylbenzidine > 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol > 2.2â€²-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) – â‰« phenol red) over an unusually wide pH range from 3.5 to 9.0. For ABTS, syringaldazine and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, the apparent Km and k cat values obtained from steady-state kinetic measurements at 40°C, pH 4.5 gave values of 26, 0.43 and 0.45 Î¼M and 18, 660 and 1175. s-1 respectively. Km values for syringaldazine and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol are up to 5 times lower than previously reported values for this enzyme class, and kcat values are up to 40 times higher. RL5 is a 4 copper oxidase with oxidation potential values of 745, 400 and 500 mV compared to the normal hydrogen electrode for the T1, T2 and T3 copper regions. A three-dimensional model of RL5 and site-directed mutants were generated to identify copper ligands. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene sequence and the sequences and contexts of neighboring genes suggested a tentative phylogenetic assignment to the genus Bacteroides. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR analyzes provide conclusive evidence that putative proteins from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and E. coli, which is closely related to the deduced protein encoded by the RL5 gene, are also multicopper proteins with polyphenol oxidase activity. This study demonstrates that these three newly characterized enzymes form a new family of functional multicopper oxidases with laccase activity related to conserved hypothetical proteins harboring the domain of unknown function DUF152, suggesting that some of these proteins may also be laccases.

159,"Prioritization of zoonotic viral diseases in wild pigs, domestic pigs and human interface","INTRODUCTION: Understanding the ecology of diseases requires an understanding of pathogens at the wildlife-animal interface. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a health concern when countries try to prevent and control zoonotic diseases, as their populations raise environmental and health concerns due to infectious agents that can infect domestic pigs and other animal species, including humans. diseases at the interface of wild boars, domestic animals and humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evidence-based semi-quantitative prioritization method included 27 criteria identified in recent publications. We classified them into five categories based on viral etiology: epidemiology (eight), prevention/control (three), economy/business (four), public health (nine), and society (three). Each criterion had a coefficient of 0 to 7 according to their evidence-based effects (maximum total of 189). Evidence for criteria for the nine viral diseases analyzed was obtained from a review of 81 sources published between 1977 and 2015. RESULTS: The top three diseases with the highest scores and zoonotic potential were swine flu (133), hepatitis E (123), and hantavirus infection (103) with the highest scores in the epidemiology and public health criteria. CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative prioritization methods, evidence-based contributes impartially to decision making; however, they are rarely used in developing countries due to the lack of data from public health surveillance. Controlling common diseases requires the development of strategies to reduce the transmission of pathogens between wildlife, domestic animals and humans.",,"Benavides-Arias, D.;Soler-Tovar, D.",2015.0,,10.7705/biomedica.v36i0.2950,0
160,Characterization of surface proteins of influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated from humans in 1997-1998,"Influenza A (H5N1) viruses infected people in Hong Kong between May and December 1997. Sixteen viruses were isolated during this epidemic, including 6 fatal cases. Molecular analysis of the surface proteins genes encoding hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of these H5N1 isolates, a subtype not previously known to infect humans, is presented. The 16 human H5 HA sequences contain multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, a motif associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The phylogenetic relationship between both avian and human H5 hemagglutinins suggests that human isolates are directly related to isolates circulating among chickens in five poultry markets in Hong Kong before and during the outbreak in humans. HA sequences from human isolates and a novel chicken isolate represent a distinct clade in which two subsets can be distinguished antigenically and by the presence of a potential glycosylation site. Similarly, N1 neuraminidases of human H5 isolates represent a class that is evolutionarily distinct from previously characterized N1 neuraminidases. Recent human H5N1 virus NA genes are avian-like, indicating direct entry from an avian source rather than evolution of a human N1 NA. All 16 human NA genes encode a shortened stem due to a 19 amino acid deletion, also found in avian H5N1 isolates recently obtained from Hong Kong. Two unique amino acids were identified in the N1 NAs of recent human isolates; however, it is unknown whether these residues affect host range. Neither the HA nor the NA genes of human H5N1 virus isolates show evidence of adaptive changes during the epidemic. While analyzes of the surface protein genes of HSN1 viruses in this epidemic did not provide immediate answers to the molecular basis for virulence, the analyzes did provide clues to potentially important areas of the genes that are worth further investigation.",,"Bender, C.;Hall, H.;Huang, J.;Klimov, A.;Cox, N.;Hay, A.;Gregory, V.;Cameron, K.;Lim, W.;Subbarao, K.",1999.0,,10.1006/viro.1998.9529,0
161,Analysis of Variability in Non-Coding Regions of Influenza A Viruses,"The genomes of influenza A viruses (IAVs) contain eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments. In addition to the protein-coding region, each segment has 5' and 3' non-coding regions (NCR), which are important for transcription, replication and packaging. NCRs contain both conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the effects of variability in NCRs are not fully understood. Full NCRs have been identified from some viruses, but a detailed analysis of the potential variability in these regions between viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To assess the degree of protection in NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced the NCRs of IAVs isolated from different wild avian host groups (ducks, gulls and seabirds). We then expanded our study to include NCRs available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Virus Database, allowing us to analyze a wider variety of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variation within NCRs varied between segments, with the greatest variation being in HA and NA and the least in M and NS segments. Overall, variability in NCR sequences was correlated with coding region phylogeny, suggesting vertical coevolution of (coding sequence) CDS and NCR regions.",,"Benkaroun, J.;Robertson, G.

162,Molecular techniques: new opportunities in light of adenovirus research,"Presenting their latest achievements in the field of adenovirus research, the author summarizes the new possibilities found in modern molecular techniques that are revolutionizing virus research and diagnostics. Among the new methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is of the greatest importance. Due to the large and growing number of known virus serotypes, the classical serological identification of new isolates has become extremely demanding today. In addition, reliable collections of reference strains and serums are rarely available in laboratories. PCR combined with sequencing offers a fast and efficient alternative. New viruses identified and classified by these methods are called types instead of serotypes. In different veterinary laboratories, the large number of strains of adenovirus isolated in different veterinary laboratories over the past few decades have not yet been characterized. Now these viruses can be typed and classified by sequence analysis of specific genes. Another major advantage of the method is that it allows molecular characterization of non-isolated viruses. This is particularly valuable for the study of adenoviruses from wild animals when isolation of the virus is often not a realistic option. The author's research group is the first in the world to determine the complete genomic sequence of an adenovirus solely through PCRs from infected organ samples of diseased and dead birds without successful isolation of the virus. Organ samples from different vertebrate animals found dead in zoos, pet stores, or the wild are continuously screened by PCR in the author's lab. Fecal samples are equally suitable for screening purposes. Besides birds and reptiles, a high rate of adenoviral infection has recently been demonstrated among domestic bats.",,"Benko, M.",2011.0,Aug,,0

164,Does common architecture spawn a viral lineage spanning all three domains of life?,"Our discovery that the major coat protein of the bacteriophage PRD1 is similar to that of human adenovirus raised the unexpected possibility that viruses infecting bacteria may be evolutionarily related to those infecting animal hosts. We first review the evolution of this idea. Next, we describe how we used structure-based modeling to show that several other viruses with no detectable sequence similarity have coats made of similar proteins - the ""double-barrelled trimer"". There is evidence that the group includes several viruses that infect very different hosts in all three areas of life: Eukarya; bacterium; and Archaea, which split billions of years ago. The current classification of viruses hides such similarities. We propose that the appearance of a double-barrelled trimer coat protein in an icosahedral dsDNA virus with major aspects, regardless of its host, is a very strong indicator of membership in a viral lineage with a common ancestor.",,"Benson, S.

165,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical syndrome and genetic diversity","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most important tick-borne viral disease in humans, causing sporadic cases or outbreaks of serious disease in a wide geographical area from western China to the Middle East and Southeast Europe and most of Africa. CCHF is maintained in vertical and horizontal transmission cycles involving disease-free ixodid ticks and a variety of wild and domesticated vertebrates. The virus circulates in a number of tick genera, but Hyalomma ticks are the major source of human infection, possibly because both immature and adult forms actively seek hosts for the blood meals required at all stages of maturation. CCHF is most common among farm workers following the bite of an infected tick, and to a lesser extent among slaughterhouse workers who are exposed to the blood and tissues of infected farm animals and medical personnel through contact with bodily fluids of infected animals. CCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the arboviruses, with nucleotide sequence differences between isolates ranging from 20% for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. While viruses with different sequences can be found in the same geographic area, closely related viruses have been isolated in very distant regions, suggesting that CCHF has been widely spread from time to time in the past, possibly via migratory bird-borne ticks or international channels. animal trade. Reclassification between genome segments during co-infection of ticks or vertebrates appears to have played an important role in generating diversity and represents a potential future source of new viruses. In this article, we review the current knowledge of CCHF by first summarizing its molecular biology, maintenance and transmission, epidemiology, and geographic range. We also include a comprehensive discussion of CCHFV genetic diversity, including maps of the virus's range with overlaid phylogenetic trees. We then review the characteristics of CCHF, including the clinical syndrome, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, vaccine development, and laboratory animal models of CCHF. The article ends with a discussion of the possible future geographic range of the virus. For the benefit of researchers, we include an Supplementary Table listing all published reports of CCHF cases and outbreaks in the English literature, as well as some key articles in other languages, with total case counts, case fatality rates, and all CCHF viruses in GenBank.

166,Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of host range genes of Camelpox virus isolates from India,"Camelpox virus (CMLV), a close variant of the Variola virus (VARV), infects camels worldwide. The zoonotic infections reported from India point to the need to study host-range genes responsible for host tropism. We report the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of five host-range genes: cytokine response modifier B (crmB), chemokine binding protein (ckbp), viral schlafen-like (v-slfn), myxomavirus T4-like (M-T4-like) and isolated from outbreaks in India. acquired b5r CMLV. Comparative analysis revealed that these genes are conserved among CMLVs and share 94.5%-100% identity at both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels. All genes showed identity (59.3%-98.4%Â) with cowpox virus (CPXV), while three genes-crmB, ckbp and b5r showed similarity (92%-96.5%Â) with VARVs at both the nt and aa levels. . Interestingly, three consecutive serine residue insertions were observed in the CKBP protein of the CMLV-Delhi09 isolate, which was similar to CPXV-BR and VACVs, with five point mutations (K53Q, N67I, F84S, A127T, and E182G) similar to zoonotic OPXVs. Also, several inconsistent point mutations were observed in other gene(s) among Indian CMLVs. These suggest that different strains of CMLV are circulating in India and that these mutations may play an important role in the adaptation of CMLVs in humans. The phylogeny revealed co-clustering of all CMLVs except CMLV-Delhi09, which was grouped separately due to the presence of specific point mutations. However, the topology of the combined phylogeny showed the close evolutionary relationship of CMLV with VARV and TATV, followed by CPXV-RatGer09/1 from Germany.

167,"Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of host range (E3L, K3L and C7L) and structural protein (B5R) genes of buffalopox virus isolates from buffalo, bovine and human in India.","Buffalopox virus (BPXV), a close variant of vaccinia virus (VACV), has emerged as a zoonotic pathogen. The host tropism of poxviruses is governed by host-range genes. Among the host range genes: E3L, K3L and C7L are essential for virus replication by preventing interferon resistance, whereas B5R is essential for virus spread and evade the host immune response as in VACV. We report the sequence analysis of host-range genes: E3L, K3L, C7L and membrane protein gene (B5R) of BPXVs from buffalo, bovine and human from recent outbreaks in India - their phylogenetic relationships with the reference strain (BP4) and other Orthopoxviruses. BPXVs revealed a range of homology with VACVs, including zoonotic Brazilian VACV-like viruses. The aa sequences of the E3L and K3L genes were 100% similar in buffalo, bovine and human isolates. However, only four important point mutations specific to the buffalo isolate (N12K and S36F in the C7L gene and D249G in the B5R gene) were observed. This indicates that different strains of BPXV were circulating during the outbreak. Mutations in C7L and B5R may play an important role in the adaptation of BPXV in humans and cattle, which needs further functional studies. BPXV strain isolated from buffalo may not be adopted in humans and cows. Various point mutations were observed in the host range genes of the reference strain (BPXV-BP4), which may be due to several virus passages in cell culture. The phylogeny constructed based on the assembled gene sequences revealed that BPXVs were not closely related to the vaccine strain (Lister and Lister-derived strain - LC16m8) as previously assumed, but rather more closely related to the reference strain (BPXV-BP4) and others. .

The F gene was found to be 1845 nucleotides long, containing a long open reading frame that can encode a protein of 541 amino acids. The cleavage motif for F0 into F1 and F2 is His-Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg. A sequence comparison and a phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify possible functional domains of paramyxovirus fusion proteins and also to classify porcine rubula virus. The F gene of LPMV is most closely related to the human mumps virus and simian virus type 5 F genes and is therefore classified into the rubulavirus genus.

169,Phage-bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic investigation of the rumen microbiome,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interactions with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analyzed the obtained data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed, with up to 28,000 different viral genotypes from each medium. The majority (~78%) of the sequences did not match the viruses previously described. Prophages, the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types, outstripped lytic phages at a ratio of approximately 2:1, associated with members of the dominant rumen phylum (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include the previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes.

170,Using non-invasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife,"Microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. While high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, establishing comparable viral communities has proven difficult, especially in wildlife samples where virus diversity and limited amounts of viral nucleic acids present distinct challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently hinders comparisons between host taxa or regions. Here, we developed a non-targeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from fecal and oropharyngeal swabs collected noninvasively. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species in transmission of the virus to humans and pets, we tested how different storage environments, nucleic acid extraction procedures, and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on the finding of viral contamination in fetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or other non-biological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than supernatant or pelleted material with undetectable viral RNA levels. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol show that ribosomal RNA depletion and mild DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid and improve virus detection. Finally, by applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven sites in Peru, we showed that saturated viral communities were detected at the resulting sequencing depth, allowing for unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate determinants of viral communities across host species, environments, and time.",,"Bergner, L. M.;Orton, R.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, which included comparison with other rabies strains from all of the Americas, identified three major Brazilian virus groups, arbitrarily termed BRL-1 to BRL-3. BRL-1 was found in terrestrial carnivores and in clusters with other American strains of cosmopolitan ancestry. BRL-2 consisted of two separate isolates from two non-hematophagous bat species with evolutionary links to North American insectivorous bat-derived strains. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and possibly livestock infected by contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was further divided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated only with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found only in gray foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian hoary fox as a reservoir of rabies.

174,No FMD virus transmission from Permanently Infected Cattle to Pure Cattle in Field Conditions in Vietnam,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD), caused by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV; Aphthovirus, Picornaviridae), is a highly contagious and economically important disease of ungulate pet and wildlife species worldwide. Following the clinical phase of FMD, the majority of FMDV-infected ruminants become persistently infected carriers, identified by detection of FMDV in oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples 28 days or more after infection. The aim of this prospective study was to characterize the FMD carrier status in cattle following natural infection under typical livestock practices in Vietnam. Ten permanently infected cattle on eight farms in Long An province in Southern Vietnam were followed by monthly screening of serum and oropharyngeal fluid samples for 12 months. To assess transmission from FMDV carriers, 16 pure cattle were deliberately brought into direct contact with permanently infected animals for 6 months and monitored by clinical and laboratory methods. The restricted mean duration of FMD carrier status was 27.7 months, and the rate of reduction in carrier animals was 0.03 per month. There was no evidence of transmission to naïve animals during the study period. In addition, there was no detection of FMDV infection or seroconversion in three calves born to carrier animals at the time of the study. The strength of infection for carrier-to-contact transmission was 0 per month, and the upper 95% confidence limit was 0.064 per month. Phylogenetic analysis of viral protein 1 (VP1) coding sequences from carriers showed that all viruses obtained in this study belong to the O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage and are grouped with phylogenetically related viruses temporally and geographically.

Ten days after the first lesion appeared, both unbleached purpuric papules and necrotic purpura became evident on the legs, ankles, and dorsum of the feet. Histological evaluation showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These latter lesions disappeared within ten days without treatment. Also, ORF lesions resolved spontaneously three weeks after onset. After six months of follow-up, neither ORF lesions nor allergic vasculitis recurred. Viral infections are well known as etiological factors of vasculitis. Many factors led us to think that this case of allergic vasculitis was associated with ORF virus infection: time of onset, duration, resolution of the clinical course of ORF, no need for treatment for recovery, and six-month patient-free follow-up. repeats. This indicates the possibility of the ORF virus being classified within the group of viruses responsible for allergic vasculitis.",,"Bettoli, V.;Trovato, C.;La Malfa, W.;Pazzaglia, M.",1997.0,,,0
176,Dynamics of acute Montipora white syndrome: bacterial communities of healthy and diseased M. capitata colonies during and after a disease outbreak.,"Coral diseases contribute to the decline of coral reefs globally and threaten the health and future of coral reef communities. Acute Montipora white syndrome (aMWS) is a tissue wasting disease that has killed hundreds of Montipora capitata colonies in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii in recent years. This work describes the analysis of coral-associated bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing generated by the PacBio RSII platform. Samples from the three health states of M. capitata (healthy, healthy-diseased, and diseased) were collected during an ongoing aMWS outbreak and a non-outbreak period, and bacterial communities were determined to determine if there was a change in community structure between the two. periods. The bacterial communities associated with the epidemic and non-outbreak samples were significantly different, and one of the main factors was Escherichia spp. in epidemic series. In silico bacterial source tracking suggested that this OTU was likely caused by sewage contamination of livestock and not of human origin. The most abundant coliform OTU was a culturable E. fergusonii isolate, strain OCN300, but did not induce disease symptoms on healthy M. capitata colonies when used in laboratory infection trials. In addition, screening of the sequencing output found that the most abundant OTUs corresponded to the previously described M. capitata pathogens. The synergistic combination of known coral pathogens, sewage pollutants, and other stressors such as fluctuating seawater temperatures and bacterial pathogens has the potential to increase the degradation of coral reef ecosystems.",,"Beurmann, S.;Ushijima, B.;Videau, P.;Svoboda, C.

177,Capripox control and elimination prospects from the Indian subcontinent: A perspective.,"Sheep pox and goat pox, two endemic capripox infections in India, pose a significant economic threat to the productivity of small ruminant animals in the subcontinent. Vaccination of all susceptible sheep and goats is a viable and sustainable method of control. The availability of effective live attenuated vaccines that are inherently thermostable and the development of advanced diagnostics provide opportunities to initiate effective control measures for capripox. All animals older than 4 months can be vaccinated with a single vaccine, either intradermally or subcutaneously, with available homologous vaccines. The success of the control program needs to be monitored with active surveillance, especially for the presence of virus, because sero-monitoring does not differentiate between infection and vaccination. Also, seroconversion following capripox vaccine cannot be adequately detected by available tools. Sustained control efforts require socio-economic and political stability, adequate infrastructure and logistical support to store and transport vaccines for delivery to remote end users. Availability of veterinary services, extension services developed to raise awareness among farmers contribute significantly to control campaigns. Poor vaccination coverage and inadequate infrastructure in large parts of the country are some of the main obstacles to the effective implementation of herd immunity through vaccination. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Bhanuprakash, V.;Hosamani, M.;Singh, R.

178,Current status of sheep pox,"Sheep are the lively shores of shepherds and their economic contribution in terms of meat, wool and leather/skin is enormous. Various infectious diseases compromise optimum productivity; Among other economic losses, sheep pox is more important as the disease restricts the export of sheep and their products. Although clinical signs are indicative of disease, laboratory confirmation is required for definitive diagnosis and epidemiology study. The causative agent is antigenically and genetically closely related to sheep pox virus (SPV), goat pox virus (GPV) and tuberous skin disease virus (LSDV), which are other members of the capripox virus genus. In some countries, SPV and GPV are cross-infective for small ruminant animals, which poses a challenge in diagnosis and epidemiology. However, recent studies have shown that viruses are phylogenetically distinct and can be distinguished by molecular tools. Prophylaxis using attenuated vaccines is the choice of control measure since immunity is long lasting. Detailed information on isolation, identification, pathology, epidemiology, diagnosis and prophylaxis will not only help update scientific fraternity knowledge, but will also be useful to policy makers to formulate appropriate measures for the control and eradication of the disease. This synthesis is to provide the reader with a current review of the disease and its control to provide an overview of the problem. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

179,Fluorogenic RT-PCR test (TaqMan) for detection and classification of bovine viral diarrhea virus,"one-tube fluorogenic RT-PCR based 'TaqMan' test has been developed for the detection and classification of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). TaqMan-PCR was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 array detection system and double-labeled fluorogenic probes. Two different gene-specific labeled fluorogenic probes for the 5â€² untranslated region (5â€² UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD type I and II. The sensitivity of the one-tube TaqMan assay was compared with the two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT-PCR using 10-fold RNA dilutions. The one-tube TaqMan assay was 10-100 times more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and standardized one-tube RT-PCR. The specificity of the test was evaluated by testing different strains of BVD virus and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum samples, field isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantification of cRNA from type I and II BVD virus was performed with a standard curve plotting cycle thresholds (CT) versus copy number. The one-tube TaqMan-PCR assay was sensitive, specific, and rapid for detection, quantification, and classification of BVD virus.

According to genetic and phylogenetic analysis, viruses have a stable gene sequence with Clade 2.3.2.1c HA. , one H9N2-derived PB2 gene and six other genes from Asian H5N1 origin. Clade 2.3.2.1c H5N1 reassortants showed a high genetic association with a human H5N1 strain (A/Alberta/01/2014). Further analysis showed that similar viruses were circulating in wild birds in China, Russia, Dubai (Western Asia), Bulgaria and Romania (Europe), as well as in domestic poultry in parts of Africa. Affected areas include Central Asia, East Asia-Australia, West Asia-East Africa and Black Sea/Mediterranean flight routes. These results suggest that novel Clade 2.3.2.1c reassortant viruses are circulating worldwide and may have gained a selective advantage in migratory birds, thus posing a serious threat to wild birds and potentially to humans.

However, this was not the case for a default third ORF, ORF3. Throughout the viral genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus were identified. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished the three main TLMV groups and allowed the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stool and saliva.

These sequences are also compared to the partial G gene sequences of VSV IND type 2 (Cocal) and type 3 (Alagoas) viruses and the full G gene sequences of the more distantly related VSV New Jersey (NJ) and Chandipura viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of G gene sequences with maximum sparing revealed four major lineages or subtypes within the classic VSV IND (type 1) viruses, each with a different geographic distribution. A high degree of VSV genetic diversity was found in Central America, and several virus subtypes of both the VSV IND and NJ serotypes were present in this primarily enzootic disease region. Nineteen percent sequence variation, but no deletions or insertions were evident in the 5' non-coding and coding regions of the VSV IND type 1 G genes. In addition to multiple base substitutions, the 3' noncoding regions of these viruses also contained multiple base insertions and deletions. This resulted in a striking variation in G gene sizes, with gene lengths ranging from 1,652 to 1,868 nucleotides. As the VSV IND type 1 subtypes diverged from the common ancestor with the NJ subtypes, their G mRNAs accumulated more 3' non-coding sequence inserts, ranging in length up to 303. They basically consist of an imprecise repetition of the UUUUUAA sequence generated by a unique polymerase stuttering error. Analysis of inferred amino acid sequence differences among VSV IND type 1 viruses revealed multiple substitutions within defined antigenic epitopes, suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the evolution of these viruses.",,"Bilsel, P.

186,Different genotypes of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis viruses circulating together in the chicken population in China,"Chicken nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis (IB) has been prevalent in most poultry farms in recent years, but the IB vaccination program has been widely implemented in China. To characterize the S1 protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from China, five representative nephropathogenic IB viruses isolated from chickens from different provinces were genetically and phylogenetically analyzed. The results showed that the lengths of the S1 genes of the isolates were quite different (1,617, 1,620, 1,623, 1,629 and 1,632 nucleotides, respectively). The homology of nucleotides and amino acids among the five isolates was 76.7% vs. 92.1% and 73.9% vs. 89.5%, respectively, indicating a large variation in the S1 genes of the isolates. Variation in S1 genes can affect the antigenicity and pathogenicity of viruses. Genetically, point mutations, insertions and deletions in the S1 protein can be observed at many positions, particularly the first 150 amino acids in the N-terminus of the S1 protein. Two motif cleavage sites (RRXRR/S, HRRRR/S) were observed in the five stranded strains. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that they belonged to different lineages. These findings indicated that different genotypes of nephropathogenic IB viruses circulate together in the chicken population in China. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bing, G.

187,Enterovirus serotypes in patients with central nervous system and respiratory tract infections in Viet Nam 1997-2010.,"BACKGROUND: Enteroviruses are the most common causative agents of human disease. Enteroviruses have recently been associated with regional and global epidemics, including severe disease (Enterovirus A71 and D68), and are of interest as emerging viruses. Here, we report Enterovirus AD (EV) from central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory tract infections in Vietnam. METHODS: Data and samples from prospective observational clinical studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were used. Species and serotypes were determined using type-specific RT-PCR and viral protein 1 or 4 (VP1, VP4) sequencing. RESULTS: Samples from patients with CNS infection (51 children - 10 CSF and 41 respiratory/rectal swabs) and 28 adults (28 CSF) and respiratory tract infections (124 children - 124 respiratory swabs) were analyzed. Twenty-six different serotypes of four Enterovirus strains (AD), including EV-A71 and EV-D68, were identified. Enterovirus B has been associated with viral meningitis in children and adults. Enteroviruses A (EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus [CV] A10) associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease have been detected in children with encephalitis. Different serotypes of the four Enterovirus strains were found in respiratory samples, including 2 polio vaccine viruses, as well as 8 CV-A24 and 8 EV-D68. With the exception of EV-D68, the relevance of these viruses to respiratory infection is unknown. CONCLUSION: We described a diverse spectrum of enteroviruses from patients with CNS and respiratory tract infections in Viet Nam between 1997 and 2010. These data confirm the global circulation of Enterovirus genera and their associations and are important for clinical diagnosis, patient management and outbreak response.",,"B'Krong, N.;Minh, N. N.

188,Adenovirus respiratory infection in turkey poultry,"virus with respiratory manifestations from turkey chicks was isolated in specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and subsequently adapted to chicken embryo fibroblast and turkey kidney cell cultures where round cell formation was observed. The cloned virus was ether resistant and contained triple thymidine. Intranuclear icosahedral virus particles of 80 nm were detected. These physicochemical properties place this isolate in the adenovirus virus group. The disease has been propagated experimentally by intratracheal vaccination of one-day-old turkey chicks. Snicking occurred in 100% of the birds and the mortality rate reached 50%. CELO (Phelps strain) antiserum neutralized uncloned and cloned CUA-2 in chicken embryos and uncloned virus in chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures. Quail bronchitis virus antiserum neutralized the cloned CUA-2 in TK cells. Agar-gel precipitin identification lines were established using CELO antiserum and postinoculation sera from experimentally infected turkeys.

189,Variable and constant regions in African swine fever virus DNA,"An analysis of the SalI restriction pattern of African swine fever virus DNA showed that SalI recognition sites did not change after more than 100 virus passages in porcine macrophages. Virus strain BA71V obtained from virus isolate BA71 by adaptation to growth in VERO cells differed from unadapted virus in two deletions 2.5 and 7 kb long located close to the DNA ends. A restriction analysis of several virus clones from a naturally infected pig revealed length heterogeneity in both variable regions. A comparison of SalI restriction maps from 23 African swine fever virus isolates (8 African, 11 European and 4 American) showed that the virus genome consists of a fixed-length central region of approximately 125 kb and two closely spaced variable regions. The DNA ends are 38-47 kb long for the left DNA end and 13-16 kb for the right DNA end. The total length of ASF virus DNA ranged from 178 (BA71) to 189 (MOZ64) kb. 23 African swine fever virus isolates were classified into five groups according to the pattern of SalI regions in the central region. Four groups contained only African isolates, while all European and American isolates belonged to the same group.

KOOLV was previously shown to be antigenically related to cotoncone virus, an ephemerovirus that causes a short-lived fever-like illness in cattle in Nigeria, but YATV did not react antigenically with any of the other viruses tested. Here we report the complete genome sequences of KOOLV (16,133 nt) and YATV (14,479 nt). Each has a complex genome organization with multiple genes, including a second nonstructural glycoprotein (GNS) gene and a viroporin (Î±1) gene between the G and L genes, characteristic of ephemeroviruses. Based on genome organization, sequence identity and cross-neutralization analysis, we show that both KOOLV and YATV should be classified as two new species in the genus Ephemerovirus.",,"Blasdell, K.

Further characterization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sequencing of the 5-UTR and partial VP1 coding region, and phylogenetic analysis classified the virus isolate as bovine enterovirus type 1 (BEV-1). No other significant pathogens were detected. This is the first report of BEV-1 isolated in the US from an animal with terminal enteric disease in more than 20 years.

Microscopic findings consisted of acute, multifocal meningoencephalitis with neuronal degeneration and necrosis and gliosis. Viral isolation yielded non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Virus genotyping classified the virus as BVDV type 2. Immunohistochemical labeling for BVDV antigens with the BVD MAb 3.12F1 clone was evident in the cytoplasm of neurons, glial cells, ependymal epithelium, perivascular macrophages and spindle cells, smooth muscle cells, and intravascular monocytes. brain and brain stem. Laboratory results support that tissue changes occur as a result of BVDV type 2 infection. In the absence of other clinical signs of BVDV infection and using the microscopic and laboratory evidence presented, we suggest that BVDV type 2 isolated from this case may represent a neurovirulent strain of the virus.

Sequences encoding proteins distantly related to the replicase protein of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified. Reverse PCR was used to amplify and sequence multiple small circular DNA viral genomes. Viral genomes were related to vertebrate circoviruses and plant geminiviruses in size and genome organization, but the rolling circle had a different location for the stem-loop structure involved in DNA replication. The replicase genes of these viruses were most closely related to those of the much smaller (similar to 1 kb) plant nanovirus circular DNA chromosomes.

A panel of flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was tested in blocking experiments with serum samples from WNV-infected chickens and crows. Selected MAbs were further tested against serum samples from birds representing 16 species and 10 families. Serum samples were collected from birds infected with WNV or Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and from uninfected control birds. Serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were included in these experiments because WNV and SLEV are antigenically closely related, maintained in similar transmission cycles, and have overlapping geographic distributions. ELISA using MAb 3.1112G potentially distinguished between WNV and SLEV infections, as all serum samples from WNV-infected birds and no serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were positive in this assay. Assays with MAbs 2B2 and 6B6C-1 readily detected serum antibodies in all WNV and SLEV-infected birds, respectively, and most other virus-infected birds. The other two MAbs partially differentiated between infections with these two viruses. Serum samples from most WNV-infected birds but not SLEV-infected birds were positive with MAb 3.67G, whereas almost all serum samples from SLEV-infected birds, but a few serum samples from WNV-infected birds, were positive with MAb 6B5A-5. .

For decades, only four classical strains (Classic swine fever virus, Bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, Border disease virus) and a few so-called atypical pestiviruses (eg Giraffe virus, Pronghorn virus, HoBi virus) were known. A number of new pestiviruses have been identified in recent years (Bungowannah virus, Bat pestivirus, Norwegian rat pestivirus, Atypical porcine pestivirus, LINDA virus). Australian Bungowannah virus can be isolated and further characterized by classical sequencing, but all other novel new pestiviruses were identified by metagenomics using next-generation sequencing technologies.

However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the pig population, and most pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Age, maintenance, genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens etc. It has been suggested that different factors such as the development of PMWS contribute to the development of PMWS. However, no proven link between any of these factors and disease development has so far been found. In this study, we investigated the possible presence of other hitherto unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with PMWS confirmed by random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of amplified genetic sequences belong to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and a novel parvovirus. Detection of TTV like PCV-2 was expected, TTV was found to have a high prevalence in pigs worldwide. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2.

198,Viral metagenomic analysis shows Co-infection status in healthy and PMWS-affected pigs,"The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has allowed the possibility to investigate and characterize the entire microbiome of individuals, providing a better understanding of the complex interaction between different microorganisms. This will help to understand how the microbiome influences the susceptibility of secondary agents and disease development. We applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from Swedish pigs and healthy pigs suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) multifactorial disease. The aim is to increase knowledge about potential viruses other than porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) involved in PMWS development and to increase knowledge about viroma of healthy individuals. A diverse viral flora was seen in healthy individuals, with several different viruses present at the same time. Most of the viruses identified are small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as the different circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were highly detected, as expected, but other viruses were also detected in the background of PCV2. DNA viruses as well as RNA viruses have been identified, among them a porcine pestivirus with high similarity to the atypical porcine pestivirus that was recently (in 2015) discovered in the USA. Many of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs can also be identified in healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in healthy pigs, but at a much lower level than in PMWS-affected pigs. While the method used here is not quantitative, the very clear difference in the amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS-affected pigs and healthy pigs likely reflects very strong replication of PCV2, which is known to be a feature of PMWS. Taken together, these findings suggest that pigs have an important viral flora consisting largely of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses. Future research on such viruses will help to better understand the role of these ubiquitous viruses in the health and disease of pigs.

It has been suggested that it not only increases soil fertility, but also increases the biomass of beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful bacteria. The aim of this study was to establish a strategy to investigate and characterize the viral and bacterial composition of a vermicomposting system. Materials and methods: The vermicompost unit used in this study was placed at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute Kabanyolo on the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, and fed 80% cattle manure and 20% food waste. On Day 172 the compost was terminated and compost samples were collected from the three layers of the unit: top, middle and bottom layer. A metagenomic approach was then applied to characterize the viral and bacterial composition of the vermicompost system. Results and discussion: A high bacterial abundance and diversity was detected. Proteobacteria were the largest phyla in the compost (mainly Alpha-, Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria), accounting for almost 65% of the bacterial readings in the datasets. Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp. DNA samples from several potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as and Clostridium spp were detected in vermicompost, suggesting that harmful bacteria may still be present in vermicast. The main viral group consisted of phages; Apart from phages, mainly insect viruses were detected. The only animal or human virus identified was kobuvirus. In summary, metagenomic analysis has been shown to be an efficient technology to characterize the microbial composition of vermicast. Data from this study contributes to a better understanding of the microbes found in such composting systems and can help identify measures necessary for safe manure handling.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A.

201,Viral metagenomic analysis of bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) from Uganda identifies novel variants of Porcine parvovirus 4 and Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2.,"Background: As a result of rapidly growing human populations, intensification of livestock production, and increased use of wildlife habitats for animal agriculture, the interface between wildlife, livestock and humans is expanding with potential impacts on both domestic animal and human health. Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses that can occasionally cause new infections in domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a wild Suid species known to move between national parks and farmland in Uganda. Results: 454 pyrosequencing treatments showed the presence of Torque tenosus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-like virus in it. greenhouse from bush pigs. PCR assays for each specific virus coupled with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, a TTSuV-2 variant, as well as PPV4 in serum samples, thus confirming the findings from 454 sequencing. Results: We performed the first analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera using a viral metagenomic approach and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid. In addition, we identified novel variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bush pigs. Â© 2012 Blomstrüm et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A. L.;StÃ¥hl, K.;Masembe, C.;Okoth, E.;Okurut, A.

202,Characterization of tonsils virome from conventional pigs and specific pathogen-free pigs.,"Swine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be affected by a number of different microorganisms as well as non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterize the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs from a conventional herd with respiratory tract lesions at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analyzed. This study showed a variable rate of co-infection in different pigs. Differences were seen in individual pigs, not group level. Some viruses, such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses, can be found in most pigs, while others, such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses, have been identified in only a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 and the complete genomes of two teschoviruses were obtained. The results of this study will help explain which viruses circulate in both healthy pigs and pigs associated with respiratory disease.

203,Phylogenetic analysis of partial S1 and N gene sequences of infectious bronchitis virus isolates from Italy revealed genetic diversity and recombination,"total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S1 gene sequences shows five field viruses clustered together with 793/B strains with 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group and 624/ strains. These two IBV types were previously described in Italy. Three other variant isolates formed the new genotype that was recently detected in many countries of Western Europe. For Italy-02, one of these variant viruses, which later became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its authenticity. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of the more conserved partial N gene sequences containing 1-300 nucleotides revealed divergent clustering. Thus, the three variant IBVs of the new Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three distinct subgroups based on N gene sequences. The 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity with vaccine strain H120 in the N gene region, respectively, with Italy-03, which could not be detected using the S1 gene primers. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain, which shared 99.3% partial N gene identity, while the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (87.7-89.7% identity only) and occurred. separate homogeneous subgroup. The results showed that both mutations and recombination events could contribute to the genetic diversity of Italian isolates. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bochkov, Y.

204,Basic research on BSE transmission to humans,"Prion diseases of animals and humans belong to neurological diseases with amyloidal deposition of related proteins. As for prion disease, cellular prionprotein, in its abnormal isoform(s), is an essential component of prionprotein aggregates found in the affected tissue. Unlike all neurodegenerative diseases such as Morbus Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease, prion diseases are contagious. Therefore, prion diseases were termed as Infectious Spongy Encephalopathies (TSE). The diseases have been well known for decades. Scrapie was first described around 1750, a case of BSE, most likely a misdiagnosis, was reported in 1850, and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was described in 1920/1930. CJD, the transmission of Kuru, was suspected in the early 1950s and was erroneously classified as a slow viral disease. Transmission of CJD posed a problem for humans when transplants from CJD cases were used for treatment. Fortunately, these iatrogenic transfers were limited. But with the emergence of BSE and the emergence of variable cases of CJD in the UK and parts of Europe, scientists suspected that cattle-to-human transmission could occur. We know from animal models that there has been successful transmission by various means. Species barriers do not completely prevent transmission. Conversely, conduction barriers may exist that control individual susceptibility to prions. Transmission modes, transmission sensitivity, identification of receptor molecules, and molecular mechanisms of the transmission process are intensively investigated. The available information allows us to hypothesize that the invisible stages of prion infection (which do not exist) act as a species barrier. This obscure infection precedes overt disease and therefore most research focuses on the development of highly sensitive assay systems for the detection of very small amounts of pathological prionprotein in suspected cases. Invisibility should also warn us not to underestimate cases of BSE or human vCJD; currently 124 in Europe and one probable case in Hongkong (March 7, 2002). Whether BSE has spread to other parts of the world through animal feed ingredients or meat can neither be excluded nor confirmed at this time.

206,New viruses in birds: Need a rooftop or a cage? Review,"Emerging viral diseases continue to have a major global impact on humans and animals. Rapid detection of the causative agent is a very important first step in order to take adequate precautions in the event of an outbreak of an emerging disease. This review discusses various aspects of virus discovery, with a particular focus on recently discovered viruses in birds. In recent years, new viruses with great potential have been discovered in domestic and wild bird species using various virus discovery methods. There are only a few studies reporting the detection of new viruses in endangered bird species, but increasing knowledge about viruses circulating in these species is important. Additional studies focusing on the full role of a novel virus in disease and the impact of a new virus on bird populations are often lacking. Intense collaboration between different disciplines is needed to gain useful insights into the role of these new viruses.",,"Bodewes, R.",2018.0,3,,0

This exemplifies the necessary expansion of our knowledge of the diversity of viruses found in wildlife, as well as the potential transmission of these viruses to pets or humans. Methods In this study, we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples (n = 42) collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores living in the northern part of Spain using random PCR combined with next-generation sequencing. Examples are American mink (Neovison vison), European mink (Mustela lutreola), European marten (Mustela putorius), European pine marten (Martes martes), stone marten (Martes foina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), and Eurasian badger (Mustelidae family). meles meles); common genet of Viverridae family (Genetta genetta); Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) from the family Canidae and the European wildcat (Felis silvestris) from the family Felidae. Results: A series of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a cobuvirus, and picobirnaviruses. Results: Using random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing, sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in stool samples collected from Spanish carnivores.

209,"Spatial Temporal Analysis of Genetic Diversity of Seal Influenza A(H10N7) Virus, Northwest Europe","UNLABELED: Influenza A viruses are major pathogens to humans, pets and wildlife, and these viruses occasionally cross the species barrier. In the spring of 2014, increased mortality rates of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) were reported in Sweden and Denmark in connection with infection with an influenza A(H10N7) virus. Within a few months, the virus had spread to seals in the coastal waters of Germany and the Netherlands, killing thousands of animals. Genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of this seal influenza A(H10N7) virus revealed that it is most closely related to several avian influenza A(H10N7) viruses. The collection of samples from infected seals during the epidemic provided a unique opportunity to follow the adaptation of the avian virus to the new seal host. Sequence data for samples collected from 41 different seals from four different countries between April 2014 and January 2015 were obtained by Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing to describe the molecular epidemiology of seal influenza A(H10N7) virus. The majority of sequence variation occurred in the HA gene, and some mutations corresponded to amino acid changes not found in H10 viruses isolated from Eurasian birds. Also, the sequence variation in the HA gene was greater at the beginning than at the end of the epidemic, when a previously observed set of mutations was fixed. These results imply that when an avian influenza virus crosses the species barrier from birds to seals, amino acid changes in HA can occur rapidly and are important for the virus's adaptation to its new mammalian host. IMPORTANT: Influenza A viruses are major pathogens for humans, pets and wildlife. In addition to the continuous circulation of influenza A viruses between various host species, interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses occasionally occurs. Wild waterfowl and shorebirds are the main reservoir for most influenza A virus subspecies, and the spread of influenza A viruses from birds to humans or other mammalian species can cause major outbreaks. In this study, various sequencing methods were used to elucidate the genetic changes that occurred after the introduction and subsequent spread of an avian influenza A(H10N7) virus among northwestern European harbor seals using various samples collected during the outbreak. Such detailed knowledge of the genetic alterations required for the introduction and adaptation of avian influenza A viruses to mammalian hosts is important for a rapid risk assessment soon after such viruses have crossed the species barrier.",,"Bodewes, R.;Zohari, S.;Krog, J.

214,Shotgun Pyrosequencing Pig Capping and Metagenomic Analyzes of Dust from Grain Plants,"Inhalation of agricultural dust causes inflammatory reactions and symptoms such as headache, fever and malaise that can progress to chronic airway inflammation and associated diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypersensitivity pneumonia. Although feed particles are the main component of these dusts in many agricultural environments, the inflammatory responses they trigger are likely attributable to particle-associated bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. In this study, we performed shotgun pyrosequencing metagenomic analyzes of DNA from dust from swine confinement facilities or grain elevators, in comparison with dust from pet-free homes. DNA sequence alignment showed that 19% or 62% of the shotgun pyrosequencing metagenomic DNA sequence read from the pig facility or house dust was of porcine or human origin, respectively. In contrast, only 2% of such readings from cereal booster powder were of mammalian origin. These metagenomic shotgun reads of mammalian origin were excluded from our analyzes of agricultural dust microbiota. Compared to grain elevator or house dust in the pig farm, the ten most common bacterial taxa were determined to consist of 75%, 16% and 42% gram positive organisms, respectively. Of the top five swine plant dust species, four could be assigned (Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus and Eubacterium, in the 4% to 19% relative abundance range). The relative abundance of these four genera was lower in dust from grain silos or pet-free homes. These analyzes also highlighted the predominance of swine plant dust at the phylum-level Firmicutes (70%), Class-level Clostridia (44%), and Order-level Clostridiales (41%). In summary, shotgun pyrosequencing metagenomic analyzes of agricultural powders show that they differ qualitatively and quantitatively at the level of microbial taxa available, and bioinformatics analyzes used for such studies must be carefully designed to avoid the potential contribution of non-microbial DNA, e.g. from resident mammals.",,"Boissy, R.

215,Genetic characterization of bovine viral diarrheal viruses isolated from permanently infected calves and born in dams vaccinated against bovine viral diarrhea virus prior to breeding.,"Objective - To collect and partially characterize strains of bovine viral diarrheal viruses (BVDVs) isolated from persistently infected (PI) calves born in vaccinated dams, to determine the genetic diversity of isolated viruses, and to determine the regional distribution of genetically similar virus subpopulations. Sample Population - 17 non-cytopathic (NCP) BVDVs from PI calves from 11 cattle or dairy herds. Procedures - Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures and BVDV-specific PCR primers were used to amplify >1,000 bases of the viral genome. Derived sequences were used for molecular phylogenetic analyzes to determine viral genotype and viral genogroup and to evaluate genetic similarity between BVDVs. Results - Analysis of 17 NCP strains of BVDV failed to detect a viral genotype or viral genogroup not currently reported in the United States. One virus was classified as genotype 1, genogroup 1b, and 16 viruses were classified as genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Genotype 2 strains were genetically diverse, and genetic similarities were not evident between viruses from a small region from larger geographic regions. Results and Clinical Relevance - The viruses isolated from flocks to which genotype 1, genogroup 1a BVDV vaccine was administered before breeding were primarily genetically diverse genotype 2, genogroup 2a BVDVs. Vaccination with more than one BVDV genotype may be required to improve protection. The methods used in this study to obtain and analyze field strains are applicable to assessing the efficacy of current BVDV vaccines. Candidates for future vaccines are viruses that can evade the immune response of cattle vaccinated against BVDV with current vaccines.",,"Bolin, S. R.;Lim, A.;Grotelueschen, D. M.;McBeth, W.

217,Unexpected diversity and expression of avian endogenous retroviruses,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were identified and characterized in three avian genomes to gain insight into early retroviral evolution. To detect relatively intact ERVs, we identified 500 ERVs in the chicken genome, 150 in the turkey genome, and 1,200 in the zebra finch genome using the RetroTector computer program. Previous studies have suggested that endogenous alpharetroviruses are present in chicken genomes. Few alpharetroviruses were seen in chicken and turkey genomes in this analysis; however, they were greatly outnumbered by beta-like, gamma-like, and alpha-like proviruses. While avian ERVs belonged to the same major groups as mammalian ERVs, they were more heterogeneous. In particular, beta-like viruses revealed an evolutionary continuum with the gradual gain and loss of betaretroviral markers and the transition from beta to alphabetic and then to alpharetroviruses. Thus, it seems that birds may have been like a melting pot for early ERV evolution. Most of the ERVs were integrated in clusters on the chromosomes, usually near the centromeres. About 25% of chicken ERVs were at or near cellular transcription units; this is almost random. Most of these integrations were in sensory orientation in introns. The integration number higher than the random number was >100 kb from the nearest gene. Deep sequencing studies of chicken embryo fibroblasts revealed that approximately 20% of 500 ERVs are transcribed and translated. A subset of these were also replicated in vivo in chickens, showing tissue-specific expression patterns. IMPORTANT Studies on avian endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have given us an insight into an earlier retroviral world. Three different classes of ERVs were observed, with many features and some important differences of mammalian retroviruses.

At that time, smallpox as a definitive disease entity was diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, later the detection of Bollinger's inclusion bodies (1877) with microscopically visible viral aggregates allowed an etiological diagnosis. Virus isolation and direct electron microscopy in embryonated chicken eggs gained importance as diagnostic tools in the 1950s. In addition, avipoxvirus taxonomy, virus characteristics, clinical manifestations, prevention modes and diagnostic procedures are also briefly explained.

This report presents the results of genetic analysis of three complete megrivirus genomes from fecal samples of chickens (chicken/B21-CHV/2012/HUN, GenBank accession no. KF961186 and chicken/CHK-IV-CHV/2013/HUN). GenBank accession no. KF961187) (Gallus gallus domesticus) and turkey (turkey/B407-THV/2011/HUN, GenBank accession no. KF961188) (Meleagris gallopavo) have the largest picornavirus genomes ever described (up to 9,739 nucleotides). The close phylogenetic association with THV-1 in the nonstructural protein-coding genome region and having the same internal ribosomal entry site type (IVB-like) suggest that the study strains belong to the genus Megrivirus. However, genome comparisons revealed many unique variations (for example, different numbers of potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3' genome segments with a potential second open reading frame of varying lengths, and multiple repetitive sequence motifs in the 3' untranslated region) and heterogeneity. Sequence relationships between structural and nonstructural genome regions. These differences suggest the classification of chicken megrivirus-like viruses as candidate new species in the genus Megrivirus. Based on the different phylogenetic positions of chicken megrivirus-like viruses in structural and nonstructural genome regions, the recombinant nature of these viruses is plausible. SIGNIFICANCE: Comparative genome analysis of turkey and novel chicken megriviruses, for example, unusually long 3' genome segments of various lengths containing up to four potential 2A peptides, a potential second open reading frame, multiple repetitive sequence motifs, and between structural and nonstructural genome regions. heterogeneous sequence relationships (possibly due to a recombination event).

232,Characterization of neutralization sites on the circulating variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV): a new site is shared by SVDV and the related coxsackie B5 virus.,"Using a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), five neutralizing, conformation-dependent sites have been identified on the antigenic variant of the currently circulating porcine vesicular disease virus (SVDV). In studies of antigenic conservation of these regions, the four described antigenic/genetic SVDV groups showed distinguishable patterns confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, five regions were precisely mapped and localized in a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All of them were found to be oriented towards the outer surface of the capsid to a different extent. Three of the five regions found in VP1, VP2 and VP3 correspond to epitopes previously identified in historical isolates as sites 1, 2a and 3b, respectively. Another site mapped to position 258 of VP1, site IV, corresponds to a recently reported epitope and is described in this study as specific to isolates of the newest antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth region has been described for the first time and corresponds to the unique neutralizing region common to both SVDV and coxsackie B5 virus; It maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also include nearby positions of VP1 belonging to site 1 in the BC loop, suggesting classification of site Ia. While novel conserved domain Ia-directed mAbs provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, these results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, as the site IV specificity of mAbs makes them unique markers for the newest strains of SVDV.",,"Borrego, B.;Carra, E.;GarcÃ­a-Ranea, J.

233,Role of viral population diversity in the adaptation of bovine coronavirus to new host environments,"The high mutation rate of RNA viruses enables a diverse population of genetic viral genotypes to exist in a single infected host. Intra-host genetic diversity can better position the virus population to respond to and adapt to a variety of selective pressures, such as host switching events. Multiple novel coronaviruses, including SARS, have been detected in human samples in the past decade alone, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses to be emerging human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus half-species during simulated host switching. Three bovine nose samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus replicated relatively well in macrophages, but lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non-lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of approximately 950x(454 sequencing) and 38,000x(Illumina). The consensus sequence of most of the crossover samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert is present, but very rare in non-passaged samples, and can rapidly change to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. Attachment coding for the three arginine residues occurred at a site associated with fusion entry into host cells and may allow infection of new cell types through heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data showed that the two different genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, supporting the hypothesis that the mutations found in the passaged strains were ""selected"" from a pre-existing pool rather than de novo mutation and subsequent population. fixing.",,"Borucki, M.

While commercial vaccines against these viruses are available, the cost of regular multi-disease vaccination regimens is too high for most African farmers. Therefore, a single, affordable multivalent vaccine that simultaneously protects against all 5 diseases would be of significant benefit to the livestock industry in Africa. It can also serve as a platform for the development of new vaccines, which is important to other developing countries around the world. In this article, we provide an overview of the economic importance of farm animals in Africa, the pathogens responsible for RVF, PPR, SPP, GTP and LSD, and the vaccination strategies currently used to combat them. Next, we review experience with the development of attenuated capripox viruses as vaccines against LSD, SPP, and GTP, and recombinant capripoxvirus vectored vaccines against RVF and PPR. We conclude the article by presenting the rationale for a single, multivalent capripoxvirus vectored vaccine to protect against 5 livestock diseases and explaining the approach taken by a consortium of Canadian and South African researchers to develop such a vaccine.

It is divided into 4 main mammalian genotypes. In this study, 3 novel full-length pig HEV genomes were sequenced and the results did not reveal any specific host determinants when compared with human isolates of the same genotype. Nucleotide composition and codon usage bias were determined to characterize HEV host restriction and genome evolution. Specific nucleotide bias was observed for nucleotides A and C in all HEV genotypes. No nucleotide bias was observed between the 3 codon positions, except for the ORF1 hypervariable region and the ORF2/3 overlapping region. CpG dinucleotides have also been shown to be underrepresented in HEV, as in most RNA viruses. The number of effective codons used in the HEV genome was high, indicating the absence of codon bias. Correspondence analysis of relative synonymous codon usage was performed and showed that HEV evolution is not driven by geographic or host factors, but represents HEV phylogeny. These results confirm that HEV genome evolution is mainly based on mutational repression. Natural selection may also play a role in shaping the HEV genome, particularly in the ORF1 hypervariable region and the ORF2/3 overlapping region, involving, for example, fine-tuning of translation kinetics and escape from the host immune system. These regions can be included in the host restriction.

The complete genomes of strain A/mallard/Netherlands/10-Nmkt/1999 and its porcine cell passaged strain were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with depth of coverage ranging from several hundred to several thousand reads at any point. This allowed characterization of identified minority subpopulations of gene segments 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 found in the original isolate. These minority subpopulations ranged from 9.5% (for section 2) to 46% (for section 4) of the relevant gene segments in the parent stock. These were probably contributed by one or more viruses circulating in the same region, at the same time, and in the same or sympathetic host species. Minority subpopulations of sections 3, 4 and 5 became extinct upon viral transmission in porcine cells, whereas minority subpopulations of sections 2, 7 and 8 replaced their majority counterparts. The porcine passaged virus was therefore a three-segment reassortant and also harbored point mutations in segments 3 and 4. The passaged virus was more homogeneous than the parent stock and there were only 17 minority single nucleotide polymorphisms above the overall frequency above 5%. genetic code.

240,Whole genome-based molecular characterization of encephalitis-associated bovine astroviruses,"New strains of astroviruses have recently been identified in association with neurological diseases in cattle. These viruses include bovine astrovirus CH13 (BoAstV CH13), which was identified in Switzerland in a cow with encephalitis. Molecular tests with a combination of reverse transcription (RT-) PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) have shown that astrovirus infection is responsible for about a quarter of viral encephalitis cases of unknown etiology in cattle. Still, whether these animals were infected by BoAstV CH13 or other strains of astrovirus remained to be investigated. In this study, we sequenced the entire astrovirus genome in brain tissues of eight RT-PCR and/or ISH positive cattle. Phylogenetic comparison of genomic RNA and encoded nonstructural and structural proteins revealed that all these astrovirus strains are very similar to BoAstV CH13 and a bovine encephalitis strain (BoAstV NeuroS1) reported from the USA, and clearly different from others previously. reported astroviruses. The conserved 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) have been predicted to exhibit distinct secondary RNA structures, possibly involved in viral RNA replication and/or protein translation. Based on these data, we propose that BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 represents a novel genotype species within the Mammastrovirus genus. The high degree of similarity between strains and their relative distance from other genotypes suggests that during evolution, some astroviruses specifically acquired factors that contribute to neuroinvasion.

241,Neurotropic astrovirus in cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis in Europe,"Encephalitis is a frequently diagnosed condition in cattle with neurological diseases. Many affected animals show a non-suppurative pattern of inflammatory reactions in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen is unknown in the majority of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. In addition, BoAstV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in about a quarter (5/22 animals) of cattle with non-suppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the pathology site. These findings support the idea that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 is closely related to rare isolates of astrovirus from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to address the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology and potential interspecies transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

243,viral metagenomic approach in a non-metagenomic experiment: mining next-generation sequencing datasets from pig DNA identified several porcine parvoviruses for retrospective evaluation of viral infections.,"Shot-gun next-generation sequencing (NGS) on all DNA extracted from samples collected from mammals often produces reads that are not mapped (ie, unmapped reads) in the host reference genome and are often discarded as by-products of experiments. In this study, we extracted Ion Torrent reads obtained by sequencing DNA isolated from archived blood samples collected from 100 performance-tested Italian Great White pigs. Two libraries of reduced representation were prepared from two DNA pools, each formed from 50 equimolar DNA samples. Bioinformatics analyzes were performed to extract unpaired reads on the reference pig genome from the two NGS datasets. In silico analyzes included read mapping and sequence splicing approaches for a viral metagenomic analysis using the NCBI Viral Genome Resource. Our approach identified sequences that matched several viruses from the Parvoviridae family: porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2), PPV4, PPV5 and PPV6, and porcine bocavirus 1-H18 isolate (PBoV1-H18). The presence of these viruses was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of individual DNA samples. PPV2, PPV4, PPV5, PPV6 and PBoV1-H18 were identified in samples collected in 1998-2007, 1998-2000, 1997-2000, 1998-2004 and 2003, respectively. For most of these viruses (PPV4, PPV5, PPV6, and PBoV1-H18), previous studies reported their first occurrence much later (5 to 10 years) than our identification period and in different geographic regions. Our study provided a retrospective evaluation of apparently asymptomatic parvovirus-infected pigs, providing information that may be important for describing the emergence and prevalence of different parvoviruses in Southern Europe. This study demonstrated the potential of mining NGS datasets that were not originally derived by metagenomic experiments for viral metagenomic analyzes in a livestock species.",,"Bovo, S.;Mazzoni, G.;Ribani, A.;Utzeri, V.

244,"Molecular characterization of menangle virus, a novel paramyxovirus infecting pigs, fruit bats and humans.","Menangle virus (MenV), isolated after a piglet reproductive disease outbreak in New South Wales in August 1997, is the second previously unclassified member of the Paramyxoviridae family and has been described in Australia since 1994. Similar to Hendra virus (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit bats (flying foxes) from the genus Pteropus. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses, and a cDNA extraction method was used to obtain viral-specific cDNA from MenV-infected cells to facilitate virus classification. Cloning and sequencing of the products allowed the identification of all sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F and HN genes. Comparison of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for each gene with members of the Paramyxoviridae family, determination of the P gene mRNA editing strategy, and phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that MenV is a new member of the genus Rubulavirus. However, the deduced protein sequence of MenV HN exhibited only limited sequence homology compared to the binding proteins of other paramyxoviruses. Key differences in amino acid residues, which are considered important determinants of neuraminidase activity, suggest that MenV HN is unlikely to have the same degree of neuraminidase activity that is characteristic of other rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins.

246,Analysis of different host cell nuclear proteome caused by attenuated and lethal hemorrhagic arenavirus infection,"Arenaviruses are important emerging pathogens and include a number of hemorrhagic fever viruses classified as NIAID category A priority pathogens and CDC potential biological threat agents. Infection of guinea pigs with the New World arena virus Pichindé virus (PICV) was used as a biosafety level 2 model for Lassa virus. Despite ongoing research, little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenesis and this has hindered the design of new antiviral therapeutics. Modulation of the host response is a potential strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases. We have previously investigated the global host response to attenuated and lethal arenavirus infections using high-throughput immunoblotting and kinomic approaches. In this report, we describe the different nuclear proteomes of a murine cell line induced by mock infection and infection with attenuated and lethal variants of PICV, investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot identification using tandem mass spectrometry revealed the involvement of a number of proteins and several heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins that regulate inflammation through potential modulation of NF-κB activity. Pathway analysis revealed a potential role for the transcription factor XBP-1, a transcription factor involved in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) expression; differential DNA-binding activity was revealed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and differences in surface MHC-II expression were seen following PICV infection. These data are consistent with the results of several previous studies and highlight potential differences between transcriptional and translational regulation. This study provides a set of differentially expressed targets for further investigation and suggests that important events in pathogenesis may be set early in infection.

247,Genomic sequences of Australian bluetongue virus prototype serotypes reveal global associations and possible entry routes to Australia,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). It mainly causes disease in sheep and sometimes cattle and other species. BTV spread to northern Europe, causing disease in sheep and cattle. The introduction of new serotypes, changes in vector species, and climate change have contributed to these changes. Ten BTV serotypes have been isolated in Australia without significant associated disease. Simplified methods and template preparation for the preferential isolation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) enabled high-throughput sequencing of 10 genome segments of all Australian BTV prototype serotypes. The phylogenetic analysis strengthened the Western and Eastern topotypes that were previously characterized but revealing unique features of several Australian BTVs. Most of the Australian BTV genome segments (Seg-) were closely related, clustering together within Eastern topotypes. A new Australian topotype has been identified for Seg-5 (NS1) and taxa have spread to several serotypes and over time. Seg-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -9 and -10 of BTV_2_AUS_2008 were closely related to cognate segments of viruses from Taiwan and Asia, but not to other Australian viruses. supports.

248,The evolution of human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006: A complete genome study.,"Background: Information on the complete genome sequencing of seasonal influenza A viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding the evolution and migration of strains. Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are currently available to the public, and several longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses have been performed. We examined the evolution of circulating human H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, analyzed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterized 24 complete genomes. Results: H3N2 was the most common strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000-2001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002-2003. After years of minor genetic variation in H1N1 viruses, the 2005-2006 season brought more variability to H1N1 than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 will soon become the prevalent strain again. Overall, influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages were also observed circulating together in the same season. Evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, particularly with the advent of Fujian-like viruses in 2002-2003. Periods of evolutionary stasis were also observed, which may indicate that the viruses adapt well. The evolution of H3N2 viruses has also been influenced by gene reclassifications between lineages in different seasons. None of the influenza genes were affected by strong positive selection pressure. Antigenic region B in H3N2 HA was the preferred region for genetic change during the study period, possibly because region A was masked by glycosylations. Substitutions were observed in CTL epitopes in genes encoding neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and specifically nucleoprotein (NP). The N-linked glycosylation pattern varied over the study period, and H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated, with ten secons predicted in HA, the highest amount of glycosylation observed in this study period. Conclusion: This study is the first to our knowledge characterizing the evolution of the complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a seven-year period from 1999 to 2006. More precise information about circulating strains is inferred for prediction of next season strains and thus better matching of vaccine composition.",,"Bragstad, K.;Nielsen, L.

249,Genomic evolution of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates revealed by deep sequencing.,"Most studies of PRRSV evolution have been restricted to a particular region of the viral genome. A comprehensive genome-wide understanding of the impact of different mechanisms on shaping PRRSV genetic diversity is still lacking. To this end, deep sequencing was used to obtain the genomic sequences of a diverse set of 16 isolates from a region of Hong Kong with a complex PRRSV epidemiological record. Genome assemblies and phylogenetic typing showed co-circulation of strains of both genotypes (type 1 and type 2) with varying patterns of Nsp2 deletion and different evolutionary lineages (""High Fever""-like and local endemic type). Recombination analyzes revealed genomic breakpoints in the structural and nonstructural regions of the genomes of both genotypes, with evidence of many recombination events originating from common ancestors. In addition, the high coating fold per nucleotide allowed the characterization of minor variants originating from half-species of each strain. Overall, 0.56-2.83% of the sites were found to be polymorphic to cognate consensus genomes. The distribution of small variants in each genome was not uniform, indicating the effect of selective forces. The proportion of variants capable of causing an amino acid change in their respective codons ranged from 25-67%, and many were estimated to be non-destructive. As noted in previous reports, low-frequency deletion variants were also detected, providing a possible mechanism for their abrupt emergence.",,"Brar, M. S.;Shi, M.;Hui, R. K.;Leung, F. C.",2014.0,,,0
250,border disease in cattle,"Within the family Flaviviridae, viruses in the genus Pestivirus such as Border disease virus of sheep (BDV) can cause great economic losses to livestock. Initially, taxonomic classification of pestiviruses was based on the host species from which they were isolated, but it is now known that many pestiviruses exhibit broad species tropism. This review provides an overview of BDV infection in cattle. The clinical, haematological and pathological-anatomical findings in cattle temporarily or permanently infected with BDV are broadly similar to those in cattle infected with the closely related pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Accordingly, diagnosis of BDV infection can be difficult as it must be differentiated from various pestiviruses in cattle. Second, it is crucial in countries with control programs to eradicate BVDV in Bovidae because pestivirus infections in sheep, which in most cases serve as reservoirs for BDV, are not included in the eradication scheme. Interspecies transmission of BDV between sheep and cattle occurs regularly, but the overall relevance of BDV in cattle appears to be minimal. However, on-farm or local-level BDV outbreaks can be very costly.",,"Braun, U.;Hilbe, M.;Peterhans, E.;Schweizer, M.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.01.006,0

We isolated influenza virus (H1N2) from a pig in a backyard breeding farm in central Chile and showed that the HA gene was the same as in a previous report. The HA and neuraminidase genes were most similar to human H1 and N2 viruses of the early 1990s, and the inner segments were similar to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The virus multiplied efficiently in vitro and in vivo and was transmitted by respiratory droplets in ferrets. It was antigenically different from other swine viruses.

253,Shotgun metagenomics of biostains using ultra-deep DNA sequencing,"Detailed molecular analysis of blood or other biological stains at a crime scene is often hampered by the low quantity and quality of extractable DNA. However, determining the origin and composition of a stain is in most cases a prerequisite for the final clarification of a criminal case. Standard methodologies, for example microsatellite typing or mitochondrial DNA sequencing following DNA amplification, are often not sensitive enough to result in sufficient and precise data. We performed ultra-deep DNA sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing technology on a whole genome amplified (WGA) environmental biostain that was unsuccessfully analyzed by standard methodologies following WGA. However, with the combination of WGA and 454 pyrosequencing, we were able to generate 7242 single sequences with an average length of 195 bp. A total of 1,441,971 bp of DNA sequences were generated and compared to public DNA sequence databases. Using ReMask and basic logical alignment search tool (BLAST) searches against known microbial and mammalian genomes, it was possible to determine the metagenomic composition of the blot, i.e. 4.2% bacterial DNA, 0.3% viral DNA, 2.7% fungal DNA, 10.3% mammalian repetitive DNA. , 0.9% pig DNA, 0.13% human DNA, and 81.5% DNA of unknown origin.

Three groups have published genotyping schemes based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and have identified five different phylogenetic segments among them, with two additional possible segments. Sequencing of over 23 complete VZV genomes from around the world further refined the phylogenetic distinctions between SNP genotypes. The widespread surveillance in countries where the varicella vaccine is currently in use, and the challenges posed by three unique genotyping approaches, led to an international meeting where an agreement was reached on a common nomenclature based on phylogenetic branches.

255,Sequencing of the nucleocapsid protein gene of the swine epidemic diarrhea virus confirms that this virus is a coronavirus related to human coronavirus 229E and porcine gastroenteritis virus.,"The nucleotide sequence of the 1.7 kbp cDNA containing the region closest to the 3' end of the swine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) genome was determined independently for the two European PEDV isolates. Almost identical results were obtained for the two isolates from PEDV infection cases in Belgium and England in 1977 and 1987, respectively. The sequences contained a 1323 nucleotide (nt) open reading frame (ORF) with moderate identity to the nucleocapsid (N) gene of other coronaviruses. The greatest similarity in both nucleic acid and protein levels was with human coronavirus 229E. However, the PEDV N gene was significantly larger than that of human 229E and porcine gastroenteritis viruses. This reflects the presence of a putative insertion of approximately 135 nt located towards the middle of the N gene. A second 336 nt ORF was found in the PEDV N gene that could encode a leucine-rich protein similar to, but shorter than, the bovine coronavirus internal protein. Several RNA motifs specific to coronaviruses were also observed. These results confirm the previous tentative classification of PEDV as a coronavirus.",,"Bridgen, A.;Duarte, M.;Tobler, K.;Laude, H.;Ackermann, M.",1993.0,,,0

There are seven different serotypes, each with various topotypes, genetic lineages, and strains. Some lineages have distinct traits that may contribute to sporadic spread beyond their recognized endemic areas. The aim of this study is to review the most important FMD epidemiological events that occurred worldwide between 2007 and 2014. Severe outbreaks were caused by FMD virus (FMDV) strain O/Asia/Mya-98 in Japan and South Korea in 2010. previously disease free. In India, where FMD is endemic, the most significant event was the reemergence of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage in 2008. Notably, this lineage, normally confined to India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, was also found. It caused various outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Libya in 2013 and in Tunisia and Algeria in 2014-2015. In January 2011, FMDV-positive wild boars were found in Bulgaria, where the disease last occurred in 1996, followed by 12 outbreaks in FMDV O/ME-SA/PanAsia2-infected animals. In 2012, FMDV SAT2 caused outbreaks in Egypt and the Palestinian Autonomous Territories. Another important event was the emergence of FMDV Asia1 Sindh-08 in the Middle East. In South America, an outbreak of FMDV serotype O, topotype Euro-SA was reported in Paraguay in 2011 and was considered alum-free with the vaccine at that time. Lessons learned from past events point to the need for an integrated strategy for FMDV control and surveillance, consisting of coordinated global and regional efforts. The specific local characteristics of the host, environment, and virus that condition the occurrence of FMD should be carefully evaluated and incorporated to adapt appropriate strategies to local plans. In this review, we have compiled relevant epidemiological FMD events to provide an overview of the current situation. We have further discussed the current challenges that exist in different FMD areas.",,"Brito, B. P.;Rodriguez, L. L.;Hammond, J. M.;Pinto, J.;Perez, A. M.",2017.0,,10.1111/tbed.12373,0

259,Non-maternal transmission is the major mode of ovine lentivirus transmission in a flock of sheep: A molecular epidemiology study.,"Transmission of ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV), a sheep lentivirus, occurs by both maternal and non-maternal routes. At present, the contribution of each pathway to the overall herd OPPV prevalence is not fully understood, as previous serological epidemiological studies lacked the ability to accurately track transmission routes within an infected flock. In this study, the amount of maternal OPP transmission in a naturally infected flock of sheep was evaluated by applying molecular analyzes to proviral sequences derived from peripheral blood leukocytes of OPP positive mother-daughter pairs (N=40). Both proviral envelope (env) and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences, separately and combined, were used in the following 2 sequence analysis methods: phylogenetic analysis and binary distance calculations. Actual maternal transmission events were defined as concordance in 2 of the 2 sequence analysis methods. Using this criterion, proviral env sequences resulted in a maternal transmission frequency of 14.3% and proviral LTR sequences resulted in a maternal transmission frequency of 10%. Both rates of maternal transmission differed significantly from the equation (P<0.0001). This indicates that the remaining 85.7-90% of girls are infected by non-maternal transmission. This is also the first study to calculate the OPP proviral rate of change for the env gene and LTR promoter. Accurate identification of OPPV transmission pathways provides critical epidemiological data to support management to reduce herd transmission and viral dose. © 2010.",,"Broughton-Neiswanger, L.

260,Antigenic and genetic analyzes of H1N1 influenza A viruses from European pigs,"H1N1 influenza A viruses isolated from pigs in Europe since 1981 have been studied both antigenically and genetically and compared with H1N1 viruses from other sources. H1N1 viruses from pigs and birds can be divided into three groups: avian, classical porcine and 'bird-like' swine viruses. Low or no reactivity of 'bird-like' swine viruses in HI tests with raised monoclonal antibodies against classical porcine viruses was associated with amino acid substitutions in the antigenic regions of hemagglutinin (HA). Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that classical swine viruses from European pigs were most closely related and closely related to North American swine strains, while 'bird-like' swine viruses clustered with avian viruses. 'Bird-like' viruses, introduced to pigs in the UK in 1992, apparently originated directly from strains in pigs in continental Europe at the time. The HA genes of the porcine viruses studied had limited variation in antigenic regions and also contained fewer potential glycosylation sites compared to human H1N1 viruses. HA exhibited antigenic shift, which was more pronounced in 'bird-like' porcine viruses rather than classical porcine strains. Genetic analyzes of two recent ""bird-like"" swine viruses showed that all RNA segments were most closely related to those of avian influenza A viruses.",,"Brown, I. H.;Ludwig, S.;Olsen, C.

263,"Epidemics of viral meningitis and single, novel, recombinant and anthroponotic origin of swine vesicular disease virus","Background and targets: Porcine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is a close relative of the human Enterovirus B serotype coxsackievirus B5. As the etiologic agent of an important veterinary emergency, few studies have attempted to explain its origin. However, several key questions remain, including the virus's exact biological ancestor and its geographic and temporal origin. Methodology: We sequenced the nearly complete genomes of 27 SVDV and 13 coxsackievirus B5 samples, all originally isolated between 1966 and 2006, and analyzed them with available sequences and historical information. Results: Analyzes containing 24 additional nearly complete SVDV genomic sequences show clear signs of intra-SVDV recombination, while all 51 SVDV isolates remain monophyletic. This supports the hypothesis of a single anthroponotic origin of transfer. Analysis of individual coding and non-coding regions supports a recombinant origin of SVDV between coxsackievirus B5 and another Enterovirus B serotype, most likely coxsackievirus A9. Comprehensive Bayesian sequence-based analysis of the time of the most recent common ancestor of all sequences analyzed shows this in a few years around 1961. Epidemiological evidence suggests that China is an origin, but there are no existing specimens to definitively test this. Conclusions and implications: Historical research and clinical aspects of the relevant Enterovirus B serotypes make the present results consistent with a hypothesis stating that SVDV arose through coinfection, recombination, and a single anthroponotic event during the major viral meningitis outbreaks around 1960. 1961 includes ancestral serotypes.

Classification and some preliminary characterizations of viral agD mutants,"The pyry virus mutants selected for their varying growth characteristics in Drosophila melanogaster were previously termed agD mutants. This article presents a classification scheme for grouping some of these mutants and also presents the characteristics of some members of each group. For each agD clone, analysis of the mean incubation time at 20°C versus time at 28°C (tÌ„20, tÌ„28) allowed us to identify compared to a similar data range for wild-type virus. 4 classes of agD mutants: (1) mutants equally affected at both temperatures, (2) cold-sensitive mutants in drosophila (csD), (3) heat-sensitive mutants in drosophila (tsD), and (4) with average incubation time mutants could not be predicted at 20 or 28°C. All agD mutants are listed. Most of these were also ts in chicken embryo cells (CEC) and some were classified as complementation groups. Some correlations were noted. For example, agD mutants with ts+ in CEC were frequently (7 out of 12) weak cold sensitive in drosophila. All of these tsD mutants, which also had ts in CEC, belonged to complement group I (protein L). The true csD mutants, whose differentiation of incubation time increased regularly with wt and again ts in CEC, all belonged to group I, except those belonging to group V (G protein). The three mutants fell into a separate subclass of csD mutants characterized by a defect in CO2 sensitivity symptom expression below a certain temperature. One of these, which is more characterized, was shown to be in complement group V. Some mutants of the fourth class were studied for their ability to infest flies. It was found to be more or less strongly affected. Among these mutants, mutations to the L, N, and G proteins were assigned independently of this phenomenon, suggesting the involvement of different physiological defects.

A genome unit was defined as the length of the unique central portion flanked at both ends by one of the terminal tandem repeats called polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA) and estimated to be 113 ± 2 kbp. V. A restriction map of the prDNA of the test strain showed internal 200 bp tandem repeats of the different sequences. This region in prDNA was highly polymorphic among BHV-4 strains even in a viral DNA preparation from a plaque-purified strain. The right linkage between the repeated and unique sequence of the genome occurred in a nearly constant region, but the left linkage contained a modified prDNA and was variable between BHV-4 strains. The unique central part of the genome was very similar in the four strains in question, with few variations dependent on the presence or absence of a restriction site and four length variations located at positions 0.006 to 0.034 (left end), 0.211. 0.225, 0.864 to 0.881 and 0.962 to 0.984 (right end).

268,The Ancient Evolutionary History of Polyomaviruses,"Polyomaviruses are a family of DNA tumor viruses known to infect mammals and birds. To investigate the family's deeper evolutionary history, we used a combination of viral metagenomic, bioinformatics and structural modeling approaches to identify and characterize fish and arthropod-associated polyomavirus sequences. Analyzes based on different new sequences show that polyomaviruses have been slowly co-evolving with their animal hosts for at least half a billion years. Phylogenetic analyzes of individual polyomavirus genes suggest that some modern polyomavirus strains arose after ancient recombination events involving distantly related polyomavirus lineages. The enhanced evolutionary model provides a useful platform for developing a more accurate taxonomic classification system for the viral family Polyomaviridae.",,"Buck, C.

270,"Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever and abortion frequency among livestock in Kisoro county, South West Uganda (2016): a prerequisite for zoonotic infection.","Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is classified as viral hemorrhagic fever and is endemic in East and West Africa. RVF is caused by an arthropod-borne virus (RVFV); The disease is zoonotic and affects human and animal health and international trade. While causing abortions in livestock, human infection occurs through close contact with infected animals or animal products. Methods: A quantitative observational study was conducted using stratified sampling in the western region of Uganda. Blood samples and abortion events were collected and recorded from 1000 animals (goats, sheep, and cattle). Serum was analyzed for RVFV IgG reacting antibodies using competitive ELISA assay. Results: The overall RVFV seroprevalence was 10.4% (104/1000). Cattle (7%) had the highest seroprevalence, followed by Sheep (2.2%), followed by goats (1.2%). Species-specific RVFV seroprevalence was highest in cattle (20.5%), followed by sheep (6.8%), followed by goats (3.6%). Seroprevalence of RVFV (21.8%) in mountainous areas in the north was significantly higher than in lowland areas in the south (3.7%) (p < 0.001). The overall prevalence of abortion was (17.4%), sheep with the highest prevalence of abortion (7.8%), followed by goats (6.3%), followed by cattle (3.3%). Species-specific low prevalence was highest in sheep (24.1%), followed by goats (18.8%), followed by cattle 9.7%. Conclusion: RVFV is endemic in Kisoro county and animals in the highland areas are more likely to be exposed to RVFV infection compared to the lowland areas in the south.

271,Molecular analysis of H7 avian influenza viruses from Australia and New Zealand: genetic diversity and associations from 1976 to 2007.,"Whole genome sequencing of 11 Australian and 1 New Zealand avian influenza A virus isolates (all H7 subtype) allowed the sequences of each of the genome segments to be compared with those of other subtype H7 avian influenza A viruses. The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment was used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic branch. This pattern is consistent with the long-term, independent evolution associated with geographic regions in this example. On the basis of analysis of other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three other geographic regions where similar monophyletic branches were observed were confirmed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America and South America. Analysis of neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3 and H7N7 genomes revealed the same site-based associations. This model of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of the analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results suggest that the maintenance host(s) is almost exclusively associated with Australia, associated with the emergence of five different combinations of neuraminidase subtypes (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates. Despite the emergence of multiple neuraminidase types, the single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which several reassortants emerged rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This evolutionary pattern is likely to occur in each of the above-mentioned regions.",,"Bulach, D.;Halpin, R.;Spiro, D.;Pomeroy, L.;Janies, D.;Boyle, D. B.",2010.0,Oct,,0

This is particularly evident in data derived from modern high-throughput DNA sequencing, where errors can cause sequences to be misassigned to new taxa rather than matching them to existing, observed taxa. We look at a number of methods to address this issue, with particular focus on fitting a parametric mix model and deleting the most diverse component; we also consider the data to be left censored and effectively combine two or more low frequency counts. We have found that these purely statistical ""downstream"" corrections will depend strongly on their underlying assumptions, but such methods can still be useful.",,"Bunge, J.;BÃ¶hning, D.;Allen, H.;Foster, J.

274,Clinical and Pathological Characterization of a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H7N8 Outbreak in Commercial Turkeys in Southern Indiana,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a systemic fatal disease in poultry caused by various subtypes of the influenza A virus and classified on the basis of serological reactions to the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. In January 2016, a new subtype of HPAI-H7N8- was identified in a herd of commercial turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in southern Indiana. Clinical signs and history included increased mortality, shortness of breath, head tremors, supine lying, and napping or unaware birds. Post-mortem examination of six recently deceased birds revealed red-colored mucus and marked pulmonary edema in the choana and trachea. Histological lesions in the brain included severe, multifocal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with foci of malacia, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. Although histological changes in the cerebellum are considered mild, all anatomical locations of the brain are affected. Other histological lesions include pulmonary congestion and edema, splenic obstruction and lymphoid depletion, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels within the spleen, and multifocal pancreatic acinar necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was weakly positive for influenza A in the brain; IHC was negative in other tissues tested. The clinical and pathological features of this case matched previously published material on HPAI and were added to examples of known or suspected mutations of a low pathogenic virus to a highly pathogenic virus.",,"Burcham, G.

Syncytia, giant cells and type A nuclear bodies appeared in chicken embryo fibroblast tissue cultures. These features, along with the biochemical and biophysical properties described in another article, allowed the HSIS virus to be classified as a herpes virus. No serological cross-reactions were observed between HSIS virus on the one hand and infectious laryngotracheitis virus, Marek virus and 5 non-avian herpes viruses on the other. The HSIS virus is therefore considered a new avian herpes virus.

However, no bovine subgroup II-specific adenovirus antigen has been demonstrated in classical mastadenoviruses. To date, serodiagnosis of bovine adenoviral infections has been severely hampered by ignorance of these facts, leading to a massive underestimation of the frequency of such infections.

279,Classification of 53/69 isolate as a separate equine herpes virus from equine coital exanthema,"On the occasion of an outbreak of equine coital exanthema (ECE), a virus strain designated ECE 53/69 was isolated from a vaginal swab. It induced plaques, polykaryotic giant cells and Cowdry type A nuclear inclusion bodies in horse cell cultures. Replication of ECE 53/69 is completely inhibited by IUDR. Proven sensitive to ether, trypsin, heat and low pH. All these features and electron microscopic data described elsewhere allowed the strain to be classified as a herpes virus. It has been confirmed to be an equine herpes virus by natural and experimental infections in equines and by replication occurring only in equine cell cultures. Equine cytomegaloviruses also replicate only in equine cells. But they do this at a much slower rate and remain attached to the cell. ECE 53/69, by contrast, causes very fast cpe and is released to the tc environment at high titer. Equine rhinopneumonitis virus differs from ECE by replication in a broad spectrum of heterologous cells as well as lack of cross-neutralization, cross-complement fixation, and different clinical manifestations.

283,Influenza A virus subtypes in wild birds in North-Eastern Spain (Catalonia),"Since the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 in 2005, several surveillance programs have been initiated in poultry and wild birds worldwide. This study describes for the first time the detection of different subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in wild birds in the western Mediterranean region (Catalonia, North-Eastern Spain). Over a 3-year period (mid-2006 to mid-2009), 1374 birds from 16 different families were examined and a total of 62 AIVs were detected via a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay. AIV was detected more frequently in the families Anatidae, Phoenicopteridae, Rallidae and Laridae. Of the 62 positive samples, 28 AIVs could be isolated in embryonated eggs. All isolates were subtyped by hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition techniques, and 10 different hemagglutinin (HA) and 7 neuraminidase (NA) were found in 13 different subtype combinations. The most common combinations were H4N6 (22.2%) and H1N1 (18.5%). HA and NA gene sequences of different AIV subtypes were compared and aligned with existing AIV strains obtained from genome databases. Our studies of AIV phylogenetic analysis revealed that all AIV genes sequenced from wild birds in North-Eastern Spain cluster within Eurasian avian branches, including the H8, N4 and N5 gene sequences analyzed for the first time in Europe. The results contribute to the understanding of AIV in the Mediterranean region and Europe.

After a short introduction to the subject, the author's negative results on inhibitors are interpreted. Next, the characteristics of the three procedures tested based on the determination of NADH as a measure for silaidase activity are discussed. Spectrofluorimetric measurement of NADH concentration is a more sensitive and useful procedure than spectrophotometry, although less sensitive than that based on bioluminescence. Sialidase activity is generally higher in influenza virus type A than in type B; however, some differences were found between the three subtypes A studied. Also, the thermal stability and stability to changes in pH values are higher for influenza virus from ducks, then humans and finally pigs. O-acetyletherase of influenza virus type C shows broad specificity; It is effective on compounds containing O-acetyl, which may not be sialic acid. This enzyme appears to contribute to facilitating the sialidase action of influenza virus types A and B.

Pathogenicity tests in chicken embryos and chickens indicate that D3 and R8 are lentogenic and W4 and P4 are mesogenic strains. Phylogenetic analysis using all six genes provides a high-resolution profile for genotype determination as genotype I for strains D3 and R8 and genotype VI for strains W4 and P4. In addition, molecular dating based on different genes shows that D3 and R8 diverged from their common ancestor around 1998; W4 and P4 split from their common ancestor around 1999. Subsequent selective pressure analysis showed specific features of gene evolution in all 4 strains since their divergence from the last common ancestor. Furthermore, the geographical origin of the 4 strains was concluded from Europe through two independent introduction events by phylogeographic analysis.

289,Identification and analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs in PK-15 cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus by deep sequencing.,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne Flavivirus, causes acute viral encephalitis with high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are important modulators of complex host-pathogen interaction networks. However, our knowledge of changes in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the post-transcriptional regulation level, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Overall, 132 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed after challenge with JEV: 78 were up-regulated and 54 down-regulated. Sequencing results for selected miRNAs were confirmed by RT-qPCR. GO analysis of host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including the metabolic pathway, inflammatory response, and immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comparative expression of miRNAs in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our findings will support further studies of the roles of miRNAs in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for antiviral therapies against JEV.",,"Cai, Y.;Zhu, L.;Zhou, Y.;Liu, X.;Liu, X.;Li, X.;Lang, Q.;Qiao, X.;Xu, Z.",2015.0,2020-01-01 00:00:00,,0

291,RUMINNAT NUTRITION SYMPOSIUM: Small but mighty: Role of rumen microbes in livestock,"Microbes living in the rumen convert low-quality, fibrous plant material into usable energy for the host ruminant animal. The rumen microbiome, made up of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and viruses, forms a complex web of symbiosis essential for host ruminant care, immune function, and overall reproductive efficiency. Robert Hungate laid the foundation for rumen microbiome research. This area of research has expanded immensely with advances in methodology and technology that have not only developed the ability to describe microbes in taxonomic and density terms, but also characterize microbe populations, their functions and interactions with each other and with the host. The interaction between the rumen microbiome and the host contributes to variation in many phenotypic traits expressed by the host animal. A better understanding of how the rumen microbiome affects host health and performance could lead to new strategies and treatments for trait improvement. Furthermore, elucidating maternal, genetic, and environmental factors that influence rumen microbiome formation and development may provide new insights into possible mechanisms for manipulating rumen microbial composition to improve long-term host health and performance. The potential for these small but mighty tripe microbes to play a role in improving livestock production is appreciated, although relatively uncertain.",,"Cammack, K. M.;Austin, K. J.;Lamberson, W.

294,Lambda display phage as a mucosal vaccine delivery vehicle for peptide antigens,"The bacteriophage is structurally stable in the gastrointestinal tract and has favorable safety, stability, ease of manufacture, and immunogenicity properties. These properties make them potential candidates as vehicles for oral vaccine delivery, but little is known about their capacity to induce mucosal immune responses in the small intestine. Whole-body imaging validated lambda bacteriophage (LP) of mice was distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract 24 hours after oral delivery. In newborn calves, targeted delivery of confirmed LP to the small intestine was immunogenic in a dose-dependent manner and was uptake by Peyer's patches. LP-specific IgA responses were induced in both Peyer patches and draining mesenteric lymph nodes. A lambda display phage (LDP) was constructed to present three immunogenic disease-specific epitopes (DSE) from the cervid prion protein (amino acids 130-140 [YML]; 163-170 [YRR] and 171-178[YRR]). phage capsid head protein D (LDP-DSE). Targeted delivery of purified LDP-DSE to intestinal segments induced IgA responses to all three peptide epitopes. Moreover, administration of bacteria expressing soluble D-DSE also induced epitope-specific IgA responses within targeted Peyer patches. These are the first studies to report the use of LDP to induce epitope-specific IgA responses in the small intestine and to confirm the function of Peyer's patches as a site for LP recruitment. Also, IgA responses to peptide epitopes on LDP were observed in the absence of a mucosal adjuvant. These observations confirm that LDP has the capacity to function as a mucosal delivery vehicle with protein D as an effective carrier for peptide epitopes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

295,Two novel parvoviruses in fruiting new and old world bats,"Bats, a globally distributed group of mammals of high ecological importance, are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral agents important to human and animal health. In this study, we evaluated pools of blood samples from two phylogenetically distant bat families, specifically flying foxes (Pteropodidae), West African Eidolon helvum, and two New World leaf-nosed fruit bat species (Phyllostomidae). Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. An array-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) combined with high-throughput sequencing was used to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Turkey. Artibeus jamaicensis (Aj-BtPV-1) from Panama. These viruses were circulating in 7-8% of the corresponding bat colony. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in high concentrations in the blood of infected animals: up to 10E8 and 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1, respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was also detected in all organs (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestine) collected from bats, and the spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites for viral replication to occur. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known human and livestock parvoviruses. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae can cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals of different geographic origins, ecology and climatic ranges.

296,Swine flu epidemic in Argentina revealed a non-contemporary human H3N2 virus that is highly contagious among pigs,"Sporadic outbreaks of human H3N2 influenza A virus (IAV) infections in swine populations have been reported since 1970 in Asia, Europe, and North America. Serological studies in pigs in South America indicate that IAVs of the H3 and H1 subtypes are currently in circulation; however, neither virus isolation nor characterization has been reported. In November 2008, an outbreak of respiratory disease consistent with swine flu virus (SIV) infection in pigs was detected in Argentina. The present study describes the clinical epidemiology, pathology, and molecular and biological features of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus isolated 96-98% common nucleotide identities with H3N2 IAVs circulating in humans from 2000 to 2003. Antigenically, sera from experimentally vaccinated animals cross-reacted mainly with H3N2 influenza viruses of non-contemporary human origin. In an experimental infection in a commercial pig breed, the virus had low virulence but effectively transmitted to pigs in contact, causing severe disease when an infected animal contracted a secondary bacterial infection. This is the first report of fully human H3N2 IAV associated with clinical disease in pigs from South America. These studies highlight the importance of bidirectional transmission of IAVs and SIVs between pigs and humans and call for improved surveillance of influenza in the pig population worldwide. © 2011 SGM.",,"Cappuccio, J.

It affected industrially raised poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks reported up to 31 December 2000. Virological studies have yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus producing intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1-6 to 2-0. and which can be classified as belonging to group C1 according to their monoclonal antibody binding patterns. Clinical, gross, and microscopic findings were specific to Newcastle disease, and different bird species were susceptible to varying degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl emerged as the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological research highlighted the important role of the broiler hatchery in initiating the epidemic and the dealers in sustaining the epidemic.

Virally induced virulence is usually measured by measuring the mean time to death or appearance of symptoms following viral vaccination. In this review, we make a distinction between general virulence and neurovirulence. We define neurovirulence as the degree of pathogenesis in the nervous system, but we intend it to be more extensive than the ability of the virus to grow in the central nervous system (CNS). This distinction is made possible by recent advances that allow an integrated assessment of the degree of pathology, reactive gliosis, and inflammatory response to infection in the intact organism with specific antisera and molecular probes.",,"Card, J.

An orthopoxvirus infection was suspected due to negative staining electron microscopy results. Diagnosis was confirmed by histology, virus isolation and molecular analysis performed in different organs from all animals. An epidemiological study was unable to identify the source of infection in the environment. Trapped rodents were negative by virological testing, but specific IgG was detected in 27.27% of small rodents and 14.28% of rats. The susceptible monkey population received attenuated live vaccine and no adverse reactions were observed; a detectable humoral immune response was induced in most vaccinated animals.

301,Virological and phylogenetic characterization of attenuated small ruminant lentivirus isolates escaping effective serological detection.,"Three field isolates of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) were derived from a mixed herd of goats and sheep that had been certified free of goat arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) for many years. Phylogenetic analysis of pol sequences allowed to classify these isolates as subtype A4. None of the animals showed clinical signs of SRLV infection, confirming previous observations suggesting that this particular subtype is highly attenuated, at least for goats. A quantitative real-time PCR strategy based on primers and probes derived from a highly variable env region allowed us to classify animals as uninfected, single or double infected. The performance of different serological instruments based on this classification revealed their profound inability to monitor animals infected with this particular SRLV subtype. In vitro, the isolates showed differences in their cytopathicity and tended to replicate more efficiently in goat, particularly goat macrophages, than in sheep cells. In contrast, in vivo, these viruses achieved significantly higher viral loads in sheep than in goats. Both env subtypes infected goats and sheep with equal yield. But one of them achieved significantly higher viral loads in both species. In conclusion, we characterized three isolates of SRLV subtype A4 that circulated efficiently in a mixed herd of goats and sheep despite their marked attenuation and a strict physical separation between goats and sheep. The poor performance of applied serological tools indicates that it is imperative to develop new, subtype-specific tools to support an SRLV eradication campaign. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Cardinaux, L.;Zahno, M.

Describes an unusual skin disease outbreak in fattening calves in southern Brazil. Of 17 male cattle aged 6-48 months fed on pastures, 14 (82%) were affected. The animals developed papules, vesicles, and scabies proliferative lesions on the muzzle with a clinical course of approximately 10-15 days. Scabies lesions often present with exudation and bleeding. Histological examination of mucocutaneous tissue in the detached crusts revealed acanthosis with thickening of the corneal layer and early keratinization (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis). There were multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the dermis. Electron microscopic examination of the shell samples revealed typical parapoxvirus particles: oval-shaped (260 nm × 160 nm), enveloped and covered with a helical layer. Polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene amplified a 590-bp product from DNA extracted from the shells. The nucleotide sequence of amplicons revealed a 97% nucleotide homology with Pseudocowpox virus and lower homology with other parapoxviruses: Bovine papular stomatitis virus (84%) and Orf virus (94%).

303,Diagnosis and Control of LPAI H5N8 Outbreak in a Commercial Flock of Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) in the Central Valley of California,"In April 2014, an outbreak of the low pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 North American genetic strain was diagnosed in a commercial quail operation in Stanislaus County, California. The spike in mortality resulted in 20 Japanese quail chickens (Coturnix c. japonica) being sent to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, Turlock Branch. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs tested positive for influenza A virus H5N8 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The virus was later isolated. In vivo assay and sequencing of the protein cleavage site of hemagglutinin classified the virus as a North American genetic strain with low pathogenicity for chickens. Following the diagnosis, a rapid and coordinated response took place to contain the outbreak. The affected building was evacuated, cleaned and disinfected. For commercial bird flu testing, three areas - a 3 kilometer (km) radius (High Risk Area), a 3-10 km area (Buffer Zone) and a 10-20 km (Surveillance Area) - were created from the affected building. and non-commercial poultry operations.

It is one of the earliest identified members of the genus Orthopoxvirus, which includes viruses that cause human smallpox and monkeypox. Both historical and current literature define ""cattle pox"" as a disease with a single etiological agent. The genotypic data presented here suggest that CPXV is not a single species, but a combination of several (up to 5) species capable of infecting cows, humans, and other animals. The practice of naming agents after the host from which the resulting disease arises obscures the true taxonomic relationships of ""cattlepox"" isolates. These data support the rise of as many as four new strains within the traditional ""cattlepox"" group and suggest that both wild and modern vaccine strains of Vaccinia virus are most closely related to CPXV in continental Europe rather than its homeland of the United Kingdom. vaccine.",,"Carroll, D.

307,Vaccinia and other viruses with vaccines available show a marked similarity to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein: the possibility of using existing vaccines to stop the AIDS pandemic,"Cross-reactive immunity occurs when infection or vaccination with a virus provides protection against another related family member. A search for homologues of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein revealed that it consists of thousands of intercalated and overlapping viral pairings, or longer-range consensus, of the pentapeptide, belonging to more than 70% of the currently sequenced virome, infecting all kingdoms from bacteria to humans. Other proteins (nef/tat/gag/pol) were similar to proteins from equine infectious anemia virus and HTLV-2/HTLV-3 viruses, while also highly homologous to proteins from Visna/Maedi and other ovine viruses. This phenomenon suggests that horizontal gene transfer from co-infecting RNA and DNA viruses to retroviruses is extensive and provides a pathway for subsequent insertion of non-retroviral genes into human and other genomes via retroviral integration. This homology includes all viruses whose vaccines are currently available. Cross-reactive immunity may be effective in AIDS, as the Vaccinia vaccine for the tropic form of CCR5 reduces viral replication in cells of HIV-1 infected patients. Measles, Dengue virus, or GB virus C infections also reduce HIV-1 viral load. Vaccinia/smallpox vaccine reintroduction can be expected to have a significant impact on the AIDS pandemic, and careful examination of potential uses of other available viral and bacterial vaccines deserves close attention. This phenomenon may also apply to other persistent viruses, bacteria and parasites for which there is no vaccine, and the arsenal of current vaccines may play a role in diseases other than those for which they were designed.

The presence of viral RNA in human and pig samples was also evaluated and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV positive samples. Forty-two pig farms were sampled; 142 workers were recruited and divided into two groups: (i) 69 workers who had occupational contact with pigs on 42 sample farms (including veterinarians and farmers); (ii) without occupational contact with 73 pigs. Of the 42 swine farms, 41 (97%) tested positive for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HEV antibodies (Abs). The overall seroprevalence in pigs was 50% (441/879), and the seropositivity rate was higher in pigs (333/469, 71%). In stool samples, HEV RNA was detected in animals on 13 (31%) of the 42 farms tested, resulting in a higher positivity in weaning (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates into genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for the HEV viral genome in the blood. Five of the 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV, with an overall prevalence of 3.52%, and there was no statistically significant difference in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% vs. 1.3%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup, suggesting a correlation between duration of exposure and the probability of HEV infection, compared with short-term subjects (veterinarians) and long-term workers (farmers).

In this study, a deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed to provide information on the genetic diversity and distribution of HEV genotypes in Bulgaria. Three different datasets of HEV virus were created for genotyping with maximum likelihood method, evolutionary rate estimated by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, demographic history research and selective pressure analysis. The evolution rate for genotype 3e was 351 × 10aˆ'3 substitutions/place/year (95% peak posterior density [95% HPD]: 145 × 10 âˆ'3-575 × 10 âˆ'3).

313,First report of Cowpea mild mottle virus in Chia (Salvia hispanica),"Chia (Salvia hispanica), a herbaceous plant of the Lamiaceae family, has gained popularity due to its high concentrations of health-promoting Omega-3 fatty acids. Plants with different virus-like symptoms were observed in major chia producing areas in Argentina. Some plants exhibited yellowing, variegated and blistered leaves, while others exhibited shortened internodes and leaf and stem deformation. The aim of this study was to identify the viruses that infect this crop. Forty symptomatic chia plants were collected from nine production sites in northeastern Argentina. Samples were tested by DAS-ELISA for Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cowpea mild mottle virus (CPMMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tospovirus group (I, II and III). by PTA-ELISA for genus Potyvirus and by PCR for Begomovirus. CPMMV was detected in three plants with different types of symptoms. In these plants, feather-like inclusions formed by virions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. ORF2 to ORF6 (2462 nucleotides) from the CPMMV viral genome was amplified by RT-PCR. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the coat protein gene (CP - ORF5) of the Chia virus isolate was obtained and compared to the 31 CPMMV sequence reported in GenBank. The results showed that nt identity ranged from 75.5 to 99.0% above the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy criteria for Carlavirus species differentiation. Phylogenetic analysis with CP gene nt sequences revealed that the CPMMV chia isolate grouped with other CPMMV isolates from Brazil, Ghana, India, Puerto Rico, Taiwan and other plant species in the USA, but separated from the other four individuals from India. This is the world's first report of the presence of CPMMV in chia. Although other viruses were not detected in this study, because CPMMV is found in chia plants with different symptoms, it is possible that the different symptoms observed were produced by a mixture of viruses.

314,Taxon sequencing in phylogenetic trees through evolutionary algorithms,"BACKGROUND: In a typical ""left to right"" phylogenetic tree, the vertical order of taxa is meaningless because only the branch path between them reflects their degree of similarity. To make unresolved trees more informative, we propose here an innovative Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) method to search for the best graphic representation of unresolved trees to give biological meaning to the vertical arrangement of taxa. METHODS: Starting from a West Nile virus phylogenetic tree, in a (1+1)-EA, we developed it by randomly rotating the internal nodes and selecting the tree with better fit at each generation. The fitness is the sum of the genetic distances between the considered taxon and the next taxon r (radius). After adjusting the radius for best performance, we developed the trees with (lambda + mu)-EAs to examine the effect of population on the algorithm. RESULTS: (1+1)-EA consistently outperformed a random search and better results were obtained by setting the radius to 8. (lambda + mu)-EAs performed as well as (1+1) except for the larger population. (1000 + 1000). RESULTS: Trees after evolution showed an improvement in both fitness (based on genetic distance matrix, then close taxa are actually genetically close) and biological interpretation. Samples collected in the same state or year converged, making the tree easier to interpret. Biological relationships between samples are also easier to observe.",,"Cerutti, F.;Bertolotti, L.;Goldberg, T. L.;Giacobini, M.",2011.0,2001-07-01 00:00:00,,0
315,Phylogenetic characterization of classic swine fever viruses isolated in Korea between 1988 and 2003.,"Twenty-four classical swine fever (CSF) virus isolates from CSF outbreaks in the Republic of Korea in 1988 and 2003 were genetically characterized for the partial E2 gene (190 nucleotides) and compared with CSF viruses reported by other countries. Phylogenetic analyzes classified Korean field isolates into subgroup 3.2 between 1988 and 1999, forming an independent division from CSF viruses identified in other countries. In contrast, viruses isolated during the 2002-2003 CSF outbreaks were classified in a different subgroup (2.1). 2.1 viruses showed a close genetic association (92.1-100% nucleotide similarity) with CSF viruses reported from China and Taiwan in 1998-2001. As no evidence of CSF virus infection was detected in the Korean boar (Sus scrofa coreanus) population, molecular characterization results strongly suggest that the CSF epidemic outbreaks in Korean pig populations between 2002 and 2003 are attributed to the introduction of a new virus. possibly the strain or strains from neighboring countries.

316,Molecular characterization of bovine transient fever virus in Thailand between 2013 and 2017.,"Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), in the negative sense, is an arthropod-borne disease caused by the bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a single-stranded RNA virus. BEFV is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, including Thailand, a country in mainland Southeast Asia. However, there are few studies on BEFV in Thailand and no information is available on the molecular properties of BEFV. Therefore, the aim of this study was to genetically characterize Thai BEFVs and reveal their evolution by phylogenetic analysis of G gene ectodomain sequences. From 2013 to 2017, blood samples were collected from cattle matching the BEF case definition from three regions of Thailand. Thai BEFV G genes and the whole genome of one isolate were sequenced and characterized East Asia/TH/LRI0045/2016. In addition, their phylogeny was established. This is the first report on the genetics of BEFV in Southeast Asia. The G ectodomain coding region of Thai BEFV found in 2013-2017 is closely related to the second and third subclades of the East Asian lineage. In addition, we observed mutations in the putative P'ORF of all Thai BEFVs that formed an early stop codon. Thai G gene sequences are closely related to sequences from mainland Chinese and Taiwanese isolates. All genomic sequences of Thai BEFV and East Asian/Chinese/JT02 L/2002 share features suggesting a common evolutionary relationship between East and Southeast Asian strains. Further research on the relationship between animal translocation, BEFV circulation in the Greater Mekong subregion, and acquisition of more G gene sequences could improve understanding of BEFV epidemiology in mainland Southeast Asia.",,"Chaisirirat, T.;Sangthong, P.;Arunvipas, P.;Petcharat, N.;Thangthamniyom, N.;Chumsing, W.;Lekcharoensuk, P.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.10.013,0
317,Metagenomic analysis of antibiotic resistance genes in dairy cow feces following therapeutic administration of third generation cephalosporin.,"Although dairy manure is widely applied to the field, it is relatively less studied compared to other farm animals as a potential source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to the environment and ultimately to human pathogens. Ceftiofur, the most widely used antibiotic in US dairy cows, is a 3rd generation cephalosporin, a class of antibiotics critical to human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of typical ceftiofur antibiotic treatment on the prevalence of ARGs in the fecal microbiome of dairy cows using a metagenomic approach. Î²-lactam ARGs were found to be elevated in the faeces of Holstein cows (n = 3) treated with ceftiofur compared to control cows (n = 3). However, the total number of ARGs in all classes was not measurably affected by ceftiofur treatment, possibly due to the predominance of unaffected tetracycline ARGs in their metagenomic libraries. Functional analysis via MG-RAST further revealed that ceftiofur treatment resulted in increases in gene sequences associated with ""phages, prophages, transposable elements and plasmids"", revealing that this treatment also enriched the ability to transfer ARGs horizontally. Measurable taxonomic shifts (increase) were noted with ceftiofur treatment, along with additional functional shifts (for example, increase in genes associated with stress, chemotaxis, and resistance to toxic compounds; metabolism of aromatic compounds and decrease in cell division and cell cycle-related genes). reduction in Bacterioidia and Actinobacteria). This study demonstrates that ceftiofur has a broad, measurable and immediate effect on the cow fecal metagenome. Given the importance of 3rd generation cephalospirins in human medicine, their continued use in dairy cattle should be carefully considered, and waste treatment strategies should be explored to slow the spread of ARG from dairy cattle manure.

318,Interspecies transmission from birds and emergence of new viruses,"Birds, the only living members of the dinosaur lineage, are warm-blooded vertebrates that display high species biodiversity, perching and migratory behavior, and a unique adaptive immune system. Birds provide natural reservoirs for numerous viral species and thus provide a source of genes for the evolution, emergence and spread of new viruses. Human entry into the natural habitats of wild birds, domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and increased poultry consumption by humans have made it easier for avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause zoonosis. Recently, a new adenovirus was found only in birds, causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infection among birds and humans. Rather than jumping directly from bird to human and becoming the primary cause of an epidemic, a new avian virus may be the potentiator of another epidemic-causing zoonotic agent. A comprehensive avian virome will improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of birds.",,"Chan, J. F. W.;To, K. K. W.;Chen, H.;Yuen, K. Y.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.coviro.2015.01.006,0

320,"Analysis of the genomic sequences of 95 papillomavirus types: combining typing, phylogeny and taxonomy","Our aim was to examine the phylogenetic relationships of all known papillomaviruses (PVs) and the possibility of constructing a supratype taxonomic classification based on this information. Of the many detectable homologous segments found in PV genomes, a 291-bp segment of the L1 gene is notable because it is surrounded by the MY09 and MY11 consensus primers and contains highly conserved amino acid residues that simplify sequence alignment. We determined the sequences of human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48, MY09-MY11, HPV- 50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5 and BPV-6 and now a database has been created. It covers HPV-1 to HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven HPV genomes yet to be typed, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed based on other sequence data. We constructed phylogenies based on partial L1 and E6 gene sequences and distinguished five major divisions, which we call supergroups. One of them combines 54 types of genital PV, which can be divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and combines most PVs typically found in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, but also includes several types typical of other cutaneous lesions such as HPV-4. The third supergroup combines the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous hoofed PVs BPV-3, BPV-4 and BPV-6, and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, canine oral PV . , and the cottontail rabbit PV. The finch PV and two rodent PVs, Micromys minutus PV and Mastomys natalensis PV, are left ungrouped due to the relative isolation of each of their progeny. Within most supergroups, groups formed on the basis of cladistic principles combine phenotypically similar PV types.

The genomes of the two vaccine ILTV strains were sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer 2X of 36 cycles of single-ended reads. The results revealed that there were several nucleotide differences (23 in vaccine 1; 31 in vaccine 2) and showed that the US CEO strains were practically identical to the Australian Serva CEO strain, a vaccine of European origin. Sequence differences indicated the spectrum of variability between vaccine strains. Only eight amino acid differences were found in vaccine 1 in ILTV proteins, including UL54, UL27, UL28, UL20, UL1, ICP4, and US8. Similarly, UL54, UL27, UL28, UL36, UL1, ICP4, US10, and US8 in vaccine 2.

324,"Lessons from Taiwan's Largest Avian Flu Virus Outbreak, 2015","The largest avian flu (AI) outbreak in history attacked poultry and wild birds in Taiwan starting January 6, 2015. This study analyzes surveillance results, epidemiological characteristics, and viral sequences using government-published information to minimize future pandemic influenza. H5 section 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic AI viruses (HPAIVs) were not detected in Taiwan before 2015. During this outbreak, four types of etiologic agents were identified: three new subtypes H5N2, H5N8 and H5N3 strains 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs and an endemic chicken H5N2 subtype (Mexican-like lineage) of low pathogenic AI viruses. Co-circulation of H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or mixed subtypes accompanied by legacy H5N2 viruses also occurred in the same farm. More than 90% of domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; In the first outbreaks, geese were most affected. The outbreak peaked in mid-January for all three new H5 subtypes. Spatial epidemiology found that the most affected areas were located in the southwestern coastal areas. Different geographic distributions of AI virus subspecies were detected in terrestrial poultry (mainly chickens), Changhwa (P = 0.03) and Yunlin (P = 0.007) counties, with hotspots of H5N2 guideline 2.3.4.4 vs. past endemic legacy H5N2 viruses. , respectively, central Taiwan. Phylogenetic and sequence analyzes of all the early 10 Taiwan H5 wing 2.3.4.4 isolates covering the three subtypes showed that they were very different from HA of past native H5 viruses from domestic ducks (75%-80%) and chickens (70%). -75%). However, they had the highest percentages of sequence identity (99.53-100%) with HA of A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) isolated on December 7, 2014 in Japan, and recently in Japan, America and Korea.

325,Dual infection of bovine strains of group a and porcine-like group C rotaviruses with gnotobiotic calves influences the pathogenesis of group C rotavirus,"There is serological evidence of the existence of bovine group C rotaviruses in the United States, but no reports of their isolation. Ninety stool samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 stool samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT). -PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive by RT-PCR alone, and a group of rotavirus C was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden pig group C strain than the Shintoku bovine strain. Since the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passing through cell culture), we hypothesized that such bilateral rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis of rotaviruses and in host adaptation. Therefore, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or in combination with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or limited to) virus transmission in vaccinated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves co-infected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea, but each neither virus spilled. . Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), while dual infection with both viruses caused lesions in the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more extensive small bowel lesions occurred in calves co-infected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses increased the fecal excretion of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Our findings therefore suggest a potential new hypothesis for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species involving binary infections.",,"Chang, K. O.;Nielsen, P. R.;Ward, L.

326,Nipah virus: phylogeny and replication,"Phylogenetic analysis of Nipah virus isolates from Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia revealed the existence of at least two different sets of NiV strains. Based on the major glycoprotein (G) gene, the Nipah virus-Tambun isolate clustered with Nipah virus isolates from Cambodia and Bangladesh, while the remaining isolates from Malaysia clustered in a separate cluster. Sequence heterogeneity was noted among Nipah virus isolates from Malaysia, but the overall genomic sequence aberration value was small, suggesting that the virus originated recently. Nipah virus replicated well in stable kidney cells in pigs and in human lung fibroblast cells. Human monocytes were infected with Nipah virus, but the cells did not support productive infection. Similarly, infection of human neuron cells did not result in the release of a high yield of infectious virus. Monocytes can serve to spread Nipah virus from the site of infection, including the blood-brain barrier. And in the brain, Nipah virus probably spreads by cell-to-cell diffusion mechanism.",,"Chang, L. Y.;AbuBakar, S.",2009.0,,,0

In this study, we aimed to estimate the frequency of TTMV infection and the possible role of this virus in its etiology in cases of cervicitis and cervical tumors such as intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma in an Isfahan population. Methods: 79 cases of cervicitis and 42 tumors were collected from the histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 62% of samples tested were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinomas, 68.4% of CINs, and 100% of SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of cases were positive. In the phylogenetic structure, two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster as previously reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Additionally, three of the isolated cervical tumors (JQ734980, JQ734981, and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster.

It infects wild mammals, farm animals and sometimes humans. Roe deer are considered the main reservoir, but the genotypes they carry are different from those found in livestock and humans. Here, we investigated whether roe deer was the main source of circulating A. phagocytophilum genotypes in the study of I. ricinus nymphs on a fragmented farmland in France. We first evaluated the prevalence of the pathogen in 1837 I. ricinus nymphs (sampled throughout georeferenced sections) and 79 roe deer. The prevalence was significantly different between ticks and roe deer: 1.9% versus 76%, respectively. Second, using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we characterized the diversity of A. phagocytophilum genotypes found in 22 infected ticks and 60 infected roe deer; The aim was to determine the frequency of coinfections. Only 22.7% of infected ticks carried genotypes associated with roe deer. This finding is in line with other findings suggesting that cattle density is the main factor explaining the infected tick density. To explore epidemiological scenarios that might explain these patterns, we constructed segmental models that focused on how exposure to A. phagocytophilum and the dynamics of infection affect pathogen prevalence in roe deer. At exposure levels estimated by the results of this study and the literature, the high prevalence in roe deer was seen only in the model where superinfections can occur in all infection phases and where the probability of infection after exposure is greater than 0.43.

331,Variations in lentiviral gene expression in monocyte-derived macrophages from naturally infected sheep,"Seventy-nine 1-year-old lambs from three different farms and one feeder were examined for natural lentivirus infection. We used three different methods to detect infection in blood-borne macrophages and to stage the ovine lentivirus life cycle. The cytopathic infectious virus was obtained from 14/14 Border Leicester animals obtained from a naturally infected herd. Neither virus particles, virus proteins, virus-specific antibodies, nor viral DNA were detected in samples from 34 lambs from two farms in southern Kansas City. However, we identified 11 infected animals from 31 feeder lambs. Specific viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from macrophages of an animal, but no infectious cytopathic virus was isolated from these cells. Cells from ten other animals contained viral DNA, but neither viral particles nor proteins could be detected by our techniques. Thus, in these naturally infected animals, the virus life cycle either continued to be completed due to differentiation of infected precursor cells in the blood or was stopped at the DNA stage despite the maturation of monocytes into macrophages. Sequence analysis of the env gene of viral genomes from two of the ten fattening sheep showed sequences different from those of known ovine and goat lentiviruses. Surprisingly, these sequences have a higher identity (nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences) than the sheep prototype, the maedi-visna virus.

We show that although the solutions are not unique even for complete information sets, clone haplotypes, their prevalence, and maximally sparing reticulated evolutionary structures can be identified.

333,Transfer of Viral Communities Between Humans During Fecal Microbiota Transplantation,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for resistant Clostridium difficile infections. However, concerns remain regarding the undesired co-transfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here, we examined FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, each receiving 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified and sequenced from donor and recipient stool samples; The reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor are easily detectable in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in the recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses known to replicate in human cells. Instead, viral contigs were either scored as bacteriophages or could not be taxonomically attributed, suggesting unstudied phage. The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with temperate phage replication. In addition, members of Siphoviridae, the typically temperate group of phages containing phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other groups. Based on these findings, we propose that the temperate phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between human individuals. In summary, we documented the transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals via FMT, but in this case series, none were from viral groups known to infect human cells. IMPORTANT Human-to-human transfer of entire virus communities has seldom been studied, but is likely of medical significance. Here, we examined fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and potentially other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT and documented the transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated in animal cells or were known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage that form stable relationships with their hosts are significantly more likely to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.",,"Chehoud, C.;Dryga, A.;Hwang, Y.;Nagy-Szakal, D.;Hollister, E.

335,Minimal core genome sequence typing of bacterial pathogens: a combined approach for clinical and public health microbiology.,"Bacterial pathogens pose a heavy health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genome typing of infectious agents, and particularly those with serious clinical implications, promises to guide clinical care to limit the detrimental effects of infections and prevent potential local diseases. or global epidemics. Here, we sequenced and compared 85 isolates of Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic human and swine pathogen; Here we analyzed 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types representing species diversity and human clinical isolates of high public health importance. We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes were shared by all isolates. Excluding 201 common but motile genes, 876 genes were defined as the minimum core genome (MCG) of the species. Of the 190,894 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, 58,501 were located in the MCG genes and were termed MCG SNPs. A population structure analysis of these MCG SNPs classified 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 included all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our MCG typing system for S. suis provided a clear separation of groups containing isolates associated with humans from groups containing isolates associated with animals. It also separated the group, which included epidemic isolates, including those causing life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from isolates of sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia only. The typing system facilitates the application of genome data to the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and to the surveillance of S. suis. MCG groups can also be used as taxonomic units of S. suis to identify bacterial subpopulations with the potential to cause serious clinical infections and large-scale epidemics.",,"Chen, C.;Zhang, W.;Zheng, H.;Lan, R.;Wang, H.;Du, P.;Bai, X.;Ji, S.;Meng, Q.;Jin, D.;Liu, K.;Jing, H.;Ye, C.;Gao, G.

336,Genetic analysis of virulence and antimicrobial resistant plasmid pOU7519 in Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis,"Background: Zoonotic Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis) causes paratyphoid in pigs and bacteremia in humans, usually carrying or congregating a virulence plasmid and sometimes a separate antimicrobial resistant plasmid. This study aimed to analyze the possible mechanism of how to construct a virulence resistant chimera of the plasmid in S. choleraesuis. Methods: The entire plasmid sequence of pOU7519 in S. choleraesuis strain OU7519 was determined using shotgun cloning and sequencing. Sequence annotation and comparison were performed to identify the sequence responsible for the formation of a chimeric virulence resistance pOU7519. Other chimeric plasmids among the collected S. choleraesuis strains were also confirmed. Results: The 127,212 bp long sequence pOU719 was determined to be a chimera of the virulence plasmid pSCV50 and a multidrug-resistant plasmid pSC138 found in S. choleraesuis strain SC-B67. pOU7519 is a conjugative plasmid carrying a variety of mobile DNAs, including prophages, insertion sequences, integrons and transposons, particularly a Tn. 6088-like transposon. By truncating the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera junction in pOU7519, defective sequences were found in the integrase gene scv50 (int) and attachment site (att), resulting in a stable chimera plasmid, possibly due to failure of excision. pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. Similar structure of chimera was also found in other large plasmids. Conclusion: Deletion of both int and att sties could possibly block chimera excision and result in an irreversible, stable pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. The emergence of conjugative virulence and antimicrobial-resistant plasmids in S. choleraesuis may pose a threat to public health.",,"Chen, C. L.;Su, L. H.;Janapatla, R. P.;Lin, C. Y.;Chiu, C.

339,Evolutionary relationships between large double-stranded DNA viruses infecting microalgae and other organisms as inferred from DNA polymerase genes,"To examine genetic relatedness between viruses infecting microalgae, DNA polymerase gene (DNA pol) fragments were amplified and sequenced from 13 virus clones infecting three distantly related microalgae (Chlorella strains NC64A and Pbi, Micromonas pusilla and Chrysochromulina spp.). . Phylogenetic trees on DNA pol sequences and hybridization of total genomic DNA showed similar branching patterns. Genetic relatedness calculated from hybridization and sequencing data showed good agreement (r = 0.90), indicating that DNA pol sequences can be used to determine genetic relatedness and infer phylogenetic relationships between these viruses. The phylogenetic tree extracted from DNA pol amino acid sequences from 24 dsDNA viruses, including Phycodnaviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, baculoviruses, and African swine fever virus, is in good agreement with groupings based on the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. Microalgal viruses are more closely related to each other than other dsDNA viruses and form a separate phyletic group, suggesting that they share a common ancestor and belong to the Phycodnaviridae. Also, Phycodnaviridae is more closely related to Herpesviridae than to other virus families in which DNA pol sequences are present.",,"Chen, F.;Suttle, C. A.",1996.0,,10.1006/viro.1996.0234,0

However, the differences between post-infection somatic cells and immune cells are poorly understood. The aim of our study was to detect different responses to infection with ALV-J in different cell lines in chicken. In this study, we detected transcriptome expression changes during infection with ALV-J in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) and HD11 cell lines. RNA-Seq was used to determine the expression levels of mRNA transcripts from the two cell types after infection with ALV-J at 1, 4 and 7Â dpi, and gene ontology analyzes were used to cluster differentially expressed genes in pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the expression of 336 and 269 differentially expressed genes related to innate immunity (OASL, CCL4), adaptive immunity (LYZ, CD72), apoptosis and autophagy (WISP2, COMP) in the CEF and HD11 lines, respectively. inflammation (JSC, IL8) and tumorigenesis (PCNA, GPX3).

341,Identification and Research of a Novel Avian Coronavirus in Ducks,"The rapid discovery of new viruses using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our understanding of viral diversity in recent years. Timely identification of new viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by new viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV) distinct from chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) using RNA-Seq. The new duck-specific CoV was a potential new strain within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by the sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also conducted a study of CoVs in domestic poultry in China using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were detected through the questionnaire. Phylogenetic analysis of viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic birds are divided into several site-specific or host-specific clades or sub-clades around the world and that IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although circulating mainly in chickens. Furthermore, this study provided new data supporting the idea that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese, and pigeons, and showed that the novel duck-specific CoV identified in this study via RNA-Seq is genetically closer to some CoVs. . circulating in wild waterfowl.

The result showed that the M, M1 and M2 gene of all recent EIV strains of Florida-2 strain isolated after 2007 were under differential evolution. It evolved into a different clade called the Aisan clade, which was distinguished from the EIV strains of the Florida-2 clan isolated before 2007 and more closely resembled the European clade.

344,Molecular epidemiology of swine epidemic diarrhea virus in China,"Since the beginning of 2006, the swine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been re-emerging in vaccinated pig herds. Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is the only accessory gene in the PEDV genome. All ORF3 genes of 12 PEDV domain strains and one vaccine strain were sequenced. The ORF3 genes of Chinese PEDV domain strains (except CH/GSJIII/07) contain a single 672- or 675-nucleotide (nt) ORF encoding a 223- or 224-aa long peptide. However, vaccine strain CV777 and CH/GSJIII/07 contain a 276-nt ORF due to a 49-nt deletion at nt 245-293. Chinese PEDV domain strains and PEDV reference strains are divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic relationship of ORF3 genes. Chinese PEDV field strains (except CH/GSJIII/07) have a close phylogenetic relationship to Korean strains and are genetically different from PEDV vaccine strains. However, CH/GSJIII/07 has a close phylogenetic relationship to the two vaccine strains, suggesting that it may have evolved from a live vaccine strain.

While some experts claimed it was an unusually hybridized mix of human, avian and swine flu viruses, others concluded that it was a purely simple reclassification hybrid of two swine flu viruses. Here, the phylogenetic diversity of the viral PB1, PA and PB2 gene sequences using online web servers and the results show that all 8 genetic segments of the new virus are probably descended from two swine flu virus strains, and one of the strains is a lineage of human, avian and swine flu viruses that emerged in the world about 10 years ago. hybridized mix. Given the recent epidemiological trends of the new virus, we believe it will spread more widely around the world and remain in human populations for a long time. It can also spread among pig populations. Widespread spread of the new virus in the future may coincide with the disappearance of a subtype of the previous human influenza A virus.",,"Chen, J.

347,"Isolation, genome sequencing and functional analysis of two T7-like coliphages of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli.","Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, which causes significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Due to drug residues and increasing antibiotic resistance caused by antibiotic use, bacteriophages and other alternative therapeutic agents are expected to control APEC infection in poultry. Two APEC phages, P483 and P694, were isolated from feces from the farmer's market in China. We then examined their biological characteristics and performed high-throughput genome sequencing and homology analyzes of these phages. The compilation results of high-throughput sequencing showed that the structures of both the P483 and P694 genomes consisted of linear and double-stranded DNA. Electron microscopy and homology analysis results revealed that both P483 and P694 belong to T7-like virus, a member of the Podoviridae family of the order Caudovirales. Comparative genomic analysis showed that most of the predicted proteins of these two phages showed the strongest sequence.

348,"Deep Sequencing, Details of a Crossover Map of Chimeric Genes in Two Pig Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Infectious Clones","BACKGROUND: Recombination is a major contributor to the genetic diversity of most viruses. A reverse genetics system using infectious clones expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and enhanced GFP (EGFP) was developed to study recombination requirements. However, it is still unclear what kind of crossover events occur to produce viable offspring. OBJECTIVE: We used 454 sequencing to extract recombination events in this system. METHODS: Two porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infectious clones, P129-EGFP-97C and P129-GFPm-d (2-6) were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. P129-EGFP-97C is a fully functional virus containing a non-fluorescent EGFP. P129-GFPm-d (2-6) is a defective virus but contains a fluorescent GFPm. Successful recombination was evident with the emergence of fully functional progeny virus expressing fluorescence. Total RNA was extracted from fluorescent-expressing infected cells and the entire fluorescent gene was amplified to prepare an amplicon library for 454 sequencing. RESULTS: Deep sequencing, nucleotide identities varied from ~37% (21nt to 165nt variable region) to 20% (T<sub>289</sub>C) to ~38% (456-651nt) showed. 100% (672-696nt) compared to EGFP. The results showed that crossover events occurred in three conserved regions (166-288nt, 290-455nt, 652-671nt), also supported by sequence alignments. Remarkably, the short conserved region (652-671nt) showed a crossover hotspot. In addition, four crossover models (two single and two double crossovers) can be used to generate viable recombinants.

Real-time RT-PCR revealed a unique course of infection for the SCID group. During the course of the infection, viremia was initially significantly lower than in normal puppies, but rose significantly by day 21. Deep sequencing of viral structural genes at days 11 and 21 identified seven amino acid substitutions in both normal and SCID pigs. The most significant change was a W99R substitution in GP2 that was present in the vaccine at a frequency of 35% but eventually disappeared in all pigs regardless of immune status. Thus, the amino acid substitutions that occur during acute infection are likely the result of adaptation of the virus to replication in pigs and not of immune selection.",,"Chen, N.;Dekkers, J.

However, the effect on virome and disease severity of PEDV-infected pigs is unknown. Advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body regions for any given host. Methods: The aim of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV positive pigs using a hypothesis-free metagenomic approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive pig faecal swab samples collected from diarrheal piglets from 17 US states between 2015 and 2016 were analyzed. Results: A bioinformatics analysis based on the Kraken algorithm revealed the presence of 9 different RNA strains outside of PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31). %, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9 %, 20/217) and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). Of the 217 piglets, 58 (27%) had PEDV infection alone, while the remaining 159 (73%) shed up to 2 9 different viruses.

351,"A new strain of astrovirus in the gut of diarrheal yaks on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, 2013","The yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Diarrhea is a common disease in the area and causes great economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral strains, we reported the metagenomic-derived virome in a pooled stool sample of 20 diarrheal yaks. Nine viruses found in pooled diarrheal samples in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hocovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus, and mountain rat hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, AstV alone had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrheal samples, indicating a correlation with clinical symptoms of diarrhea in the closets. To further investigate the molecular characterization of Yak AstV, a nearly complete genome was obtained from a diarrheal sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4%-66.2% similarity in faeces to other related bovine AstVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome showed that yak AstV fell into the cluster of bovine AstVs, but in a unique lineage, suggesting that a new species of AstV had been identified in the yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetic association with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than with bovine AstVs. Further analysis indicated that a possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2.

The results showed that strain PRRSV-SN is a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) variant strain with the North American (NA) genotype. Homology analysis showed that the ORF5 gene of the PRRSV-SN isolate shares 89.4% (86.5%) nucleotide (amino acid) sequence similarity with the North American strain VR-2332, and 98.8% (96%) identity with JXA1 ( Europe The similarity with the representative strain Lelystad virus of the type 57.7%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRRSV-SN belongs to the NA genotype and has the same subtype as other highly pathogenic PRRSV strains. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that, compared with strain VR2332, PRRSV-SN has varying degrees of variation in signal peptide, transmembrane domain (TM), primary neutralizing epitope (PNE), non-neutral epitopes, and N-glycosylation sites. Antigenicity analysis showed that PRRSV-SN ORF5 gene products and JXA1 have similar antigenic properties, and the antigenic epitopes are mainly located in the regions aa30-39, aa50-60, aa128-141, aa146-155 and aa161-183. In contrast, the antigenic properties of PRRSV-SN are quite different from that of the VR2332 strain. The main differences were that the PRRSV-SN strain was significantly narrower in the aa30-39 and aa50-60 regions than the VR2332 strain, but was significantly wider in the aa136-141 region. The results of this study showed that the epidemic strains that caused PRRSV outbreaks in the farm were still mainly JXA1 variants, but the genes of the PRRSV epidemic strain still showed constant diversity due to the more frequent use of live vaccine immunizations.

Province, China. METHODS: Eight Sw/GX/13/06 genes were cloned and genetically analyzed. RESULTS: The hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M), and non-structural (NS) genes of Sw/GX/13/06 were most closely related to the classic porcine H1N1 influenza virus strain genes. The neuraminidase (NA) and PB1 genes were most closely related to the corresponding genes from the human influenza H3N2 virus strain. The remaining two genes, PA and PB2 polymerase genes, were most closely related to avian influenza virus descendant genes.

354,Gene expression profile after activation of RIG-I in 5'ppp-dsRNA-challenged DF1,"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) can recognize influenza viruses and evoke the innate immune response. RIG-I is absent in the chicken genome but is conserved in the ducks genome. RIG-I deficiency makes chickens more susceptible to avian influenza infection, and clinical symptoms are more pronounced than in other poultry. It is unknown whether delivery of duck RIG-I to chicken cells induces immunity as seen in ducks and the role of RIG-I in resident immunity. In this study, a chicken cell strain with stable duRIG-I expression by lentiviral infection was established by donating DF1/LV5-RIG-I and a control strain DF1/LV5 was established in parallel. To confirm stable, high-level duRIG-I expression in DF1 cells, duRIG-I mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Also, 5'triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5'ppp-dsRNA) was used to mimic an RNA virus infection and infected DF1/LV5-RIG-I and DF1/LV5 cells were subjected to high-throughput RNA sequencing; 193.46M reading and 39.07G base. A total of 278 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), namely duRIG-I-mediated responding genes, were identified by RNA-seq. Among 278 genes, 120 DEGs were annotated in the KEGG database, and the most reliable KEGG pathways are likely to be the signaling pathways of RIG-I-like receptors. Functional analysis by gene ontology (GO) indicates that the functions of these DEGs are mainly related to Type I interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-Î²-mediated cellular responses, and upregulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway. Based on the genes shared between the different pathways, a network representing crosstalk between RIG-I and other signaling pathways was constructed using the Cytoscape software. The network suggests that the RIG-mediated pathway may cross-talk with the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and MAPK signaling pathway during transmission of antiviral signals. After screening, a group of key responsive genes in RIG-I-mediated signaling pathways such as ISG12-2, Mx1, IFIT5, TRIM25, USP18, STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, IRF7 and IRF8 were tested for differential expression by true. time RT-PCR. In summary, by combining our results and the available literature, we propose a RIG-I-mediated signaling network in chickens.",,"Chen, Y.;Xu, Q.;Li, Y.;Liu, R.;Huang, Z.;Wang, B.;Chen, G.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.dci.2016.07.009,0
355,Characterization of a newly identified bacteriophage infecting Bordetella bronchiseptica in pigs.,"novel lethal bacteriophage infecting Bordetella bronchiseptica, vB_BbrM_PHB04, was isolated from wastewater collected from a pig farm in China. The phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 exhibited growth over a wide range of temperature and pH conditions, and showed different coat values and lytic spectrum activity within the same strains at 25Â°C and 37Â°C. High-throughput sequencing revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative open reading frames. Overall, the vB_BbrM_PHB04 genome showed very low similarity (highest nucleotide identity 82%, 1% coverage) to other phage sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the Myoviridae family. In addition, polymerase chain reaction-based detection of phage genes in phage-resistant B. bronchiseptica variants revealed no evidence of lysogenic activity of the vB_BbrM_PHB04 phage.",,"Chen, Y.;Yang, L.;Sun, E.;Song, J.;Wu, B.",2019.0,,10.1007/s00705-018-4034-0,0

358,Genetic variation in envelope genes of contemporary US swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strains influences viral antigenicity.,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases in pigs caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Genome sequences of sixty-six PRRSV strains were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the USA in 2014 to investigate contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of genes encoding envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To investigate the effect of observed genetic variation on antigenicity, genome regions encoding GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of eight different PRRSV strains using reverse genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region from only four of the eight strains yielded live recombinant virus. When appropriate, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A significant strain-related loss in cross-reactivity was variably observed with indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with commercially modified live vaccines following replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using antisera from pigs naturally exposed to PRRSV.

Our previous work shows that orf is ubiquitous in Fujian Province, China, an area of significant heterogeneity among ORFVs. In this study, we sequenced the complete genomes of four Fujian goat ORFV strains (OV-GO, OV-YX, OV-NP, and OV-SJ1). The four strains were 132-139 kb in length, each containing 124-132 genes and approximately 64% G+C content. The most notable differences between the four strains were found near the genome termini. Compared with other ORFVs, seven genes were absent in OV-NP and three genes near the right terminal in OV-SJ1. We also investigated the skin virulence of four Fujian ORFVs in goats. ORFVs with gene deletions showed low virulence, while ORFVs without gene deletions showed high virulence in goats, suggesting that gene deletion probably led to attenuation of ORFVs. Gen 134 was disrupted in the OV-NP genome due to the absence of the start code. The phylogenetic tree based on the complete Parapoxviruse genomes showed that sheep-derived and goat-derived ORFVs formed distinctly separate branches with 100% bootstrap. Based on the single gene phylogenetic tree of 132 genes of ORFVs, it can be easily distinguished that 47 genes originate from sheep or goats. To further reveal the genetic diversity presented in goat ORFVs and sheep ORFVs, we analyzed the inferred amino acid sequences of gene 008, multiple alignments of amino acid sequences of gene 008 from five goat ORFVs and four sheep ORFVs. revealed 33 unique aminos. acids that differentiate it as a host, either sheep or goat.

On the other hand, most Brazilian isolates appear to be derived from only one entry. Multiple introductions of the virus have likely occurred through the importation of animals with the asymptomatic form of the virus or the importation of contaminated semen, according to data from the Pig Breeders' Association.

In the former, infections often lead to massive viral replication, resulting in iridescence and eventual death of the infected animal. Among the latter, infections target various organs and can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality among commercially and ecologically important fish and amphibian species. The viral replication strategy was primarily elucidated through the frog virus 3 (FV3) study with additional input from other iridovirides of ecological or commercial importance. Replication occurs in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and includes genome length and concatemeric DNA synthesis, extensive methylation of the viral genome (only among vertebrate viruses), coordinated expression of three classes of viral gene products, and formation of icosahedral virions within the cytoplasmic viral assembly.

CCHFVs are relatively different in their genome sequences and are grouped in seven separate sequences based on S-segment sequence analysis and six compartments based on M-segment sequences. Our aim was to obtain new information about the molecular epidemiology of CCHF in Iran. Methods: We analyzed the partial and complete nucleotide sequences of the S and M segments from 50 Iranian patients. Extracted RNA was amplified using one-step RT-PCR and subsequently sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using Mega5 software.

In this study, viral metagenomics was used to determine which viruses were present in Rhipicephalus spp. Ticks collected in Mozambique's Zambezi Valley. Methods: RNA was amplified by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The produced sequences were subjected to quality control and classified by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. Results: Although viruses similar to Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified, most of the viral sequences showed the closest sequence identity to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Nearly complete sequences of the five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2 and PA) were obtained, showing an amino acid identity of 32%-52% against known quaranjaviruses. The sequences were most closely associated with the Wellfleet Bay virus and were detected and isolated from common plumage during a fatality event in the United States.

In this study, we compared influenza hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated populations with annual vaccine strains. In total, 181 influenza A/H3N2 virus samples isolated from 82 vaccinated and 99 unvaccinated patients (2011-15, four Japanese influenza seasons) were genetically analyzed using a next-generation sequencer. Amino acid (AA) differences from the corresponding vaccine strains were found in 74 of the 329 HA1 sites. There was a maximum of four AA differences within epitopes in the previous three seasons (2011-14) and fifteen AA differences in the following season (2014-15). A greater number of deviations to AA differences were found to be more significant in isolates obtained from vaccinated patients compared to unvaccinated patients (P=0.0005 in 2011-14; P=0.0096 in 2014-15). Differences in AA within epitopes were also higher in isolates from vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated patients (2.64% vs. 2.14% for 2011-14, P=0.033; 7.78% vs. 6.59% for 2014-15, P=0.058). AA differences at seven sites (48I-278K, 128A-142G, 145S, 158K and 193S) became dominant in subsequent seasons. In all of these regions, dominance was maintained during incompatibility of isolates with vaccine strains and was lost after vaccine mating.

380,Characterization of H9N2 avian influenza viruses from the Middle East shows heterogeneity at amino acid position 226 in hemagglutinin and potential for transmission to mammals.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are a valuable tool for tracking changes in viral genomes and determining the genetic heterogeneity of viruses. In this study, NGS was applied to clinical poultry samples from Jordan to detect eleven H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV). All of the tested viruses belonged to the Middle East A genetic group of the G1 strain. Deep sequencing showed a high degree of heterogeneity of glutamine and leucine residues at position 226 in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, increasing specificity for avian or mammalian type receptors. Additionally, additional amino acid changes were detected in PB1, PA, M1, M2, and NS1 among the viruses tested. Compared with single gene amplification, the application of NGS for the surveillance and characterization of H9N2 LPAIV provides a complete genetic profile of emerging isolates and a better understanding of the potential for zoonotic transmission to mammals.",,"Chrzastek, K.;Lee, D.

To achieve non-selective amplification and recovery of low-abundance genetic sequences, a simplified Sequence-Independent, Single-Primary Amplification (SISPA) technique was applied in combination with the MiSeq platform to target negative and positive-sense single-stranded RNA viral sequences. . This method allowed successful sequence assembly of the viral genome of full- or full-length avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). In addition, SISPA analysis applied to unknown cases of clinical mixed viral infection produced genome assemblages consisting of 98% NDV and 99% IBV genomes. Complete or nearly complete virus genome sequence was obtained with titers of 10<sup>4.5</sup> EID<sub>50</sub>/ml (50% embryo infection dose) or above, and virus identification was detectable with titers 10<sup>3 </sup> EID<sub>50</sub>/ml or more.

382,Characterization of a novel gyrovirus in human feces and chicken meat,"Background: Sequence-independent amplification of clinical samples may lead to the identification of new pathogens. Objectives: To identify novel viruses in human stool samples from patients with diarrhea and to investigate the ecology and clinical significance of such viruses. Study design: Nucleic acid extracted from stool samples from patients with diarrhea of unknown etiology was subjected to random PCR amplification and Roche/454 pyrosequencing. The new viruses identified were characterized genetically and epidemiologically. Results: Four gyroviruses, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus (HGV)/avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV3), and a new gyrovirus (provisionally designated gyrovirus 4 (GyV4)) were identified in human stool samples. . GyV4 was also detected in chicken skin and meats for human consumption, as well as CAV and AGV2/HGV. Results: A new gyrovirus (GyV4) was identified in human feces and in chicken meat sold for human consumption. This virus was phylogenetically different from previously reported gyroviruses in chicken and humans (chicken anemia virus, human gyrovirus, avian gyrovirus 2 and recently reported gyrovirus 3).

384,Pathotyping and Phylogenetic Characterization of Newcastle Disease Viruses Isolated in Peru: Identification of Two New Subgenotypes within Genotype XII,"Infections of poultry with virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1), also known as Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs), cause Newcastle disease (ND). This highly contagious disease affects poultry and many other bird species worldwide. In countries where the disease is common, continuous monitoring and characterization of isolates causing epidemics is necessary. In this study, we report the results of pathogenicity testing and phylogenetic analyzes of seven NDVs isolated from various regions of Peru between 2004 and 2015. The intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPIs) of the six viruses range from 1.75 to 1.88, corresponding to a velogenic pathotype. The remaining virus had an ICPI of 0.00, corresponding to a lentogenic pathotype. These results were consistent with amino acid sequences in the fusion protein (F) cleavage site. All velogenic isolates had the polybasic amino acid sequence 112RRQKRâ†“F117 at the F cleavage site. Phylogenetic analyzes of the complete F gene sequences showed that all isolates were classified in class II of APMV-1. Velogenic viruses are classified in genotype XII, while lentogenic virus is classified in genotype II, which is closely related to the LaSota vaccine strain. Furthermore, the tree topology, bootstrapping values and genetic distances observed in the XII genotype resulted in the identification of new XIIa subgenotypes (in South America) and XIIb (in China), and possibly two clades in the XIIa genotype. All velogenic Peruvian viruses belonged to subgenotype XIIa. Overall, our results confirm the existence of the XII genotype in Peru and show that it is the common genotype currently circulating in our country. Phylogenetic characterization of these isolates helps characterize the evolution of NDV and may aid in the development of vaccines specific to our regional needs.",,"Chumbe, A.;Izquierdo-Lara, R.;Tataje, L.;Gonzalez, R.;Cribillero, G.;GonzÃ¡lez, A.

385,Introduction to the ecology of arboviruses (in Russian),"Arboviruses make up the largest group of viruses of vertebrates. By 1972, about 400 arboviruses had been registered in the world, of which about 260 were divided into 41 groups according to their antigenic properties; 130 viruses have not yet been grouped. In the Universal Classification System of Viruses, arboviruses are included in 6 genes: Alphavirus, Flavivirus, Rhabdovirus, Reovirus, Arenavirus, and Enterovirus. Members of these genera differ markedly in biology, morphology, and biochemical and antigenic characteristics, indicating the heterogeneous character of the arboviruses group. The heterogeneity of this group suggests that transmission of viruses by arthropods as modes of propagation arose independently from systematically distant different types of viruses. All known arboviruses are pathogenic only to vertebrates. They also multiply in arthropod tissue (in vivo and in vitro) but show no pathogenic effects on them. It is noteworthy that certain viruses of arthropods do not reproduce in the tissues of vertebrates. Arbovirus circulation cycles are mainly determined by the trophic relationships of hematophagous arthropods with vertebrates. These associations are most abundant with the group of approximately parasitized mammals. 2500 species of mosquitoes, sandflies, sandflies and Ixodid, Argasid and Gamasid ticks. The trophic associations of arbovirus vectors with birds are considerably lower than with mammals. Apparently, the more than 500 types of hematophages in this category are not related to birds. The most numerous affinities with this group of vertebrates are found in mosquitoes and Argasid ticks. Close trophic relationships are indicated by reptilia reptilla, mosquitoes of the genus Deinocerite, some sandflies of the genus Sergentomyia, and all Ixodid ticks of the genus Aponoma. The total number of species of arbovirus vectors parasitizing on reptiles does not exceed 50. Ecologically, 212 arboviruses can be named mammalian viruses, 39 avian viruses, and 3 reptile arboviruses. There is a close positive correlation (coefficient 0.90) between the number of vectors trophically associated with one or another land vertebrate group and the number of arboviruses specific to that group. Most arboviruses originate on one continent, but spread over two to three continents if they have mainland connections (North and South America, Africa, and Eurasia). Arboviruses occurring in the Western and Eastern hemispheres are ecologically related to humans (Dang 2 and 3, yellow fever), domestic animals (bluetongue of the sheep, Wad Medani) or migratory birds and their narrowly specific parasites (Tyuleniy virus).

390,Metasecretome-selective phage display approach to explore the functional potential of a rumen microbial community,"BACKGROUND: In silico, secretome proteins can be predicted from fully sequenced genomes using a variety of existing algorithms that identify membrane targeting sequences. For the metasecretome (collection of surface, secreted, and transmembrane proteins from environmental microbial communities), this approach is impractical given that metasecretome open reading frames (ORFs) make up only 10% to 30% of the total metagenome and are underrepresented in the dataset. generally low coverage of the metagenomic gene pool, even in large-scale projects. RESULTS: By combining secretome selective phage display and next-generation sequencing, we focused sequencing analysis of the complex rumen microbial community on the metasecretome component of the metagenome. This approach resulted in a high enrichment (29-fold) of fibrolytic enzymes secreted from the plant-bound microbial community of the bovine rumen. In particular, we have so far identified hundreds of rare modules of cellulosomes, specialized cell-surface complexes for plant fiber recognition and degradation. CONCLUSIONS: As a method, metasecretome phage display combined with next-generation sequencing has the power to sample the diversity of low-abundance surface and secreted proteins that would otherwise require extraordinarily large metagenomic sequencing projects. As a resource, the metasecretome display library, powered by the dataset obtained by next-generation sequencing, is readily available for i) affinity selection by standard phage display methodology and ii) easy purification of displayed proteins as part of the virion for individual functional analysis.",,"Ciric, M.;Moon, C.

Thirty-seven Bovine Viral Diarrhea Viruses have been identified and genetically characterized in persistently infected cattle, animals affected by mucosal disease, and in bulk milk. The 5–²UTR region was amplified and sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed comparing all Italian BVDV sequences available from the Genbank database. An unusual number of persistently infected animals proved to be present on multiple farms.

392,Evidence for the Presence of Tunisian-Like Pestiviruses in Small Ruminants in Italy since 2007,"The genus Pestivirus, which belongs to the family Flaviviridae, contains ssRNA+ viruses responsible for infectious diseases in pigs, cattle, sheep, goats and other domestic and wild ruminant animals. Like most RNA viruses, pestivirus has high genome variability with practical implications for disease epidemiology, diagnosis and control. In addition to the officially recognized strains of the pestivirus genus such as BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BDV and CSFV, other pestiviruses have been identified. In addition, most ruminant pestiviruses show the low or absent species specificity observed in serological tests and can infect more than one species. Small ruminants, in particular, are the recipient hosts of the most heterogeneous group of pestiviruses. The aim of this study is to perform the molecular characterization of pestiviruses isolated from sheep and goats in Sicily, Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two viral genomic regions (part of 5'-UTR and all Npro regions) revealed the presence of different pestivirus genotypes in the analyzed goat and sheep herds. Two of the five viral isolates clustered with BVDV-1d viruses, a strain common in Italy but never reported in Sicily. The other three isolates formed a separate cluster with high similarity to Tunisian isolates, which were recently proposed as a new pestivirus strain. This represents the first evidence for the presence of Tunisian-like pestivirus in small ruminant animals in Italy. Also, one of the isolates was collected from a goat and represents the first isolation of this species of Tunisian-like pestivirus.",,"Ciulli, S.;Purpari, G.;Agnello, S.;Di Marco, P.;Di Bella, S.;Volpe, E.;Mira, F.;de Aguiar Saldanha Pinheiro, A.

393,Association between protection against human rotavirus disease and factors influencing protection in low-income settings,"Rotaviruses (RV) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and children worldwide and are predominantly associated with high mortality in low-income settings. The virus is classified into G and P serotypes as well as P genotypes based on differences in the surface-exposed proteins VP7 and VP4, respectively. Infection results in a variable level of protection from subsequent re-infection and disease. This protection is predominantly homotypic in some settings, while broader heterotypic protection is reported in other cohorts. Two antigenically different oral RV vaccines are licensed and available widely, including in under-resourced settings, with funding from the GAVI alliance. The first is a monovalent vaccine derived from a live attenuated human RV strain, and the second is a pentavalent bovine-human reclassification vaccine. Both vaccines are highly effective in high-income settings, but greatly reduced levels of protection are reported in low-income countries. Here we discuss the current challenges faced by mucosal immunologists and vaccineists seeking to identify immunological correlates and understand the varying levels of protection these vaccines confer in humans. Such understanding is critical to maximizing the public health impact of existing vaccines, as well as developing the next generation of RV vaccines needed.",,"Clarke, E.;Desselberger, U.",2015.0,,10.1038/mi.2014.114,0

Individual genome segments of each isolate were characterized by partial digestion of terminally radiolabelled RNA with a base-specific nuclease. This analysis showed that although mobility variations are always associated with detectable changes in the nucleotide sequence, sequence changes that are at least as large as those found in segments that show electrophoretic mobility variations are also detected in segments that do not show mobility variations. Evidence that genome segment reclassification has occurred among viruses in the field came from analysis of 11 RNA species from these five isolates. The overall conclusion from these results is that great care should be taken in interpreting simple genome profiling analyzes of different isolates for epidemiological purposes and that classification of these viruses on the basis of genome electropherotype alone can be misleading.",,"Clarke, I.

The two Hong Kong strains are easily distinguishable from previous A(2) strains by the resistance of their hemagglutinins to trypsin treatment and by their failure to restore hemagglutination capacity after removal of dithiothreitol from the treated virus preparations. In these respects, the horse strain was most similar to the Hong Kong variants. The pattern of hemagglutination inactivation also differentiated porcine, PR8 and CAME strains from each other as well as from the other five strains. The results suggest that grouping type A viruses according to the pattern of inactivation of their hemagglutinins may be a valuable aid to standard serology for a more precise classification of these viruses.",,"Cleeland, R.;Grunberg, E.;Prince, H.

397,"A complex mosaic of enteroviruses shapes the transmission and evolution of community-acquired hand, foot, and mouth disease in a single hospital","Human enteroviruses (EV) pose a major risk to public health. This is particularly so in the Asia-Pacific region, where increasing numbers of cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and major outbreaks of serious neurological disease associated with EV-A71 are occurring. Despite their importance, key aspects of the emergence, epidemiology, and evolution of EVs remain unclear, and most studies of EV evolution have focused on a limited number of genes. Here, we describe the genomic-scale evolution of EV-A viruses over an 18-month period sampled from mildly diseased pediatric patients admitted to a single hospital in Western Sydney, Australia. This analysis revealed the presence of eight viral serotypes—Coxsackievirus (CV) A2, A4, A5, A6, A8, A10, A16, and EV-A71—up to four different serotypes circulating at any given 1 month. Despite the absence of large-scale outbreaks, a high level of geographic and temporal mixing of serotypes was detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple strains of the same serotype were present in the community and that this diversity was shaped by multiple entries into the Sydney population with only a single CV-A6 lineage exhibiting in situ transmission over the entire study period. Genomic-scale analyzes also revealed the existence of novel and historic EV recombinants. Notably, our analysis did not reveal any association between viral phylogeny, including serotype, and patient age, sex, or disease severity (for uncomplicated disease). This study highlights the contribution of EV-A viruses other than EV-A71 to mild EV disease, including HFMD, in Australia, and highlights the need for greater surveillance of these viruses to develop strategies for outbreak preparedness and vaccine design.",,"Cobbin, J.

Until now, identification and characterization of disease-associated ncRNAs has been slow or inaccurate, requiring many years of testing to understand complex RNA and protein gene relationships. High-throughput sequencing now offers the opportunity to characterize miRNAs, siRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and long ncRNAs on a genomic scale, making it faster and easier to clarify how these ncRNAs contribute to the disease state. brings. However, this technology is still relatively new and ncRNA discovery is not a high priority application for modern bioinformatics. Here, we summarize the background concepts and practical approaches for ncRNA analysis using high-throughput sequencing and its relevance to understanding human diseases. As a case study, we focus on the parasitic protists Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, where great evolutionary distance means difficulties in comparing ncRNAs with those from model eukaryotes. A combination of biological, computational and sequencing approaches allowed easier classification of classes of ncRNAs such as snoRNAs, but also helped identify new classes. It is hoped that greater understanding of ncRNA expression and interaction may aid in the development of less drastic treatment for protist-based diseases.",,"Collins, L. J.",2011.0,,,0
400,The recently identified flavivirus Bamaga virus is horizontally transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and interferes with in vitro replication and in vivo transmission of West Nile virus.,"Arthropod-derived flaviviruses such as yellow fever (YFV), Zika and dengue viruses continue to cause significant human diseases globally. These viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes when a female sucks an infected blood meal from a viremic vertebrate host and secretes the virus into a subsequent host. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a recently discovered flavivirus in Culex sitiens subgroup mosquitoes collected from the Cape York Peninsula of Australia. This virus phylogenetically clusters with the YFV group, but is potentially restricted in most vertebrates. However, a high level of replication in an opossum cell line (OC) indicates a potential relationship with marsupials. Vector competence of two members of Cx to determine whether BgV can be transmitted horizontally by mosquitoes. sitiens subgroup, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens was investigated for BgV. Eleven to thirteen days after ingesting an infectious blood meal, infection rates were 11.3% and 18.8% for Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sites respectively. The client transmitted the annulirostris virus at low levels (5.6% had overall BgV-positive saliva); The customer sitiens did not transmit the virus. When mosquitoes were intratoracially injected with BgV, the infection and transmission rates for both species were 100% and 82%, respectively. These results provided the first evidence that BgV can be transmitted horizontally by Cx. annulirostris, the primary vector of pathogenic zoonotic flaviviruses in Australia. We also evaluated whether BgV could interfere with in vitro replication and in vivo infection and transmission of superinfecting pathogenic Culex-associated flaviviruses. BgV significantly reduced the in vitro growth of Murray Valley encephalitis and West Nile (WNV) viruses. Prior infection with BgV by injection did not prevent WNV superinfection of Cx. annulirostris, significantly fewer BgV-infected mosquitoes can transmit WNV than mosquitoes injected with mock-injections. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of flavivirus ecology, modes of transmission by Australian mosquitoes, and mechanisms of superinfection response.",,"Colmant, A. M.

Bacterial readouts are abundant in viromes, but how much role this genetic material plays in aquatic microbiology ecology remains unclear. To this end, we have developed a useful approach for the characterization of viral and microbial communities of aquatic environments, focusing specifically on the identification of microbial genes harbored in viromes. Virus-like particles were isolated from water samples collected along the Lambro River from the spring to the highly urbanized area of Milan. Derived viromes were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing, looking for the presence, relative abundance of bacterial genes, focusing specifically on genes involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes were identified in all virome samples, with a high amount of reads assigned to cellular processes and signaling. Compared with those identified in the microbiome isolated from the same sample, virome data revealed differences in functional categories and their relative abundance. To confirm the role of the aquatic viral population in bacterial gene transfer, water-based mesocosms were disrupted or undisturbed by low dose tetracycline. Results from qPCR experiments revealed variation in abundance of tet genes in the virome and microbiome, highlighting the relevant role of viral populations in microbial gene mobilization.",,"Colombo, S.;Arioli, S.;Neri, E.;Della Scala, G.;Gargari, G.;Mora, D.",2017.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01095,0

Although PEDV was detected, its low abundance indicated that other viruses were involved in the outbreak. Interestingly, one porcine bocavirus and several enteroviruses were most abundant in the sample. We also observed the presence of a gene-spliced porcine enterovirus genome, similar to a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed using resequencing, bioinformatics and proteomic approaches. Moreover, the cleavage sites predicted for insertion indicate that this gene is expressed as a single protein rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported as an important mechanism for generating genetic diversity, but gene insertions are extremely rare in viral families. While such intrafamilial recombinations are rare, our finding suggests that these events may contribute significantly to viral evolution.",,"Conceicao-Neto, N.;Theuns, S.;Cui, T.;Zeller, M.;Yinda, C.

406,"Hepatitis E virus is prevalent in the swine population of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and there is evidence of homogeneity with Chinese Genotype 4 human isolates.","The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotypic range of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the pig population of the northern Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). We collected 181 fecal samples from 6-month-old domestic-breed pigs, and feces were stored in RNA stabilization buffer due to cold chain and transport limitations. Twenty-one (11.6%) pigs had detectable HEV RNA and 43.5% of backyard pig herds were infected. Based on a 240 base pair nucleotide sequence surrounding the junction of open reading frames 1, 2 and 3 (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3), isolates were phylogenetically classified into genotype 4. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed distinct genetic groups of Lao HEV isolates and the two isolates. Clustered groups with human and porcine HEV isolates from China.

407,Hepaciviruses quite different from African cattle,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV; Hepacivirus genus) is a highly relevant human pathogen. Unique hepaciviruses (HV) have recently been discovered in animal hosts. No direct ancestor of HCV has been found, but the genetically closest animal HVs are found in horses. To investigate whether other peridomestic animals also carry HVs, we analyzed serum from Ghanaian cattle for HVs by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Nine of 106 samples from different sampling sites contained HV RNA (8.5%) at median viral loads of 1.6×105 copies/ml. Infection seemed unrelated to cattle age and sex. Nearly complete genome sequencing of five representative viruses confirmed the taxonomic classifications. Bovine HVs formed two distinct phylogenetic lineages that differed up to 17.7% at the nucleotide level in the polyprotein-coding region, suggesting co-occurrence of different virus subtypes. A conserved microRNA122-binding site at the 5' internal ribosomal entry site suggested liver tropism of bovine HVs. Phylogenetic analyzes suggested the circulation of HVs in cattle for several centuries. Bovine HVs were genetically quite different from all other HVs, including HCV. HVs from genetically related equine and bovine hosts were not monophyletic, confirming host changes during evolution of the Hepacivirus genus. Similar to equine HVs, the genetic diversity of bovine HVs was low compared to HCV genotypes. This demonstrates the impact of the human-modified ecology of peridomestic animals on virus diversity. Further studies should explore the occurrence of cattle HVs in other geographic areas and breeds, virus pathogenicity in cattle, and potential exposure of human risk groups such as farmers, butchers and slaughterhouse workers.",,"Corman, V.

409,Heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies are produced by people vaccinated with the seasonal flu vaccine.,"The target of neutralizing antibodies that protect against influenza virus infection is the viral protein HA. Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for several antigenically related isolates of a given subtype. However, although heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have been recently isolated from phage display libraries, it is unknown whether such antibodies are produced during an immune response to influenza virus infection or vaccine. We report here that following vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing H1 and H3 influenza virus subtypes, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bind and neutralize viruses belonging to various HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9), including pandemic A/California/07/09 H1N1. isolate. mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. Except for one mAb that binds to the HA spherical head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bind to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA root region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with influenza viruses representing different subtypes. These findings suggest that seasonal influenza vaccine can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with swine-derived pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.",,"Corti, D.;Suguitan Jr, A.

Six groups of five animals received a lethal suspension of various virus strains at a concentration of 103 TCID50/mL, and goats were observed for 15 days after infection. Ivory Coast 89 (CI89), Guinea Conakry and Bissau Guinea PPRV strains caused a peracute disease; The India-Calcutta strain caused acute illness; The Sudan-Sennar strain produced acute to mild illness, while the Nigeria 75/1 wild-type strain induced mild illness and the animals recovered.

A portion of the 5""² untranslated region and the 5"" end of the gp53 (E2) coding sequence were amplified and sequenced by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the field isolates were separated into Ib or II genotypes. Of the 28 field isolates, only one belonged to genotype Ia. Interestingly, some type I strains were equally different from type Ia and Ib strains and clustered into additional subtypes within genotype I. Immune sera from young calves experimentally inoculated with field isolates first identified on the basis of their sequence were used in two-way neutralization experiments. . The results clearly differentiated type I from type II strains, although some degree of cross-neutralization was observed. Within type I, the new clusters were not antigenically distinguishable from the more common type Ib strains or type Ia NADL strains, suggesting that the BVDV genotype I is antigenically homogeneous. The isolation of BVDV type I and II strains from cell lines and a bovine vaccine demonstrates that molecular epidemiology surveillance for BVDV is warranted.

412,Animal genomics in natural reservoirs of infectious diseases,"Natural reservoirs of viruses, such as wild bats, birds, rodents, and non-human primates, are often non-model organisms and, until recently, offer limited opportunities for in-depth study. Next-generation sequencing provides a way to partially circumvent this limitation, as the methods required for data collection and analysis are largely species-independent. Comparative genomics and other ""omics"" provide new opportunities to study the structure and function of diverse biological systems of wild species that would otherwise be inaccessible. The genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help identify dominant pathways of virus-host interaction and reveal differences between susceptible and resistant organisms, populations, and species. This is of great scientific interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments for viral diseases in humans and livestock. In this way, we will 'learn from nature' and one day apply this knowledge to create disease-resistant livestock or to develop new treatment and prevention strategies. Reservoir host genomics will also open up the possibilities for developing new vaccines for wildlife, helping to develop new diagnostic platforms, and having broad implications for developmental and evolutionary biology. In this review, the authors focus on the natural reservoir hosts of viral pathogens, although most of the discussion points are equally applicable to natural reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria, fungi or other parasites.",,"Cowled, C.;Wang, L.

413,pseudovirus infection in Oklahoma beagle dogs,"Pseudorabies are caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although pigs are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a wide host range and can cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States achieved PRV-free status in 2004 after the virus was eradicated from domestic pig herders, but the virus is still present in wild pig populations. The present report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs used to hunt wild boars. The dogs developed clinical signs including facial abrasions, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhoea, ataxia, muscle stiffness and facial itching with death. Two were euthanized and one died approximately 48 hours after the onset of clinical signs. Significant histological changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neurophagia and suspicious intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissues from 2 dogs, and immunohistochemistry detected the virus in the third dog. Virus sequencing and phylogeny based on available GenBank sequences revealed that the virus is a field strain, possibly closely related to a cluster of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Despite being eradicated from domestic pigs in the United States, PRV is present in wild pig populations and therefore should continue to be considered a possible cause of disease in dogs and other pets with compatible clinical histories and signs.

To understand the relationship between H5N1 viruses circulating in poultry and viruses isolated from humans, extensive phylogenetic and molecular analyzes of viruses collected from both hosts in Vietnam between 2003 and 2010 were performed. We examined the temporal and spatial distribution of human cases relative to H5N1 poultry outbreaks and characterized amino acid substitutions in each gene segment identified in humans relative to closely related viruses from avian hosts. Six emagglutinin sequences and 8 genotypes were identified in humans, and all were originally identified in poultry.

417,Major molecular aspects of human coronaviruses and their homology with animal coronavirus strains,"After the discovery of several new human respiratory pathogens in 1965, a group of viruses known since 1937 but not called coronaviruses began to emerge. It has been noted that some newly identified human respiratory viruses, designated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and OC43 and 229E, have similar appearances. These viruses exhibited a characteristic fringe of large, distinctive, petal-shaped peplomers or spikes resembling a crown. They were named 'coronavirus' after this feature. Shortly thereafter, several new viruses were added to the group of coronaviruses that cause disease in pigs, rats, turkeys, dogs, cats, and cattle. The diversity of infected animal species and the multitude of organ systems involved have made Coronaviridae one of the most important viral families in veterinary medicine. The two human coronaviruses (HCV), HCV-OC43 and HCV-229E, belong to different antigenic groups. HCV-OC43 shares antigenic correlation with neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus (NCDCV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and MHV. HCV-229E is antigenically associated with porcine infectious gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCV). As a group, coronaviruses contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 27 to 31 kb with an estimated molecular weight of 6 x 106 to 8 x 106 daltons. In infected cells, the viral RNA genome is first transcribed into a full-length negative-strand RNA, which is transcribed into a positive-sense genomic RNA and six to eight subgenomic mRNAs by a leader-prime transcription mechanism.",,"Cristallo, A.;Gambaro, F.;Battaglia, M.;Cereda, P.

The strain was tested for resistance to representative viruses of subgroups A, B and transiently identified C both on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture. The divergence rates of resistance to subgroup A and B viruses were consistent with the previously proposed hypothesis that single autosomal recessive genes control resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection on CAM and replicated plate infection in tissue culture with subgroups A and B viruses showed that resistance to subgroups A and B was independently inherited. Tests with viruses provisionally classified as subgroup C showed that they consisted largely of a mixture of subgroup A and B viruses, or particles with both host range specificity. However, virus stocks of subgroup C category, as well as some stocks classified as subgroup B, produced few pocks or foci on individuals known to be resistant to subgroup A and B viruses.

However, the evolution and pathogenicity of the H3 avian influenza virus (AIV) circulating in domestic birds in China remains largely unclear. In this study, seven H3 AIVs (four H3N2 and three H3N8) were isolated from poultry in the live poultry market (LPM) in China. Phylogenetic analyzes of the whole genomes showed that all viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage, except that the N8 genes of the two H3N8 isolates fell into the North American lineage. Surprisingly, the N8 gene of one H3N8 and two H3N2 isolates PB2, PB1, NP and NS has close association with that of the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses circulating in Korea and the United States, contributing to the internal genes of H3-like AIV. thinks it can be found. highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses. The phylogenetic tree and antigenic cross-reactivity results of the HA gene indicated that two antigenically different H3 viruses were circulating in LPM in China.

420,"Phylogeny, Pathogenicity and Transmission of H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses in Chickens","We analyzed five H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from different birds in China in 2012. Based on the whole genome sequences, we divided the viruses into four genotypes. The DKE26, GSE43 and DKE53 viruses belonged to Genotypes 1–3, respectively. CKE93 and CKE96 viruses were classified into Genotype 4. Genotype 1–3 corresponds to viruses containing the HA gene of section 2.3.2 and Genotype 4 is the virus carrying the HA gene of section 7.2. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of viruses, we infected chickens with 103 EID50 /0.1 ml GSE43 (clan 2.3.2) or CKE93 (c. 7.2) virus. Our results revealed that 6 of 7 specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens inoculated with GSE43 virus died 7 days before infection, but all SPF chickens inoculated with CKE93 virus survived infection. Both GSE43 and CKE93 viruses proliferated systemically in chickens. Virus titers of GSE43 virus in the tested organs were clearly higher than those of CKE93 virus. Our results revealed that the pathogenicity and replication of GSE43 in chickens was much higher than that of CKE93. GSE43 virus can be transmitted between chickens, but CKE93 cannot be transmitted between chickens by pure contact. Thus, different H5N1 AIV strains had variable pathogenicity and transmission abilities among chickens.

Since April 2010, the DTMUV epidemic in southeastern provinces of China has caused great economic losses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in viral infection through binding to host target genes or viral genomes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interaction, we here describe miRNA expression profiles in DTMUV-infected and uninfected DEF cells by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 287 known and 63 new miRNAs were identified. 48 miRNAs, including 26 known miRNAs and 22 novel miRNAs, were differentially expressed in response to DTMUV infection. Among these miRNAs, 37 miRNAs were up-regulated and 11 miRNAs were down-regulated. 9 miRNAs were randomly selected for validation by qRT-PCR experiment. The results of the qRT-PCR experiment were consistent with the sequencing data. GO enrichment showed that the predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in the regulation of the immune system, cellular process and metabolic process. KEGG pathways analysis revealed that predicted target genes are involved in various signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. This is the first study to evaluate changes in miRNA expression in DEF cells upon DTMUV infection.

424,Sensitive surveillance for viral respiratory pathogens: virome capture sequencing for detection and genomic characterization of severe acute respiratory infection in Uganda.,"Background: Vulnerable public health is a new set of methods for targeting disease prevention and mitigation interventions to high-risk subpopulations. We implemented a syndromic surveillance-sensitive public health strategy for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Uganda, combining spatio-temporal analytics with genomic sequencing to detect and characterize potentially epidemic viral respiratory pathogens. Methods: Using a national surveillance network, we identified patients with unexplained, influenza-negative SARI between 2010 and 2015. Spatio-temporal analyzes were performed retrospectively to identify unexplained SARI clusters. Within clusters, respiratory viruses were detected and characterized in naso and oropharyngeal swab samples using a novel oligonucleotide probe capture (VirCapSeq-VERT) and high-throughput sequencing platform. The linkage with conventional epidemiological strategies further characterized the transmission dynamics of the pathogens identified. Results: Of the 2,901 unexplained SARI cases, 9 were identified, constituting 301 (10.4%) cases. Clusters were more likely to occur in urban areas and during the biennial rainy season. Within the detected clusters, we identified an unrecognized outbreak of measles-related SARI; sequence analysis included co-circulation of endemic genotype B3 and genotype D4, possibly imported from England. We also identified a possible cluster of hospital SARIs associated with a novel picobirnavirus most closely related to swine and dromedary viruses. Conclusions: Using a sensitive approach to public health surveillance, we detected and characterized the genomics of vaccine-preventable and zoonotic respiratory viruses associated with clusters of severe respiratory infections in Uganda. Future studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility, scalability, and impact of implementing similar approaches during real-time public health surveillance in low-income settings.",,"Cummings, M.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two major divisions have occurred throughout the history of NDV, resulting in three genome size categories. An ancient split in the primitive reservoir (wild waterfowl species) gave rise to two basal sister clades, class I and II, with genomes of 15,198 (due to the 12-nucleotide insert in the phosphoprotein gene) and 15,186 nucleotides, respectively. Only the ancestors of class II viruses colonized chicken populations and later evolved into virulent forms. These occurred multiple times, resulting in an early lineage [including genotypes I-IV and H33(W)] with a genome size of 15,186 nucleotides. A second division occurred in the secondary (chicken) host in the 20th century. This resulted in the branching of a branch (including the last genotypes V-VIII, consisting of pathogenic viruses only) with the simultaneous insertion of six nucleotides into the 5'2 non-coding region of the nucleoprotein gene, thereby further increasing the genome size. 15,192 nucleotides.

In this communication, we provide a detailed characterization of the type of virus causing it. Based on the different epitope configurations detected by the various monoclonal antibodies, the isolate can be distinguished from other OPV strains and is classified as a cowpox virus (CP). This classification was validated by constructing a species-specific PCR assay and physical maps for the restriction enzymes HindIII and XhoI.

429,Outbreaks of zoonotic vaccinia virus in Brazil,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as a live vaccine during the WHO-led smallpox eradication campaign in the second half of the 20th century. The program ended with the eradication of the disease, one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. Interestingly, one of the key factors in the successful vaccination campaign - VACV itself - is poorly understood regarding its natural reservoirs, evolutionary history and origins, often considered extinct as a naturally occurring virus. However, orthopox viruses other than variola virus are known to have been circulating in Brazil since the early 1960s. More specifically, VACV has been associated with naturally acquired infections in humans, cattle, and possibly other reservoirs since 1999, when cattle vaccine outbreaks began to be identified consistently from year to year. In this article, we list and discuss the most important VACV outbreaks that have occurred in Brazil over the past 20 years.

Here we report the complete genome sequence of a novel type of BPV (BPV 04AC14) derived from a papillomatous lesion. The genome is 7,282 bp long and exhibits the classical genetic organization and motifs of Papillomaviridae members. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyzes revealed that BPV 04AC14 clustered with members of the genus Xipapillomavirus.

At the start of the epidemic, little was known about the morphology of Zika virus, its genome structure, its routes of transmission, and its potential to cause neurological malformations and disorders. With the advancement of basic science, discoveries of the mechanisms of strain variability, viral transfer to the fetus, and neurovirulence have been published. These will certainly lead to the development of strategies to block vertical viral transmission, neuronal invasion and pathogenesis in the near future. This article reviews the current literature on Zika virus infections to provide a holistic view of its etiology and pathogenesis.

432,A Case of Fatal Augmentation Disease in a Dog: Immunolocalization of the Virus and Complete Genome Sequencing,"Louping-ill (LI), caused by the Louping-ill virus (LIV), causes an often fatal encephalitis, affecting mainly sheep and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), but is also seen in other species. An adult male Border collie dog was definitively diagnosed with lethal LI, and the lesion profile, LIV antigen distribution, and the complete genome sequence of the responsible LIV were investigated to determine whether it differed significantly from sheep-derived LIV. No gross lesion was present. Histological lesions were limited to the central nervous system and consisted of lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, glial foci, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. Immunlocalization of the viral antigen showed that it is present only in small amounts in neurons. These histological and immunohistochemical findings were similar to those reported in affected sheep. Compared with published whole genome sequences of sheep-derived LIV, only minor differences were present and phylogenetically, the virus clustered individually between a subsection containing Scottish strains, LIV 369/T2 and G, and another subsection containing a British isolate LIV A. . shares a common progenitor with LIV A from the dog. These findings indicate that there is no dog-specific LIV strain, dogs are susceptible to sheep-associated LI strains, and there is an increased prevalence of ticks and thus exposure to LIV is safe. Dogs may require effective vaccination.",,"Dagleish, M. P.;Clark, J. J.;Robson, C.;Tucker, M.;Orton, R. J.;Rocchi, M. S.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.09.004,0
433,Evolutionary analysis of Tembusu virus: Evidence for emergence of a dominant genotype,"We recently identified Tembusu virus (TMUV) as the causative agent of the duck contagious disease that has spread in China since 2010. A recent study has shown a potential case of human infection by TMUV, citing the evolution of TMUV in particular. Since no information is available regarding the evolution of TMUV, we performed extensive phylogenetic analyzes using TMUV's largest collection of full open reading frame (ORF) sequences. Our results showed that two virus strains were associated with the 2010 outbreak in China, and lineage II, specifically sublineage II-c, emerged as the dominant lineage currently circulating. We conclude that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of this TMUV emerged around 1996. Evidence of natural recombination was also detected in TMUV. Molecular adaptation analyzes revealed that strong negative selection shaped the evolution of TMUV, while a set of codons exposed to positive pressure were also identified. Our work has revealed, for the first time, the evolutionary history and character of TMUV and will be helpful for vaccine and diagnostic development.",,"Dai, L.;Li, Z.;Tao, P.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.004,0
434,Next-generation sequencing strategies to characterize the turkey genome,"The Hindi genome sequencing project was launched in 2008 and was mainly based on next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In our initial studies, we used a synergistic combination of 2 NGS platforms (Roche/454 and Illumina GAII), detailed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) maps, and unique assembly tools to sequence and assemble the genome of the domesticated turkey, Meleagris gallopavo. Since the initial release in 2010, efforts have continued to improve genome assembly, gene annotation, and genomic analysis. The first assembly construct (2.01) represented approximately 89% of the genome sequence with 17X depth of coverage (931 Mb). Sequence contigs were assigned to 30 of 40 chromosomes and approximately 10% of the assembled sequence corresponded to unassigned chromosomes (ChrUn). The array has been refined through both genome-wide and domain-focused sequencing, including shotgun and double-ended sequencing, and targeted sequencing of chromosomal regions with low or missing coverage. These additional efforts improved the sequence assembly and resulted in 2 sequential genome constructs with higher genome coverage (25X/Build3.0 and 30X/Build4.0) with a total available sequence of 1,010 Mb. Also, BAC with end sequences assigned to Z/W and MG18 (MHC) chromosomes, ChrUn, or not inserted into the previous construct were isolated, deeply sequenced (Hi-Seq) and included in the final construct (5.0). A comprehensive set of RNA samples was collected from female and male turkeys at various developmental stages to aid in the explanation and to construct a gene expression atlas of major tissues. Transcriptome sequencing data (using Illumina Hi-Seq) will provide information to improve the final assembly and ultimately improve sequence annotation. The most recent sequence covers more than 95% of the turkey genome and should provide a much more advanced gene level annotation, making it a valuable resource for studying genetic variation underlying economically important traits in poultry.",,"Dalloul, R.

435,Characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolates from outbreak cases in commercial chickens and wild pigeons in Ethiopia.,"Newcastle disease (ND), caused by virulent avian paramyxovirus type 1, is one of the most important diseases responsible for devastating epidemics in poultry flocks in Ethiopia. However, little is known about the genetic characteristics of Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) circulating in commercial chickens and wild birds. In this study, we characterized isolates from poultry farms (n = 8) and wild pigeons (n = 4) from outbreaks suspected of ND between 2012 and 2014. NDVs isolated from pathological specimens by grafting into embryonated chicken eggs were biologically characterized by conventional intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPI) and genetically based on Phylogenetic analysis of partial F-gene sequences (260 bp) spanning the cleavage site. The ICPI values of isolates obtained from chickens ranged from 0.9 to 1.8; whereas the ICPI of pigeon isolates was 1.4. All isolates contained multiple basic amino acids in the inferred cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is typical of virulent viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial cleavage region of the F-gene (260 bp) showed that all virus sequences from pigeons were identical and clustered in the VIh genotype, while virus sequences from chickens clustered together in the VIf genotype. The similarity between viruses obtained from chickens and viruses obtained from pigeons varies between 82.5% and 85.6%. This indicates that different subgenotypes of genotype VI are circulating in the chicken and wild pigeon population in Ethiopia. This warrants further work to understand the role of wild birds in NDV epidemiology in Ethiopia and highlights the importance of continued surveillance in both wild poultry and domestic poultry.",,"Damena, D.;Fusaro, A.;Sombo, M.;Belaineh, R.;Heidari, A.;Kebede, A.;Kidane, M.;Chaka, H.",2016.0,,,0

A specific PCR method was developed for the detection of Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) and this method has proven to be suitable for diagnostic purposes. PCR scanning of organ samples from pigs suspected of being affected by PMWS or PDNS revealed the presence of PCV-2 in 80% of cases. Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates were fully sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison with all available PCV-2 sequences showed that swine circoviruses circulating in Hungary are more variable than in many other European countries. The two Hungarian strains clustered together with the Spanish strains forming a separate group; the other two fell into a common group with the French, UK and Dutch strains, while the other two strains showed the closest association with two of the three known German PCV-2 sequences.",,"DÃ¡n, Ã;MolnÃ¡r, T.;Biksi, I.;GlÃ¡vits, R.;Shaheim, M.;Harrach, B.",2003.0,,10.1556/AVet.51.2003.4.13,0

439,Development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of parapoxviruses,"Parapoxviruses (PaPVs) cause widespread infections in ruminant animals worldwide. All PaPVs are zoonotic and can infect humans after direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Here we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of PaPVs. The new assay (referred to as the RVSS assay) was specific for PaPVs only and had no cross-reactivity to other pox viruses. Using a recombinant plasmid as a positive control, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined as 16 genome PaPV copies per assay. Amplification efficiency estimate (91-99%), inter-assay and inter-assay variability estimation (standard deviation [SD]: 0.28-1.06 and 0.01-0.14, respectively), and operator variability estimate (SD: 0.78 between labs and 0.28 between operators in a lab) ) was within the acceptable range. Diagnostic specificity was evaluated on 100 samples from healthy normal animals, and all but 1 tested negative (99%). Diagnostic susceptibility (DSe) was evaluated in 77 clinical specimens (skin/shell) from infected sheep, goats and cattle and all tested positive (100%). The assay was multiplexed with beta-actin as an internal positive control and the multiplex assay displayed the same DSe as the single assay. Further characterization of PaPV samples by nucleotide sequencing of PCR products following species-specific real-time PCR and conventional PCR revealed the presence of Orf virus not only in sheep and goats, but also in 1 bovine animal. Validated RVSS testing demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and robustness, which are critical for laboratory detection of PaPVs.",,"Das, A.;Ward, G.;Lowe, A.;Xu, L.;Moran, K.;Renshaw, R.;Dubovi, E.;Reising, M.;Jia, W.",2017.0,,10.1177/1040638716680676,0

Six possible new PV types that could not be detected by widely used PCR protocols were identified. Overall L1 nucleotide identities were less than 90% compared to the PV strains and strains described. L1 nucleotide BLAST sequence hits indicated that each new strain was associated with Beta, Gamma, Dyokappa, Dyoeta and Xipapillomavirus, as well as two possible new unclassified genera. Our results show that the use of NGS is relevant for the detection and characterization of distantly related PV and is of great importance in coinfection studies.

448,Comparative analysis of gut bacterial and RNA viral communities from sentinels housed in selected broiler farms,"There is great interest in characterizing the complex microbial communities in poultry guts and understanding the effects of these dynamic communities on microbes of importance to poultry performance, disease status, animal welfare and human health. Research characterizing avian enteric virus has identified novel avian viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems are not yet fully defined. The complex bacterial community in the poultry gut influences gut development, immune status and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. Current metagenomic research was conducted to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen-free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-contact gut microbiome with the altered microbiome following contact with field-raised poultry. Analysis of intestinal virus from contact birds (""series"") placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae and Astroviridae absent or in proportionally lower numbers in pre-contact birds. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in post-contact birds, particularly by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae are well characterized and have historically been implicated in poultry enteric disease; Members of Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have been described in birds and the avian gut only relatively recently, and their role in recognized disease syndromes and bird performance in general has not been established.

It is clear that the avian gut viral community is minimally characterized and not fully understood. Research on the microbiome of the avian gut has provided some insight into the geographic distribution and rapidly evolving taxonomy of avian enteric picornaviruses. The present research was undertaken to produce a comparative metagenomic analysis of intestinal virus from a healthy flock of turkeys from a field placed flock. This research revealed a series of enteric picornaviruses found in commercial birds in the field that are not completely absent in the healthy flock. A novel molecular diagnostic assay was used to monitor shedding of field strains of turkey enteric picornavirus in commercial flocks inoculated with picornavirus-positive intestinal homogenates prepared from turkeys with moderate enteric disease. The spread of this new enteric picornavirus in commercial poultry resulted in a significant reduction in weight gain, suggesting that this common resident in the turkey intestine may cause performance problems or intestinal disease in the field.",,"Day, J.

The genomes of these five viruses share similar genome structure with other cycloviruses, with a circular ~1.7 kb genome and two main bidirectionally transcribed ORFs. Genomic sequence data collected during this study were combined with all cyclovirus genomes available in public databases to identify conserved motifs and regulatory elements in intergenetic regions, as well as to identify diversity and recombinant regions within their genomes. The genomes reported here represent four different strains of cyclovirus, three of which are novel. Our results confirm that cycloviruses circulate widely in winged insect populations; Of the eight different cyclovirus species detected in dragonflies to date, some show a wide geographic distribution. Recombination analysis revealed both interspecies and interspecies recombination events among cycloviruses, including genomes from different sources (eg goat meat and human feces). Similar to other well-characterized circular ssDNA viruses, recombination may play an important role in cyclovirus evolution. © 2013 SGM.",,"Dayaram, A.;Potter, K. A.;Moline, A. B.;Rosenstein, D.

453,"Detection of hepatitis E virus in liver, mesenteric lymph node, serum, bile and feces of naturally infected pigs affected by different pathological conditions","The aim of this study is to detect hepatitis E virus (HEV) in different samples from naturally infected pigs and to genetically characterize the detected strains. Serum, bile, liver, lymph nodes, and feces were collected from 69 animals, 1 week to 4 months old, with different pathological conditions. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the histopathology of HEV and tissues. Positive RT-PCR samples were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. HEV was detected in at least one sample in 26 (37.7%) of 69 animals. Bile was the most common positive sample, followed by mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, faeces, and serum. HEV was detected in 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 11) month old pigs. A total of 22 (31.9%) of 69 pigs had mild to moderate hepatitis, and 15 of these were HEV RT-PCR positive in at least one of the samples tested. live pigs such as liver, mesenteric lymph node and bile. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that all identified Spanish swine HEV strains belonged to genotype III. Therefore, genotype III strains are present in a relatively high proportion of pigs 1 to 3 months old. Through this study, it cannot be ruled out whether concomitant infections will affect HEV distribution in infected pigs.

454,"Recently, antigenic and molecular heterogeneity in swine flu A(H1N1) virus isolates, with possible implications for vaccination policy.","To investigate the occurrence of antigenic drift in swine flu A(H1N1) viruses and the coupling between epidemic and vaccine strains, 26 virus isolates and previous outbreaks from respiratory disease outbreaks among training pigs in the Netherlands in the 1995/1996 season were studied using serological and molecular methods. In contrast to porcine H3N2 viruses, no significant antigenic shift was observed in porcine H1N1 viruses isolated from the late 1980s to 1996. However, a marked antigenic and genetic heterogeneity was recently detected among the 26 porcine H1N1 virus strains in hemagglutination inhibition tests and nucleotide sequence analyses. Interestingly, the observed antigenic and molecular variants were not randomly distributed between farms. This finding indicates the independent introduction of different swine H1N1 virus variants in the various farms of the study and points to a marked difference in the epidemiologies of human and swine flu viruses. The observed heterogeneity may hinder the control of swine flu by vaccination and indicates that the efficacy of existing swine flu vaccines should be reassessed and the antigenic reactivity of swine flu viruses should be monitored regularly.

455,Evolutionary origin of 2A-like sequences in Totiviridae genomes,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of new species potentially belonging to the Totiviridae family. Many of these new viruses are not yet covered by the Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) official classification. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis involving novel sequences of Totiviridae candidates revealed a clade containing Giardiavirus and a wide variety of novel totiviruses infecting arthropods, protozoa and mollusks. This extended Giardiavirus lineup includes two monophyletic groups, one containing the Giardia lamblia virus (GLV) (GLV-like group) grouped with viruses that infect arthropods and vertebrates, and the other the previously proposed Artivirus group (IMNV-like group). Screening members of the GLV-like group to search for genomic elements already identified in the IMNV-like group revealed the presence of regions with a high affinity for 2 A-like oligopeptides, mainly in a particular subset of arthropod viruses. that these viruses retain their ancestral characteristics. The presence of these ""pseudo2 A-sites"" associated with phylogenetic reconfiguration indicates that these sequences emerged at a decisive stage for viral evolution. If they are changed to functional 2A-like sequences, an irreversible pathway will be initiated to increase genome complexity.",,"de Lima, J. G. S.;Teixeira, D. G.;Freitas, T. T.;Lima, J. P. M.

456,"Akabane, Aino and Schmallenberg virus – where and what do we know about the role of domestic ruminant hosts and Culicoides vectors in virus transmission and overwintering?","Akabane, Aino, and Schmallenberg virus belong to the Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses and depend on Culicoides vectors for spread among ruminant hosts. While infections of adults are mostly asymptomatic or associated with only mild symptoms, transplacental transmission of these viruses to the developing fetus can have significant teratogenic effects. Research focusing mainly on congenital malformations has established a relationship between the developmental stage at which a fetus is infected and the outcome of an Akabane virus infection. Available data suggest that a similar correlation holds for Schmallenberg virus infections, but is not yet completely conclusive. Experimental and field data also show that Akabane virus is definitely more effective in inducing congenital malformations in cattle than Aino and Schmallenberg virus. The mechanism by which these Simbu viruses pass annual periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climatic regions has not been defined. Annual windblown reintroduction of infected sandflies with year-round vector activity from tropical endemic areas has been proposed, as has overwintering in adult perennial sandflies. However, experimental and field data indicate that the role of vertical virus transmission in the ruminant host cannot be excluded as a wintering mechanism at this time. Further studies are needed on the biology of Culicoides and specific groups of transplacentally infected newborn ruminants without gross malformations to elucidate this issue.",,"De Regge, N.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.coviro.2017.10.004,0

Phylogenetic analysis of complete coding regions and p-spacing comparisons showed close association with the French pig strain FR-SHEV3c, which was detected in 2006 (p-distance value 0.101), belonging to HEV-3 but not assigned to any known subtype. The three HEV sequences showed relatively high nucleotide distances (p-distance > 0.129) compared to other identified HEV subtype references and unclassified strains.

458,Bovine papular stomatitis affecting dairy cows and milkers in midwestern Brazil,"Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a parapoxvirus associated with papular and erosive lesions in the mouth, lip and oral mucosa of cattle. The udders of milked cows are sometimes affected and the infection is often transmitted to humans. This report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection affecting cows and including humans in midwestern Brazil. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand-milking farms and affected 20 milking cows. Symptoms included painful reddish papules, ulcers, and scabies proliferative lesions on the nipples with a clinical course of 7-12 days. Affected cows showed severe local pain that did not allow milking to be completed. Histologically, parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with acanthosis, spongiosis and adjacent focal widespread ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were noted in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Staff milking affected cows developed lesions on the hands, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and scabies lesions within 4-7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a series of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene performed on DNA extracted from scabs amplified a 590-bp product that, when sequenced, revealed 99%, 85%, and 84% similarities to BPSV, Pseudocowpox virus, and Orf virus respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the B2L sequence showing that the virus clustered with BPSV isolates.

459,Laboratory decision making during the 1997-1998 classic swine fever epidemic in the Netherlands,"The National Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever (CSF) virus in the Netherlands examined more than two million samples for CSF virus or serum antibody during the 1997-1998 CSF epizootic. The enormous sample size and prevalence of border disease (BD) virus and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus infections in Dutch pig herds required the laboratory to focus diagnostic efforts on generating CSF-specific test results throughout the eradication campaign. Detection of 82% of the 429 outbreaks was achieved using direct immunofluorescence and peroxidase testing (FAT/IPA) in combination with samples (tonsils) from clinically suspected pigs. This suggests that in most outbreaks, pigs have clinical signs recognized by farmers and/or veterinarians that indicate the presence of CSF virus in a herd of pigs. A positive diagnosis of 74% of all tissue samples (tonsils) collected from infected pig farms was made by FAT. More than 140,000 heparinized blood samples were analyzed with virus isolation resulting in the detection of 4.5% of infected flocks. CSF virus was isolated in approximately 29% of all blood samples collected from pigs from infected or suspected farms. Various serological studies, each conducted in a different framework, led to the detection of 13.5% of the total number of epidemics. Detection of CSF virus antibody in serum was performed by semi-automatic blocking ELISA. Approximately 28.5% of the sera that reacted in the ELISA were classified as positive for CSF virus neutralizing antibody and 26.5% were classified as positive for other pestiviruses following virus neutralization test (VNT). We concluded that the two identified CSF laboratory diagnostic methods were decisive in the eradication campaign: the first was FAT for screening diseased pigs; and second, ELISA and VNT when millions of predominantly healthy pigs need to be screened for the presence of CSF serum antibody. However, when examining samples from swine herds with a high prevalence of non-CSF pestiviruses, decision-making can be severely hampered based on the results generated by both methods.",,"De Smit, A.

Diagnosis was based on virus growth characteristics, electron microscopy, and molecular biology techniques. Molecular characterization of the virus was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning and DNA sequencing of conserved orthopoxvirus genes such as vaccine growth factor (VGF), thymidine kinase (TK), and hemagglutinin. We used the VGF-homologous and TK gene nucleotide sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree for comparison with other smallpox viruses. The gene sequences showed 99% homology with the vaccinia virus genes and clustered together with the virus isolated in the phylogenetic tree. Aracatuba virus is very similar to Cantagalo virus, showing the same signature deletion in the gene.

461,New parvoviruses from wild and domestic animals in Brazil provide new insights into parvovirus distribution and diversity,"Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds, and cattle in the states of Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, thereby classifying them into eight parvovirus species (six of which had not been previously described) representing six different genera in the Parvovirinae subfamily. Our findings expand the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three known parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus). Furthermore, our research provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates and reveals that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sublineages that circulate widely throughout the world within certain taxonomic host groups.",,"De Souza, W.

463,Neurological Clinical Symptoms in Cattle with Astrovirus-Associated Encephalitis,"Background: Evidence for neurotropic astroviruses has been established using new genetic methods in cattle suffering from a previously unknown viral encephalitis. Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations observed in cattle with astrovirus-associated encephalitis. Animals: Eight cattle (4 cows, 3 heifers and 1 bull from 4 different breeds) admitted to the Ruminant Clinic due to neurological disease and 1 cow examined in the field. Methods: Cases were selected on the basis of neuropathological diagnosis of nonsuppurative encephalitis, positive in situ hybridization result for astrovirus, and availability of physical and neurological evaluation results. If available, laboratory results were evaluated. Results: The most common clinical symptoms were decreased environmental awareness (7), cranial nerve dysfunction (5), and lying on the back (5). The cow seen in the field was the only animal with serious behavioral changes. The number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased in 4 animals and the protein concentration increased in 3 of the 5 samples. In 1 case, the presence of astrovirus in a CSF sample could be identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Other laboratory abnormalities were nonspecific. Conclusions and Clinical Significance: Astrovirus infection may be an important differential diagnosis in cattle with clinical signs of brain disease and should be considered after other causes have been excluded.

464,Swine vesicle disease: characteristics of the virus strain France 1/73,"France 1/73 swine vesicular disease strain has the biological and physicochemical characteristics of an Enterovirus. Single cycle growth in the IBR'S2 cell can be detected in as little as 2 hours 30 minutes and the maximum is reached in 5 hours. Replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. A specific green fluorescence in the cytoplasm can be demonstrated within four hours of infection by fluorescent immunofluorescence. The virions obtained by this cell system were concentrated with PEG and analyzed by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient. Thus, the two particle populations are separated. The first one has a sedimentation coefficient of 150S and the other 75S. After isopicnic centrifugation, a density of 1.34 g/cm3 is attributed to the heavier particles and 1.30 g/cm3 to the lighter particles. Electron microscopic examination shows that the particles have a diameter between 30 and 32 nm. The stain penetrates all particles with a density of 1.30 g/cm3 and corresponds to empty capsids. An effective specific antiserum has been prepared in pigs with these viral antigens. It can be used for all serological reactions. Therefore, it is used for differential diagnosis with complement fixation tests (classical reaction at 37°C) using vesicular fluid from sick pigs. An inactivated oil adjuvant vaccine was also prepared. The rate of protection of vaccinated animals is between 75% and 100% with a probability of 95%.",,"Delagneau, J.

Data were generated using the MiSeq 2Â Ã—Â 250Â bp and HiSeq 2Â Ã—Â 150Â bp Illumina sequencing platforms for 16S amplicon and WGSM sequencing, respectively. Each approach revealed a distinct microbial community profile, with Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter as the dominant genera for the WGSM dataset and Clostridium and Methanosaeta for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon dataset. Virome characterization revealed the existence of two viral families with Bacteria and Archaea, Myoviridae and Siphoviridae as hosts. A wide functional diversity was found, with a predominance of genes involved in acetone, butanol, and ethanol synthesis; and one-carbon metabolism (eg, methanogenesis). Genes related to acetotropic methanogenesis pathways were more abundant than methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic, confirming the taxonomic results showing the prevalence of the acetotropic genus Methanosaeta. Furthermore, the dataset showed several metabolic genes involved in the sulfur, nitrogen, iron and phosphorus cycles, and that many species can act on all cycles.

469,Physico-chemical characterization of bovine transient fever virus as a member of the Rhabdoviridae family,"This study of the physico-chemical properties of bovine ephemeral fever virus was initiated to determine whether it could be classified as a rhabdovirus. In contrast to the normal bullet-shaped morphology of some rhabdoviruses, virus particles are usually cone-shaped or lighter variants than bullet-shaped. Virion contains six proteins with single-stranded RNA and moles that precipitate at 42S. wt. 164, 101, 64, 53, 43 and 29 x 103. Protein P101 is located on the surface of the virus and is glycosylated. It is removed by treatment of virus particles with trypsin. The nucleoprotein, protein P64, has been found to be a phosphoprotein like N protein of rabies virus, whereas NS in vesicular stomatitis virus is phosphorylated protein. The virus harvest contains imperfect interfering particles. The particles are cone-shaped forms as short as about one-third the length of the infectious virion and resemble imperfectly interfering particles of vesicular stomatitis virus in morphology. These particles interfere with the replication of bovine transient fever virus, but not the serotype of Indiana vesicular stomatitis virus. They contain single-stranded RNA that collapses at 18 to 20S. The particles appear to have the same protein composition as that found in the virus particle. The physico-chemical properties of the bovine transient fever virus justify its inclusion in the Rhabdoviridae family. The protein composition differs in detail from that found for vesicular stomatitis and rabies viruses, but is similar to that found for Obodhiang and kotonkan, two rabies serogroup viruses isolated from insects in Africa.",,"Della-Porta, A.

472,Monitoring the immune response to vaccination with an inactivated vaccine associated with bovine neonatal pancytopenia by deep sequencing transcriptome analysis in cattle.,"Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a novel fatal, alloimmune/alloantibody-mediated disease of newborn calves induced by ingestion of colostrum from cows vaccinated with a specific vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV). The hypothesis of pathogenic MHC class I molecules in the vaccine has been put forward, but no formal proof of specific causal MHC class I alleles has yet been provided. However, the unique properties of the vaccine result in extremely high titers of specific antibodies in vaccinated animals, but are also found in other molecules that apparently induce BNP. Therefore, a comprehensive picture of the immune response to the vaccine is so important. Applying the new approach of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq), our study provides a new holistic, comprehensive analysis of blood transcriptome regulation after vaccination with the specific BVDV vaccine. Our RNAseq approach identified a novel cytokine-like gene in the bovine genome that was greatly upregulated after vaccination. This gene has not been previously identified in any other species and may be specific to the immune response of ruminants. Furthermore, our data elicited a multi-coordinated immune response against double-stranded (ds) RNA or a dsRNA analog after vaccination with an inactivated single-stranded (ss) RNA vaccine. This suggests either significant contamination of the vaccine with dsRNA from host cells after virus culture, or a dsRNA analog administered to the vaccine. The first option will highlight the potential risks associated with virus culture on homologous cells during vaccine production; The second option will highlight the potential risks associated with immunostimulating adjuvants used in vaccine production.",,"Demasius, W.;Weikard, R.;Hadlich, F.;Muller, K.

To determine the chicken skin virome in comparison with the human skin virome, a chicken swab sample from fifteen healthy indoor chickens with five genetic backgrounds was examined for the presence of DNA viruses by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The results show a predominance of herpes viruses of the genus Mardivirus, either from vaccine-induced or possibly asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS method used here to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any papillomavirus, polyomavirus or circovirus, indicating that these viruses may not be resident in chicken skin.

477,Transmission of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic viruses in Australian pigs,"Background Pigs have receptors for both human and avian influenza viruses and are a natural host for influenza A viruses. The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus, derived from avian, human and swine flu viruses, has infected pigs in several countries. Objectives To investigate the relationship between H1N1pdm viruses isolated from swine outbreaks in Australia and human samples associated with one of the outbreaks by phylogenetic analysis and to determine whether any reclassification events occurred during human-swine interspecies transmission. Methods Real-time RT-PCR and whole genome sequencing were performed on RNA isolated from nasal swabs and/or virus cultures. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Geneious package. Outcomes Influenza H1N1pdm outbreaks were detected in three pig farms in three different states in Australia. Further analysis of the Queensland outbreak led to the identification of two different types of viruses in pigs. Two staff members working on the same pig farm were also infected with the same two strains found in pigs. Whole genome sequence analysis on viruses isolated from pigs and humans did not identify reclassifications of these H1N1pdm viruses to seasonal or avian influenza A viruses. Conclusions This is the first report of infected with swine flu in Australia and marks the end of the flu-free era for the Australian swine industry. Although no reclassifications were detected in these cases, the ability of these viruses to pass between pigs and humans highlights the importance of monitoring the pig for new influenza infections.

478,Porcine virome and xenotransplantation,"The composition of swine virus includes viruses that infect pig cells, ancient virus-derived elements, including endogenous retroviruses inserted into pig chromosomes, and bacteriophages that infect a wide array of bacteria living in pigs. Viruses that infect pigs, among them viruses that also infect human cells, as well as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), are important when assessing the viral safety of xenotransplantation. Bacteriophages mainly associated with bacteria found in the gut are not important in this context. Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs is being developed to alleviate human transplant distress. Here, published data describing viromes in different pigs and their relevance to the virus safety of xenotransplantation are analyzed for the first time. Consequently, analysis of porcine virus has resulted in the identification of a large number of new viruses, although their effects on xenotransplantation are unclear. Most importantly, viruses with known or suspected zoonotic potential were generally not detected by next-generation sequencing, but were uncovered by more sensitive methods.",,"Denner, J.",2017.0,,10.1186/s12985-017-0836-z,0
479,Identification of 6 new strains of Ghanaian G8P human-bovine reassortant rotavirus by next-generation sequencing,"Group of rotaviruses (RVA) is the most important etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age worldwide. The monovalent rotavirus vaccine Rotarix was included in the National Extended Immunization Program (EPI) in Ghana in May 2012. However, there is little genetic and phylogenetic data in pre-vaccine publicity on the complete genomes of circulating human RVAs. The common bovine rotavirus VP7 genotype G8 has been detected sporadically in Ghanaian children, usually in combination with VP4 genotype P[6]. To investigate the genomic constellations and phylogeny of circulating RVA strains prior to vaccine administration, the complete genomes of two unusual G8P[6] strains detected during burden of disease surveillance, GH018-08 and GH019-08, were characterized by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. . Ghanaian isolates, GH018-08 and GH019-08, displayed the unusual, previously unreported genotype constellation G8-P[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H3. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that 10 out of 11 genes of GH018-08 and GH019-08 were identical/nearly identical, significant variation detected only in VP1 genes, and clearly established that multiple independent interspecies transmission and reclassification events occurred between partners. circulating bovine/sheep/goat rotaviruses and human DS-1-like RVA strains.

480,Insights on circovirus host range from the genomic fossil record,"In samples from humans and domestic animals, various DNA sequences derived from circoviruses (Circoviridae family) have been identified, often in association with pathological conditions. However, in the majority of cases, little is known about the natural biology of the viruses from which these sequences are derived. Endogenous cirroviral elements (CVe) are DNA sequences derived from circoviruses that occur in animal genomes and provide a useful source of information about circovirus-host relationships. In this study, we screened the genome assemblies of 675 animal species and identified a large number of circovirus-related sequences, including the first CVe samples derived from cycloviruses. We confirmed the presence of this CVe in the breeding line of the long twig (Pseudomyrmex gracilis), thereby determining that cycloviruses infect insects. We examined the evolutionary relationships between CVe and contemporary circoviruses, showing that CVe from ants and mites is a relatively close group with cycloviruses in phylogeny. Furthermore, the relatively random scattering of cyclovirus sequences from vertebrate samples and CVe from insect genomes suggested that contamination may be an important consideration in studies reporting these viruses. Our study demonstrates how endogenous viral sequences can inform metagenomic-based virus discovery. Additionally, it casts doubt on the role of cycloviruses as pathogens of humans and other vertebrates.",,"Dennis, T. P. W.;Flynn, P. J.;de Souza, W. M.;Singer, J. B.;Moreau, C. S.;Wilson, S.

481,Deep sequencing of viral genomes provides insights into the evolution and pathogenesis of the varicella zoster virus and vaccine in humans.,"Vaccination with the vOka vaccine prevents varicella (chickenpox) in children and susceptible adults. The vOka vaccine strain contains a mix of genotypes and causes rashes in a small number of recipients despite attenuation. Like the wild-type virus, the vaccine delays neuronal tissue and can then be reactivated to cause Herpes zoster (shingles). We purified and sequenced vOka directly from skin lesions using hybridization-based methodologies. We demonstrated that vaccine alleles can be recovered from lesions and that there is a serious bottleneck between vaccination and lesion formation. Genotypes in any given lesion appear to come from one to three vaccine genotypes with a low frequency of new mutations. A single vOka haplotype and new mutations are not consistently present in the rashes; this indicates that neither new mutations nor recombination with wild-type were critical for the evolution of vOka eruptions. Instead, alleles resulting from attenuation (ie not derived from free-living virus) are present at lower frequencies in rash genotypes. We identified 11 loci in which the ancestral allele was selected in vOka rash occurrence and showed that the genotypes in rashes that were reactivated without delay were indistinguishable from rashes that occurred immediately after vaccination. We conclude that, although the VOka vaccine is heterogeneous, it did not evolve to form rashes by positive selection in the half-species mode, but rather allows selection in human subjects for alleles that were essentially neutral at the time of vaccine production, allowing us to identify them. key loci for rash formation.",,"Depledge, D.

VZV is reactivated in approximately one-third of infected individuals, causing herpes zoster, often accompanied by neurological complications. The restricted host range of VZV and the lack of suitable in vitro models until recently have severely hindered molecular studies of VZV latency. However, recent technological advances have facilitated a number of exciting studies culminating in the discovery of a VZV delay-associated transcript (VLT) and provide new insights into our understanding of VZV delay and the factors that can initiate reactivation. Extracting the functions of the VLT and related molecular mechanisms should now be considered a priority to improve our understanding of the factors governing VZV delay and reactivation. In this review, we summarize the implications of recent discoveries in the field of VZV latency from both the virus and host perspective and provide a roadmap for future work.",,"Depledge, D.

483,Deep Sequencing of Distinctive Preparations of Live Attenuated Varicella-Zoster Virus Vaccine Reveals a Conserved Core Attenuating Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms,"UNLABELED: The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and herpes zoster, and many of the mutations that contribute to attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in the skin, are well documented. At least three different vOka preparations are marketed. Here, we demonstrate 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using deep sequencing of seven batches of vOka vaccines (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken). mutations are present in all vaccine series. This includes six regions where the vaccine allele, which we think may be important for attenuation, is fixed or close to fixation. We also show that, despite differences in vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of individual batch-specific mutations. This demonstrates that vaccine production processes do not introduce new mutations and that despite the mix of variants available, VZV live vaccines are extremely stable. IMPORTANT: The continued success of vaccines to prevent chickenpox and shingles, together with the extremely low incidence of adverse reactions, demonstrates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself consists of a heterogeneous population of live attenuated viruses and thus requires deep sequencing technologies to investigate differences and similarities in virus populations between different preparations and vaccine lines. Our data show minimal variation between groups, an important safety feature, and provide new insights into the extent of mutations found in this attenuated virus.",,"Depledge, D.

489,Transcript of the UL28 homolog of bovine herpes virus 1 and expression kinetics of its product,"We report that bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) UL28 ORF, a homologue of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL28 gene, represents a functional gene encoding a viral-specific protein. Located at positions 53 058 - 55 538 of the viral genome, the BHV1 UL28 ORF encodes a 3.4 kb viral-specific transcript detected 6 h post infection (pi), after which its levels accumulated up to 12 h and remained stable up to 24 h pi thereafter. Transcription of BHV1 UL28 was determined to initiate 95 bases upstream from the initiation codon of the ORF, corresponding to 33 nucleotides downstream from a putative TATA box. A BHV1 UL28 specific antiserum produced against a T7-Tag/UL28 fusion protein expressed in E. coli specifically reacted with a 100 kDa protein in Western blots of BHV1 infected protein cell lysates. The expression kinetics of the protein was delayed by 6 hours relative to its transcript, suggesting that the gene is regulated at the translational level. Unlike the HSV and pseudorabies virus UL28 genes, which belong to the viral genes of the early (Î²) class, that of BHV1 is clearly classified as an Î³2 gene. Further studies will be required to determine whether these kinetic differences have any functional significance.

490,Metagenomic comparison of endemic viruses from broilers with runting-stunting syndrome and normal birds,"Worker stunting syndrome (RSS) in broilers is an enteric disease that causes significant economic losses to poultry producers worldwide due to increased feed efficiency, reduced body weight during growth and excessive culling. Of particular interest are RSS-associated viral agents that have been difficult to characterize fully to date. Past research into the etiology of RSS has implicated a wide variety of RNA and DNA viruses, but to date, no single virus has been identified as the main agent of RSS, and the current view is that it may originate from a collection of viruses, collectively known as virome. This article attempts to characterize viral pathogens associated with 2-3 week old RSS affected and unaffected broilers using next generation sequencing and comparative metagenomics. Analysis of viromes identified a total of 20 DNA and RNA viral families, with 2 unidentified categories consisting of 31 different viral genera and 7 unclassified genera. The most abundant viral families identified in this study were Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Coronaviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae. This study identified historically important viruses associated with diseases such as chicken astrovirus, avian nephritis virus, chicken parvovirus and chicken calicivirus, as well as relatively new viruses such as chicken megrivirus and sicinivirus 1, and will help expand knowledge on enteric disease in broiler chickens. chickens provide information on the viral components of a healthy avian gut and identify various enteric viruses and viral communities suitable for further study.",,"Devaney, R.;Trudgett, J.;Trudgett, A.;Meharg, C.;Smyth, V.",2016.0,,,1
491,Enrichment of Viral Nucleic Acids with Sex-Specific Oligonucleotides by Solution Hybrid Selection,"Despite recent advances, our knowledge of potential and rare human pathogens is far from comprehensive. Current molecular diagnostic tools rely mainly on specific amplification of marker sequences and may miss infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; however, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogenic genetic material in clinical specimens, its application is only cost effective in special rather than routine cases. In this work, we present a method for semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in an HTS library by hybridization in solution with strain-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. In addition, enterovirus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Enterovirus) sequences were successfully enriched using the foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to background nucleic acid was approximately 1,000-fold. Because hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide coupling requirements than PCR, a few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover potential sequence variation across the entire genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. The efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes their use in diagnostics cost-effective.",,"Deviatkin, A. A.;Lukashev, A. N.;Markelov, M. M.;Gmyl, L. V.;Shipulin, G.

Despite their importance, there is still much to learn about phages in the human microbiome. We investigated the gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two African baboon social groups, and Danish pigs; Most of these microbiomes contain phages belonging to a clade with genomes >540 kilobases long, which is the largest ever reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phages. We call these Lacquer phages. CRISPR differential targeting indicates Lac phages infect bacteria of the genus Prevotella. We manually curated to complete 15 different Lak phage genomes from metagenomes. The genomes show many interesting features, including the use of an alternative genetic code, large highly expressed intergenic regions, and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have different phage genotypes, and shifts in variable frequencies on consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination resulted in extensive genome mixing of nine baboon Lak phage populations.

Recently, a new PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here PRV-3) was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV and blood samples collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as a source of virus. Virus particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete coding sequences of PRV-3 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. Compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1%, and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins ranged from 96.7% (lambda1) to 79.1% (sigma3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belonged to a separate cluster. The region coding for Sigma3 was sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences were pooled together, but far from PRV-3 isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyzes of PRV-3 proteins revealed that predicted secondary structures and functional domains are conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1.

Although the first description of the virus in India dates back to 1987, the virus has been circulating in parts of sub-Saharan Africa for several decades and in the Middle East and South Asia since 1993. To examine the genetic relationship between isolates of different geographic origin, a selected region of the fusion (F) protein gene of viruses was amplified using RT/PCR and the resulting DNA product was sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Viruses from 27 outbreaks reported between 1993 and 2000 in Asian and Middle Eastern countries and two recent outbreaks from the African continent were compared with the prototype African strain. Of the four known strains of the PPR virus, strains 1 and 2 viruses have only been found in West Africa. Originating from an outbreak in Burkina Faso in 1999, the virus fell into strain 1. Viruses of strain 3 have been found in East Africa, where there was an outbreak of this type in Ethiopia in 1996, as well as in Arabia and southern India. However, there has been no further isolation of strain 3 virus from India since it was reported from Tamil Nadu in 1992. A virus from this strain was circulated in Yemen in 2001. In the past 8 years, only the fourth strain virus has spread to the Middle East and Asian subcontinent, reaching as far east as Nepal and Bangladesh.

This article provides an overview of the molecular properties of NiV, focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of two NiV surface glycoproteins, the receptor-binding G protein and the fusion protein F. Since viral glycoproteins are major determinants for the cell, detailed knowledge of these proteins in terms of tropism and virus spread can help to understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity.

500,Genetic analysis of avian paramyxovirus-1 (Newcastle disease virus) isolates from pig populations in China with respect to commonly used commercial vaccine strains.,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is thought to infect bird species only. However, at least eight NDV strains were isolated from pig populations in China during 1999-2006, and four of these were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Genetic analysis revealed that JL106 and SP13 had a 112G-RQGR-L117 motif at the cleavage site of protein F, while JL01 and MP01 had a 112G-KQGR-L117 motif, suggesting that they are all typical for low virulence viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on full-length F gene sequences indicated that JL106 and SP13 belong to genotype II, similar to the commercial La Sota vaccine strain widely used in China. While JL01 and MP01 cluster within genotype I, they are genetically identical to the V4 vaccine strain. Animal experiments showed that JL106 can effectively infect chickens. The present results indicated that the use of live La Sota and V4 vaccines and close contact between bird and pigs can result in interspecies infection, therefore further surveillance of swine NDV epidemiology is warranted. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Ding, Z.;Cong, Y.

501,Modulation of microRNAs in two genetically different chicken lines predisposed to different necrotic enteritis disease,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) play a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation by affecting the 3'-UTR of target genes. We used small RNA high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate whether miRNAs are differentially expressed in these two chicken lines after induction, using inbred White Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2, which show the disease resistant and susceptible phenotypes of Marek, respectively. . necrotic enteritis (NE). 12 miRNAs selected from the most down-regulated or up-regulated miRNAs following NE induction were confirmed by their expression in real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, miR-215, miR-217, miR-194, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-216a, miR-216b and miR-429 are highly expressed in the gut derived from line 7.2, while miR- 1782 and miR-499 were downregulated. In the spleen, miR-34b and miR-1684 were the most up-regulated miRNAs at line 6.3. Notably, five of the six target genes, CXCR5, BCL2, GJA1, TCF12 and TAB3, were differentially expressed between line 6.3 and line 7.2 and showed suppression in the MD-susceptible chicken line. Their expression levels were inversely proportional to those of miRNA from both HTS and quantitative real-time PCR. These results suggest that some miRNAs are differentially altered in response to NE and modulate the expression of their target genes in the two inbred lines. Collectively, HTS analysis of gut miRNAs from NE-affected inbred chickens showing different disease phenotypes led to the identification of miRNA-regulated host immunity genes. Future studies of the function of these miRNAs and their target genes in the host will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control host-pathogen interaction in NE. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Dinh, H.;Hong, Y.

Because of these features, it is recommended that the virus be accepted as a member of the Myxovirus group. Porcine cholera virus is associated with bovine viral diarrhea virus via a ""soluble"" antigen and also has essential lipid.

504,Metagenomic analysis of RNA viruses in a freshwater lake,"Freshwater lakes and ponds offer an ecological interface between humans and various host organisms. They are a habitat for the larval stage of many insects and can serve as a medium for intraspecific and interspecific transmission of viruses such as avian influenza A virus. Also, freshwater bodies are already known reservoirs for disease-causing viruses such as Norwalk Virus, Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, and Adenovirus. Although RNA virus populations have been studied in marine environments, very limited analysis of the freshwater viral community has been made to date. Here we present a study of RNA viruses in Needwood Lake, a freshwater lake in Maryland, USA. Our results show that, as with studies in other aquatic environments, most of the nucleic acid sequences obtained show no significant similarity to known sequences. The remaining sequences are mainly from viral types with significant similarity to about 30 viral families. We speculate that these new viruses could infect a variety of hosts, including plants, insects, fish, pets and humans. Among these viruses, we discovered a previously unknown dsRNA virus closely related to Banna Virus, which is responsible for a febrile illness and is native to Southeast Asia. We also found multiple viral sequences distantly related to Israel Acute Paralysis virus, which plays a role in honeybee colony collapse disorder. Our data suggest that, due to their direct contact with humans, domestic and wild animals, freshwater ecosystems can serve as reservoirs for a wide variety of viruses (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) and possibly play a role in the spread of emerging and pandemic diseases.

505,Genetic analysis of human rotavirus C: the appearance of the Indo-Bangladeshi strain in Far East Asian countries.,"Rotaviruses C (RVCs) circulate worldwide as an enteric pathogen in both humans and animals. Most studies of their genetic diversity focus on the VP7 and VP4 genes, but the complete genomes of 18 human RVCs have been identified in independent studies. The genetic background of Far East Asian RVCs is different from other human RVCs found in India and Bangladesh. Recently, an RVC detected in South Korea in 2010 had a similar genetic background to India-Bangladeshi RVCs. This study was conducted to identify the entire genome of eight Japanese RVCs detected in 2005-2012 and compare them with other human and animal global RVCs to better understand the genetic background of contemporary Far East Asian RVC. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that human RVCs differ from animal RVCs. Among human RVCs, three lineage constellations had long circulation. The genetic background of Far East Asian RVC was distinguished from Indo-Bangladeshi RVC as previously reported. However, in 2012 we found one Japanese RVC carrying the genetic background of Indo-Bangladeshi RVC, while the remaining seven Japanese RVCs carried the typical genetic background of Far East Asian RVC. This is the India-Bangladesh RVC's first report in Japan. With this observation and the reclassification of human RVCs in Hungary, our study demonstrates the spread of RVCs from one region to another.",,"Doan, Y.

507,Sequence analysis of a porcine enterovirus serotype 1 isolate: Relationships to other picornaviruses.,"The majority of the genomic sequence of a porcine enterovirus serotype 1 (PEV-1) isolate was determined. The genome was found to contain a large open reading frame encoding a leader protein before the capsid protein region. This showed no sequence identity to other picornavirus leader regions and sequence data suggested that it lacks proteolytic activity. The 2A protease was small and showed a remarkable sequence identity to aftoviruses and at rhinovirus serotype 2. The 2A/2B junction had the typical cleavage site (NPG/P) exhibited by these viruses. Other proteins shared less than 40% sequence identity with equivalent proteins from other picornavirus genera. Phylogenetic analyzes of the P1 and 3D sequences showed that this virus forms a separate branch of the Picornaviridae family. Based on the results presented in this manuscript, PEV-1 has been assigned to a new genus of picornavirus. The phylogeny of the virus relative to other picornaviruses is discussed.",,"Doherty, M.;Todd, D.;McFerran, N.;Hoey, E. M.",1999.0,,,0
508,Functional characterization of a monoclonal antibody epitope using a lambda phage display depth sequencing platform,"We recently described a method called PROFILER for the identification of antigenic regions that are preferentially targeted by polyclonal antibody responses after vaccination. To test the technique's ability to provide insight into the functional properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitopes, we used here a well-characterized meningococcal factor H-binding protein (fHbp) epitope recognized by mAb 12C1. A fHbp library engineered on a lambda phage vector enabling surface expression of polypeptides of very different lengths was subjected to massive parallel sequencing of phage inserts after affinity selection with 12C1 mAb. We identified dozens of unique antibody-selected sequences, the most enriched of which (termed FrC) can largely recapitulate the ability of fHbp to bind mAb 12C1. Computational analysis of the cumulative enrichment of single amino acids in fragments selected by the antibody identified two overrepresented residue sequences (H248-K254 and S140-G154), whose presence was subsequently found to be required for FrC binding to mAb 12C1.

512,Phylogenetic diversity and genotypic complexity of H9N2 influenza A viruses revealed by genomic sequence analysis,"H9N2 influenza A viruses have become resident in terrestrial poultry and wild birds worldwide and occasionally infect mammals, including humans and pigs. To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database, representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. Panoramic framework to better understand the genesis and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses and to explain the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in various hosts. Panorama phylogenetic analysis of eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 distinct lineages with marked host and geographic differences in phylogeny. Panorama genotypic analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses contained at least 98 genotypes, which were divided into seven series (AG) according to HA lineages. Phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that H9N2 viruses are closely related to H3, H4, H5, H7, H10 and H14 subtype influenza viruses. Our results show that H9N2 viruses undergo extensive reclassification to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes; this suggests that the continued circulation of multiple genotypic H9N2 viruses in various hosts worldwide has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in poultry and epidemics in humans. To facilitate international communication about the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of H9N2 influenza viruses, we propose a nomenclature system to describe and unify all strains and genotypes of H9N2 influenza viruses.

513,Reassortant H9N2 influenza viruses containing H5N1-like PB1 genes isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China.,"H9N2 influenza A viruses have become endemic to different terrestrial poultry and wild birds in Asia and occasionally infect humans and pigs. To evaluate the role of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) in the evolution of influenza A virus, we conducted two outbreak studies on avian influenza viruses in wild black-billed magpies in 2005 in Guangxi, China, and characterized three isolated black-billed magpies. H9N2 viruses (BbM viruses). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three BbM viruses were nearly identical in all their genomes with 99.7% to 100% nucleotide homology, and the genes for BJ94-like (Ck/BJ/1/94), HA, NA, M and NS, SH/F/98-like (Ck/SH) /F/98) PB2, PA and NP genes and H5N1-like (Ck/YN/1252/03, clade 1) PB1 genes. Genetic analysis showed that BbM viruses were most likely the result of multiple reclassifications between co-circulating H9N2-like and H5N1-like viruses and were genetically different from other H9N2 viruses due to the presence of H5N1-like PB1 genes. Genotypic analysis revealed that BbM viruses evolved from a variety of sources and belonged to a new genotype (B46) discovered in our recent study. Molecular analysis showed that BbM viruses are likely to be low pathogenic reagents. However, the results of our pathogenicity study showed that BbM viruses reproduce efficiently in chickens and a mammalian mouse model, but not lethal to infected chickens and mice. Antigenic analysis showed that the BbM viruses were antigenic heterologous with the H9N2 vaccine strain. Our study is probably the first report to document and characterize H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China. Our results indicate that black-billed magpies are susceptible to H9N2 influenza viruses, raising concerns about possible transmission of reassortant H9N2 viruses among poultry and wild birds.

514,"Characteristics of influenza H13N8 subtype virus first isolated from Qinghai Lake District, China","Background: As the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza killed thousands of wild birds in this region in 2005, Lake Qinghai in China has become a hotspot for research on the impact of avian flu on migratory wild birds. However, the ecology and evolution of the low pathogenic avian influenza virus in this region is limited. This project-based bird flu surveillance in the Qinghai Lake area was initiated in 2012. Method: Wild bird droppings and lake surface water samples were collected in Qinghai Lake in 2012. Virus isolation was performed on embryonated chicken eggs. Influenza A virus was detected by rRT-PCR. Virus sequences were obtained by deep sequencing. Phylogenetic correlation and molecular characteristics of viruses were analyzed. Virus growth and infection characteristics, receptor binding preference and pathogenicity were studied in vitro. Results: Two H13N8 subtype influenza viruses were isolated. Viruses phylogenetically belong to the Eurasian lineage. Most of the genes are associated with the gull-borne influenza virus, with the exception of the PB1 gene, which is most likely derived from the Anseriformes virus. Evidence of interspecies reclassification is presented. The two viruses have limited growth capacity in MDCK and A549 cells, but grow well in embryonated eggs. The dual receptor binding properties of the two viruses were revealed. Low pathogenic properties were determined by the trypsin-dependent plaque formation assay. Results: Two H13N8 subtypes of influenza viruses were highly associated with gull origin. The interspecies reclassification of the H13 subtype virus among wild birds of Anseriforme litter Charadriiformes highlights the importance of strengthening bird flu surveillance in this region.

In this study, the Chinese prototypical PRV strain LA caused mild respiratory disorders, while ZJ01 caused fatal diseases. The whole genome sequencing results show that the two viruses can be classified into two subsets, unlike the traditional European and US strains. To examine the potential role of the gE and gI proteins in ZJ01 virulence, we generated several recombinant viruses. In two chimeric viruses (rZJ01-LA/gEI and rLA-ZJ01/gEI), the gE and gI genes were replaced using the corresponding genes from ZJ01 and LA. rZJ01-LA/gEI and parent virus rZJ01 retained high virulence in piglets, although the survival time of piglets infected with rZJ01-LA/gEI was clearly prolonged. In contrast, rLA-ZJ01/gEI exhibited higher virulence than the parent virus rLA.

In this study, GDsg, a novel virulent strain of PRRS virus (PRRSV), was isolated in Guangdong province of China and caused high fever, high morbidity and high mortality in pigs and piglets. The genome of this new strain was 15,413 nucleotides (nt) long, and comparative analysis revealed that GDsg shared 82.4% to 94% identity with type 2 PRRSV strains, but only 61.5% identity with type 1 PRRSV Lelystad virus strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that type 2 PRRSV isolates contained five subgenotypes (I, II, III, IV and V), represented by NADC30, VR-2332, GM2, CH-1a and HuN4, respectively. Moreover, GDsg belongs to the nascent type 2 PRRSV subgenotype III. More interestingly, the newly isolated GDsg strain has multiple discontinuous nt deletions, 131 (19 + 18 + 94) at location 1404-1540 and a 107 nt insertion in the NSP2 region. Most importantly, strain GDsg was identified as a virus that was recombined between the low pathogenic field strain QYYZ and the vaccine strain JXA1-P80.

Previous studies describing the evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J genetic variants focused mainly on the early infection period or on a few randomly selected clones. Here, we vaccinated 30 specific pathogen-free chickens with the same constitutive ALV-J stock with known genetic background. Six (three antibody positive and three antibody negative) chickens were selected from among 15 viremia chickens. Viruses were serially isolated at 36 weeks and then sequenced using the MiSeq high-throughput sequencing platform. This produced the largest ALV-J dataset to date, consisting of over three million clean reads. Our results showed that host humoral immunity can greatly increase the genetic diversity of ALV-J genetic variants. Notably, selection pressures favored a dynamically proportional changes in ALV-J genetic variant frequency. The cross-neutralization assay showed that with the change of the dominant variant, the antibody titers specific to the infectious clones corresponding to the most dominant variants at weeks 12 and 28 also changed significantly in sera collected at weeks 16 and 32. Dominant variant shift was observed in antibody negative chickens. We also identified a new hypervariable region in the gp85 gene.

This protein has many essential roles in RNA binding, viroplasm formation, replication cycle involving helicase and can hydrolyze β-phosphate of RNA and NTPs, acting as an RTPase and NTPase. Analysis of sequences from rotavirus strains isolated in Australia between 1984 and 2009 revealed that the NSP2 gene was highly conserved and clustered with NSP2 genotypes N1 and N2, which were defined according to the whole genome-based rotavirus classification system. Phylogenetic analysis showed that NSP2 gene sequences isolated from Australian rotavirus strains formed four distinct lineages. Temporal variation was observed in several clusters over the 26-year period, with ancestry D and A detected only since 1999 during the entire study period. Phylogenetic analysis and dendrograms identified NSP2 genes that exhibited reclassification between different virus VP7 genotypes. Sequence from a human strain closely grouped with the NSP2 genes of bovine rotavirus strains. This study also identified a cross-lineage sequence that exhibits evidence of recombination in which intergenic recombination has been detected for the first time in an NSP2 gene sequence.

Most studies have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify bacteria. However, the decreasing sequencing cost has resulted in a gradual shift away from amplicon analyzes and towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Shotgun metagenomic data can be used to identify a wide variety of species, but has rarely been applied to fungal identification. Here, we develop a set of classification pipeline called FindFungi and use it to identify fungal sequences in publicly available metagenome datasets. We focus primarily on animal metagenomes, particularly those from the pig and mouse microbiomes. We identified fungi in 39 of the 70 datasets of 71 fungal species. At least 11 pathogenic species with zoonotic potential have been identified, including Candida tropicalis. We identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples that were initially analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel oil.

However, many rodent species can have adverse effects, such as damage to crops and stored products, and are a health concern due to the transmission of pathogens to humans and animals. The first rodent viruses were discovered through isolation approaches, resulting in groundbreaking information in immunology, molecular and cell biology, and cancer research. In addition to rodent-specific viruses, rodent-borne viruses cause numerous zoonotic diseases. The most prominent examples are the reoccurring outbreaks of human hemorrhagic fever disease caused by arena and hantaviruses. In addition, rodents, tick-borne encephalitis virus and Borrelia spp. They are reservoirs for vector-borne pathogens such as Today, next-generation sequencing or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing the rate at which new viruses are discovered, but other molecular approaches, such as generic RT-PCR/PCR and rolling circle amplification techniques, are contributing significantly. fast-paced process. However, when comparing known human viruses to those known for rodents, the mammalian taxon with the largest species number, the available information still represents only the tip of the iceberg. The diagnostic potential of HTS-based metagenomic approaches is demonstrated by their use in whole genome determination and discovery of novel borne- and adenoviruses as causative disease agents in squirrels. As a result, HTS combined with traditional RT-PCR/PCR-based approaches resulted in a significantly increased knowledge of the diversity of rodent viruses.

524,"Bats worldwide carry viruses related to the hepatitis E virus, forming a putative new genus within the family Hepeviridae.","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with foodborne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4 found in temperate climates. Considering the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat samples from 85 different species and five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs have been detected in African, Central American and European bats, forming a new phylogenetic branch in the Hepeviridae family. Bat hepeviruses were highly diverse and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence of human transmission of bat hepeviruses was found in more than 90,000 human blood donations and in individual patient sera. Whole genome analysis of a representative virus confirmed the official classification within the family Hepeviridae. Sequence and distance-based taxonomic considerations suggested that bat hepeviruses form a separate genus within the family Hepeviridae, and that at least three other genera can be identified, comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses. This could mean that hepeviruses have recently invaded mammalian hosts and undergo speciation according to host constraints. Human HEV-related viruses in livestock and peridomestic animals may represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses rather than animal precursors causally involved in human HEV evolution.

525,Next-generation sequencing demonstrates West Nile virus half-species diversity after a single pass in an in vivo infection model in a carrion crow (Corvus corone).,"West Nile virus (WNV) occurs as a population of genetic variants (quasispecies) that infect a single animal. Previous low-resolution estimates of viral genetic diversity in sampled wild birds and mosquitoes and in multiple passage adaptation studies in vivo or in cell culture suggest that WNV genetic diversity is mostly limited to the mosquito vector. This study investigated the genetic variation of WNV in avian hosts during a single passage using next-generation sequencing. Wild-caught carrion crows were subcutaneously infected using a clonal Middle Eastern WNV. Blood samples were taken 2 and 4 days after infection. A reverse transcription (RT)-PCR approach was used to amplify the WNV genome directly from serum samples prior to next-generation sequencing, yielding at least 700 x average depth in each sample. Appropriate controls were sequenced to distinguish biologically relevant low-frequency variants from experimentally revealed errors. WNV populations in wild crows showed considerable diversity, far from the vaccinia virus semispecies structure. In contrast, WNV populations in intracerebrally infected day-old chickens were not different from those of the inoculum. Where previous studies have concluded that WNV genetic diversity is only experimentally demonstrated in permitted insect vector species, we have experimentally demonstrated that WNV populations vary significantly in a wild bird reservoir species.",,"Dridi, M.;Rosseel, T.;Orton, R.;Johnson, P.;Lecollinet, S.;Muylkens, B.;Lambrecht, B.;Van Borm, S.",2015.0,Oct,,0
526,Complete nucleotide sequence of vaccine strain of Chinese serotype Asia1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"The full-length nucleotide sequence of the Chinese vaccine strain Asia1/YNBS/58 of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was determined. The results showed that the complete genome of YNBS/58 is 8,164 nucleotides (nt) long, including 1,061-nt 5â€² untranslated region (UTR), 6,990-nt open reading frame (ORF), and 113-nt 3â. €² UTR. Genome sequences of Asia1/YNBS/58 and other known FMDV strains were compared. Homology analysis showed that non-structural proteins were more conserved than structural proteins in FMDV, and the 5â€² UTR was more conserved than the 3â€² UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Asia1/YNBS/58 clustered in the Asia1 serotype and was associated with three other isolates, Asia1/IND/63/72, Asia1/3chymron/63 and Asia1/2ISRL/63, suggesting that they are closely related. genetic relationship. VP1-, VP2-, and VP3-based phylogenetic trees were divided into different clusters according to different serotypes, while other gene-based phylogenetic trees exhibited some degree of crossover between serotypes. According to the nucleotide similarities between Asia1/YNBS/58 and two new Chinese Asia1 isolates, Asia1/HKN/05 and Asia1/JS/05, each constitutes a distinct genotype.

527,MicroRNA expression profile of primary sheep testicular cells in response to bluetongue virus infection,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a member of the Orbivirus genus in the family Reoviridae and causes a non-contagious, insect-borne disease in domestic and wild ruminant animals, primarily sheep, and sometimes cattle and some deer species. Virus infection can trigger changes in the cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which plays important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we used deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular miRNAs are differentially expressed in primary sheep testicular (ST) cells infected with BTV. A total of 25 known miRNAs and 240 new miRNA candidates differentially expressed in BTV-infected and uninfected ST cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes were annotated, respectively. Nine differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Target prediction and functional analysis of these regulated miRNAs revealed significant enrichment for a variety of signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, Hippo, NF-kB, viral carcinogenesis, FoxO, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. This study provides a valuable basis for further research into the roles of miRNAs in BTV replication and pathogenesis.",,"Du, J.;Gao, S.;Tian, Z.;Xing, S.;Huang, D.;Zhang, G.;Zheng, Y.;Liu, G.;Luo, J.;Chang, H.;Yin, H.",2017.0,4,,0

The Picornaviridae family contains clinically important pathogens that infect humans and animals, and an increasing number of rodent picornaviruses have recently been associated with zoonoses. From October 2013 to July 2015, we collected 574 pharyngeal and anal swab samples from 287 rodents from 10 different species from eight representative regions of China. Seven representative sequences identified from six rodent species were amplified as complete genomes and classified into four lineages. The three lineage 1 viruses belonged to a novel picornavirus genus and were more closely related to Hepatovirus than to other picornaviruses based on aa homology. Lineage 2, lineage 3 and lineage 4 viruses belong to the genera Rosavirus, Hunnivirus and Enterovirus, which represent the new species, respectively. Based on both phylogenetic and identity analyses, Lineage 2 viruses were closely related to rosavirus 2 obtained from the feces of a child in The Gambia, and Lineage 3 viruses were closely related to pet Hunnivirus.

529,Molecular evolution and emergence of the H5N6 avian influenza virus in central China.,"The H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) has posed a potential threat to public health since its emergence in China in 2013. To understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 AIV in the avian population, we conducted molecular surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang. Province of Hunan Province in central China in 2014 and 2015. Wugang Province is located on the East Asia-Australia migratory bird crossing route and one human death was reported in the province on 21 November 2016 due to an H5N6 virus. In total, we sampled and sequenced the complete genomes of 175 H5N6 AIVs. Notably, our analysis revealed that H5N6 AIVs contain at least six genotypes resulting from segment reclassification, including a rare variant with an HA gene derived from the H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene whose origins are H7N3 viruses. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that genetically similar H5N6 AIVs tended to cluster according to geographic regions of origin.

It has a large worldwide distribution and has also been reported to infect humans. Although many strains have been isolated from different parts of mainland China, rarely any strains have been reported from the southern provinces of China. We reviewed a case of orf virus infection that occurred in Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province in southern China. An orf virus strain, GDQY, was successfully isolated and identified by cell culture techniques and transmission electron microscopy. The complete genes of ORFV011, ORFV059, ORFV106 and ORFV107 were amplified for sequence analysis based on nucleotide or amino acid levels. To discuss genetic variation, precise sequences were used to compare with other reference strains isolated from different regions or countries. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on these species and evolutionary distances were calculated based on the alignment of their exact sequences. The typical structure of Orf virus was observed in cell culture suspensions inoculated with GDQY, and the full length of the four genes were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GDQY is homologous to FJ-DS and CQ/WZ on ORFV011 nucleotides. ORFV059 may be more variable than ORFV011 based on comparison between GDQY and other isolates. Genetic studies of ORFV106 and 107 were reported for the first time in the presented study.",,"Duan, C.;Liao, M.;Wang, H.;Luo, X.;Shao, J.;Xu, Y.;Li, W.;Hao, W.;Luo, S.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.016,0
531,Isolation and characterization of influenza A virus (subtype H5N1) causing the first highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in chickens in Bhutan.,"In 2010, we identified the Influenza A/H5N1 virus that caused the first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in chickens in Bhutan. The virus was highly virulent for chicken and killed them within two days of experimental vaccination with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.88. Full genome sequencing of 4 viral isolates was performed for genetic and phylogenetic analyses. The isolates revealed multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage sites of hemagglutinin (HA), similar to other ""Qinghai-like"" H5N1 isolates. The receptor binding site of the HA molecule contained bird-like amino acids (222Q and 224G). The isolates also contained amino acid residue K at position 627 of the PB2 protein and other markers in the NS 1 and PB1 proteins, emphasizing the risk to mammals. However, the isolates were susceptible to currently commercially available influenza drugs. Sequence analysis showed that Bhutanese viruses shared 99.1-100% nucleotide homology in all eight genes among themselves, and a 2010 chicken isolate from Bangladesh (A/chicken/Bangladesh/1151-11/2010) showed the common progenitor virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Bhutanese isolates belonged to subdivision 2.2.3 (EMA 3) and shared a common progenitor virus with the 2010 Bangladesh virus. Based on the evidence of phylogeny and molecular markers, it can be concluded that the outbreaks in Bhutan and Bangladesh in 2010 were caused by the independent introduction of the virus, possibly through migratory birds. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Dubey, S.

533,Characterization of a novel genotype and serotype of infectious bronchitis virus in West Africa.,"Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1,000 chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length sequences of the Spike 1 (S1) gene revealed a new IBV genotype, which we have named 'IBADAN'. The minimum genetic distance to the nearest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at amino acid level) reached 24% and 32% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The complete genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4% at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. Since IBV S1 plays an important role in antigenicity, the antigenic relevance of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against strains IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B in virus neutralization experiments. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like ITA/90254/2005 strain, but only at a low level (33% antigenic association), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. Comparison of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity.

This study used high-throughput sequencing to assess the richness and diversity of poultry litter bacterial communities and to explore links between these communities and a poultry's environmental characteristics, including its history of gangrenous dermatitis (GD). Cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed differences in the distribution of bacterial phylotypes between Wet and Dry litter samples and houses. The wet litter contained more diversity, with 90% of the total bacterial abundance occurring in the first 214 OTU clusters. In contrast, only 50 clusters accounted for 90% of Dry litter bacterial abundance.

537,Molecular and microscopic evidence of viruses in marine copepods,"As dominant members of marine mesozooplankton communities, copepods play critical roles in oceanic food webs and in the biogeochemical cycle. Despite the ecological importance of copepods, little is known about the causes of copepod deaths, and up to 35% of total copepod deaths cannot be explained by predation alone. Viruses have been established as ecologically important infectious agents in the oceans; however, viral infection in mesozooplankton communities has not been investigated. Here, we used molecular and microscopic techniques to document viral infection in natural populations of the calanoid copepods Acartia tonsa (Calve) and Labidocera aestiva (Wheeler) in Tampa Bay, FL. Viral metagenomics has revealed previously undocumented viruses of all species called Acartia tonsa copepod circo-like virus (AtCopCV) and Labidocera aestiva copepod circo-like virus (LaCopCV). LaCopCV was found to be extremely common and abundant in L. aestiva populations, with prevalence of up to 100% in some samples and mean viral loads per capita of 1.13 x 10(5) copies. LaCopCV transcription was also detected in most of the L. aestiva individuals showing viral activity. AtCopCV was detected sporadically in A. tonsa populations throughout the year, suggesting temporal variability in viral infection dynamics. Finally, unknown virus-like particles were observed in the connective tissues of A. tonsa and L. aestiva by transmission electron microscopy; this showed that the viruses were actively replicating in copepod connective tissue rather than infecting intestinal contents, parasites or symbionts. Taken together, these results provide strong independent evidence for active viral infection in dominant copepod species, showing that viruses can significantly affect mesozooplankton ecology.",,"Dunlap, D.

Of the 6 colostrum-deprived calves vaccinated before receiving their first milk, 3 died; however, a comparable proportion (9/17) of unvaccinated colostrum-deprived calves also died. Calves 4 to 8 weeks old that were exposed to the virus developed fever and leukopenia, but less than half of the calves developed diarrhea and few died. None of the unvaccinated calves fed colostrum died. In utero infection of the fetus appeared to be a common occurrence, as judged by the presence of antibodies to one or more bovine enteroviruses in fetuses who aborted at 4 months or more of pregnancy. The antibodies were believed to be of fetal origin.

539,Characterization of novel Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) antisense transcripts by deep sequencing reveals constitutive expression and transcriptional interaction with viral microRNAs in tumors.,"Background: Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is a deltaretrovirus closely related to Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). Cattle are the natural host of BLV, where it integrates into B-cells and produces a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic, but after a long latency approximately 5% develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, reflecting the disease course of HTLV-1. The mechanisms by which these viruses trigger cellular transformation remain unclear. In both viruses, little or no transcription is observed in tumors from the 5'LTR, but proviruses are not transcriptionally silent. In the case of BLV, an RNA polymerase III transcribed microRNA cluster is highly expressed, while the HTLV-1 antisense transcript HBZ is consistently present in all tumors examined. Results: Here, we show, using RNA-seq, that the BLV provirus constitutively expresses antisense transcripts in all leukemic and asymptomatic samples also examined. The first transcript (AS1) can be alternately polyadenylated and produce ~600bp (AS1-S) transcript and less abundant ~2200bp (AS1-L) transcript. Alternative splicing creates a second transcript of ~400bp (AS2). The coding potential of AS1-S/L is unclear, with a small open reading frame of 264bp, but the transcripts are mainly retained in the nucleus, implying a lncRNA-like role. The AS1-L transcript overlaps with BLV microRNAs, and using high-throughput sequencing of the RNA-ligas-mediated (RLM) 5'RACE, we show that the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments using BLV proviruses modified with deleted or reversed microRNAs point to additional transcriptional interaction between the two viral RNA species. Conclusions: The identification of novel viral antisense transcripts suggests that the BLV provirus is far from silent in tumors. Moreover, the consistent expression of these transcripts in both leukemic and non-malignant clones points to a vital role in the virus's life cycle and tumorigenic potential. In addition, cleavage of AS1-L transcript by BLV-encoded microRNAs and transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species suggest a shared role in the regulation of BLV.",,"Durkin, K.;Rosewick, N.;Artesi, M.;Hahaut, V.;Griebel, P.;Arsic, N.;Burny, A.;Georges, M.;Van den Broeke, A.",2016.0,,10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8,0
540,Phylogenetic analysis of beak and feather disease virus across a host ring type complex,"Pathogens have been hypothesized to play an important role in host diversity and speciation. Susceptibility of hybrid hosts to pathogens is thought to be a common phenomenon that may promote host population divergence and subsequent speciation. However, when testing common diversity of pathogens in the hybridizing host complex, few studies have been tested for pathogen infection in animal hybrid sites. For over 8 years, we have studied natural infection by the rapidly evolving single-stranded DNA virus, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), which infects parrots using a host-ring species complex (Platycercus elegans) in Australia. We found that host subspecies and hybrids varied dramatically in both prevalence and burden of BFDV: intermediate subspecies, both hybrid and phenotypical, had lower prevalence and burden compared to the main subspecies, while host age, sex, longitude, and latitude, as well as temporal effects, were controlled by the control subspecies. is done. . We sequenced viral isolates across the range for the first time to our knowledge in any host-pathogen system, revealing patterns of genomic variation similar to Mayr's ring-species hypothesis. Viral phylogeny, geographic location, intraspecies host density, and parrot community diversity and composition did not explain differences in BFDV prevalence or burden among subpopulations. Overall, our analyzes suggest that functional host responses to infection, or strength of infection, differ between subspecies and hybrids. Our findings highlight the role of host hybridization and lines in altering host-pathogen interactions, dynamics that may have important implications for gene flow and speciation patterns, and provide insights into how pathogens can adapt to different host populations.",,"Eastwood, J.

From a dolphin diagnosed with an unknown respiratory disease in 2008. At that time, TtPIV-1 was found to be most similar to, but different from, bovine PIV-3 (BPIV-3). In this study, similar viral growth kinetics and production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6 and CXCL8) were observed between BPIV-3 and TtPIV-1 in BEAS-2B, MDBK and Vero cell lines. The initial terminology of TtPIV-1 was based on the partial sequence of the fusion and RNA polymerase genes. Based on the similarities we saw with the in vitro study, it was important to examine the TtPIV-1 genome in more detail.

FMDV nonstructural protein (NSP) seroprevalence for outbreaks was estimated at 80% (90/72) and 70% (188) post-outbreak. Antibodies to FMDV serotypes O, A, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3 were detected across states using solid-phase competitive ELISA. The FMDV genome was detected in 99% (73 out of 74) samples from animals affected by FMD using rRT-PCR, and the cytopathic effect in cell culture was found in 59% (44 out of 74) of these samples. Three FMDV serotypes O, A and SAT2 were isolated and characterized. Phylogenetic evaluations of virus isolates indicated that two topotypes of FMDV serotype O, East Africa-3 (EA-3) and West African (WA) as well as FMDV strains of African genotype (G-IV) were in circulation. serotype A and FMDV SAT2 topotype VII strains. The serotype O (EA-3) strains from Nigeria are most closely related to a 1999 virus strain from Sudan, while the WA strain from Nigeria shares genetic association with three 1988 viruses from Niger. FMDV serotype A strains were closely related to a known virus from Cameroon, and SAT2 strains were most closely related to virus subtypes from Libya. This study provides evidence of co-occurrence of FMDV serotypes and topotypes in West, Central, East and North Africa and is relevant for control. The findings help fill the knowledge gap of FMDV dynamics in Nigeria and the West African subregion to support local and regional development of vaccine-based control plans and international risk assessment.",,"Ehizibolo, D.

544,Bovine herpesvirus type 2 is closely related to primate alphaherpes viruses.,"Bovine herpesvirus type 2 (BoHV-2), also known as bovine mammillitis virus, is classified, together with herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), in Family Herpesviridae, Subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, and Genus Simplexvirus us and its 15 kb U (L) Other primate simplex viruses based on similarities in 4 genes within cluster 23-29. This can be explained by either a global similarity or a recombination event that introduces primate herpesviral sequences into a bovine virus. Our sequences confirm for DNA polymerase (U(L)30), a large gene adjacent to the previously identified conserved cluster, and glycoprotein G (U(S)4), a gene as far away from the cluster as possible on the circularized genome. He claims a close relationship between BoHV-2 and primate simplex viruses and a global similarity and possibly a close evolutionary relationship.

545,Initial outbreaks and phylogenetic analyzes of avian influenza H9N2 viruses isolated from poultry flocks in Morocco,"Background: H9N2 avian influenza viruses continue to spread worldwide in poultry and wild birds. Morocco faced the first H9N2 influenza virus outbreaks affecting different poultry production in early 2016. After the virus was released, it spread very quickly across the country. Methods: Samples were collected from 11 chicken flocks with high morbidity and mortality rates. Four viruses from broilers and one virus from broiler breeders were successfully isolated and fully sequenced. Results: Phylogenetic and molecular marker analyzes indicated that Fas viruses belonged to the G1 lineage and probably originated from the Middle East. Fasanisolates, as is known for H9N2 viruses, have several genetic markers that increase virulence in poultry and transmission to humans. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that under field conditions H9N2 can have a devastating effect on egg production and mortality, highlighting the lack of pathogen-related surveillance data in the region.",,"El Houadfi, M.;Fellahi, S.;Nassik, S.;GuÃ©rin, J.

547,Detection of the first G6P[14] human rotavirus strain from a child with diarrhea in Egypt,"We report the first detection of a G6P[14] rotavirus strain in the stool of a child who participated in a hospital-based diarrhea surveillance study conducted in Egypt during 2004. Rotavirus infection was initially detected using a rotavirus group A VP6 enzyme immunoassay; P (VP4) and G (VP7) genotypes of the strain were determined by RT-PCR. We sequenced the VP7 gene and the VP8* portion of the VP4 gene, and the strain VP7 [>94% nucleotides (nt), >97% amino acids (aa)] and VP4 (>93% nt, >98% aa) was found in Italy in the winter of 1987. Sequences of PA169, a novel strain of G6P[14] isolated for the first time from juvenile. Additional sequencing and analysis of the remaining structural (VP1-VP3, VP6) and non-structural (VP1-VP3, VP6) proteins (NSP1-NSP5) support this animal-to-human reclassification theory. According to the whole genome classification system, strain G6P[14] (EGY3399) was assigned to the genotypes G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3. The greatest similarity of EGY3399 NSP4 and NSP5 gene sequences was with those of sheep and monkey origin, respectively. Combined with other observations, our results support other studies showing that G6P[14] isolates rarely cause severe diarrhea in Egyptian children and that animal rotavirus contributes to the genetic diversity of rotavirus detected from humans through interspecies crossover and single- or multi-segment reclassification. © 2011.",,"El Sherif, M.;Esona, M.

548,"Avian flu: Virology, diagnosis and surveillance","Avian influenza virus (AIV) is the causative agent of a zoonotic disease that affects populations worldwide, often with devastating economic and health consequences. Most AIV subtypes cause little or no disease in waterfowl, but outbreaks in poultry may be associated with high mortality. Although transmission of AIV to humans is rare and is strain-dependent, the virus has the ability to mutate or re-transform into a form that triggers a life-threatening infection. The continued emergence of new influenza strains makes it particularly difficult to predict behavior, spread, virulence, or potential for human-to-human transmission. It is difficult to prepare for this event, as it is difficult to predict which viral strain or which location will initiate the next pandemic. However, rigorous implementation of biosecurity, vaccination and education programs can minimize the threat of AIV. Global surveillance programs help record and identify emerging and potentially pandemic strains hosted by the reservoir host. Â© 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",,"El Zowalaty, M. E.;Bustin, S.

549,Sheep respiratory syncytial virus F gene sequence and its diagnostic application,"Ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) are divided into 2 subgroups, ovine RSV and bovine RSV. Although sheep RSV infects cattle, its contribution to bovine respiratory disease, an important issue for vaccine development in cattle, has not been determined. Diagnosis by virus isolation or serology has low or variable sensitivity and/or specificity, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been proposed as a rapid and sensitive technique for RSV detection. A simple procedure has been developed to detect and identify bovine and ovine RSVs. First, the nucleotide sequence of the sheep RSV fusion (F) gene was determined and compared with representative strains of bovine RSV and human RSV subgroups A and B. The sheep RSV F gene has 85% and 72-73% nucleotide identity with those of cattle. RSV and human RSV, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the sheep RSV F gene has 94% and 83-84% amino acid identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. Next, PCR primers targeting a specific F gene fragment of bovine and ovine RSV were designed. Primers represented the sequence complementary to bases 85-103 and bases 510-493 of the sheep RSV F gene. A similar PCR product (426 bp) was obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis from bovine RSV and ovine RSV. However, the products were specific to the parent virus and could be distinguished by EcoRI or MspI restriction endonuclease cleavage. EcoRI separated the ovine product into 2 bands (285 and 141 bp), but did not affect the bovine RSV PCR product. However, MspI separated the bovine product into 2 bands (229 and 197 bp) but had no effect on the ovine product. In addition, this assay did not amplify any PCR products with human RSV. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion is a useful and practical approach for the detection and differentiation of ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses.",,"Eleraky, N.

550,Accurate classification and amino acid signatures of hemagglutinin for influenza A virus host-origin association and subtyping,"Host-origin classification and signatures of influenza A viruses were searched based on the HA protein for HA host tracking. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), decision trees, and associative classification for each influenza A virus subtype and major hosts (human, avian, pig) were constructed. Features of HA protein signatures that are specific to the host and subtype were sought. Host-associated signatures revealed in different subtypes of the virus were identified. Support and confidence ratings were performed for evaluation of classification models based on ROC curves and amino acid class association rules. Host classification based on HA subtype achieved accuracy between 91.2% and 100% using decision trees after feature selection. Host-specific class association rules for avian-host origins gave better ratings of support and confidence, followed by human and finally porcine origin. This finding indicated lower specificity of the pig host, perhaps pointing to the ability to mix different strains. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"ElHefnawi, M.;Sherif, F.

Subgroup A and B receptors are molecularly identified and their genomic locations TVA and TVB mapped. Subgroup C receptor unknown, its genomic locus TVC is reported to be genetically linked to TVA located on chicken chromosome 28. In this study, we used two chicken strains in themselves carrying different allelic encodings for resistance (TVCR) and susceptibility (TFCS) against infection by subgroup C viruses. A backross population of these lines was tested for susceptibility to subgroup C infection and genotyped for markers from chicken chromosome 28. We confirmed the close link between the TVA and TVC loci. We also defined the position of TVC on chromosome 28 relative to markers in the consensus map of the chicken genome.",,"Elleder, D.;PlachÃ½, J.;Hejnar, J.;Geryk, J.;Svoboda, J.",2004.0,,10.1111/j.1365-2052.2004.01118.x,0

Also, the nucleotide sequence of the partially amplified nucleoprotein (N) gene was compared with other RABV wild strains available in GenBank. The results revealed that RABV antigen was identified by dFA technique in diseased buffalo brains and characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions (Negri bodies) and RABV nucleic acid were detected by histopathology and RT-PCR, respectively.

For the first CSF viruses isolated from these 14 outbreaks were analyzed in pigs to evaluate their molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity. Based on the nucleotide sequences of the 5–² untranslated regions, the isolates were phylogenetically classified as 2.1b or 2.2 subgenotypes, and the 2014 and 2015 isolates classified as 2.1b were closely related to the Chinese and Chinese isolates.

558,Viral discovery as a tool for pandemic preparedness,"Emerging diseases are often caused by new or previously unrecognized zoonotic viral pathogens, and they tend to originate and emerge from wildlife. When human or animal cases are first identified, specific molecular or serological diagnostic tests are not yet available, resulting in a delay in determining the etiologic agent and source of an outbreak. Preparing for the next virus emergence is a major public health concern due to poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates found in wildlife reservoirs. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help reduce the time between detection and response in the event of an epidemic and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of spread from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely used in surveillance programs. Metagenomic studies have identified new viruses, new strains of known viruses, and characterized host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence detection, it is limited to lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, requires significant bioinformatics capabilities, and is low cost and therefore not commonly found in the regions of the world most vulnerable to zoonotic disease formation. In contrast, consensus PCR uses standard and widely available technologies, has greater sensitivity than NGS, and has also been used to identify novel viruses in wildlife, livestock, and humans, although it is limited to detecting conserved target genetic sequences among known virus groups. The use of cPCR, if possible in combination with NGS and serology, can offer a powerful approach to the rapid identification of etiologic agents in an epidemic and to characterize the important wildlife virome known to carry zoonotic viruses. Here, the authors review the pathogen discovery techniques currently used in human and animal surveillance programs and the challenges of using viral discovery to identify novel zoonotic pathogens.",,"Epstein, J.

559,Major transitions in human evolution revisited: A tribute to ancient DNA,"The origin and diversity of modern humans has been characterized by major evolutionary transitions and demographic changes. Patterns of genetic variation in modern populations could help reconstruct something akin to 200,000 years of population history. However, by combining this information with genomic data from ancient remains, we can now have direct access to our evolutionary history and reveal our population history in much greater detail. This review summarizes major recent achievements in ancient DNA research and shows how the field has moved from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short mitochondrial fragments to whole genome sequencing, thus revisiting our own history. Ancient DNA studies have revealed the paths our ancestors took while colonizing the planet, who they mixed with, how they domesticated plant and animal species, how they genetically responded to changes in lifestyle, and also which pathogens destroyed their populations. These approaches promise to soon resolve many of the pending debates about our own origins that cannot be resolved from modern patterns of genetic variation alone, and therefore provide an extremely powerful toolkit for the next generation of molecular anthropologists.

Compared to most American isolates, European isolates have a 43 nucleotide deletion. A larger deletion of 86 nucleotides is present in some viruses from South America and the Philippines. These deletions include the loss of one or two predicted pseudoknot structures in this region of the 5'-UTR. In addition, multiple point mutations allowed the derivation of a phylogenetic tree that defined a group of isolates very similar to that derived from the capsid gene sequences of the same viruses. The study provides evidence that deletion (or insertion) events must have been very frequent during the evolution of FMDV type C, because phylogenetically very closely related (belonging to the same tree branch) viruses may differ in the presence or absence of these deletions.

562,Effect of antigenic and genetic drift on serological surveillance of H5N2 avian influenza viruses,"Serological surveillance of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses is performed by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using reference reagents. This method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test to detect antigenic differences (subspecies) between circulating influenza virus, vaccine, and/or reference strains. However, significant differences were observed between reference antisera and field isolates during sero surveillance of influenza A viruses in pig and poultry farms. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of influenza virus genetics and antigenic drift on serological tests using standard HI tests and reference reagents. Low pathogenic AI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serological testing using antisera produced with year-specific AI virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a significant difference between early LPAI H5N2 viruses (1994 - 1998) and newer virus domain isolates (2002 - 2008). The results of the HI assay were significantly influenced by the choice of AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as the reference antigen for the assay. These analyzes show that LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico consistently undergo genetic drift, and the sero-surveillance of AI viruses is significantly affected by the antigen or antiserum used for HI testing. To keep pace with AI antigenic shift, reference viral antigens and/or antisera must be constantly changed during surveillance of AI viruses. This strategy should improve the estimation of antigenic differences between circulating AI viruses and selection of appropriate vaccine strains.",,"Escorcia, M.;Carrillo-SÃ¡nchez, K.;March-Mifsut, S.;Chapa, J.;Lucio, E.;Nava, G.

564,Echination (horsepox vaccine): an early alternative to vaccination (cattlepox vaccine) and potential role of equinepox virus in the origin of smallpox vaccine,"Nearly 150 years after Edward Jenner published ""The Investigation"" in 1798, it was generally assumed that cowpox virus was the vaccine against smallpox. It wasn't until 1939 that vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine virus, was serologically related but different from cowpox virus. In the absence of a known natural host, the vaccine was considered to be a laboratory virus that may have resulted from mutational or recombinational events involving cowpox virus, variola viruses, or some unknown ancestral Orthopox viruses. A favorite candidate for a vaccine progenitor has been the horsepox virus. Edward Jenner suspected that cowpox was derived from horsepox, and also believed that the ""substance"" from both diseases could be used as a preventative for smallpox. In the 19th century, horsepox vaccine (echination) was used together with cowpox vaccine (vaccination) in Europe to prevent smallpox. Vaccine production practices in the 19th century may have resulted in the use of virus mixtures, resulting in different genetic modifications that resulted in today's vaccine strains. Horsepox, a disease previously reported only in Europe, began disappearing on this continent since the turn of the 20th century and now appears to be extinct, but the virus perhaps continues to lurk in an unknown reservoir. Genomic sequencing of a horsepox virus isolated in Mongolia in 1976 showed that although closely related to the vaccine, this equinepox virus contains additional, potentially ancestral sequences not found in vaccines. Recent genetic analyzes of current vaccine viruses have revealed that some strains contain ancestral equinepox virus genes or are phylogenetically related to equinepox virus. We recently reported that a commercially produced smallpox vaccine produced in the United States in 1902 is genetically remarkably similar to the horsepox virus, forming a missing link in this 200-year-old mystery.",,"Esparza, J.;Schrick, L.;Damaso, C.

The supernatant density of twelve closely related orthopoxviruses purified in these gradients was determined as 1.25 g/ml and that of isolated virion DNAs as 1.1 g/ml. Virion DNA from each of the 12 selected prototype and wild-type viruses was partitioned with three distinct site-specific restriction endonucleases, Hind III, Sal I, and Bam HI, and fragments (molecular weights 0.5 × 10 to 20 × 106). separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The characteristic DNA fragment migration patterns observed in the gels allowed the viruses to be classified. By comparing the profiles of Hind III fragmented DNAs, we were able to classify viruses into 4 types: cowpox, vaccine, monkeypox (2 isolates) and variola (8 isolates). Viruses resulting from infection with variola major can be distinguished from viruses from infection with variola minor. Isolates within the species (strains) were also distinguished mainly by comparing the gel electrophoresis profiles of Sal I-digested DNA from viruses.",,"Esposito, J. J.;Obijeski, J. F.;Nakano, J.

566,zoonotic smallpox viruses,"Poxviruses endanger a long-known group of important pathogens, including some zoonotic members that affect living animals and humans. While whole genome sequence analysis has begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell infection, viral replication and virulence, our understanding of poxvirus maintenance in nature and their transmission to humans is still poor. In the last two decades, reports of human monkeypox outbreaks in Africa and North America, increased numbers of cowpox virus infections in cats, exotic animals and humans, and human vaccine virus infections in South America and India remind us – alongside eradicated smallpox disease virus - there are other smallpox viruses that can harm men. We are beginning to learn that the host range of some pox viruses is much larger than originally thought, and that mainly rodents serve as virus reservoirs. The following review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the epidemiology of zoonotic poxviruses and to highlight orthopox viruses. By outlining the available information on poxvirus transmission, we hope to raise awareness about the transmission routes of infections and their correct diagnosis.

Antigenic characterization was performed using an antigen capture ELISA based on a panel of seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that search for at least three VP2-located antigenic domains. All these domains are reactive for European classical serotype 1 IBDV in the Faragher 52/70 (F52/70) reference strain, Genomic characterization was obtained by reverse transcription, amplification and direct sequencing of a genome fragment encoding the VP2 variable domain. Eleven vv isolates from France were compared with UK661, DV86 and 849VB viruses from the British, Dutch and Belgian and an early vv isolate from Ivory Coast in 1988. All viruses were antigenic characterized by non-binding of Mab 3 and 4. The lack of binding of Mabs 3 and 4 could therefore be helpful to distinguish between classical and vvIBDVs, none of the non-French strains resembled French isolates 91168 and 94432 that did not bind Mabs 6, 7 or 8, Genetic analysis revealed close associations Among all European viruses that differ from each other by no more than 12 nucleotides and 3 amino acids. The African isolate was markedly different from all European viruses, including the F52/70 virus, with at least 22 nucleotides and six amino acid differences.

569,Antigenic characterization of inclusion body hepatitis virus,"Evidence that inclusion body hepatitis (IBHC) in chickens is caused by a virus (IBHV) was established in 1973. Characterization of IBHV was performed using standard criteria for virus classification. The results showed that IBHV is a member of the avian adenovirus group. However, no antigenic associations were found between IBHV and the other two avian adenovirus isolates (CELO and Indiana C), as observed by hemagglutination (HA) and virus serum neutralization tests. Another adenovirus isolate was found to be serologically different from IBHV (Tipton strain), but promoted typical IBHV. This antigen was able to give a specific precipitate reaction with sera from chickens previously exposed to IBHV. Repeated embryo transfer of IBHV reduced its pathogenicity for susceptible chickens. Protection of chickens against IBHV challenge has been achieved by vaccination with high embryo transfer IBHV (Tipton strain). It was also found that subcutaneous administration of vaccine virus induced a better immune response than the instillation route, as observed by the resulting virus serum neutralization index.",,"Fadly, A.

570,Re-emergence of Peste des Petits Ruminants virus in Morocco in 2015: molecular characterization and experimental infection in Alpine goats.,"Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a transboundary viral disease of small ruminant animals that causes great economic losses in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In Morocco, the first PPR outbreak was reported in 2008. Since then, no cases have been reported for seven years, probably due to three consecutive vaccination campaigns in 2008-2011 and close surveillance in border areas. In June 2015, the disease resurfaced in Morocco, raising questions about the origin of the virus. PPR virus was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the virus was isolated from clinical samples on VeroNectin-4 cells. The disease was propagated experimentally in Alpine goats using epidemic isolates from both sheep and goats. Molecular characterization of the 2015 Fas PPR isolate confirmed the identity of the virus as strain IV, closely related to the 2012 Algerian (KP793696) and 2012 Tunisian (KM068121) isolates, and significantly different from the previous PPRV Fas 2008 strain (HQ131927). This study therefore confirms a new attack of the PPR virus in Morocco in 2015 and highlights the urgency of implementing a joint control strategy to combat PPR in the Maghreb region in North Africa.",,"Fakri, F.;Embarki, T.;Parida, S.;Bamouh, Z.;Jazouli, M.;Mahapatra, M.;Tadlaoui, K.;Fassi-Fihri, O.;Richardson, C.

The partial 5'²-untranslated region (5'²-UTR) sequence of each isolate was determined and phylogenetic analysis was performed. All isolates were classified as belonging to the BVDV-1 genotype and can be assigned to different BVDV-1 groups, namely BVDV-1b (n = 20), BVDV-1d (n = 6) and BVDV-1e (n = 10). ). The remaining two isolates can be classified as BVDV-1f and BVDV-1h, respectively.

572,Frequency and health outcome of bovine viral diarrhea virus detected in subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in permanently infected animals,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) cause acute and persistent infections. Acute infection results in generalized immunosuppression characterized by a reduction in circulating lymphocytes as a result of depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Persistent infection with BVDV is the result of immune tolerance and is not usually associated with lymphocytopenia. The health outcomes of permanently infected (PI) calves vary widely; some die from mucous disease, some succumb to bad attitudes, and others appear normal and survive to adulthood. Detection of BVDV at the single lymphoid cell level is important for examining subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during BVDV infections, but there are several methods that can be used to detect and quantify BVDV at this level. To overcome this challenge, a new flow cytometry-based PrimeFlow RNA assay was developed using in situ detection of BVDV. This assay was used to evaluate differences in viral distribution within subpopulations of PBMC over time in PI calves carrying one of two different types of BVDV (type 1 and type 2). Samples were taken from the calves at 3 different time points, approximately one month apart. During the course of the study, a subset of the calves died from maltreatment. Mucosal disease was not noted in any of the deaths. BVDV RNA was detected in all clinically healthy-appearing PI PBMCs using RNA probes specific for the BVDV N<sup>pro</sup>-E<sup>rns</sup> coding regions for each virus of interest. Calves succumbing to bad thrift were found to have little or no virus in their T cells. Clearance of the virus from T cells suggests a compromised immune tolerance in these calves. This is the first report of an observed pattern in viral load in T-cell subpopulations and survival in PI calves.",,"Falkenberg, S. M.;Dassanayake, R. P.;Walz, P.;Casas, E.;Neill, J. D.;Ridpath, J.

To identify the cause of PR outbreaks specifically among vaccinated pigs, 11 pseudorabies virus (PRV) field strains were isolated from Guangdong province during 2013-2014. Major viral genes (gE, TK, gI, PK, gD, 11K and 28K) were analyzed in this study. Insertions or deletions were observed in the gD, gE, gI and PK genes compared with other PRV isolates from all over the world. Furthermore, sequence alignment showed that insertions in gD and gE were unique molecular features of the new common PRV strains in China. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that our isolates clustered on an independent branch with other strains isolated from China in recent years and showed a closer genetic relationship with earlier isolates from Asia. Our results suggest that these isolates are novel PRV variants with unique molecular signatures.",,"Fan, J.;Zeng, X.;Zhang, G.;Wu, Q.;Niu, J.;Sun, B.;Xie, Q.;Ma, J.",2016.0,,10.4142/jvs.2016.17.3.369,0

Analyzes included examining the phylogenetic tree, evolution rates, amino acid substitutions, egg-adapted mutation, and homology modeling. We found differences between egg-adapted viruses and MDCK cell-derived viruses based on phylogenetic trees and evolutionary rates; viruses tended to ""NA>HA>MP"". Four amino acid substitutions (Q223R, V527 I, M19I and H275Y) were found in three egg-adapted viruses. Q223 Rand V527I was found in hemagglutinin protein, while M19I and H275Y were detected in neuraminidase. The Q223R mutation changed the structure of the antigenic regions between Sb and Ca2. H275Y is a classic neuraminidase resistance mutation. The results show that egg-adapted mutations occur when influenza viruses are isolated in chicken embryos from the Hubei influenza surveillance network. These mutations may affect the selection of vaccine candidates and vaccine efficacy; therefore, monitoring for egg-adapted mutations in the influenza surveillance network should be strengthened.",,"Fang, B.;Liu, L.;Ye, G.;Li, X.;Yu, X.;Jiang, Y.",2016.0,,,0

Neuraminidase evolves in a lineage-specific manner as the virus adapts to a new host or changes to escape the host's immune system. Therefore, many PIPs define positions that are undoubtedly involved in virus-host interactions. Phylogenetically significant regions (PIRs) are defined as several PIPs close together. There are 15 PIRs in N1 and 12 in N2, seven of which are shared between the two subtypes. Many PIRs overlap with antigenic or glycosylation sites.

577,Selection of vaccine strains of foot and mouth disease virus for use in South Africa,"The SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 (SAT: South African Territories) strains of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus are most widely represented in Southern African countries, particularly the SAT 2 virus. Since 1982, 139 isolates of these virus types have been examined. O and other type A viruses have been detected in the north of this region. Typing and subtyping of viruses by complement fixation (CF) testing can be enhanced using monoclonal antibody panels (MAbs) that provide an accurate antigenic profile of a new strain. A total of 33 strains of SAT 2 were investigated using MAbs and the results allow classification of viruses into groups presenting the same profile. The author presents comparisons using conventional serotyping methods (CF and virus neutralization (VN) tests) of isolates and vaccine viruses, as well as profiling of isolates using MAbs. Both analysis methods provide information about the relationships between viruses. The CF and VN tests provide details on how animals respond to a particular isolate and how that antibody response will recognize another isolate; from this, serological relationships can be proposed regarding how different isolates may induce a humoral immune response. With MAb profiling, details of antigenic relationships between isolates are obtained, allowing the identification of individual epitopic variations. These analyzes may provide the potential to place different isolates into 'antigenic' groups. Compared with the vaccine viruses, the vaccine virus with the closest profile to the isolate group can be tried to be detected. Immunological analysis (for example, using the CF tests used in this paper) can provide more information about the association between a particular vaccine and MAb profiling and an identified antigenic group. Of course, this MAb profile can provide essential information in a very short time, which is particularly useful in an emergency. Confirmation of results from profiling will then be provided by serological analysis. Such pooled assays provide a more comprehensive description of the antigenic and immunogenic relationships between FMD virus isolates and between isolates and vaccine viruses.",,"Fargeaud, D.",1995.0,,,0
578,Intra-epidemic genome variation in the highly pathogenic African swine fever virus (ASFV) from the country of Georgia,"BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes acute hemorrhagic infection of clothing, with a mortality rate of up to 100%. No vaccine is available and the potential for catastrophic disease remains high in Europe due to the ongoing ASF epidemic in Russia and the Baltic states. To date, no intra-epidemic complete genome variation has been reported for ASFV. To provide a more comprehensive basis for genetic variation early in the ASF epidemic, we sequenced two Georgian ASFV samples, G-2008/1 and G-2008/2, derived from domestic pig blood collected in 2008. METHODS: Genomic DNA was directly extracted from low volume ASFV PCR positive pig blood samples and subjected to next-generation sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform. De novo and mapped sequence assemblies were performed using CLCBio software. Genomic plots, sequence alignments, and assembly patterns were created using Geneious v10.2.4. Sequence repeat architecture was analyzed using DNASTAR GeneQuest 14.1.0. RESULTS: The G-2008/1 and G-2008/2 genomes were distinguished from each other by encoding changes in seven genes, including MGF 110-1 L, X69R, MGF 505-10R, EP364R, H233R, E199L and MGF 360. -21R, in addition to eight homopolymer pathway variations. The 2008/2 genome had a novel allele status at a previously unidentified intergenic repeat locus between the C315R and C147L genes. The C315R/C147L locus represents the earliest observed variable repeat sequence polymorphism reported among those isolated from this outbreak. No sequence variation was observed in conventional ASFV subtyping markers. The two genomes exhibited complete linearity and identical gene content with the Georgia 2007/1 reference genome. Approximately 56 unique homopolymer A/T pathway variations unique to the Georgia 2007/1 genome were identified. In both 2008 genomes, within-sample sequence read heterogeneity was evident in six homopolymeric G/C pathways restricted to the known hypervariable ~7 kb region in the left terminal region of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported intra-epidemic comparative genomic analysis for ASFV and provides insight into the intra-epidemic microevolution of ASFV. The genomes reported here, in addition to the G-2007/1 genome, provide an early basis for future genome-level comparisons and epidemiological monitoring efforts.",,"Farlow, J.;Donduashvili, M.;Kokhreidze, M.;Kotorashvili, A.;Vepkhvadze, N.

579,Foreign matter detection in vaccines - Review of technical aspects,"The quality and safety of commercial vaccines is of paramount importance. Contrary to all precautions and efforts, the use of biological material in vaccine development and manufacture can lead to potential contamination of vaccines with known and unknown foreign agents (EAs). In the veterinary field, official lists of EAs have been compiled as a legal framework. potential agents that need to be tested during the manufacture of vaccines. However, the detection of known and unknown contaminants in vaccines is a common task for manufacturers and authorities in both the veterinary and human fields, who share the similar needs of specific technical approaches. State-of-the-art molecular methods such as large parallel sequencing (MPS) or randomized PCR coupled with microarrays can open new perspectives in foreign matter testing. The robustness and efficacy of this technical approach in vaccine control was clearly demonstrated in a human vaccine sample when swine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) contamination occurred in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine.

580,Xenosurveillance reflects traditional sampling techniques for the identification of human pathogens: a comparative study in West Africa.,"Background New surveillance strategies are needed to detect the rapid and sustained emergence of infectious disease agents. Ideally, the application of new sampling strategies should be simple, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that utilizes blood collected by hematophagus arthropods to track and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals, often found in large populations. Also, many species of domestic or peridomestic mosquitoes will preferentially get their food by sucking blood from humans, making them a unique and largely unused reservoir for collecting human blood. Methodology/Basic findings By systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trip in northern Liberia, we sought to exploit this phenomenon to determine whether the pathogen sequences from bloodstained mosquitoes accurately reflect those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans by fingertip and aspirating blood-feeding mosquitoes from inside the homes. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these samples was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples from the xenosurveillance and fingerprint blood draw produced a similar number and quality of reads relative to the two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus. Conclusions/Significance This study presents the first systematic comparison between alien surveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the feasibility of alien surveillance as a tool for sampling human blood for circulating pathogens.",,"Fauver, J.

581,Duck gut viral metagenome analysis captures snapshot of viral diversity,"BACKGROUND: Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) are an economically important waterfowl for meat, eggs and feathers; it is also a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. The emergence of new viruses is attributed to the coexistence of multiple virus species and subtypes in their reservoir hosts. An in-depth understanding of virome status in major reservoir species is essential for effective prediction of future viral outbreak or pandemic. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric pathway of ducks by the viral metagenomic approach, we deeply sequenced viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from a flock of 23 ducks that share water bodies with wild migratory birds. RESULT: A total of 7,455,180 reads were produced at an average length of 146 bases, of which 7,354,300 reads were de novo merged into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases, and the remaining 100,880 reads were singular. The duck viroma was identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E score, <10(-3)) against the viral reference database. Numerous sequences of duck viromes were homologous to animal virus of the family Papillomaviridae; and phages of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae families and unclassified phages. In addition, several sequences of duck viromes were homologous to insect viruses of the families Poxviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Baculoviridae, Densovirinae, Iflaviridae, and Dicistroviridae; and plant viruses of the families Secoviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae and Partitiviridae, reflecting the diet and placement of ducks.

586,Initial evaluation of the classic swine fever marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf for oral vaccination of wild boar under field conditions,"Oral vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) is a powerful tool to control disease outbreaks in wild boars. So far, vaccination campaigns have been conducted using live attenuated vaccines that do not allow serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although this disadvantage is acceptable for wild boar, the use of marker vaccines will facilitate studies on disease and vaccination dynamics. Recently, the CSF marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf was evaluated for oral immunization under laboratory conditions. The promising results led to efforts to study the vaccine candidate in field conditions and feed formulation. In this context, two oral vaccination campaigns were carried out with CP7_E2alf feed vaccines in two areas called 'faunistic hunting farms' in the Umbria region of Italy. One campaign was run using a single vaccination, the second with a routinely applied double vaccination strategy. Both campaigns were conducted without concerted hunting actions. Feed intake, vaccine virus detection, and antibody responses were evaluated along with reviews on bowel cleansing. As a comparator, seven wild boars were hand-fed with feed under laboratory conditions. In the field, feed intake ranged from 63.7% to 98.7%, with antibody prevalence reaching only 33.3-35.1%. Marker serology showed that sample quality had a strong influence on the test result, with a total of 85% correct classification of samples. The vaccine virus could not be detected. Under hand-feeding conditions, six out of seven wild boars received at least one feed, and five of these showed detectable antibody levels seven weeks post-vaccination. These results were supported by stability tests. Appropriate stability of the vaccine virus has been demonstrated in both field and laboratory conditions. In total, most results were in line with our expectations. However, optimization of the DIVA test should be attempted in the future. © 2014.",,"Feliziani, F.;Blome, S.;Petrini, S.;Giammarioli, M.;Iscaro, C.;Severi, G.;Convito, L.;Pietschmann, J.;Beer, M.;De Mia, G.

587,Co-localization and interaction of duck enteritis virus glycoprotein H and L,"Background: Duck Enteritis Virus (DEV), belonging to the Î±-herpesvirus subfamily, is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. Glycoproteins H and L (gH and gL) encoded by UL22 and UL1 are conserved in the family of herpes viruses. They play important roles as gH/gL dimers during viral entry into host cells via cell-cell fusion. The interaction between gH and gL has been confirmed in various human herpes viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this article, we examined the interaction between DEV gH and gL. Results: Recombinant plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL were successfully generated. Expressions of both DEV gH and gL were observed after 12 h of incubation of COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL, respectively. Furthermore, co-localization of a ratio of gH and gL was detected in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells after co-transfection for 24 h. Recombinant plasmids pCMV-Flag-gL and pCMV-Myc-gH were then generated and co-transfected into COS-7 cells. Both gH and gL were shown to be tested with positive results by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Results: Our results demonstrated not only the co-localization of DEV gH and gL in COS-7 cells, but also the interaction between them.

Analysis of S1 gene sequences amplified from 62 isolated strains along with 40 reference strains published in Genbank showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 63.5% to 99.9% and amino acid homologies ranging from 57.9% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Chinese IBV strains clustered in six different genetic groups (I-VI). Most of the isolated strains belonged to group I and isolation of group V strains increased compared to a previous surveillance period. The current vaccine strains (H120, H52, W93, and Ma5) used in China formed the Mass group, which is evolutionarily distant from the Chinese isolates. Alignment of S1 amino acid sequences revealed polymorphic and diverse substitutions, insertions and deletions, and the S1 protein of the major pandemic strains contained 540 amino acids with a cleavage site sequence of HRRRR or RRF(L/S)RR. Further analysis showed that recombination events formed a new subgroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that various IBV variants circulated and genetically evolved together in Southern China during the observation period.

A total of 626 patients diagnosed with HFMD in Shanghai, China from January 2012 to September 2013 were included in this study. Of these, 292 CVA6-infected cases were subjected to clinical analysis. Whole genome sequencing, recombination and phylogenetic analyzes were also performed. A recombinant CVA6 monophyletic strain was found during a CVA6-related HFMD outbreak in Shanghai, China in November 2012 and comprised 21.9% (64/292) of CVA6 strains over the study period. Recombination analyzes showed that the 2C gene of the novel CVA6 virus was probably derived from a circulating coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) strain in the population. Clinical observation has shown that this recombinant CVA6 virus causes a more generalized rash than non-recombinant CVA6 virus.

591,Disease outbreaks caused by steppe-type rabies viruses in China,"Although rabies is a major public health problem in China, the epidemiology of animal rabies in the northern and northwestern border provinces is unknown. From February 2013 to March 2014, seven outbreaks of pet rabies caused by wild carnivores were reported in the Xinjiang (XJ) and Inner Mongolia (IM) Autonomous Regions of China and were diagnosed in brain samples of infected animals by fluorescent antibody testing (FAT). and RT-PCR. Ten fields of rabies virus were obtained. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis based on the complete N gene (1353 bp) amplified directly from the original brain tissues showed that these ten strains were steppe-type viruses closely related to strains reported in Russia and Mongolia. None had been previously described in China. Viruses from XJ and IM clustered separately in the two lineages, showing their distinct geographic distribution.

Viruses were isolated from three White-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), a Whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) and a Lesser fly (Calidris minuta). Prior to our study, only two complete APMV-8 sequences had been reported worldwide since their discovery in the US and Japan in the 1970s.

593,Pathogenesis of Influenza D Virus in Cattle,"NOT LABELED: Cattle has been proposed as the natural reservoir for a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae virus family tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Although isolated from sick animals, it is unclear whether IDV causes any clinical disease in cattle. To address this aspect of Koch's assumptions, three dairy calves (treatment animals) kept in separate pens were intranasally inoculated with IDV strain D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014. 1 day after inoculation, one seronegative calf (contact animal) was added to each of the treated animal houses. The virus was detected in seroconverted and respiratory tracts in cattle in both the treatment and contact groups. Histologically, there was a significant increase in neutrophil tracking in the tracheal epithelium of treatment calves compared to control animals. While infected and contact animals showed various symptoms of respiratory infection, they were mild and the calves in the treatment group did not differ from controls in heart rate, respiratory rate or rectal temperature. To mimic zoonotic transmission, two ferrets were exposed to a plastic toy fomite soaked with infected nasal discharge from treated calves. This ferret did not shed the virus or the seroconverter. In summary, this study shows that IDV causes a mild respiratory illness upon experimental infection of cattle and can be effectively transmitted between cattle by in-pente contact, but cannot be transferred from cattle to ferrets via fomite exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that cattle are a natural reservoir for the virus. IMPORTANT: A new influenza virus has been identified in swine, cattle, sheep and goats that has been tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Among these hosts, cattle have been proposed as natural reservoirs. In this study, we show that bovines experimentally infected with IDV can shed the virus and transmit it to other cattle by direct contact, but not via fomite routes to ferrets. IDV induced minor clinical signs in infected cattle, fulfilling another Koch's assumption for this new agent, but other objective clinical endpoints did not differ from those of control animals. Although the disease observed was mild, IDV induced neutrophil tracking and epithelial attenuation in the bovine trachea, which may facilitate coinfection with other pathogens and in doing so predispose animals to bovine respiratory disease.",,"Ferguson, L.;Olivier, A.

594,Molecular and phylogenetic characterization based on the complete genome of the pathotype of a virulent Newcastle disease virus isolated in Brazil in the 1970s.,"Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which includes a diverse group of viruses with a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. ND is one of the most important diseases of chickens as it seriously affects poultry production worldwide. In the 1970s, virulent ND outbreaks were recorded in Brazil and strain APMV-1/Chicken/Brazil/SJM/75 (SJM) of NDV was isolated. This strain was characterized as highly pathogenic for chickens but not pathogenic for other avian species. Here, we present the complete genome of the NDV strain SJM and explore the phylogenetic relationships of this virus with other NDV strains in terms of genome and protein composition, as well as characterizing the evolutionary process. NDV strain SJM is categorized as a velogenic virus, and the complete genome is 15,192 nucleotides long, consisting of six genes in the order 3'-NP-PMF-HN-L-5'. The presence of the major pathogenic determinant of NDV strains (112R-RQK-Râ†“F117) was identified in the Fusion protein of NDV strain SJM. In addition, phylogenetic analysis classified the NDV lineage SJM as a member of class II, genotype V, showing that this virus helps us understand the evolutionary process of strains belonging to this genotype. This work adds to the growing interest in involving the characterization of NDV isolates to improve our current understanding of the epidemiology, surveillance and evolution of pathogenic strains.

595,Molecular detection of bovine Noroviruses in Argentine dairy calves: Circulation of a tentative new genotype.,"Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens detected in fecal samples of both diarrheal and nondiarrheal calves from various countries around the world. However, epidemiological information on bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many major cattle producing countries from South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheal dairy calves (B4836, B4848 and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies of these three samples based on a partial coding region for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) and the third (B4848). ) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region of two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) by the availability of another sequence (B4881), which shares the highest genetic association with genotype 1 but is far enough away to establish a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and the capsid protein-coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). Based on these data, this strain may be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in the worldwide literature. Further analysis even suggested that this strain could be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively designated GIII.4. The data provide important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.",,"Ferragut, F.;Vega, C.

596,Oligonucleotide microchip for subtyping influenza A virus,"BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenic properties of two outer glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen subtypes of HA and nine species of NA are known. Recently, circulations of some subtypes (H7N7, H5N1) have been closely monitored because of the epidemiological threat they present. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the potential of using gel-based microchip technology for rapid and sensitive molecular subtyping of influenza A virus. METHODS: The method uses a microchip consisting of 3D gel-based elements with immobilized probes. Segments of the HA and NA genes are amplified using multiplex RT-PCR and then microchip hybridized. RESULTS: The developed microchip was validated using a panel of 21 known reference strains of influenza virus. The selected strains represented different HA and NA subtypes derived from avian, porcine and human hosts. The entire procedure takes 10 hours and allows one to identify 15 HA subtypes and two NA subtypes. Forty-one clinical specimens (Russia, 2005) isolated during poultry decline in Novosibirsk were successfully identified using the proposed technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 76% and 100%, respectively, when compared to the 'gold standard' techniques (virus isolation with the following characterization by immunoassay). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that subtyping using gel-based microchips is a promising approach for rapid detection and identification of influenza A and can greatly improve its monitoring.",,"Fesenko, E.

597,"Epidemiological investigation and analysis of protein variability of the NS5B gene and non-primate hepacivirus in several equine cohorts from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","Among the recently disclosed hepacivirus strains, non-primate hepacivirus/hepacivirus A in horses and donkeys is closely related to human hepatitis C virus (HCV). Therefore, the horse is an attractive surrogate large animal model for HCV therapy, pathogenesis and prophylaxis studies. Despite global efforts, epidemiological and genetic studies have not been able to elucidate the risk factors, virus distribution, or genetic variability of hepacivirus A, which is also important for equine welfare. Very little information about this background scene is available in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with hepacivirus A infection among different horse cohorts in the state of Rio de Janeiro and to evaluate the diversity of the viral NS5B gene and protein. Hepacivirus A RNA was detected in equine cohorts from all geographic mesoregions, regardless of horse activity or breed investigated. The statewide prevalence ranges from 4.0% to 27.5%. Potential risk factors such as geographic location and age of female horses were significantly associated with the presence of virus RNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulation of subtype 2 in all meso-regions. NS5B gene sequences clustered by geographic origin, whereas NS5B fragments did not allow for discriminant analysis. The predicted NS5B protein showed significant protection, particularly in the thumb area. In conclusion, the higher frequency of hepacivirus A RNA detection in breeding horses and young females suggests a direct link between reproductive practices and spread of the virus. Additional studies are required to understand the distribution of this genetically conserved hepacivirus.",,"Figueiredo, A. S.;Lampe, E.;de Albuquerque, Pplf;Chalhoub, F. L. V.;de Filippis, A. M.

598,Bat astroviruses: Toward understanding the transmission dynamics of a neglected virus family,"Bats belong to the order Chiroptera, which represents the second largest order of mammals with over 1,200 species and an almost global distribution. Environmental changes and deforestation have severely affected many ecosystems, intensifying contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a wide variety of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to this day. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent of diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses were thought to be strictly species-specific. However, a large genetic diversity has recently been discovered between animal and human astroviruses, which may indicate the potential for these viruses to overcome species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge of the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been extended to some neurotropic strains recently shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and animals. This review provides an overview of what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans and livestock, particularly cattle and pigs. Future research activities are recommended to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further evaluate the zoonotic potential of these viruses.",,"Fischer, K.;dos Reis, V.

599,A mutation 'Hot Spot' in Schmallenberg virus M-segment,"In autumn 2011, Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel orthobunia virus of the Simbu serogroup, was identified by metagenomic analysis in Germany. SBV has since been detected in ruminant animals all over Europe and research has been conducted on phylogenetic relationships, clinical manifestations and epidemiology. However, until now, only comparative sequence analysis of SBV genome segments with other strains of the Simbu serogroup has been performed, and detailed data on S and M segments related to virus-host-cell interaction have been lacking. In this study, we investigated S- and M-segment sequences from 24 SBV positive field samples from sheep, cattle and goats collected from all over Germany. The results showed that the overall genome variability of SBV is neither regional nor dependent on host species. However, we have characterized for the first time a region with high sequence variability (a mutation 'hot spot') within the glycoprotein Gc encoded by the M segment. © 2013 SGM.",,"Fischer, M.;Hoffmann, B.;Goller, K.

The aim of this study was to identify a method for genotyping SuHV-1 based on the partial sequences of the gene encoding the gene for glycoprotein C (gC) and to elucidate possible reasons for the variability of this region. A total of 109 g of sequences collected from GenBank were divided into five main groups after reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree by Bayesian inference. Analysis showed that a portion of the gC (approximately 671 bp) was under selective pressure at various points coinciding with sites of protein defect. It was also possible to divide SuHV-1 into five genotypes that evolved under different selective pressures. These genotypes are not country or continent specific, perhaps due to multiple entry events related to pig imports.",,"Fonseca, A. A., Jr.;Camargos, M. F.;Sales, M. L.;Heinemann, M. B.;Leite, R.

609,Genomic analysis of the multi-host pathogen Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae reveals extensive recombination as well as the existence of three generalist branches with wide geographic distribution.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of how bacterial populations are structured is an important prerequisite for studying their ecology and evolutionary history, facilitating research on host specificity, pathogenicity, geographic distribution, and molecular epidemiology. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is an opportunistic pathogen currently re-emerging in both the swine and poultry industries globally. This bacterium causes occasional deaths in captive marine mammals and has recently been implicated in large-scale wildlife killings. However, despite its economic importance and wide geographic and host distribution, including zoonotic potential, the global diversity, recombination rates, and population structure of this bacterium are poorly characterized. In this study, we performed a large-scale genomic comparison of E. rhusipathiae based on a diverse collection of isolates to address these information gaps. RESULTS: Eighty-three E. rhusipathiae isolates from a range of host species and geographic origins isolated between 1958 and 2014 were sequenced and combined using both reference-based mapping and de novo splicing. We found that a large portion (58%) of the core genome undergoes recombination. Therefore, we used three independent methods resistant to the presence of recombination to define the population structure of this species: a phylogenetic tree and network analysis based on a set of conserved protein sequences in silico chromosome staining. All three methods were broadly compatible and supported the existence of three different clades within the E. rhusiopathiae species. Although we found some evidence of host and geographic clustering, each clan contained isolates from a variety of host species and from multiple continents. RESULTS: Using whole genome sequence data, we validated recent suggestions that E. rhusipathiae is a weakly clonal species that has been extensively shaped by homologous recombination. Despite frequent recombination, we can reliably identify three distinct classes that are not clearly separated by host species or geographic origin. Our results provide a fundamental basis for future molecular epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of E. rhusiopathiae and facilitate comparisons with other recombinogenic, multi-host bacteria.",,"Forde, T.;Biek, R.;Zadoks, R.;Workentine, M.

610,Genetic diversity among pandemic 2009 influenza viruses isolated from a transmission chain,"BACKGROUND: Influenza viruses such as swine influenza A(H1N1) virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) generate genetic variation due to the high error rate of their RNA polymerases, often resulting in mixed genotype populations (intra-host variants) within a cell. single infection. This variation helps influenza respond rapidly to selection pressures such as those imposed by the immunological host response and antiviral therapy. We performed deep sequencing to characterize influenza intra-host variation in a transmission chain consisting of three cases due to oseltamivir-susceptible viruses and one derived oseltamivir-resistant case. METHODS: Following detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, we performed in-depth sequencing of the complete NA gene from two of the oseltamivir-susceptible virus-infected cases and all eight gene segments of the viruses causing the remaining two cases. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of a resistance-causing mutation (resulting in NA H275Y substitution) was observed in oseltamivir-susceptible subjects. Furthermore, deep sequencing revealed a subpopulation of oseltamivir-susceptible viruses in the case carrying resistant viruses. We detected a higher level of intra-host variation in the case with oseltamivir-resistant viruses than in those infected with oseltamivir-susceptible viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir resistance was detected only after prophylaxis with oseltamivir, suggesting that the mutation was selected as a result of antiviral intervention. The persistent oseltamivir-susceptible virus population in the case carrying resistant viruses suggests that either a small proportion survive the treatment or that the oseltamivir-susceptible virus quickly re-establishes itself in the virus population after the bottleneck. Moreover, the increased intra-host variation in the oseltamivir resistant case is consistent with the hypothesis that population diversity of an RNA virus may increase rapidly after a population bottleneck.",,"Fordyce, S.

611,Detection of hepatitis E virus in samples of animal origin collected in Hungary,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmitted human pathogen. HEV infections are mainly associated with acute, self-limiting, icteric hepatitis with a mean mortality of 1%. Animal reservoirs are thought to play an important role in the protection of the virus and the spread of HEV to humans. HEV-induced seroconversion has been described in several species, but clinical hepatitis has not been observed in animals to date. The fact that HEV strains derived from animals are genetically closely related to human HEV isolates supports the notion of zoonotic transmission of the virus. In this comprehensive study, HEV formation was investigated in Hungarian wild and domestic animal samples. HEV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in liver samples of wild boar, roe deer and deer. Studies of domestic pig samples detected HEV in 39% of Hungarian pig farms surveyed. Concurrent research revealed no definite difference in the frequency of HEV positivity between liver and fecal samples of domestic pigs. The highest (36%) incidence of HEV infection was found among 11-16 week old pigs. Samples from domestic cattle and rodents collected from pig farms, forests and meadows tested negative for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences amplified in the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of the selected strains revealed that the viruses detected belonged to three subgroups of the third gengroup. HEV is closely related to human and porcine HEV strains detected in different countries. Studies have revealed the widespread distribution of HEV in Hungarian wild ungulate and domestic pig populations with significant genetic variation across strains. © 2009 Elsevier BV",,"ForgÃ¡ch, P.;Nowotny, N.;ErdÃ©lyi, K.;Boncz, A.;Zentai, J.;Szucs, G.;Reuter, G.;Bakonyi, T.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.004,0
612,Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction for Differentiation of Massachusetts Vaccine and Brazilian Field Genotypes of Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus is classified according to serotypes or genotypes (or both) in different poultry producing countries of the world. In Brazil, the Massachusetts type (Mass) and local field Brazilian variants (genotypes; BR) used as live vaccines predominate in commercial poultry flocks. This work describes the development and validation of two real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluids and clinical specimens. Genotype-specific primers combined with a generic probe targeting the S1 gene constituted Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR-specific assays. The analytical sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison to an IBV generic real-time RT-PCR based on the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five Mass field isolates, three vaccine samples and one co-infected sample (BR and Mass), while BR RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible, and as sensitive as the conventional 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 IBV clinical specimens, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR, and 2 for both tests. Of the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive for the 5'UTR RT-qPCR only and 30 were negative for the three assays. As a result, both analyzes were able to detect Mass and BR genotypes, allowing fast and easy IBV molecular typing from allantoic fluids and clinical samples.",,"Fraga, A. P.;Ikuta, N.;Fonseca, A.

613,Discovery of parvovirus-related sequences in an unexpectedly wide range of animals,"Our knowledge of the genetic diversity and host ranges of viruses is piecemeal. This is especially true for the Parvoviridae family. Genetic diversity studies of single-stranded DNA viruses within this family have largely focused on species that infect arthropods and vertebrates that cause diseases of humans and our pets: a focus that distorts our perception of parvovirus diversity. While metagenomic approaches can help correct this bias, so can transcriptomic studies. Large amounts of transcriptomic data are available for a wide variety of animal species and may contain detectable viral transcripts when this data is erroneously collected from infected individuals. Therefore, we conducted a systematic search for parvovirus-related sequences (PRSs) in publicly available databases of transcripts, genomes, and proteins, and eleven new transcriptome datasets. This revealed 463 PRSs in transcript databases from 118 animals. At least 41 of these PRSs are likely integrated into animal genomes, as they are also found in genomic sequence databases. In addition to elucidating the ubiquity of parvoviruses, the number of parvoviral sequences discovered in public databases has revealed numerous previously unknown parvovirus-host combinations; especially in invertebrates.

614,Classification of cowpox viruses into several branches and identification of a new strain,"Cowpox virus (CPXV) was considered as a uniform species within the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Previous phylogenetic analysis showed that CPXV is polyphyletic and isolates can cluster in distinct clades, where two of these clades show genetic similarities to variola (VARV) or vaccinia viruses (VACV). Further analyzes were initiated to assess both the genetic diversity and the evolutionary background of circulating CPXVs. Here we report full-length sequences of 20 CPXV strains isolated from different animal species and humans in Germany. Phylogenetic analysis of a total of 83 full-length OPV genomes confirmed the polyphyletic character of the CPXV strain and suggested at least four distinct segments. The German isolates from this study clustered mainly in two CPXV-like branches and no VARV- and VACV-like strains were observed. A single strain isolated from a cottony tamarind clustered away from all other CPXVs and may represent a new and unique evolutionary lineage. Classification of CPXV strains into clades roughly followed their geographical origins, with the highest clan diversity ever observed for Germany. We also found evidence for recombination between OPV strands without significant disruption in clustering observed. In conclusion, this analysis significantly expands the number of CPXV full-length sequences available and confirms the co-circulation of several CPXV clades in Germany and provides the first data on a new evolutionary CPXV lineage.",,"Franke, A.;Pfaff, F.;Jenckel, M.;Hoffmann, B.;HÃ¶per, D.;Antwerpen, M.;Meyer, H.;Beer, M.;Hoffmann, D.",2017.0,,10.3390/v9060142,0

This study aimed to investigate the potential role of viral agents in PFTS-affected and healthy animals by evaluating the virome composition of different organs using a metagenomic approach. This analysis allowed the demonstration of a higher abundance of Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) in healthy subjects, while increased Ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (BoPV2), Ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (PPV), and Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) in pigs with PFTS. No abundance of different RNA viruses was found between PFTS-affected and control pigs. Remarkably, this is the first molecular characterization of PPV6 and BoPV2 in Spain and one of the few worldwide, supporting their apparent widespread circulation. Interestingly, PCV-3 has been recently identified in several clinical-pathological conditions, as well as in healthy pigs, whereas the pathogenic potential of BoPV2 is unknown. Although the results obtained should be taken as preliminary, it opens the door to further studies on the potential role of these viruses or their combinations as predisposing factor/s for the formation of PFTS.",,"Franzo, G.;Kekarainen, T.;Llorens, A.;Correa-Fiz, F.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2019.0,,10.1136/vr.105125,0
616,Subpopulations in aMPV vaccines are unlikely to be the sole cause of virulence.,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) frequently infects the respiratory and reproductive tracts of domestic birds with secondary infections and causes serious economic losses in many parts of the world. While the disease in general is effectively controlled with live vaccines, virulence of these vaccines has been demonstrated several times. Consensus sequence mutations involved in the process have been identified on more than one occasion. In a previous subtype A aMPV candidate vaccine study, small subpopulations were included. In the current study, the presence of subpopulations in a subtype B vaccine was investigated by deep sequencing. Of the 19 positions where the vaccine (strain VCO3/50) and progenitor (strain VCO3/60616) consensus sequences differed, subpopulations were found to have sequence-matching progenitor sequences at 4 positions. However, none of these mutations occurred in a virulent return of that vaccine, thus demonstrating that the majority of the progenitor virus population did not survive the weakening process and thus were clearly not involved in any virulence reversion. However, a single nucleotide variation was found in the vaccine that agreed with the consensus sequence of a derived virulent revertant virus, so this and other undetected, potentially virulent subpopulations may be involved in the reversal. Much deeper sequencing of progenitor, vaccine, and revertant may clarify whether problematic virulent subpopulations are present and therefore need to be routinely removed during aMPV vaccine preparation prior to registration and release.",,"Franzo, G.;Naylor, C.

In vertebrates, the LEP gene symbol is reserved for leptin, a key regulator of energy balance in mammals. Results: Expanding this search by initiating a comprehensive search for this gene in genome data made available to public databases with the duck genome manuscript All avian genomes in the whole genome shotgun sequencing database, we were able to report the first identification of coding sequences capable of encoding the complete leptin protein precursor in wild birds. Gene structure, synthesis and sequence similarity (up to 54% identity and 68% identity) to reptilian leptin in hawks (Falco peregrinus and cherrug), udders (Pseudopodoces humilis), finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and pigeons (Columba livia) confirmed avian leptin was a true ortholog of the mammalian form. However, in the duck, as in other domestic poultry, the LEP gene could not be identified. Conclusion: The lack of LEP gene in poultry suggests that birds that have lost it are particularly suitable for domestication. The identification of an intact avian gene for leptin in wild birds may partially explain the evolutionary conservation of its receptor in leptin-free poultry.

619,Implications for the crystal structure and host adaptation of porcine vesicular disease virus,"Porcine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is an Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family that causes symptoms indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease virus. Phylogenetic studies have shown that it is a recently evolved genetic subset of the important human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5) and, in agreement with this, uses the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for cell entry. The 3.0-a… crystal structure (highly virulent) of strain UK/27/72 SVDV reveals the expected similarity in core structure to that of other picornaviruses and shows the closest existing structure to CBV5, most similar to that of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3). . Properties that help assemble and solidify protein subunits are expanding in this virus, perhaps explaining its extreme tolerance to environmental factors. Using the multiple capsid sequences available for both SVDV and CBV5, we mapped amino acid substitutions that may have occurred during the putative adaptation of SVDV to a new host on the structure of SVDV and a model of the SVDV/CAR complex produced. Referring to the complex of CBV3 and CAR visualized by cryo-electron microscopy. The alterations are divided into three clusters as follows: one row of five-fold pore, the second pairs with the CAR-binding site and partially overlaps with the degradation accelerating factor (DAF) site to bind to echovirus 7 (ECHO7), and the third lies close to where the low-density lipoprotein receptor binds to the minor rhinovirus group. to the five-fold axis. Subsequent changes in SVDV (post 1971) map to the first two clusters and may have improved the adaptation of the virus to pigs by optimizing the recognition of a porcine CAR and/or DAF homologue.",,"Fry, E.

620,Molecular detection and typing of duck hepatitis A virus directly from clinical specimens,"To develop a new approach for detection and typing of duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV), a pair of non-degenerate primers were designed to amplify a âˆ¼250-bp genomic region at 5â€²UTR. 3 reference strains and 6 duck embryo-derived isolates containing 2 serotypes from various regions of China were successfully amplified with the primer set. The molecular typing method was developed by determining the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon. Nucleotide identity was 94% with homologous serotype and 73% with heterologous serotype when isolate sequences were compared with DHAV 5-UTR sequences found in public databases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic clustering of 5-UTR sequences of a homologous serotype and confirmed the new classification of DHAV (two new serotypes recently described in Taiwan and South Korea, respectively) to three identified genotypes (A, B, and C). Analysis of the results by capsid coding region showed that the primer pair should aid in the detection of DHAV and the amplicon sequence contains type-specific information and can be used for efficient and rapid molecular typing. Molecular methods have proven their usefulness through the detection and typing of DHAV directly from 28 liver samples collected from dead ducklings during duck viral hepatitis epidemics in different parts of China between 2001 and 2007. The results confirmed the presence of DHAV in all 28 samples. and A (13/28) and C (15/28) genotypes of DHAV circulated together in China.

621,Comparative transcriptome analyzes show enhanced cellular protection against FMDV in PK15 cells pretreated with IFN-Î³.,"Interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) can induce a host antiviral response against foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of IFN-Î³ anti-FMDV infection in host cells, high-throughput RNA sequencing was analyzed for systemic changes in gene expression profiles in FMDV-infected PK15 cells with or without IFN-Î³ pretreatment. More than 25 million reads covering 1.2–1.5 Gb were analyzed from each experimental panel. FMDV challenge altered the transcription of genes that positively and negatively regulate cell death or apoptosis; however, the expected immunosuppression response was not clear. IFN-Î³ pretreatment normalized the increase in apoptosis with FMDV infection. Moreover, transcription factors required for IFN-Î³ functioning, STAT1 and IRF1 were upregulated by IFN-Î³ pretreatment and stimulated downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These induced ISGs are mainly responsible for antigen processing, antigen presentation or antiviral defense. Interestingly, a synergistic effect was observed on some ISGs, including OAS1, OAS2, MX1, MX2, RIG-I, and IFIT1, in combination therapy compared to IFN-Î³ therapy alone. The proposed effects identified by RNA sequencing were consistent with the cellular morphology changes and were confirmed by the respective protein markers. This is the first report to investigate transcriptome changes caused by FMDV infection with or without IFN-Î³ pretreatment. Identified key host genes controlling cell survival in vitro expand our comprehensive understanding of how IFN-Î³ inhibits FMDV infection and may shed light on the development of improved FMD control approaches.",,"Fu, Y.;Zhu, Z.;Chang, H.;Liu, Z.;Liu, J.;Chen, H.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2016.03.027,0

623,Bovine herpesvirus-1: comparison and differentiation of vaccine and field strains based on genomic sequence variation,"Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) causes major diseases in cattle, including respiratory, fetal diseases and reproductive tract infections. Control programs often include vaccination with a modified live viral (MLV) vaccine. Sometimes BoHV-1 strains are isolated from infected animals or fetuses after vaccination. Currently there are no markers to distinguish MLV strains from field strains of BoHV-1. In this study, several BoHV-1 strains were sequenced using whole genome sequencing technologies, and the data were analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The strains sequenced included the reference BoHV-1 Cooper strain (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial MLV vaccine strains, and 14 field strains from the cases submitted for diagnosis. Based on SNP analyses, viruses can be classified into groups with similar SNP patterns. Eight MLV strains can be distinguished, although some are closely related. A number of field strains isolated from animals with a history of prior vaccination had SNP patterns similar to specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates were very different from all vaccine strains. The results suggest that some BoHV-1 isolates from clinically sick cattle/fetus may be associated with a previous MLV vaccination history, but more information is needed on the rate of BoHV-1 genome sequence alteration before irrefutable associations can be established. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fulton, R.

Antigenic drift is driven by the accumulation of point mutations in HA. And the receptor binding specificity of HA is responsible for the host range restriction of the virus. In April 2009, large new outbreaks of H1N1 influenza were reported in the human population from North America. The pandemic H1N1 virus was caused by the swine flu virus. The evolutionary process after the introduction of the pandemic virus into the human population has not been clarified. We performed phylogenetic analyzes that construct and calculate a phylogenetic tree for site-based selective pressures in the HA gene. The phylogenetic tree showed that pandemic viruses were not clearly clustered in the phylogenetic tree based on their geographic location or isolation time. The virus is circulating the world extensively, with multiple entries in most geographic areas. We found 3 positively selected regions in the HA gene for the pandemic H1N1 virus. Among them, position 206 is located in an antigenic region. We did not find significant negative selection at any of the receptor binding sites.

627,Unexpected Dynamics of Inter-farm Transmission During a High-Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreak,"UNLABELED: Next-generation sequencing technology is now increasingly applied to study the intra-host and inter-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information about the evolution of the avian influenza virus and transmission during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep sequencing data from clinical samples collected from five industrial enterprises and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 outbreak in Italy to reveal (i) epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) . evolution of virus pathogenicity and (iii) viral transmission routes between different farms and shelters. We show high genetic diversity of HPAI H7N7 viruses in a single farm as a result of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. Specifically, we identified co-circulation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences and 92 minority variants at the consensus level. To assess inter-farm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the main source of the virus, suggesting that different viral haplotypes spread from the index farm to other industrial enterprises, possibly at different time points. Our results revealed the dynamics of inter-farm transmission, showing that epidemiological data cannot be resolved alone, and showed that delay in disease detection and eradication is the main reason for the emergence and spread of the HPAI strain. IMPORTANT: The intra- and inter-host evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain during a naturally occurring epidemic are currently poorly understood. Here, we perform for the first time an in-depth series analysis of all samples collected during an HPAI epidemic, and demonstrate the importance of complementing epidemic research with genetic data to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of viruses and to evaluate between and within. -farm genetic diversity of the viral population. We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenic form to the highly pathogenic form occurred in the first infected herd, where we identified haplotypes with different lengths of hemagglutinin cleavage sites. We also identify the index case as the main source of virus, indicating that rapid implementation of population reduction measures is necessary to limit the spread of the virus to other farms.",,"Fusaro, A.;Tassoni, L.;Milani, A.;Hughes, J.;Salviato, A.;Murcia, P.

628,Development of a pyrosequence test for typing alphaherpes viruses,"Identification of the herpes virus in biological material is usually accomplished by real-time PCR. In order to classify the identified virus strain, real-time PCR must be supplemented with capillary electrophoresis sequencing analysis, which is often time consuming. Here, we present a protocol for the rapid and reliable identification of 5 closely related herpes viruses by the PyroMark Q24 sequencing system. PyroMark performs DNA sequencing analysis using pyrosequencing, a technology based on the detection of pyrophosphate released during DNA elongation [1]. PyroMark is designed to detect changes in specified variable positions of DNA. It can efficiently detect single nucleotide differences in sequences [2]. In this paper, we describe a protocol to pyrosequence a small polymorphic segment of the US8 gene. Based on the differences identified in the nucleotide sequence, we can easily classify the herpes virus as Bovine herpesvirus 1.1, Bovine herpesvirus 1.2, Bovine herpesvirus 5, Bubaline herpesvirus 1 or Caprine herpesvirus. Protocol setup offers several advantages over commonly used techniques: it requires less than one business day to move; allows to analyze up to 24 samples at a time at reasonable costs; and the aforementioned herpes viruses, to detect genetically strongly related organisms with great reliability and specificity. The procedure is readily applicable to other virus families with appropriate modifications.",,"Fusco, G.;Amoroso, M. G.;Gesualdi Montesano, N.;Viscardi, M.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.mex.2015.01.001,0
629,Temperature sensitive mutants of Chandipura virus. II. Phenotypic characteristics of six complementary groups,"Fifty mutants of the rhabdovirus Chandipura virus temperature sensitive (ts) were classified into six complementation groups, designated ChI to ChVI. Group ChI contains 44 mutants, group ChII contains 2 mutants, and the remaining groups each contain 1 mutant. Mutants in the ChI, ChIII, ChIV, and ChVI groups had RNA-negative phenotypes in experiments measuring amplification of RNA synthesis at the restriction temperature. Two mutants in the ChII group had RNA-positive phenotypes and the virions were thermostable. The mutant ts Ch851 of the ChV group was also RNA positive, and the M polypeptide of this mutant appeared unstable in cells incubated at the restriction temperature. Thus, the ChII and ChV complementation groups are likely to represent genes encoding two viral proteins of the virion envelope. A precise assignment cannot be made in the case of the four RNA-negative groups, as all studied mutants showed some polymerase activity in vitro at the limiting temperature. An attempt to obtain polymerase mutants by screening for susceptibility to rifampin was unsuccessful. The six temperature-dependent host-range mutants (tdCE phenotype) of Chandipura virus failed to replicate in chicken embryo cells at the limiting temperature, but otherwise they differed from similar vesicular stomatitis viruses in host-spacing characteristics.",,"Gadkari, D.

The same major viral strains were demonstrated across batches of a given reagent, but the proportion of viral reads among total reads varied significantly between samples (from 0.002% to 22.7%). The sequences found in FBS were mainly derived from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1 to 3 and bovine parvovirus 3 (BPV3). The BVDV sequences derived from FBS showed only minor differences with the primers generally used to screen for BVDV. The viral sequences in trypsin were mainly from porcine circovirus type 2.

Methods: Mycobacteriophage DNAIII DNA was isolated and purified using the lambda DNA extraction protocol. Shotgun sequences were assembled with Phred and PhraD and edited with Consed, then gaps were filled by sequencing the PCR fragments. General features of the genome were analyzed using the EditSeq software of the DNAStar software package. The genome was screened for open reading frames using Glimmer 3.0. The genetic information of the mycobacteriophage DNAIII genome was further investigated by co-linearity analysis and phylogenetic tree construction. The ability of DNAIII to cleave M. tuberculosis was investigated in vitro and the effects of temperature, alcohol, and pH values on DNAIII survival were determined. Results: The DNAIII genome had a size of 39,520 bp and was linear double-stranded DNA, with a G+C content of 66.83%. DNAIII contained 60 predicted protein-coding genes and did not encode any tRNA. There was no tandem repeat sequence in the DNAIII genome. The DNAIII gene encoded 32 integrases and also no gene encoding a repressor. DNAIII was quite similar to Angel and BPs and was in line at the nucleotide acid level.

ND is economically important because of the large mortality and morbidity associated with it. The disease is endemic in many third world countries where agriculture serves as the primary source of national income. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and is a well-characterized member among the avian paramyxovirus serotypes. In recent years, NDV has attracted virologists not only for its pathogenic potential, but also for its oncolytic activity and use as a vaccine vector for both humans and animals. The NDV-based recombinant vaccine offers a viable choice for live attenuated vaccine construction due to the modular nature of transcription, minimal recombination frequency, and absence of DNA phase during replication.

A total of 6,939 alternatively spliced genes were detected, among which the most common pattern was the skipped exon (SE). In addition, 5,607 AS genes were found to be differentially expressed; Compared with group C, group VB contains 2,825 genes that are significantly up-regulated and 2,782 genes that are significantly down-regulated. These 5,607 differentially expressed AS genes are involved in many important biological processes. Many are involved in apoptosis and tumorigenesis. We also proved by agarose gel electrophoresis that the AS events predicted by our study are real and that AS is closely associated with apoptosis and tumorigenesis in REV-infected CEFs. Our study provides the best analysis to date of the potential link between AS and CEFs in response to REV infection. Research highlights transcriptomic analysis of REV-infected CEFs using high-throughput sequencing. Potential link between alternative splicing and CEFs in response to REV infection. The skipped exon is the most common spliced pattern in REV-infected CEFs.

640,"Classification of a new member of the TBE flavivirus subgroup according to its immunological, pathogenetic and molecular characteristics: Identification of subgroup-specific pentapeptides.","The antigenic, pathogenic and molecular properties of Turkish sheep encephalitis (TSE) virus, TTE80 strain, were compared with other members of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus complex. Monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity for the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein differentiated TSE virus from loping disease (LI), western or far eastern TBE, Langat and Powassan virus in indirect immunofluorescence, hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralization tests. TSE virus, which causes LI-like disease in sheep, was similar to LI virus in mouse neurovirulence tests. Molecular homology data of all structural genes of TSE virus compared to other tick-borne flaviviruses indicated that TSE virus is a separate member of the TBE virus subgroup. The data are consistent with the conclusion that TSE virus evolved in a separate evolutionary pathway compared to close antigenic relatives, western European, far eastern TBE viruses and LI virus. By aligning amino acids encoded in the viral envelope glycoprotein of mosquito and tick-borne flaviviruses, we also identified subgroup-specific pentapeptide motifs for tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue subgroup viruses of the Flavivirus genus. These pentapeptides have important implications for the evolution, classification and diagnosis of flaviviruses.",,"Gao, G. F.;Hussain, M. H.;Reid, H. W.;Gould, E.

641,"Viral genome and antiviral drug susceptibility analysis of two patients from a family cluster caused by influenza A(H7N9) virus in Zhejiang, China, 2013","Goals: In the winter of 2013, people were at risk of human-to-human transmission of the re-emerging influenza A(H7N9) virus. Here, we report on the clinical features, genomic sequences of the host viruses, and antiviral drug susceptibility of two patients infected with this virus from the same family. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological data of two patients from the same family were collected and analyzed. Sequencing was performed for viruses isolated from these two patients and an epidemiologically related chicken, and the sequences of eight gene segments of the viruses were analyzed phylogenetically. The susceptibility of viruses to antiviral drug therapy was determined by the neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility test. Results: Two patients in a family cluster shared the same symptoms but had different outcomes and had a strong epidemiological link. Three strains were isolated, two from these two patients and one from chicken. Analyzes of genome sequencing and phylogenetic trees showed that the two viruses were nearly identical. We noted the presence of two new mutations in the NA gene and six new mutations in the PB2 gene, in addition to the PB2 E627K amino acid substitution that was not present in the first-wave isolates. Drug susceptibility testing showed that the new isolates were resistant to oseltamivir but susceptible to peramivir. Results: Two patients in a family cluster were cases of probable human-to-human transmission. The new isolates were susceptible to peramivir but reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir.",,"Gao, H.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with differential expression of miRNAs during influenza A virus infection, we profiled global miRNA and mRNA expression in A549 cells infected with human seasonal influenza A virus H3N2 (Human_Br07), porcine influenza A virus H1N1. (SW_3861) or avian influenza A virus H3N2 (AVI_9990). MiRNA and mRNA expression profiles were obtained by microarray and high-throughput sequencing analyses, respectively. Integrated analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using bioinformatics tools, and expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). ) was confirmed with We identified 20 miRNAs (6 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated) and 1286 mRNAs (935 up-regulated and 351 down-regulated) that exhibited the same differential expression trends in three groups of infected cells compared to an uninfected control. An integrated analysis of these expression profiles identified 79 miRNA-mRNA pairs associated with the influenza A reference pathway, and 107 miRNA-mRNA interactions were associated with the defense of the virus. In addition, the results obtained showed that 8 differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-210-3p, hsa-miR-296-5p, hsa-miR-371a-5p, hsa-miR-762, hsa) Supported by qPCR analysis. -miR-937-5p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, hsa-miR-3665 and hsa-miR-1290) and 13 differentially expressed mRNAs (IFNL1, CXCL10, RSAD2, MX1, OAS2, IFIT2, IFI44 L, MX2 , XAF1, NDRG1, FGA, EGLN3, and TFRC).

Despite its economic and medical importance, the known information about the transcriptome and genome of M. orientalis is limited. In this study, we performed de novo sequencing, transcriptome assembly, and functional annotations of adult M. orientalis, from which approximately 77.4 million high-quality clean reads were obtained, among which the length of transcript contigs ranged from 100 to 11,249 nt, with an average length. 373 nt and N50 length 919 nt. Next, we pooled 31,943 unigenes, of which 20,009 (62.6%) were annotated by BLASTn and BLASTx searches against the existing database.

644,"Biological heterogeneity of H5N1 influenza A virus isolates from humans in Hong Kong, including systemic replication in mice.","In 1997, an H5N1 avian influenza A virus infected humans in Hong Kong. Although the virus causes systemic infection and is highly lethal in chickens due to the sensitivity of hemagglutinin to furin and PC6 proteases, it is unknown whether it also causes systemic infection. infection in humans. Clinical outcomes of infection in Hong Kong residents ranged from mild respiratory illness to multiple organ failure leading to death. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of influenza due to these H5N1 isolates, we investigated their virulence in mice. The results identified two different groups of viruses: group 1, where the lethal dose (MLD50) for 50% of mice was between 0.3 and 11 PFU, and group 2, where the MLD50 was greater than 103 PFU, after intranasal vaccination of mice with 100 PFU group 1 virus. One day later, the virus titer in the Lungs was 107 PFU/g, or 3 log units higher than that of group 2 viruses. Both virus strains proliferated to high titers (> 106 PFU/g) in the lungs on day 3 and maintained these titers through day 6. More importantly, only group 1 viruses caused systemic infection and multiplied in non-respiratory organs, including the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis showed replication of group 1 virus in brain neurons and glial cells and cardiac myofibers. Phylogenetic analysis of all viral genes showed that both groups of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses formed a distinct lineage from that of other viruses, and that genetic reclassification did not occur between H5N1 and H1 or H3 human viruses. Since mice and humans harbor both furin and PC6 proteases, we propose that the virulence mechanism responsible for the lethality of influenza viruses in birds also works in mammalian hosts. The failure of some H5N1 viruses to produce systemic infection in our model suggests that many still unidentified factors contribute to the severity of H5N1 infection in mammals. In addition, the ability of these viruses to produce systemic infection in mice and the clear differences in pathogenicity between the isolates studied here suggest that this system provides a useful model for the study of the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infection in mammals.",,"Gao, P.;Watanabe, S.;Ito, T.;Goto, H.;Wells, K.;McGregor, M.;James Cooley, A.;Kawaoka, Y.",1999.0,,,0
645,Deep Sequencing Analysis of DF-1 Cell Transcriptome Response to Infection with Duck Newcastle Disease Virus,"Newcastle Disease (ND) is caused by Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), with respiratory and digestive mucosal bleeding for typical symptoms. It is an acute highly contact disease. NDV can proliferate in DF-1 cells. NDV from waterfowl is different from older NDV from chicken, it causes death of waterfowl. However, the molecular mechanisms of NDV-infected waterfowl are still not fully understood. In this study, researchers used the illumina genome analyzer platform to perform genome-wide Digital Gene Expression (DGE), a tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method analysis of NDV-YC-infected DF-1 cells. The researchers were able to achieve a sequencing depth of 5.0-6.1 million tags per library and found >8000 genes that would be differentially expressed during NDV-YC infection processes.

646,Whole genome shotgun sequencing revealed highly polymorphic genome regions and genes in Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolates collected from a single feeding site.,"Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 continues to pose a serious health threat to humans. Bovines, the main reservoir of the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 in their gastrointestinal tract and shed variable concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 into the environment. Genetic characterization of cattle barn E. coli O157 strains is of interest to the livestock industry, food industry, and public health community. This study applied whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) to characterize 279 cattle barn E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from a single medium in the southwestern USA. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the strains, and the resulting phylogenomic tree revealed three main groups. Using the Sakai strain genome as a reference, more than 2,000 SNVs were annotated and a detailed SNV map was created. The results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci throughout the E. coli O157:H7 genome aligned with prophage regions and highly variable genes involved in processing bacterial genetic information. WGS data was further profiled against an extensive virulence factor database (VFDB) for virulence gene identification. Out of a total of 285 virulence genes identified, only 132 were present in all strains. There were six virulence genes specific to single isolates. Our findings suggested that genome variations of E. coli O157:H7 are mainly attributable to the dynamics of certain phages and that bacterial strains have variable virulence gene profiles despite originating from a single bovine population; pathogenicity, host prevalence, and transmissibility with E. coli O157:H7.",,"Gao, X.;Yang, X.;Noll, L.;Shi, X.;Worley, J.;Allard, M.;Brown, E.;Nagaraja, T.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 10, 11, 13, and 17 are seen in most of the United States, while serotype 2 (BTV-2) has previously only been detected in the southeastern United States. Since 1998, 10 other BTV serotypes have also been isolated from ruminant animals in the southeastern United States. In 2010, BTV-2 was first identified in California, and preliminary sequence analysis showed that the virus isolate was closely related to BTV strains circulating in the southeastern United States. In the current study, the whole genome sequence of the California strain of BTV-2 was compared with that of other BTV-2 strains from the Americas. The results of the analysis suggest that genetically distinct viruses circulate together in the southeastern United States, and that the 2010 western isolate is also closely related to the southeastern BTV strains.

Bovine strain B:USA:78:1A and dog strain C:USA:81:2 were adapted to cell culture and cloned in this study. Other viruses, namely monkey strain S:USA:79:2, porcine Ohio State University strain P:USA:77:1, and human strain WA, have already been adapted to cell culture, although they have been further cloned for this task. Serum neutralization test was used to classify viruses into serotype groups. Viruses that differed 20-fold or more in neutralization titer were divided into different serotype groups. Four main serotype groups were found in this study and these groups were represented by cattle, human, pig and dog-monkey strains. From cross-protection studies, these serotype groups were found to differ significantly. Except for the swine strain, none of the viruses used as the vaccine protected the gnotobiotic piglets from challenge with the virulent swine Ohio State University rotavirus strain. Also, the canine virus protected the piglets from fighting the monkey virus. RNA electropherotype confirmed that the dog and monkey strains differed in the eight RNA segments, eliminating the possibility that they were the same virus. From these findings, it was concluded that only viruses belonging to the same serotype group can be expected to provide cross protection, and therefore, vaccination should be done with serotypes that the animal is likely to be exposed to.",,"Gaul, A.

In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were obtained from bat fecal samples using reverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a genomic organization similar to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the Circoviridae family. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1 741 to 21 77 bp and consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, each encoding the putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential root loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved non-nucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Of the 199 samples tested, 47 (23.6%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome and two (1.0%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. A total of 48 partial Rep sequences plus five full-length genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis showed that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and may represent 22 new species belonging to the family Circoviridae.",,"Ge, X. Y.;Li, J.

This study describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H1NX based on the full molecular characterization of eight virus genes collected in Anhui Province, China from 2014 to 2015. Methods: Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to determine the hemagglutination (HA) activity of HA subtypes. The entire genomes of viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA Analyzer. Sequences were genetically analyzed using DNASTAR and MEGA 6 to study their genetic evolution. Pathogenic effects of viruses were evaluated using mouse infection models. Results: Seven strains of the H1 subtype avian influenza virus were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis showed natural recombination of H1 influenza viruses between Eurasian ancestry and North American ancestry. Some genes had high sequence identity with A/bean goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2); this is a typical case involving viral reclassification between Eurasian ancestry and North American ancestry. The results of infection experiments in mice showed that viruses can acquire the ability to replicate in the respiratory organs of mice without adaptation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that continuous surveillance of wild birds, especially migratory birds, is important for understanding the ecology of the virus and providing early warning of possible H1 influenza outbreaks.",,"Ge, Y.;Yao, Q.

We analyzed 506 bird samples collected from poultry in live bird markets and backyard flocks. To identify influenza A viruses. Virus isolation positive samples (n = 50) were divided into subtypes and their genomes completing the coding were sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates are H9N2, H11N3, H4N6 and H1N1. Less frequently detected subtypes included H1N3, H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7, and H7N9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 identified subtypes, most of the viral gene segments were most closely related to poultry or wild avian viruses commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe and/or North Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed in various geographic regions in Bangladesh, and the surface and inner protein gene segments were phylogenetically clustered with a diverse number of viral subtypes, suggesting an extensive reclassification among these LPAI viruses. H9N2 subtype viruses differed from other LPAI subtypes in that genes from these viruses consistently clustered together, indicating that this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to previous human-derived H9N2 viruses detected in Bangladesh, representing a potential source for human infection. In contrast, circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses were both phylogenetically and antigenically unrelated to H5 viruses previously identified in humans in Bangladesh and H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. Domestic poultry sold at live bird markets in Bangladesh carried a wide variety of LPAI virus subtypes and a high diversity of genotypes.

It has been used for various purposes such as transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, examination of DNA-protein interaction, and detection of genome methylation. Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research for the chicken, as well as other avian species, as an important model organism for the study of embryology, immunology, oncology, virology, evolution, genetics and genomics. Despite their major contributions to life science research, the future of microarrays is being questioned with the advent of massively parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that promise to overcome some of the limitations of microarray platforms. In this article, we review the various sources of microarrays developed for chicken and their potential past and future applications. We also discuss about the future of microarrays in the NGS era, particularly in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that although NGS promises some important advantages, and in particular offers the opportunity to explore new elements in genome microarrays, it will remain the main tools for research and application in the field of farm animal genetics/genomics due to its affordability and high price. throughput nature, mature embedded technologies and ease of implementation.

Understanding genomic features and virus taxonomy is essential to maintain control and prophylactic programs. Considering the recent various studies reporting a relatively high number of new strains, especially from Asian countries, four hundred and eighty-two genomic sequences were evaluated in this study by applying the palindromic nucleotide substitutions method for genotyping. Based on secondary structure alignment and calculation of genetic distance between strains in the 5–² untranslated region of pestivirus RNA, the current taxonomy of the species was reviewed. Twenty-two genotypes were identified by applying a nomenclature based on difference in genus.",,"Giangaspero, M.;Apicella, C.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.02.003,0

When first identified, the virus was considered a variant of the rinderpest virus. The biological and physicochemical characteristics of the virus indicate that it is closely related to the measles, rinderpest and canine distemper viruses. These three viruses make up the Morbillivirus genus of Paramyxoviridae. The PPR virus is sufficiently different from these 3 viruses to justify its consideration as the fourth member of the Morbillivirus genus.",,"Gibbs, E. P. J.;Taylor, W. P.;Lawman, M. J.

The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in epidemic analysis facilitates rapid and accurate identification of pathogen virulence factors and can be used to identify disease transmission pathways within a population and provide information about the likely source. Molecular tools such as WGS are being developed and developed rapidly to provide robust and higher resolution methods for identifying, comparing and classifying pathogenic organisms.

664,Massive Extinction of Bovine Leukemia Virus Proviral Clones Located at Genomic Transcriptionally Active Sites During Primary Infection,"Deltaretroviruses, such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV), cause a persistent infection that usually remains asymptomatic but can also lead to leukemia or lymphoma. These viruses reproduce by infecting new lymphocytes (i.e. infectious cycle) or by clonal expansion of infected cells (mitotic cycle). The relative importance of these two cycles in viral replication changes during infection. Most infected clones are formed before the onset of an effective immune response. Next, the major replication pathway is the mitotic expansion of pre-existing infected clones. Due to the scarcity of available samples and ethical reasons, only limited data are available on early infection by HTLV-1. Therefore, we addressed this question in a comparative BLV model. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify the insertion sites of the provirus to monitor the clonality (i.e., the number of distinct clones and the abundance of each clone) of the BLV-infected cell population. We found that BLV spread shifted from cell neoinfection to clonal proliferation approximately 2 months after inoculation. Initially, BLV proviral integration significantly favors transcribed regions of the genome. Negative selection subsequently removes 97% of detected clones in seroconversion and dislikes BLV-infected cells carrying a provirus located close to a promoter or a gene. However, clone abundance among surviving proviruses is positively correlated with the proximity of the provirus to a replicating site. Thus, during primary infection, two opposing forces operate and determine the fate of long-term clonal composition: (1) initial integration within genes or promoters, and (2) negative selection favoring proviruses located near replicated regions. The result of this initial response will contribute to the proviral load setpoint value as clonal abundance will benefit from carrying a provirus in replicated regions.

This assumption has recently been challenged by experiments showing that bovine leukemia virus (BLV) encodes miRNAs from intragenomic Pol III promoters. BLV miRNAs are abundantly expressed in B-cell tumors in the absence of significant levels of genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs. Using deep RNA sequencing and functional reporter assays, we demonstrated that miRNAs mediate the expression of genes involved in cell signaling, cancer, and immunity.

667,Neuropathotyping: a new system for classifying Marek's disease virus,"statistical approach was used to construct a new classification system based on neurological responses of Marek's disease virus (MDV). To improve the system, neurological response data from 15x7 chickens inoculated with 30 serotype 1 MDV strains were statistically analyzed by a cluster analysis. The aim was to determine a statistical system that would confirm whether the three neurovirulence groups were correlated with the three previously described pathotypes. The system was also validated in two additional specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken strains, SPAFAS and line SC (Hy-Vac). The proposed system is based on the analysis of three variables: 1) frequency of birds showing transient paralysis (dpi) 9 to 11 days after vaccination, (2) mortality before 15 dpi, and (3) frequency of birds showing persistent neurological disease between 21 and 23 dpi. Using this system, an MDV can be classified into one of three groups, namely neuropathotypes A, B, and C, which roughly correspond to lethal, very lethal and very lethal plus pathotypes, respectively. However, the correlation between neuropathotype and pathotype was not absolute and neuropathotyping is a complement rather than a replacement for the existing pathotyping system. Our results showed that neuropathotyping studies can be conducted in two types of commercial SPF chickens using the same variants, although the system must first be standardized using prototype viruses. Neuropathotypes can also be predicted with reasonable accuracy by our statistical analysis. Using this analysis, we determined that MDV strains within the very virulent pathotype could be divided into neuropathotypes B and C, thereby establishing a previously unrecognized pathotypical classification. This finding demonstrates how neuropathotyping can expand important information not identified by conventional pathotyping.",,"Gimeno, I. M.;Witter, R. L.;Neumann, U.",2002.0,Oct-Dec,,0
668,Natural transmission and comparative analysis of small ruminant lentiviruses in Norwegian sheep and goat populations.,"Serological studies of small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections have revealed seropositive sheep in several mixed herds in which sheep were kept with seropositive goats. Here, we examined genetic associations in LTR, pol and env surface unit (SU) of SRLV isolates from both mixed and monospecies herds and their growth patterns in goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures. Phylogenetic analyzes of pol and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs from both goats and sheep in mixed herds were distributed in group C, while isolates from unmixed sheep herds clustered in group A with maedi-visna-like representatives of the A1 subtype. . In this study, it has been suggested that the transmission direction of group C virus is from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by SRLV isolates did not indicate any species-specific traits. No specific nucleotide sequences of the LTR-U3 region or env SU were identified that could be associated with the cytopathic phenotype. This study shows that sheep in Norway harbor SRLVs belonging to phylogenetic groups A and C, providing further evidence that interspecies infection is a regular feature of SRLVs that may represent an important source for viral persistence.

669,Characterization of microRNAs encoded by the bovine herpesvirus 1 genome,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a worldwide ubiquitous and important bovine pathogen. This study reports the identification of 10 microRNA (miRNA) genes, Bhv1-mir-B1-Bhv1-mir-B10, encoded by the BoHV-1 genome that has been processed into 12 detectable mature miRNAs, as determined by ultra-high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics analyses. small RNA libraries and expression studies. We found that four of the miRNA genes were present in the BoHV-1 genome in duplicate, resulting in a total of 14 miRNA coding loci. The unique features of BoHV-1 miRNAs include evidence of bidirectional transcription and the close association of two miRNA genes with origin of replication, including a miRNA encoded in the origin of replication. The miRNA gene Bhv1-mir-B5 is encoded in the opposite DNA strand of the delay-associated transcript, potentially giving rise to antisense transcripts originating from this locus. The association of herpesvirus miRNAs with latency appears to be a common feature in alphaherpesviruses. Analyzes of the BoHV-5 genome for putative miRNA gene orthologs identified a high degree of evolutionary conservation for nine of the BoHV-1 miRNA genes. The possible roles of BoHV-1 miRNAs in the regulation of known BoHV-1 transcription units and the genetics of BoHV-1 genotypes are also discussed.

These viruses spread rapidly to Europe and North America in the fall of 2014, causing five outbreaks in poultry businesses in Germany by February 2015. Birds kept in a zoo in northeastern Germany were also affected. Only a few individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia) showed clinical symptoms and eventually died during infection, but subsequent in-depth diagnostic investigations showed that other birds kept in the same composition of white storks were acutely positive or passed. Asymptomatic infection with HPAIV H5N8. The authority granted an exception to the culling of all 500 remaining zoo birds. Restraint measures included grouping zoo birds into eight epidemiological units, in which 60 birds from each unit repeatedly tested negative for H5N8. Epidemiological and phylogenetic studies revealed that the most likely source of entry was direct or indirect contact with infected wild birds, as white storks had access to a small pond frequented by wild mallards and other aquatic wild birds for 10 days in December 2014.

671,Subtyping of swine flu viruses using a high-throughput real-time PCR platform.,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important human and animal pathogens with a high impact on human and animal health. In Denmark, a passive surveillance program for IAV in pigs has been implemented since 2011, where screening tests and subsequent subtyping are performed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). A disadvantage of the current subtyping system is that several assays are required to cover a wide variety of circulating subtypes, making the system expensive and time consuming. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a high-throughput method that could improve surveillance of swine flu viruses (swIAVs) and reduce virus subtyping costs. Twelve qPCR assays specific to various swIAV-related hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene lines and six assays specific to IAV's internal genes have been developed and optimized for the high-throughput qPCR platform BioMark (Fluidigm). qPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same reaction conditions using 48.48 dynamic array (48.48DA). Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by testing field samples with virus isolates and known subtypes. The results revealed a similar performance of swIAV 48.48DA to traditional real-time analysis, and also the specificity of swIAV 48.48DA was very high and there were no cross-reactions between tests.

672,"Potential for co-infection of mosquito-specific flavivirus, nhumirim virus to prevent transmission of west nile virus in mosquitoes","Nhumirim virus (NHUV) is an insect-specific virus that is phylogenetically linked with dual host mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Previous in vitro co-infection experiments have shown that prior or concomitant infection of Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV results in a 10,000-fold reduction in viral production of West Nile virus (WNV). This interference between WNV and NHUV was observed here in an additional Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A mutant of WNV 2K peptide (V9M) capable of superinfecting with a predetermined WNV infection showed comparable interference from NHUV as the parent WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells. Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes were inoculated intrathoracically with NHUV and WNV or, as a control only, with WNV, allowed to incubate viruses exogenously for up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and transmissibility and replication of WNV were determined.

WNV-transmitting quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were significantly lower for the WNV/NHUV group at seven and nine days post-vaccination (dpi) than for the WNV control, while no differences in Cx were observed. pipiens vaccine group. At nine dpi, a 40% reduction in infectivity was observed in mosquitoes from the dual vaccination group compared to the WNV-only control.

673,Interaction between MDV and HVT influences viral miRNA expression,"It is well known that herpes viruses encode a large number of microRNAs (miRNAs) and that these virally encoded small RNAs play multiple roles in infection. This study was conducted to determine how co-infection of a pathogenic MDV serotype 1 (MDV1) strain (MD5) and a vaccine strain (turkey herpes virus [HVT]) alters viral miRNA expression in vivo. We first used small RNA deep sequencing to identify MDV1-encoded miRNAs expressed in tumorigenic spleens of MDV1-infected birds. The expression patterns of these miRNAs were then further evaluated at an early time point (7 days after infection [dpi]) and a late time point (42 dpi) in birds with and without HVT vaccination using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). In addition, the effect of MDV1 co-infection on HVT-encoded miRNAs was determined using RT-PCR. A diverse miRNA population was expressed at 42 dpi in MDV-induced tumorigenic spleens, and 18 of the 26 known mature miRNAs were represented. Of these, both mdv1-miR-M4-5p and mdv1-miR-M2-3p were the most highly expressed miRNAs. RT-PCR analysis also revealed that nine MDV miRNAs were differentially expressed between 7 dpi and 42 dpi infected spleen. At 7 dpi, three miRNAs were differentially expressed between the spleens of HVT and MD5 co-infected birds compared to MD5-infected birds alone, while at 42 dpi nine miRNAs were differentially expressed. At 7 dpi, expression of seven HVT-encoded miRNAs was affected in the spleens of co-infected birds compared to birds receiving HVT vaccine alone. At 42 dpi, the six HVT-encoded miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups. Target prediction analysis demonstrates that these differentially expressed viral miRNAs are involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and adaptive immune response.

674,Application of phylogeny reconstruction and character evolution analysis to infer directional microbial transmission patterns,"used phylogenetic analyzes to reconstruct directional interspecies transmission patterns during a pseudorabies virus outbreak in Illinois, USA, in 1989. It was isolated from five species: cattle, sheep, goat, pig, and raccoon (Procyon lotor). I generated DNA sequences for 16 isolates of pseudorabies virus in the glycoprotein C gene from which I generated phylogenetic trees. I then used these trees in conjunction with parsimony-based analyzes of character evolution to infer the frequency and direction of interspecies transmission events. Comparison of inferred frequencies and transmission directions based on 10,000 random trees with null expectations showed a significant excess of transmission events from pigs to pigs and a corresponding lack of transmission events from non-swine species. These results are in line with the known biology and natural history of pseudorabies virus and suggest that retrospective phylogeny reconstitution and character evolution analyzes can be used to investigate the transmission ecology of pathogens.

681,"Molecular investigation of bovine viral diarrhea virus infection in yaks (Bos gruniens) from Qinghai, China.","Background: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus that infects both domestic animals and wildlife species worldwide. In China, cattle are often infected with BVDV of different genotypes, but there is very limited information about BVDV infection and genetic diversity of the virus in the vicinity of China. The objectives of this study were to detect viral infection in the vicinity of Qinghai, China, and the 5"" untranslated region (5""UTR) and N-terminal protease (N <sup>pro</ s>) region. Results: Between 2010 and 2012, 407 blood samples were collected from clinical or non-clinical closes in six counties of Qinghai Province. Ninety-eight samples (24%) were found to be positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting a conserved region of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. The nucleotide sequences of the 5â€²UTR and the complete N<sup>pro</sup> region were determined for 16 positive samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that all 16 samples belonged to subgenotypes BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1q. Conclusions: This study provides, for the first time, molecular evidence for BVDV infection involving multiple subgenotypes of BVDV-1 in the vicinity of Qinghai. This could have occurred under three possible scenarios: interspecies transmission, natural infection, and use of BVDV-contaminated vaccines.

Other pathogens notable for their epidemic spread include arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus diseases, which are carried by rodents over great geographic distances, and arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika) activated by ecology and vector adaptations. Have we learned from past epidemics? Are we ready for the worst? The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global health infrastructure. In addition to acquiring treatments, vaccines and other preventative drugs, biosurveillance is critical to preventing disease from occurring and preventing its spread. So far, only the western hemisphere has a large and built-in monitoring system; however, diseases continue to emerge sporadically, particularly in Southeast Asia and South America, highlighting the flaws of our surveillance. Outbreaks destabilize fragile governments, devastate the most vulnerable populations, and threaten global society. Pandemic risk calculations use new technologies such as computational maintenance of geographic and historical datasets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Next Generation sequencing, and Metagenomics to monitor molecular changes during the emergence of pathogens, and mathematical models to assess risk. Forecasts help identify emerging hotspots, populations at risk, and pathogens under genetic evolution. Preparedness anticipates the international partnerships needed to manage risks, the needs of the population, infrastructure capacities, sources of emergency financing, and finally, before a disaster occurs. Currently, the world is in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health inequalities despite massive environmental changes due to exponential population growth, political conflicts, migration, global trade, urbanization and global warming. On behalf of humanity, we must focus on building the necessary capacities for health surveillance, preparedness and pandemic response.",,"Gonzalez, J.

684,"Origin, distribution and potential risk factors associated with influenza A virus in pigs in two production systems in Guatemala","Background: Guatemala is the country with the largest pork production in Central America; however, evidence of influenza A virus (IAV) in pigs is not clearly defined. Objectives: In this study, we analyzed the presence and spatial distribution of IAV in commercial and backyard pig populations. Methods: Samples from two nationwide surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 were tested using virological (rRT-PCR and virus isolation) and serological (ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition) assays to detect IAV. Results: Influenza A virus was detected in 15.7% (30.6% of herds) of pigs sampled in 2010 and 11.7% (24.2% of herds) in 2011. Percentage of seropositive pigs 10.6% (16.1% of herds) and 1.4% (3.1% of herds) per year, respectively. Three pandemic H1N1 and one seasonal human-like H3N2 virus were isolated. Antibodies against viruses from different genetic clusters were detected. No reassortant strains were detected with swine viruses. Unlike the most recent seasonal human vaccine strains, the H3N2 virus was closely related to human viruses circulating in Central America in 2010. Spatial clusters of rRT-PCR positive swarms were detected annually by screening statistics. Conclusions: Our results show IAV circulation across Guatemala and identify commercial farms, animal health status and age as potential risk factors associated with IAV infection and exposure. Detection of human-borne viruses in pigs suggests a role for humans in the molecular epidemiology of IAV in pigs in Guatemala and attests to gaps in local animal and human surveillance.",,"Gonzalez-Reiche, A.

Amino acid homology to the corresponding protein of asymptomatic or symptomatic human rotaviruses representing serotypes 1 to 4 of porcine rotavirus VP4 ranged from 87.1% to 88.1% for asymptomatic strains and 77.5% to 77.8% for symptomatic strains. Amino acid homology of Gottfried strain to monkey rhesus rotavirus, monkey SA11 virus, bovine Nebraska calf diarrhea virus and porcine OSU strains ranged from 71.5% to 74.3%. Antigenic similarities of VP4 epitopes between Gottfried strain and human rotaviruses were detected by a plaque reduction neutralization assay with hyperimmune antisera produced against Gottfried strain or a Gottfried (10 genes) x human DS-1 rotavirus (VP7 gene) reassortant exhibiting serotype 2. neutralization specificity. In addition, a panel of six anti-VP4 monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing human rotaviruses of serotype 1, 3 or 4 was able to neutralize the Gottfried strain. These observations suggest that the VP4 outer capsid protein of Gottfried rotavirus is more closely related to human rotaviruses than to animal rotaviruses.",,"Gorziglia, M.;Nishikawa, K.;Hoshino, Y.;Taniguchi, K.",1990.0,,,0
687,Molecular phylogenetics of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from vaccinated flocks during epidemics in southern India reveals the circulation of a new subgenotype.,"Newcastle disease (ND) is an economically important contagious poultry viral disease reported worldwide. ND is endemic in India and episodes of ND outbreaks are not uncommon despite strict vaccinations. We isolated and characterized seven ND viruses from commercial poultry farms inoculated during severe disease outbreaks in Tamil Nadu, southern India, between April 2015 and June 2016. All seven isolates were categorized as virulent according to the mean time to death (48-54 hours). in embryonated chicken eggs. In addition, their sequences bore the virulence signature of multi-basic amino acid residues in the fusion protein cleavage sites (RRQ/RR/KRF). Phylogenetic and evolutionary distance analyzes revealed the circulation of a new subgenotype of the XIII genotype, class II ND viruses proposed here as sub-genotype XIIIe. The genetic difference between circulating virulent strains and vaccine strains could possibly explain the disease outbreak in vaccinated herds. In addition, our study points to the need to implement routine epidemiological surveillance and review the current vaccination program.",,"Gowthaman, V.;Ganesan, V.;Gopala Krishna Murthy, T.

The prevalence of hepatitis E is higher in areas with poor hygiene conditions. The use of molecular techniques has contributed to gaining valuable information on the epidemiology of hepatitis E in developed countries. In these regions, hepatitis E virus infection shows a different pattern and is associated with contact with domestic animals, particularly pigs. The role of hepatitis E as a possible zoonosis in industrialized countries provides a new and interesting approach to this disease. This review summarizes the available information on the biology, structure and transmission of the virus and diagnosis of infection.

689,Detection and genome characterization of bovine polyomaviruses in beef muscle and minced meat samples from Germany,"Polyomaviruses are small, non-enveloped, circular double-stranded DNA viruses. Some polyomaviruses can induce tumors and cancer under certain conditions. Bovine polyomaviruses (BPyV) 1-3 have so far been little analyzed. It has been hypothesized that consumption of beef containing polyomavirus may contribute to the development of cancer in humans. To assess the distribution of the BPyV genome in meats from Germany, 101 beef muscle samples and 10 minced meat samples were analyzed here. A custom sample preparation method coupled with or without rotating circle amplification (RCA) and BPyV-specific PCRs was developed and implemented. BPyV-1 DNA was detected in 1/101 (1%) samples from beef and 2/10 (20%) minced meat samples. While BPyV-2 DNA was detected in 3/10 (30%) ground beef samples, BPyV-3 was not detected in the samples. RCA application did not increase the detection rate in beef samples. Sequence analysis of PCR products showed the presence of BPyV-1, BPyV-2a and BPyV-2b. The entire genome of a BPyV-1 strain from ground beef showed 97.8% sequence identity to the BPyV-1 reference strain, and the genome of a BPyV-2a strain from ground beef showed 99.9% sequence identity to strain 2aS11. It can be concluded that BPyV genomes can often be detected in minced meat samples, but higher sample numbers should be investigated in the future to confirm this finding. To assess the risk of cancer induction through consumption of BPyVs found in beef products, further studies should focus on the infectivity, tumorigenicity and heat resistance of the viruses contained.

690,Advances in antiviral vaccine development,"Antiviral vaccines have been the most successful biomedical intervention to prevent epidemic viral disease. Vaccination for smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle was the basis for disease eradication, and recent advances in polio eradication are promising. While early vaccines were developed experimentally by passing them on from live animals or eggs, newer vaccines have been developed due to the advent of new technologies, particularly cell culture and molecular biology. Recent technological advances in gene delivery and expression, nanoparticles, protein production, and adjuvants have created the potential for new vaccine platforms that could provide solutions for vaccines against viral pathogens for which there is currently no intervention. In addition, the technological convergence of human monoclonal antibody isolation, structural biology, and high-throughput sequencing provides new opportunities for atomic-level immunogen design. Selection of human monoclonal antibodies can identify immunodominant antigenic regions associated with neutralization and provide reagents to stabilize and resolve the structure of viral surface proteins. Understanding the structural basis for neutralization can guide the selection of vaccine targets. Deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire and identification of the ontogeny of desired antibody responses may reveal splice recombination and somatic mutation requirements for B cell recognition and affinity maturation. Collectively, this knowledge will provide new strategic approaches for selecting vaccine antigens, formulations and regimens. It also creates the potential for rational vaccine design and creating a catalog of vaccine technology platforms that will be effective against any family or class of viral pathogens and improve our preparedness for emerging viral threats.

691,Genital Zoster Infection: The Big Rogue,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are taxonomically closely related viruses that produce clinically distinct diseases but share common features of infection. HSV-1 and HSV-2 both produce cutaneous and mucocutaneous primary infections followed by reactivation disease in the same or a nearby anatomical site. Primary VZV infection, also known as chickenpox, is a childhood disease that usually produces smallpox-like cutaneous lesions that are scattered throughout the body. Reactivation VZV infection, often referred to as herpes zoster, usually occurs later in life, but unlike HSV disease, it typically produces smallpox-like lesions in a different anatomical location throughout the dermatomes. Therefore, the clinical differential diagnosis of reactivation HSV infection and zoster is usually based on the anatomical location and appearance of the lesion(s). The recent availability of molecular tests has resulted in the unexpected diagnosis of zoster infections in male and female patients presenting with genital lesions. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of HSV and VZV infections and to relate a laboratory experience that resulted in the diagnosis of zoster infections using a molecular assay in which almost 10% of the 282 positive VZV specimens were from the genitals.",,"Granato, P.

692,"Metagenomic Detection of Viral Pathogens in Spanish Honey Bees: Co-infection with Aphid Fatal Paralysis, Israel Acute Paralysis, and Sinai Lake Viruses","The situation with honey bees in Europe has deteriorated in recent years with steady declines in populations and/or catastrophic winter losses. This has been largely attributed to the emergence of a variety of known and ""unknown"" emerging new diseases. Previous studies have shown that colonies can often harbor more than one pathogen, making it difficult to identify etiologic agents by classical methods. Using an unbiased metagenomic approach, which allows the detection of both unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, three viruses, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Israel Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), has been reported in honey bees. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees has only recently been reported, and this is the first such strain to be described in Europe. Similarly, LSV appears to be a group of as yet unclassified viruses with uncertain impact on colony health and these viruses have not been previously identified outside of the United States. Our study also reveals that these bees carry Turnip Ringspot Virus (TuRSV), a plant virus that serves as potentially important vector organisms. Taken together, these results illustrate new possibilities opened up by high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis to study emerging diseases in domestic and wild animal populations, including honey bees.

693,Whole genome sequence comparison of vtx2 transforming phages from Enteroaggregative Hemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains,"BACKGROUND: Enteroaggregative Hemorrhagic E. coli (EAHEC) is a novel group of pathogenic E. coli characterized by the presence of a vtx2-phage integrated into the genomic backbone of Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC). So far, four different serotypes of EAHEC have been identified, causing a minor outbreak and six sporadic cases of HUS during the 1992-2012 period, in addition to the major infection outbreak in Germany in 2011. In the present study, we determined the whole genome sequence of the vtx2-phage, designated Phi-191, found in the first described EAHEC O111:H2 isolated in France in 1992, and compared the sequences with those of the vtx-phages available. RESULTS: The whole genome sequence of the Phi-191 phage was identical to that of vtx2-phage P13374 found in the EAHEC O104:H4 strain isolated 20 years later during the German epidemic. Also, the EAHEC O104:H4 strains described so far were almost identical to those of other vtx2-phages. Conversely, the Phi-191 phage looked different from the vtx2-phage carried by EAHEC O111:H21 isolated in Northern Ireland in 2012. typical Verositotoxin-producing strains of E. coli showed the presence of a 900 bp sequence uniquely associated with EAHEC phages and encoding a tail fiber. RESULTS: At least two different vtx2-phages, both characterized by the presence of a specific tail fiber encoding gene, interfered with the emergence of EAHEC. Despite the high variability described for vtx-phages, the finding of an identical vtx2-phage in two EAggEC strains isolated after 20 years is unexpected, suggesting that such vtx2-phages are under strong selective pressure. Observation of different EAHEC infections has been traced back to countries where EAggEC infections are endemic and human sewage treatment is generally ineffective, suggesting that such countries may represent the cradle for the emergence of the EAHEC pathotype. In these regions, human-induced EAggEC can extensively contaminate the environment where they may encounter free vtx-phages emitted by the feces of ruminants.",,"Grande, L.;Michelacci, V.;Tozzoli, R.;Ranieri, P.;Maugliani, A.;Caprioli, A.;Morabito, S.",2014.0,2008-07-01 00:00:00,,0

Co-linearity of the genes with the KSHV genome was observed, and the core herpes virus genes had strong sequence homology to the corresponding KSHV genes. RFHVMn lacked homologues of open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and KSHV ORFs K5 and K6; this appears to have been created by duplication of ORFs K3 and K4 after KSHV and RFHV split. RFHVMn contained positional homologues of all other unique KSHV genes, although some showed limited sequence similarity. RFHVMn contained a set of candidate microRNA genes. Although there was little sequence similarity to KSHV microRNAs, it contained the same seed sequence, kshv-miR-K12-10a, as a candidate positional homologue, indicating functional overlap. RNA transcript splicing was highly conserved between RFHVMn and KSHV, and strong sequence conservation was noted at specific promoters and putative origins of replication, predicting substantial functional similarities. Sequence comparisons showed that RFHVMn and KSHV evolved in long-term synchronization with the evolution of their hosts, and both viruses are phylogenetically grouped in the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses. RFHVMn is the closest KSHV homolog to be fully sequenced and the first sequenced RV1 rhadinovirus homologue of KSHV from a non-human Old World primate. The strong genetic and sequence similarity between RFHVMn and KSHV, combined with similarities in biology and pathology, suggest that RFHVMn infection in macaques offers an important and relevant model for the study of KSHV in humans.

697,A metagenomic analysis of pandemic influenza a (2009 H1N1) infection in patients from North America.,"Although metagenomics has previously been used for pathogen discovery, its cost and complexity have prevented it from being used as a practical front-line diagnosis for unknown infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate the utility of two metagenomic-based strategies, a pan-viral microarray (Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus. Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the early stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada and the United States (n = 17), Virochip was able to detect a new virus most closely related to swine flu viruses without prior knowledge. Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011 to 10.9%), covering up to 97% of the influenza genome in one sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers close to the detection limits for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided information on upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequences, including joining several full-length genomic segments. These results suggest that a modern metagenomic detection strategy could potentially replace the multiple traditional diagnostic tests required to search for an outbreak of a new pathogen and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute diseases or epidemics in clinical and public health settings.

698,Complete genome of klassevirus - a new picornavirus in pediatric stool,"Background: Diarrhea kills 2 million children worldwide each year, but in approximately 30-50% of cases no etiologic agent is found. Picornaviral genera such as enterovirus, cobuvirus, cosavirus, parechovirus, hepatovirus, teschovirus and cardiovirus have all been found in human and animal diarrhea. Modern technologies, particularly deep sequencing, allow rapid, high-throughput screening of clinical samples such as feces for novel infectious agents associated with human disease. Results: A pool of 141 pediatric gastroenteritis samples previously found to be negative for known diarrheal viruses was subjected to pyro-sequencing. From a total of 937,935 sequence reads, a collection of 849 reads distantly related to Aichi virus was collected and found to constitute 75% of a novel picornavirus genome. The whole genome was then cloned and found to share 52.3% nucleotide double identity and 38.9% amino acid identity to Aichi virus. The low level of sequence identity suggests a new genus of picornavirus, which we refer to as classevirus. Blind screening of 751 stool samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals revealed a second positive case of classevirus infection, which was later found to be from the index case's 11-month-old twin. Conclusion: We report the discovery of human classevirus 1, a member of a novel picornavirus genus, in the stool of two infants from Northern California.

Still, this information is essential for animal and public health surveillance, vaccine updates, and understanding the evolution and wide-spread spread of the virus. Methods: The study population consisted of 21 herds of pigs with clinical problems due to respiratory disease. Nasal swabs from individual pigs were collected and tested by virus isolation and rtRT-PCR in MDCK cells. All eight segments of 10 H3N2 viruses were sequenced and molecularly characterized using high-throughput sequencing. Results: The prevalence within herd ranges from 2% to 100%. Structurally, Ontario H3N2 viruses can be classified into three different groups. Group 1 was most similar to the original trH3N2 virus from 2005. Group 2 was most similar to Ontario turkey H3N2 isolates, with PB1 and NS genes from trH3N2 virus and M, PB2, PA and NP genes from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. All Group 3 internal genes were genetically related to A(H1N1)pdm09. Analysis of the HA1 antigenic regions showed that Group 1 had 8 aa changes within the 4 antigenic regions, A(1), B(3), C(2) and E(2). Group 2 viruses have 8 aa changes in 3 antigenic sites A(3), B(3) and C(2), while Group 3 viruses have 3 antigenic sites, B(1), D(1) and E(2), cluster IV.

We investigated antibody prevalence, active infection and virus variation in serum and cecal content samples from 629 pigs at slaughter. The prevalence of antibodies to HEV was 92.8% (584/629) and HEV RNA was found in 15% (93/629) of cecal content, 3% (22/629) of plasma samples and 2% of both ( 14/14) detected. 629). However, although HEV is common in UK pigs and enters the food chain of viremic pigs, most (22/23) viral sequences clustered separately from the predominant type seen in humans.

Although clinically uncertain in pigs, hepatitis E in humans is caused by HEV infection and transmission through the food chain has been identified. Following a 2013 study investigating the prevalence of HEV infection in slaughter-age pig samples in the UK, the one showing the highest viral load was selected for further characterization. High-throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete coding sequence from the five samples. An in-frame insertion was observed within the HEV hypervariable region in two samples. To investigate whether this mutation causes high levels of viremia and excretion, virus isolation and culture was performed in sampled pigs. Based on viral growth kinetics, there was no evidence that these additions affect replication efficiency in vitro, suggesting that as yet undetermined host factors may influence the course of infection and, consequently, the risk of foodborne transmission.",,"Grierson, S.

There is a high incidence of Sa-SSTI in New Zealand, where most morbidity is caused by the polyclonal methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) bacterial population. However, MSSA also colonizes the cornified epithelium of approximately 20% of the population asymptomatically, and their distinction between commensalism and pathogenicity is not fully understood. We aimed to see if MSSA differed genetically between colonization and SSTI; and whether strains isolated from domestic animals differ from human strains given the close interactions between humans and pets. METHODS: We compared the genomes of concurrent colonization and clinical MSSA isolates from humans and domestic animals in New Zealand. RESULTS: Core and accessory genome comparisons revealed a homogeneous bacterial population between colonization, disease, humans and domestic animals. MSSA colonization rate in dogs was relatively low (5.4%). CONCLUSIONS: In New Zealand, most Sa-SSTI morbidity results from a random sample of the MSSA population colonizing, consistent with the opportunistic infection pattern rather than the paradigm that separates strains by pathogenicity. Therefore, investigating the factors that determine colonization and immune escape may be more beneficial than comparative virulence studies.

With this technique, precise species assignment was achieved for 34 potyvirus-infected vanilla samples collected in the Indian Ocean and Pacific regions between 1997 and 2005. Virus identification was based on BLAST homology and nucleotide identities of 162 to 327 nt fragments with known potyvirus sequences. Species assignment was confirmed by neighbor splicing of 149 nts common to 32 vanilla sequences and 51 known potyviruses. Subject to further definition, these data revealed four additional Potyvirus strains that can infect vanilla: Bean yellow mosaic virus, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, Ornithogalum mosaic virus, and Wisteria vein mosaic virus. The procedure was fast, cost-effective, easy to use and showed good taxonomic discriminant value. It also made it possible to identify potyviruses in neighboring weeds and should therefore aid in the understanding of potyvirus outbreaks occurring in a variety of epidemiological conditions.",,"Grisoni, M.;Moles, M.;Farreyrol, K.;Rassaby, L.;Davis, R.;Pearson, M.",2006.0,Aug,,0

706,Varicella-Zoster virus-specific gp140: A highly immunogenic and disulfide-linked structural glycoprotein,"140,000-dalton disulfide-linked glycoprotein (gp140) expressed by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was identified in infected cultured cells and was precipitated by two murine monoclonal antibodies (VZ-151 and VZ-158). When analyzed under reduction conditions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gp140 was predominantly partitioned into a 66,000 low molecular weight product (gp66). Because metrisamide was observed in the polypeptide profile of gradient-purified enveloped virions, this protein was classified as a viral structural component. By immunofluorescence analyzes with a monoclonal antibody probe, it has been documented that gp140 expression is highly conserved both in cultured cells inoculated with homologous (VZV-Oka) and heterologous (VZV-32) strains and in infected human tissues from chickenpox and zoster patients. The highly immunogenicity of the glycoprotein was confirmed by the presence of high titer of anti-gp140 antibody in the sera of both hyperimmunized laboratory animals and naturally infected humans. Transiently, the humoral response to gp140 following primary VZV infection preceded that to other viral glycoproteins. These studies therefore describe an immunogenic, disulfide-linked viral structural glycoprotein that must lie between the five other fucosylated species – gp118, gp98, gp88, gp62 and gp45 – specific to VZV previously described.",,"Grose, C.;Edwards, D.

Therefore, we first created a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based protocol that enables unbiased identification of transcripts in virus particles. Next, we applied our protocol to analyze RNA in Cowpox virus, an emerging zoonotic member of the Poxviridae family. Our results revealed that 19 viral transcripts were included, while host identifications were limited to ribosomal and mitochondrial RNA. Most viral transcripts had an unknown and immunomodulatory function, suggesting that transcript participation may be beneficial for poxvirus immune evasion. Notably, the most abundant transcript originates from the D5L/I1R gene, which encodes a viral inhibitor of the host cytoplasmic DNA sensing mechanism.",,"Grossegesse, M.;Doellinger, J.;Haldemann, B.;Schaade, L.;Nitsche, A.",2017.0,10 13,,0
709,Combined Proteomics/Genomics Approach Reveals Proteomic Alterations of Mature Virions as a Novel Poxvirus Adaptation Mechanism,"Like poxviruses, DNA viruses have a highly stable genome, suggesting that the adaptation of virus particles to specific cell types is not limited to genomic changes. Cowpox viruses are zoonotic pox viruses with an extraordinarily wide host range that demonstrate their adaptive potential in vivo. To elucidate the adaptation mechanisms of poxviruses, we isolated cowpox virus particles from a rat and passaged them five times in a human and a rat cell line. We then analyzed the proteome and genome of the non-passaged virions and each passage. While the overall viral genome sequence was stable during migration, proteomics revealed many changes in virion composition. Interestingly, an increased viral fitness was observed in human cells in the presence of increased amounts of immunomodulatory proteins. Protein amounts were likely regulated at the transcriptional level, as the only small variant with increased frequency during crossover was located in a viral RNA polymerase subunit, and also because most small variants were found in transcription-associated genes. This study is the first comparative proteome analysis of virus particles before and after cell culture propagation, revealing proteomic alterations as a novel poxvirus adaptation mechanism.",,"Grossegesse, M.;Doellinger, J.;Tyshaieva, A.;Schaade, L.;Nitsche, A.",2017.0,11 10,,0
710,Bacteriophage strain typing by rapid single molecule analysis,"Rapid characterization of unknown biological samples is the focus of many current studies. Here, we report a method for screening biological samples by optical mapping of their DNA. We use a novel, one-step chemo-enzymatic reaction to covalently attach fluorophores to DNA at the four-base recognition sites of a DNA methyltransferase. Due to the diffraction limit of the light, the intense scattering of the tags results in a continuous fluorescent signal throughout the DNA. Amplitude modulations (AM) of fluorescence intensity along stretched DNA molecules exhibit a unique molecular fingerprint that can be used for identification. We show that this labeling scheme is highly informative and allows for accurate genotyping. We demonstrate the method by labeling the genomes of lambda and T7 bacteriophages, which results in a consistent, unique AM profile for each genome. These profiles are also successfully used for identification of phages from a background phage library. Our method may provide an easy way to screen and typify a variety of organisms and has potential applications in metagenomic studies of diverse ecosystems.",,"Grunwald, A.;Dahan, M.;Giesbertz, A.;Nilsson, A.;Nyberg, L.

Since 2013, autopsy lesions, histological studies, virus isolation, phylogenetic analysis, and selection pressure analysis of the gE gene of vPRV have been recorded for 395 clinical cases, and 5,033 pig serum samples have been detected by the PRV gE-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The main clinical symptoms were miscarriage in pregnant sows, fatal neurological signs in piglets, and respiratory disease in growing pigs. Histopathological examination revealed necrotic splenitis, hepatitis and lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic nephritis and non-suppurative encephalitis. Typical eosinophilic inclusion bodies were found in the nuclei of liver cells. Using PCR, 110 samples from 395 clinical cases were tested to be positive for the gE gene. Fifteen vPRV strains were isolated and confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the gE gene. The strains shared 97.1%-99.9% nucleotide (nt) and 96.6%-99.5% amino acid (aa) homology with the PRV reference strains. Selection pressure analysis showed that a site in the codons of glycoprotein E was under positive selection. Of the 5,033 serum samples, 2,909 were positive by ELISA for a positive rate of 57.8%. These results showed that vPRV is still prevalent in Shandong Province and there is severe PRV infectious pressure.

Orf virus was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing, recurrent infection testing, transmission electron microscopy, and PCR. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of two genes of Orf virus were analyzed. The results showed that under electron microscopy the virus has the presence of typical parapoxvirus virions and many eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. In the ELISA test, the optical density (OD) readings of the sample showed a positive result, and virus-infected rabbits typically appeared infected with Orf virus. All these findings proved to be an Orf virus, for example. Phylogenetic studies of the Orf B2L and Orf F1L genes showed that the virus clustered in different branches and was more closely related to the Orf virus Nantou (DQ904351) and OV-SA00 isolates (AY386264).

718,Detection and characterization of novel bocavirus (genus Bocaparvovirus) and gastroenteritis viruses from asymptomatic pigs in Ireland,"BACKGROUND: Farm animals have been the putative source of several human outbreaks in recent years, for example influenza H1N1, rotavirus G8/G9 and MERS-CoV. Monitoring of new viruses in animals is essential to assess the risk to human and animal health and to identify any economic effects, such as growth retardation. There are few data on the detection and characterization of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in pigs in Ireland. Recently, a number of small novel porcine DNA viruses have emerged globally, for example, torque tenosus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 and 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses recently detected in humans and animals. METHODS: This study investigated the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus and porcine bocavirus) in archived stool samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 samples were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), followed by a subset of samples (n=44) individually examined. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. RESULTS: The initial scan showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm with the formation of three distinct groups in the phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in this study, with the first report of PCV, PAdV and strain I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some samples contained >1 virus and statistical analysis showed a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV in this farm. CONCLUSION: Investigating the diversity of enteric viruses circulating in Irish pig farms is important to improve current prophylactic tools and facilitate early detection of changes in circulating viruses.",,"Gunn, L.;Collins, P.

It may be useful to screen for universal influenza virus vaccines by analyzing epitopes of multiple subtypes of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein.

ELISA method. Following this, common continuous amino acid sequences were identified by multiple sequence alignment analysis with the GenBank database and DNAMAN software for use in the prediction of epitopes of the HA protein. Synthesized peptides of these common sequences were prepared and used to confirm and identify linear epitopes predicted through localization and distribution analyses. These methods identified nine HA linear epitopes distributed among different strains of influenza virus, three from influenza A, four from 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza, and two from H1. The current study demonstrated that, considering a combination of antigen-antibody reaction specificity, variation in influenza virus HA protein and linear epitopes could offer a useful approach for designing effective multi-epitope vaccines.

H5N8 and H5N2 viruses have caused major economic losses to the poultry industry in Europe and North America, and fatal human infections with the H5N6 virus have occurred in Asia. Information is urgently needed on the evolution of the receptor-binding specificity of these viruses, which may affect the host range. We report that the emergence of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor binding specificity. In contrast to the ancestral sequence 2.3.4 H5 proteins, the new generation 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind to fucosylated sialosides due to the K222Q and S227R substitutions unique to the highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins. The North American sequence 2.3.4.4 virus isolates only retained the K222Q substitution, but still binds fucosylated sialosides.

However, many cases of vaccine failure have been reported worldwide in recent years, as chickens develop symptoms of MD despite proper vaccination. Significant polymorphisms and point mutations in the Meq gene of MDV have been reported to be associated with virulence and oncogenicity. This study was conducted to isolate and characterize MDV domain isolates based on the Meq gene. Twenty-five specimens from suspected MD cases were collected and processed for virus isolation in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) primary culture; where 28% (7 out of 25) samples showed the characteristic cytopathic effects of MDV in the form of plaques and syncytia. Additional evidence for the presence of MDV in these samples was confirmed by PCR. To analyze the diversity in all seven isolates of MDV, a polymorphism study was performed by cloning and sequencing the full-length Meq gene (1020 bp).

727,Turkish coronavirus is more closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus than mammalian coronaviruses: a review,"Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is the cause of an acute, highly contagious enteric disease of turkeys. In recent years, TCoV has been increasingly recognized as an important pathogen of young turkeys in North America, causing economic losses due to growth disruption and inadequate feed conversion. Although the epidemiology and pathogenesis of TCoV has been extensively studied, TCoV remains one of the least characterized of known coronaviruses. Avian and mammalian coronaviruses are divided into different antigenic/genotypic groups; however, the classification of TCoV is controversial. Previous studies have shown TCoV to be closely related to bovine coronavirus and other group 2 mammalian coronaviruses, but more recent antigenic and genome sequence analyzes contradict these findings and instead provide evidence that TCoV is closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). provides. In addition, experimental studies have shown that the host TCoV range once thought to be limited to turkeys also includes chickens. These studies have raised additional questions regarding the classification of TCoV; in particular, whether IBV and TCoV are taxonomically different viruses or whether TCoV is merely a variant of IBV. Because these studies show that TCoV and IBV are so closely related, sequence analyzes of TCoV have given credence to the idea that TCoV is a variant of IBV. However, these studies were limited to only three TCoV strains and relatively small portions of the TCoV genome. TCoV is easily distinguished from IBV based on antigenic and biological differences, suggesting that TCoV should be considered as a separate virus strain. Additional studies will be needed to better define the relationship between TCoV and IBV and to resolve this taxonomic question. Based on our current understanding, it seems prudent to consider TCoV and IBV as distinct virus strains that share a close phylogenetic relationship and together form group 3 of the coronavirus major antigenic groups.",,"Guy, J.

728,Constructs of H5 avian and H9 swine flu virus hemagglutinin: possible origin of influenza subtypes,"Influenza A virus (H1-H15) has 15 subtypes, all of which are found in avian species. It has caused three pandemics in the last century: H1 in 1918 (and 1977), H2 in 1957, and H3 in 1968. An H5 avian virus in 1997 and an H9 virus in 1999 caused respiratory disease outbreaks in Hong Kong. We determined the three-dimensional structures of hemagglutinins (HAs) from H5 avian and H9 porcine viruses closely related to viruses isolated from humans in Hong Kong. We compared them with known structures of H3 HA from the virus causing the 1968 H3 pandemic and the HA-esterase-fusion (HEF) glycoprotein from an influenza C virus. Structure and sequence comparisons suggest that HA subtypes may have arisen from the diversification of properties that affect the metastability of HAs required for membrane fusion activities in viral infection.",,"Ha, Y.;Stevens, D.

Genomic tools such as high-throughput sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, and microarray-based analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms provide unprecedented ways to analyze the diversity of genomes of emerging pathogens and the molecular basis of host response to them. By comparing and contrasting the consequences of an emerging infection with those of closely related pathogens in different but related host species, we can further delineate the various host pathways that determine the outcome of zoonotic transmission and adaptation to newly invaded species.

731,Possible sources and routes of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 infections in poultry and wild birds in Central Europe in 2007 were obtained through likelihood analysis.,"Recurrent outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV occurred in several Central European countries in 2007. In-depth phylogenetic analyzes including full-length genomic sequences of related viruses were performed to elucidate the possible origins and transmission routes of the outbreaks. Tree reconstructions and host-slide and ancestral field inferences were performed within the framework of maximum likelihood. All viruses belonged to a separate subgroup (named ""EMA-3"") within section 2.2 and therefore differed from the two HPAIV H5N1 virus strains (called ""EMA-1"" and ""EMA-2"") contained in the same virus. geographic area in 2006. Analysis of the concatenated coding regions of all eight genome segments significantly improved the resolution and robustness of the reconstructed phylogenies compared to single gene analyzes. At the same time, methodological limits to the retrospective establishment of transmission networks spanning a relatively small geographic area and for a short period of time emerged when only a few supporting area epidemiological data were available. Uncertainties persisted about the origin of EMA-3 viruses from a region encompassing Southeast Germany and the Czech Republic, and the ways in which they spread to other European countries. AIV monitoring programs for wild birds and poultry in these countries did not reveal the presence of these viruses in either population. Host transitions between domestic poultry and wild bird populations have occurred several times. Analysis of outbreaks in Northeast Germany and nearby northern Poland in December 2007 showed that the geographic or even temporal environment of the outbreaks did not necessarily indicate a common source of invasion. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Haase, M.;Starick, E.;Fereidouni, S.;Strebelow, G.;Grund, C.;Seeland, A.;Scheuner, C.;Cieslik, D.;Smietanka, K.;Minta, Z.;Zorman-Rojs, O.;Mojzis, M.;Goletic, T.;Jestin, V.;Schulenburg, B.;Pybus, O.;Mettenleiter, T.;Beer, M.;Harder, T.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.005,0

Serologically different from classical (Type I) DHV, this virus was grown in liver and kidney cell cultures of duck origin. Replication was limited in chicken and quail kidney and duck embryo fibroblast cultures. It did not grow in various other cell cultures of avian or mammalian origin. The virus was successfully grown in the embryonic eggs of ducks, not chickens. DHV-III passed through a 50 nm membrane filter, was stable at pH 3.0, and resisted treatment with 5% chloroform. Virus growth was not inhibited by treatment with 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine.

734,Metagenomic Detection of Viruses in Aerosol Samples from Animal Slaughterhouse Workers,"Published studies have shown that those working in animal slaughterhouses have a higher risk of lung cancer compared to the general population. No specific causative agent has been identified and exposure to various chemicals has been studied and found to be unrelated. Evidence suggests a biological etiology, as the risk is highest for workers exposed to live animals or biological substances containing animal feces, urine or blood. To investigate possible biological exposures in animal slaughterhouses, we used a metagenomic approach to characterize the profile of organisms present in an aerosol sample. An assessment of aerosol exposure for individual workers was made by collecting personal samples representing the respirable fraction of dust/bioaerosol in workplace air in both cattle and sheep slaughterhouses. Two sets of nine personal aerosol samples were pooled for the cattle processing and sheep processing areas, with a total of 332,677,346 sequence reads each and 250,144,492 sequence reads at 85 bp length, respectively. Eukaryotic genome sequences were found at both sampling locations, and cattle, sheep, and human sequences were common. Sequences from WU polyomavirus and human papillomavirus 120 were detected in the metagenomic dataset from the cattle processing area, and these sequences were confirmed to be present in the original personal aerosol samples. This work presents the first metagenomic description of personal aerosol exposure and this methodology can be applied to a variety of settings. Furthermore, the detection of two candidate viruses warrants further research in determining occupational exposures in animal slaughterhouses. Â© 2013 Hall et al.",,"Hall, R.

735,Detection of arboviruses and other microorganisms in experimentally infected mosquitoes using massively parallel sequencing,"The incidence of human disease attributed to arbovirus infection is increasing worldwide with effective control interventions limited to sustainability, insecticide resistance, and lack of effective vaccines. Several promising control strategies are currently under development, such as the release of mosquitoes trans-infected with virus-blocking Wolbachia bacteria. The implementation of any control program depends on effective virus surveillance and a thorough understanding of virus-vector interactions. Massively parallel sequencing has enormous potential to provide comprehensive genomic information that can be used to evaluate many aspects of arbovirus ecology and to evaluate new control strategies. To demonstrate the proof of principle, we analyzed Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus experimentally infected with dengue, yellow fever or chikungunya viruses. Random amplification was used to prepare sufficient templates for sequencing in the Personal Genome Machine. Viral sequences were present in all infected mosquitoes. Additionally, in most cases, we were also able to identify mosquito species and mosquito microorganisms, including the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. Importantly, naturally occurring Wolbachia strains can be distinguished from strains trans-infected to mosquitoes. The method allowed us to assemble full-length viral genomes and detect other microorganisms in a single reaction without prior sequencing knowledge. This is a step towards implementing massively parallel sequencing as an arbovirus surveillance tool. It has the potential to provide information on virus transmission dynamics and has applicability to post-release monitoring of Wolbachia in mosquito populations.",,"Hall-Mendelin, S.;Allcock, R.;Kresoje, N.;van den Hurk, A.

736,Metabarcoding analysis of the eukaryotic microbiota in the gut of HIV-infected patients,"Research on the relationship between changes in the gut microbiota and human diseases, including AIDS, is a growing area. However, studies on the eukaryotic component of the gut microbiota in HIV-infected patients have just begun and have not yet been conducted. Furthermore, eukaryotic community profiling is influenced by the use of different methodologies at each step of culture-independent techniques. Here, four DNA extraction protocols were compared to initially test the effectiveness of each method in recovering eukaryotic DNA from stool samples. Our results revealed that the recovery of eukaryotic components from stool samples differed significantly between DNA extraction methods. Next, the composition of the gut eukaryotic microbiota was evaluated through clone sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of nuclear ribosomal internally transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1) and 2 (ITS2) amplicons, and real-time PCRs in HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers. Our results revealed that not only richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) differed between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers depending on the molecular strategy used, but also global eukaryotic community composition with little overlapping taxa. among the techniques. Furthermore, our results based on the cloning libraries and ITS1/ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing showed significant differences in fungal composition between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, but without obvious clusters separating the two groups. According to cloning libraries, Malassezia restriction was significantly more common in stool samples from HIV-infected patients, while operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were significantly higher in stool samples from HIV-infected patients compared to healthy subjects. in both ITS subregions. Finally, real-time PCR showed the presence of different proportions of Microsporidia, Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis and Hymenolepis diminuta in stool samples from HIV patients compared to healthy individuals. Our study revealed that the use of different sequencing approaches can influence the results of perceived eukaryotic diversity of the human gut. We also provide a more comprehensive look at the eukaryotic community in the gut of HIV-infected patients through the complementarity of the different molecular techniques used. Combining these diverse methodologies could provide a gold standard for a more complete characterization of the eukaryotic microbiome in future studies.",,"Hamad, I.;Abou Abdallah, R.;Ravaux, I.;Mokhtari, S.;Tissot-Dupont, H.;Michelle, C.;Stein, A.;Lagier, J.

737,Using Bayesian network modeling to resolve farm management risk factors for bovine viral diarrhea virus infection,"Understanding the risk factors for bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) transmission is important for planning national disease control programs. However, traditional statistical approaches may miss important aspects of BVD epidemiology due to the highly correlated nature of many farm-level risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, we used data collected from 304 cattle herds in New Zealand during the 2015/2016 period to compare the results of Bayesian network (BN) analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Blood samples from 15 heifers from each farm were pooled and analyzed by an antibody ELISA test to classify BVD virus exposure. Farmers were surveyed about general management practices, their knowledge of BVD and risk factors for disease transmission, including on and off-farm movements, on-farm contacts, and whether they implemented BVD control measures for service bulls. Multiple assignment was used to remove missing values from the dataset before statistical analysis. The results showed that 57/116 (49.1%) fattening holdings and 95/188 (50.5%) dairy holdings were most likely to be actively infected with the BVD virus. Around 60% of the farms had heifers/cows moving to the premises and 13.8% of the farmers reported contact with cattle from other farms. The results of the multivariate logistic regression showed that farms that had heifers/cows transported to facilities for all or most of the last five years had a higher risk of being BVD seropositive than farms without these movements (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29). â€“4.24). Farms where cattle had occasional or occasional contact with cattle from other farms were at higher risk than farms without any inter-farm animal contact (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.33–5.41), although this association was not frequency dependent. Only close animal contacts between farms were directly associated with BVD status in the BN model, but this approach further resolved other complex relationships between associated management factors and provided additional important insights into BVD epidemiology. Compared to other countries with intensive production systems, contact over the fence appeared to play a more important role in New Zealand pastoral-based production systems and should be considered when developing strategies for a national BVD control program.",,"Han, J.

Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were phylogenetically compared with those of known human and animal enteric caliciviruses. Based on these analyses, 15 BECV belonged to Norovirus genogroup III and genotype 2 (GIII/2) and were genetically different from human Norovirus GI and GII. Six BECVs had capsid gene sequences similar to those of the unclassified Nebraska (NB)-like BECV. 15 bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) were more closely related to Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (GIII/2) and other known genotype 2 BoNVs than genotype 1 Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE . BoNV Bo/CV521-OH/02/US shows high nucleotide and amino acid identities (84% and 94%, respectively) with the Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK capsid gene, while the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are the percentage of the RNA polymerase gene. was more closely related to those of Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE (77% and 87% identity, respectively) than Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (69% vs. 69%). identities), suggesting that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a genotype 1-2 recombinant. Gene conversion analysis by the recombinant identification program and SimPlot also predicted that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a recombinant.

However, many unknown viruses are barely detected through conventional virus isolation and PCR assay. Developing a technology platform to detect unknown viruses. We have established technology based on viral metagenomics in combination with new molecular diagnostics. The technology consists of host nucleic acid extraction, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to detect cells infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and a tissue sample of a pig infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).

PEDV has also been detected in Europe, following disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States. To better understand the general condition, molecular epidemiology and factors that may influence the most variable disease impact; Forty samples of pig feces from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries were collected and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV full encoding sequences were generated. Compared on a global scale, all sequences examined from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a highly homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting recent re-entry. However, detailed analyzes revealed two new clusters and putative ancestral strains. Based on available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type, or clinical presentation could not be established. In addition, the effect of secondary infections was investigated using metagenomic datasets. While few coinfections were observed, no correlation with disease course was found.

Such methods are generally PCR-based and therefore require the availability of sequence data from the pathogen. Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens. Transmission may be by direct contact with the animal, for example by exposure to fecal matter, or indirectly by arthropod vectors. Here, we investigated the viral content in rat fecal matter (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found that sequences from members of Picornaviridae were abundant in the microbiome of all samples. Here we describe the diversity of picornavirus-like contigs, including full-length genomes closely related to Boone cardiovirus and Theiler encephalomyelitis virus.

SaV is an agent that causes gastroenteritis in children and adults. SaV can be divided into five genogroups (GI-GV), among which GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to infect humans, while SaV GIII infects swine species. Detection methods include ELISA, RT-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR. Because few SaV studies have been conducted, it is difficult to draw correlations or conclusions between incidence, detection, and overall prevalence rates. However, most studies agree that SaV infection is more common in young children than adults, and that infection in children almost always occurs by age 5 years. In addition, children in day care centers and institutions are at greatest risk for SAV-related infection and transmission. Recently, a number of important findings regarding human SaV have been discovered. SaV strains were detected in water samples including untreated wastewater samples, treated wastewater samples and river samples. SaV strains have also been detected in shellfish samples intended for human consumption, and recombinant SaV strains have been detected in several different countries.

749,Comparative analysis of selected genes from Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus and other poxviruses,"Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) is the first symbiotic EPV identified from a parasitic wasp. DlEPV is introduced into the tefritid fruit fly larva host along with the wasp egg during spawning. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of dlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with that of selected pox viruses and other organisms. BlastP studies showed that five of these were homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly(A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms, such as gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae, and lambda phage integrase (Î»-Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for conserved early (TGA, A/T, XXXXA) or late (TAAAAT, TAAT or TAAAT) gene expression in poxviruses were identified with these ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments and aggregation of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences shows that DlEPV likely split from the ancestral node between poultry pox virus and B, lepidopteran, and orthopteran EPVs, and Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes belonged to these species. He claimed he was leaving. EPV belongs respectively. The dlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A and Î»-Int contained many conserved domains typifying these proteins. These homologs may be involved either in viral pathogenicity or enhancement of parasitism via compensation and gamma-glutamyl cycling in the parasitized fly, or through integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly.

750,Genetic diversity of chicken anemia virus following cell culture passage in MSB-1 cells,"Compared to CAV isolates that have undergone 60 passages in MSB-1 cells (SMSC-1/P60, 3-1/P60), chicken anemia virus (CAV) isolates received 33-66 nucleotide substitutions in the coding region and were passaged only 5 times in 13-MSB-1 cells. 16 amino acid changes (SMSC-1 and 3-1) compared to 16 (Chowdhury et al., Arch. Virol. 148, 2437-2448, 2003). In this study, we found that a low CAV (BL-5) and a high CAV transition (BL-5/P90) differed by only 15 nucleotide substitutions, resulting in 11 amino acid changes. VP1-based phylogenetic analysis also revealed that both isolates were close to each other but not to other CAV isolates from Malaysia, namely SMSC-1 and 3-1.",,"Hasmah, M. S.;Omar, A. R.;Wan, K.

751,Newcastle disease outbreaks in Sudan from 2003 to 2006 were caused by viruses of the 5d genotype.,"Newcastle disease (ND) is a serious neurological and respiratory disease in poultry that affects all bird species but does not cause symptoms in wild waterfowl that are traditionally their natural hosts. In the late 1990s, a new genotype, ie. Pathogenic to all bird species, including waterfowl, 5d originated in China and has since spread from East Asia to parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the fusion protein gene of isolates from ND outbreaks in Sudan and found that all contemporary strains isolated between 2003 and 2006 were genotype 5d containing the virulent fusion protein cleavage site (F0) motif 112RRQKRF117.

752,"Transmission patterns of human enterovirus 71 to and from European countries, 2003 to 2013","Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is implicated in epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and has been reported to occur in east and southeast Asia with serious neurological complications. In other geographic areas, transmission of this virus is poorly understood. We used large array datasets (viral protein 1 belongs to the gene encoding VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to compare the molecular epidemiology and geographic spread patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2 and C4 in Europe. other parts of the world. The European countries considered for the study were Member States of the European Union (EU) and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Viruses of subgenogroups B4, B5 and C4 circulate mainly in eastern and southeastern Asia. Sporadic entries of these subgenogroups are observed in Europe, but C1 and C2 viruses predominate. The phylogenies showed evidence of multiple spreading events involving C1 and C2 viruses in Europe since the mid-1990s. Two sporadic waves of C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The 2007 Dutch epidemic caused by C2 and the emergence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 occurred when circulation of C1 viruses was low. A chain of transmission involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and later to Canada between 2001 and 2006. Recent events in which the spread of viruses from, to, and within Europe have occurred appear to be relevant to the long-term survival of EV. -71 highlights the need for enhanced surveillance of this virus.",,"Hassel, C.;Mirand, A.;Lukashev, A.;Terletskaia Ladwig, E.;Farkas, A.;Schuffenecker, I.;Diedrich, S.;Huemer, H.

754,Detection of Campylobacter jejuni in rectal swab samples from Rousettus amplexicaudatus in the Philippines,"Bats are the second diversity species of mammals and are widely found throughout the world. They are thought to be reservoirs and vectors of zoonotic pathogens. However, there are few reports of evidence of pathogenic bacteria retained in bats. Precise knowledge of pathogenic bacteria in the bat microbiota is important for zoonotic control. Therefore, metagenomic analysis targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA of the rectal microbiota in Rousettus amplexicaudatus was performed using high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed that 103 genera of bacteria were detected, including Camplyobacter. Campylobacter was the second dominant genus, and Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni were identified in the microbiome of R. amplexicaudatus. Campylobacteriosis is one of the serious bacterial diarrheal diseases in humans, and C. jejuni is the most frequently accused species as the causative agent of campylobacteriosis. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of C. jejuni in 91 wild bats by PCR. As a result of targeted PCR testing on the 16S-23S intergenic spacer, the partial genome of C. jejuni was detected in only five R. amplexicaudatus. This is the first report of C. jejuni being detected in bat rectal swab samples. C. jejuni is the most common cause of campylobacteriosis in humans, transmitted through contact with water and livestock. This result showed that R. amplexicaudatus could be a carrier of C. jejuni.",,"Hatta, Y.;Omatsu, T.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Katayama, Y.;Taniguchi, S.;Masangkay, J.

755,Use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of vaccine contamination by avian leukosis virus,"reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for avian leukosis virus (ALV) has been developed for the detection of contamination of vaccines produced in embryonated egg and cell cultures from chickens. ALV is highly pathogenic and induces a broad spectrum of disease in infected animals. ALV can be divided into five subgroups (AE). The envelope glycoprotein (env gp85) is the main antigen determinant and is responsible for subgroup classification. Viral RNA of all subgroups (AE) was isolated and amplified using three sets of primers. Subsequently, restriction endonuclease analysis confirmed product identity and differentiated between subgroups. In specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs experimentally inoculated with ALV, viral RNA was found in allantoic fluids, as well as in vaccines supplemented with different subsets of ALV. No incidental virus was detected in commercially available preparations. This system provides a rapid and specific in vitro method for the detection of ALV RNA as a foreign agent and can be applied for quality control of avian vaccines.",,"HÃ¤uptli, D.;Bruckner, L.;Ottiger, H.

These advances have made possible direct microbial detection and characterization from clinical samples, known as metagenomic sequencing. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed in five snout and five faecal swab pools collected from each of two primary and two secondary market slaughterhouses and a cull pig purchasing station in the southeastern United States. Sequences were assembled de novo and analyzed by BLASTN to identify viruses present in the samples. Twenty-seven different viruses were detected. Reads similar to the diverse family of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified in nearly every sample (50/47). Other viruses identified in all five sampling sites and in more than half of the samples were bocavirus, torovirus, posavirus, torque teno virus, IAS virus, picobirnavirus, and teschovirus. Viruses identified at more than one site in more than 20% of the samples included enterovirus, parvovirus, influenza A virus, sapelovirus, and Senecavirus A. Other important swine viruses detected less frequently include swine circovirus type 2, swine epidemic diarrhea virus and swine deltacoronavirus.

757,Bovine rhinitis viruses are common in US cattle with bovine respiratory disease,"Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiological agents of the bovine respiratory disease complex, but little research has been published on their epidemiology and ecology for several decades. Only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified in the USA, while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) have been previously identified only in the UK and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic presentation from Kansas identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide identity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and template assemblies using reference genomes yielded nearly complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The nearly complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to allow for further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5'-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical samples. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One specimen showed infection with BRAV1 only. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture-adapted BRBV found that antibodies reactive to immunofluorescence testing were common in the flocks analyzed. Altogether, these results suggest that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV circulate together in US cattle and show high similarity to viruses isolated from various sites more than 30 years ago.",,"Hause, B.

758,Characterization of a new influenza virus in cattle and pigs: a proposal for a new genus in the family Orthomyxoviridae.,"We recently reported the isolation of a novel virus, tentatively named C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), with 50% overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICV) from an Oklahoma pig. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a different matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy from that of ICV. The novelty of the C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether the C/OK virus could be found in a non-swine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was prevalent in US cattle herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three cattle viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether porcine/bovine C/OK viruses can be reclassified with human ICV and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reclassification and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed. In vitro reclassification using two human ICVs and two porcine and bovine C/OK viruses showed that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reclassify and produce viable progeny. No cross-recognition of detergent cleaved virions was observed in AGID between human and non-human viruses using polyclonal antibodies that are antigenically reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results suggest that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically different from ICV. It is suggested that the new virus be classified in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. The presence of C/OK virus in swine and cattle indicates that this new virus can spread and infect other mammals, including humans. Â© 2014 Hause et al.",,"Hause, B. M.;Collin, E.

Here we present the first genomic sequence of the reference strain PCPV (VR634) together with the genomic sequence of a PPV (F00.120R) isolated from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Finland. The F00.120R and VR634 genomes are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively, whose genome organization is similar to that of other PPVs. While the predicted proteins of F00.120R and VR634 have an average amino acid sequence identity of over 95%, they share only 88% and 73% amino acid identity with the ORFV and BPSV proteomes, respectively. The most notable differences were found near the genome termini. Six genes are absent in F00.120R and three in VR634 seen near the right terminal of other PPVs. The four genes at the left end of F00.120R and one in the middle of both genomes appear to be fragmented paralogs of other genes within the genome. VR634 has larger-than-expected inverted terminal repeats, possibly as a result of genomic rearrangements. The high G+C content (64%) of these two viruses, together with amino acid sequence comparisons and whole genome phylogenetic analyzes, confirms the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the genus Parapoxvirus and confirms that the virus is responsible for the epidemic of infectious stomatitis.

767,History of prions and transmission of protein misfolding,"The nature of the causative agents of these ""slow virus diseases"" remains a mystery, as J. Cuillé and PL Chelle successfully transmitted scrapie among sheep to chimpanzee by experimental vaccination in 1936 and DC Gajdusek kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 1966 and 1968, respectively. In 1982, S. Prusiner named them ""PRIONs"" (for ""Protein-containing Infectious particles"") because they appear to lack nucleic acids to classify them as viruses. Most rare human PRION diseases appeared ""sporadic"", although infectious or genetic mechanisms were rarely found. They shared many clinical and neuropathological features with human neurodegenerative diseases (slow development, marked nervous system involvement, amyloid deposits, poor immune response), the mechanism of which is not generally considered infectious. In 1991, H. Braak demonstrated the low spread of neuropathological tau-related lesions along anatomical pathways in the Alzheimer's disease brain. They appear long before clinical signs. The abnormally misfolded protein features of many neurodegenerative diseases are thought to be picked up after initial seeding. This leads to their cell-to-cell transmission and propagation through neuronal and extra-neuronal pathways, which is unexpectedly under investigation. Whether insemination is contagious or not is controversial. This new paradigm should open the door to a new therapeutic approach to understand their natural histories and phenotypic diversity, which has already led to an assessment of the diagnostic value of skin biopsy.",,"Hauw, J.

768,Evidence of microevolution of Salmonella Typhimurium during a series of egg-related epidemics linked to a single poultry farm,"BACKGROUND: The bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is one of the most common causes of foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks. A series of S. Typhimurium outbreaks occurred in Tasmania, Australia between 2005 and 2008, all traced back to eggs originating from a single poultry farm. To investigate the microevolution of a pathogenic S. Typhimurium clone in a natural, spatio-temporal constrained population, we sequenced the genomes of 12 isolates associated with these outbreaks. RESULTS: Isolates sharing a DT135-like phage type, known locally as 135@ or 135a, formed a segment within the S. Typhimurium population that closely resembled the reference genome SL1334 (160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs). Ten of the isolates belonged to a single clone (<23 SNPs between pairs of isolates), possibly representative of the poultry circulating S. Typhimurium population; the other two were sporadic cases and were genetically different from this clone. Divergence dating showed that all 12 isolates diverged from a common ancestor in the mid-1990s, and the clone began diversifying in 2003-2004. This clone spread to the human population several times between 2005 and 2008; over this time period, SNPs continued to accumulate at a constant rate of 3-5 SNPs per year, or 1x10-6 substitution site-1 year-1, faster than the longer one. -S. Predicted futures (~50 years) rates for Typhimurium. Our data show that roughly half of the nonsynonymous substitutions are rapidly removed from the S. Typhimurium population, after which the purification selection is no longer important and the remaining substitutions are fixed in the population. S. Typhimurium 135® isolates were nearly identical to SL1344 in gene content and virulence plasmids. Their phage contents were close to SL1344 except that they carried a different variant of Gifsy-1, lacked the P2 residue found in SL1344, and replaced the P2 phage SopEphi of SL1344 with a new P2 phage, P2-Hawk. The DT135 lacks the P2 prophage. Two additional plasmids were identified in S. Typhimurium 135® isolates, pSTM2 and pSTM7. Both plasmids were IncI1, but phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and their bacterial hosts suggest that these plasmids are genetically distinct and result from independent plasmid acquisition events. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides high-resolution insight into the short-term microevolution of the important human pathogen S. Typhimurium. It shows that purifying selection occurs rapidly in this population (<= 6 years) and then declines, providing an estimate for the short-term rate of substitution. The latter is likely to be more suitable for foodborne outbreak research than previous estimates based on longer timescales.",,"Hawkey, J.;Edwards, D.

To fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB strains, we used a metagenomic approach and sequenced and analyzed the complete coding sequences (CDS) of the VP3, NSP3 and NSP4 genes and partial or complete CDS of others. RVB genes detected from Japanese cattle. VP3, NSP3 and NSP4 of bovine RVBs, murine, human, and porcine RVBs suggest that bovine RVBs belong to a new genotype. In addition, significantly lower amino acid sequence identities were observed for NSP4 (36.1%-39.3%) between bovine RVBs and RVBs of other species. In contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to RVBs of other species and strains of rotavirus A (RVA). Phylogenetic analyzes of all gene segments revealed that the bovine RVB strains formed a branching cluster away from other RVBs. These results suggest that bovine RVBs evolved independently from other RVBs, but in a similar fashion to other rotaviruses.

We hypothesized that peptides representing the diversity of native HIV-1 V3 loop variants could capture elements of conserved higher-order structures, thereby stimulating broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies. We designed a panel of 29 subtype B V3 sequences that are assumed to reflect the range of V3 diversity. These peptides were used to immunize guinea pigs. The most potent peptide (62.19) induced antibodies that clustered around the subtype B consensus sequence and reproducibly neutralized 31% of subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates evaluated, but exhibited limited cross-neutralization of non-subtype B HIV-1 strains.

772,"Group A Rotaviruses in Chinese Bats: Genetic Composition, Serology, and Evidence for Bat-to-Human Transmission and Reclassification","Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and growing evidence supports the idea that bats may harbor group A rotaviruses (RVA), which is an important cause of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains with entirely new genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and Chinese bats. However, all data are mainly based on the detection of RVA RNA, which is only present during acute infections and does not allow assessment of the actual exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or intestinal samples and 448 bat serums were collected from five provinces of southern China. Specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Lineage GLRL1 had an entirely new constellation of genotypes, while the other three had a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized virus group widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, while strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 likely reconnected between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat serum by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher prevalence of RVA-specific antibodies than bats in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for interspecies transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the public health impact of bats as a reservoir of RVA. IMPORTANT Bat viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra and Nipah viruses are important pathogens causing outbreaks of emerging serious infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses that can cause gastroenteritis in humans, although 8 group A viruses (RVA) have been identified from bats so far. In this study, 4 additional RVA strains were identified, one of which provides strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological studies have also shown that RVA infection in bats is much more common than expected based on detection of viral RNA.",,"He, B.;Huang, X. H.;Zhang, F. Q.;Tan, W.

774,Characterization of a novel G3P[3] rotavirus isolated from a smaller horseshoe bat: a distant relative of feline/dog rotaviruses.,"Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many viruses that are pathogenic to humans. A viral metagenomics-based approach was used to examine gut samples from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be associated with group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation in cell cultures confirmed the presence of a new RVA strain, RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 small horseshoe bats. Whole genomic sequencing analyzes show that MSLH14 is of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis showed that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain CMH222 with animal traits isolated from Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a number of animal RVA strains, most of which were believed to be associated with cat/dog RVAs. Experimental infection demonstrated that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to lactating mice, causing 100% mortality when inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5×-102 50% tissue culture infective doses. Because this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strains, it is tempting to think that it is a true strain of bat RVA rather than an interspecies-transmitted virus. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably young animals, will be crucial in determining whether this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.",,"He, B.;Yang, F.;Yang, W.;Zhang, Y.;Feng, Y.;Zhou, J.;Xie, J.;Feng, Y.;Bao, X.;Guo, H.;Li, Y.;Xia, L.;Li, N.;Matthijnssens, J.;Zhang, H.;Tu, C.",2013.0,,10.1128/jvi.02013-13,0
775,Genome-wide mapping of DNase I hypersensitive regions and association analysis with gene expression in MSB1 cells,"DNase I hypersensitive regions (DHSs) mark various classes of cis regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers. MSB-1, derived from chicken Marek's disease (MD) lymphomas, is an MDV-transformed CD4+ T cell line for the MD study. Previously, DNase IHS sites have been studied in human cell types mainly for mammals. To capture regulatory elements specific to MSB1 cells and explore the molecular mechanisms of MDV-induced T-cell transformation in MD, we generated a high-quality DHS map and gene expression profiling for functional analysis in the MSB1 cell line. A total of 21,724 significant DHS peaks were detected from approximately 40 million short reads. DHS distribution differed between chromosomes and they preferred to enrich gene-rich chromosomes. More interestingly, DHS enrichments were found to be scarce in regions that were abundant in CpG islands. Furthermore, we integrated DHSs into gene expression data and found that while DHSs tended to enrich on highly expressed genes across all gene regions, DHSs did not show significant changes for low and silently expressed genes. Furthermore, the correlation of DHSs with expression of lincRNAs was also calculated, implying that enhancer-associated lincRNAs likely originate from enhancer-like regions of DHSs. Together, our results showed that DNase I HS regions were highly correlated with active gene expression in MSB1 cells, suggesting that DHSs could be considered as markers to identify cis regulatory elements associated with chicken Marek's disease.

776,Whole genome sequencing of genotype VI Newcastle disease viruses from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from wild pigeons reveals continued evolution and previously unrecognized genetic diversity in the USA.,"Background: Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) are highly contagious and cause disease in both wild birds and poultry. A pigeon-adapted variant of genotype VI NDV, commonly referred to as pigeon paramyxovirus 1, is widely isolated from columbia in the United States and worldwide. Full genomic characterization of these genotype VI viruses circulating in wild colombias in the United States is limited, and failure of rapid diagnostic detection has been reported due to the genetic variability of the virus. Therefore, in this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and characterize these circulating viruses, providing valuable genetic information. NGS enables deep sequencing of multiple samples in parallel. When used on FFPE samples, this methodology allows for retrospective studies of infectious organisms. Methods: FFPE wild pigeon tissue samples (kidney, liver and spleen) from 10 deaths in the USA between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed using NGS to detect and sequence NDV genomes from randomly amplified total RNA. Results were compared with previously published immunohistochemistry (IHC) results conducted on the same samples. In addition, phylogenetic analyzes were performed on the complete and partial fusion gene and whole genome coding sequences. Results: Twenty-three of the 29 IHC-positive FFPE pigeon samples were identified as positive for NDV by NGS. Positive samples produced an average genome coverage of 99.6% and an average median depth of 199. In the USA from 2010 to 2016. Wild bird-derived FFPE samples. There are at least two distinct US genotype VI NDV strains conserved in wild pigeons, independently evolving continuously, and without obvious epidemiological links to viruses circulating abroad. These findings support the hypothesis that Columbuses served as a reservoir of lethal NDV in the United States.",,"He, Y.;Taylor, T. L.;Dimitrov, K. M.;Butt, S. L.;Stanton, J. B.;Goraichuk, I.

777,Electrostatic Variation of Haemagglutinin as a Distinguishing Mark of the Evolution of Avian Influenza Viruses,"Avian influenza virus is a zoonotic agent that significantly affects public health and the poultry industry. Monitoring viral evolution and spread is crucial for surveillance and monitoring programs currently based on serological or DNA sequencing-phylogenetic analysis. However, virus-host interactions, antigenic drift, and spread of viral strands are strongly dependent on variation in the surface properties of capsid proteins. Here we report that in silico comparative structural analysis of hemagglutinin can reveal relevant evolutionary fingerprints, especially when integrated with sequence-based analyses. Phylogenetic analyzes of H9 viral strains from wild birds and poultry by different methods led to reliable clustering of viruses into five main groups. Subsequent comparison of structural features showed concordance between such aggregation and surface electrostatic fingerprints. These latter fingerprints associate group-specific variations in electrostatic charges and isocontours with well-known hemagglutinin regions involved in modulation of immune escape and host specificity. This work suggests that the integration of structural and sequence comparisons could enhance the investigation of trends and related mechanisms in viral evolution.",,"Heidari, A.;Righetto, I.;Filippini, F.",2018.0,,10.1038/s41598-018-20225-3,0

(2010) MChip, a low-density microarray, differentiates between seasonal human H1N1, North American pig H1N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(6), 411-416. Background MChip uses data from the hybridization of amplified viral RNA to 15 different oligonucleotides targeting the influenza A matrix (M) gene segment. An artificial neural network (ANN) automates the interpretation of subtle differences in fluorescent intensity patterns from the microarray. The entire process from clinical sample to identification, including amplification of viral RNA, can be completed in <8 hours for under $10. Objectives The work presented here represents an effort to expand and test the capabilities of MChip to discriminate against influenza A/H1N1 from various strains. Methods MChip ANN is trained to recognize fluorescent display patterns of a variety of known influenza A viruses, including human H1N1, human H3N2, swine H1N1, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 and samples of a wide variety of avian, equine, canine, and a wide variety of influenza A viruses. swine flu viruses. The robustness of the MChip ANN was evaluated using 296 blind isolates. Results ANN training was extended by the addition of 71 well-characterized influenza A isolates, providing relatively high accuracy (minor misclassification) in distinguishing unique H1N1 strains: nine human A/H1N1 (88%Â·9% correct), 35 human A/H3N2 (% 97Â·1% correct), 31 North American pig A/H1N1 (80Â·6 correct), 14 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 (87Â·7% correct), and 23 negative samples (91Â·3% correct). Genetic variation among porcine H1N1 isolates may have contributed to the lower success rate for these viruses. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that MChip has the ability to distinguish genetic variations between influenza viruses with appropriate ANN training. Further selective enrichment of ANN will improve its ability to rapidly and reliably characterize influenza viruses of unknown origin. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Heil, G.

779,Molecular characterization of avian reovirus isolates in Tunisia,"Background: Genotype analyzes of avian reoviruses isolated from organ samples from chickens with suspected clinical symptoms between 1997 and 2008 were based on sequences for both the ÏƒC and ÏƒB genes, enabling studies to be conducted, in agreement with those published in Genbank. molecular classification and relationships. Methods The full length of the known variable protein ÏƒC and some of the genes encoding ÏƒB were amplified by RT-PCR using conserved primers. PCR products were sequenced and sequences analyzed and aligned with avian reovirus sequences from the Genbank database. Results: Sequences of ÏƒC-encoding genes of all isolated strains showed their close association with American, Chinese and Indian strains. Taking the American strain S1133 as reference, two Tunisian isolates 97.1 and 97.2 showed some nucleotide substitutions. For isolate 97.1, the substitution was silent, whereas for strain 97.2, the mutation was at the first position of the corresponding codon and induced substitution of the encoded amino acid. For the gene encoding ÏƒB, the sequences of the Tunisian strains showed mutations at positions two or three of the corresponding codons, inducing substitutions of amino acids at these positions. Phylogenetic trees based on genes encoding ÏƒC and ÏƒB showed a closer association of genotype I between isolates from Tunisia, America, and Taiwan. Conclusion: Our study identifies the genotype of avian reoviruses that are not yet genetically well characterized. The characterization and classification of these viruses may be important for understanding the epidemiology of malabsorption syndrome and viral arthritis and improving our knowledge of the genotype of strains circulating in Tunisian herds. In addition, examining their variable pathogenicity can be extremely important in selecting the appropriate vaccine strain to control the disease.

All field isolates showed greater genetic homogeneity (95-100%) among themselves and were 19.7-21.2% different from the vaccine strain. In phylogenetic analysis, Indian field isolates formed a distinct lineage (lineage VII) distinct from the six previously identified lineages (lineage I-VI) in type C FMDV [J. Viral. 66 (1992) 3557]. The vaccine strain is grouped with European ancestry (strain II). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the antigenic regions A and C of the domain isolates showed no significant change from the vaccine strain.

781,Emergence of a new type O foot-and-mouth disease virus: phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship to the PanAsia pandemic strain.,"Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O has been associated with over 75% of outbreaks in India. Previous studies with this serotype have shown that viruses circulating in India belong to a single genotype. Recent (February 2001) foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in Europe have focused global attention on the source of the virus and have been traced to the PanAsia (serotype O) strain found in India since 1990. In this study, we sequenced the complete VP1-encoding (1D) gene for 71 FMDV serotype O isolates from India, belonging to the PanAsian strain, that were recovered from field outbreaks in the past 4 years (1962-2001) to further characterize the isolates. All isolates in the tree were classified in three main branches (determined as A, B and C); Branch C is further divided into four groups (I-IV), of which IV. belongs to the group PanAsia strain. We also show that the PanAsia strain has been endemic circulating since 1982 (not in 1990, as previously reported) and has been the most dominant epidemic strain in recent years, with distribution in at least 17 states in the country. During 2001, another new virus group (group III) with 5.4-11.1% genetic deviation at the nucleotide level from the PanAsia strain was found to circulate endemic together and gradually replace it. At the amino acid level, this strain differed from the PanAsia strain at the five amino acid positions in VP1. Although these strains differed at the nucleotide level, they maintained a good antigenic relationship with one of the vaccine strains widely used in the country (IND R2/75). Given the ability of the PanAsia virus to persist, spread and outpace other strains, the current trend could be of serious concern as the newly emerged virus has replaced it. If this is true, there is another equally different species, PanAsia, which could pose a serious threat to the global dairy and meat industries.",,"Hemadri, D.;Tosh, C.;Sanyal, A.;Venkataramanan, R.",2002.0,,10.1023/a:1020165923805,0
782,Genetic analysis of foot and mouth virus type O isolates responsible for field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999,"The partial nucleotide sequence at the 3â€² end of the 1D (VP1-encoding) gene of 90 foot-and-mouth disease virus type O isolates obtained from field outbreaks in India between 1993-9 was determined. Sequences were compared with each other and with reference viruses. Published sequences of 15 type O isolates from different parts of Asia and one isolate from Europe (O1BFS) and one isolate from Egypt (O1/Sharquia/Egypt/72) were also included in the analysis for comparison. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, viruses can be grouped into four different genotypes (genotypes I-IV). All 90 isolates from India were genotype-I, as were the reference isolates from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. Genotype-I isolates were further subdivided into 16 subgenotypes. The Indian isolates were found to be extremely heterogeneous in nature and clustered into 12 different genetic groups. The nucleotide sequence difference between isolates in genotype-I is 0-11.6%, while it is 0-8.8% in Indian isolates. Viruses of similar genetic groups circulate in India, Bangladesh, and Middle Eastern countries. Genotypes-II and -III are represented by Lebanese (O1/South Lebanon) and European (O1-BFS) isolates, respectively. Genotype-IV consists of isolates from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This study reveals the emergence of viruses belonging to more than one genetic group in a short time and the persistence of a single genetic group for several years in the same geographical area.

785,Human biliary glycoproteins serve as receptors for interspecies transfer of mouse hepatitis virus.,"The Mouse Hepatitis virus (MHV) variant, designated MHV-H2, was isolated by serial passage in mixed cultures of permissive DBT cells and nonpermissive Syrian Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells. MHV-H2 was efficiently replicated in hamster, mouse, primate kidney (Vero, Cos 1, Cos 7) and human adenocarcinoma (HRT) cell lines, but not in pig testicular (ST), feline kidney (CRFK), and canine kidney (MDCK) cells. To understand the molecular basis of coronavirus cross-species transfer into human cell lines, the replication of MHV-H2 was studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells expressing the high human homolog of the normal murine receptor, biliary glycoprotein (Bgp). . MHV-H2 was replicated in human HepG2 cells, breast carcinoma (MCF7) cells at low levels, and human colon adenocarcinoma (LS 174T) cell lines expressing high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at low levels. These data suggested that MHV-H2 might use the human Bgp homolog as a receptor for entry into HepG2 cells. To further examine MHV-H2 receptor utilization in human cell lines, blockade experiments were performed with a panel of different monoclonal or polyclonal antisera directed against human CEA genes. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antiserum for all CEA family members or with Kat4c (cd66abde), a monoclonal antibody directed against Bgp1, CGM6, CGM1a, NCA and CEA, inhibits virus replication and MHV-H2 infects HepG2 cells.

These antibodies did not block sindbis virus (SB) replication in HepG2 cells, nor did they block SB, MHV-A59, or MHV-H2 replication in DBT cells. Monoclonal antibodies Col-4, Col-14 and Kat4c (cd66abde) reacted strongly with human Bgp and CEA, but showed variable binding patterns with other CEA genes. Following expression of human Bgp in normally nonpermissive porcine testis (ST) and feline kidney (CRFK) cells, the cells became susceptible to MHV-H2 infection.

We identified highly represented putative eukaryotic, circular, single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among them, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a previously reported virus from a hyperthermal lake that shares features of both single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single-stranded DNA viruses. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to examine the prevalence of both positive and negative chains and viral load of the hybrid virus (DMClaHV) associated with Daphnia mendotae (Cladocera) during a summer season in Lakes Oneida and Cayuga. DMClaHV had high prevalence within Daphnia populations where the viral load and the proportion of virus positive individuals were higher prior to the host population decline. DMClaHV viral load was different between the two Daphnia species (D. mendotae and D. retrocurva), and dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We detected DMClaHV in eggs (ephippia) from Lake Oneida sediments with an estimated age of 30 years. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm in diameter) virus-like particles in Daphnia that are quite distant from intestinal tissues and are not associated with intracellular parasites.

787,Application of high resolution melting curve analysis for classification of infectious bronchitis viruses in field samples,"Aim: A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/high resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis protocol was developed in our laboratory to differentiate infectious bronchitis (IB) virus reference strains. In the current study, this method was used to detect and classify IB viruses in field submissions. Procedure: Samples were taken from 40 suspected cases of IB virus over an 11-month period, and 17 applicants were positive for IB virus via polymerase chain reaction. HRM curve analysis classified each strain as subgroup 1, 2, or 3 strains (12 references) or an unclassifiable strain (5 references). The 3' untranslated region (UTR) and partial S1 gene nucleotide sequences were determined for the 17 IB virus strains and their identity was compared with that of the relative reference strains to validate the classifications established using HRM curve analysis. Results: The 3'UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences from 12 IB domain viruses classified as subgroup 1, 2 or 3 using HRM curve analysis had -99% identity with the corresponding subgroup reference strain. Analysis of the 3' UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the five unclassifiable IB virus strains showed that four belonged to one of the subgroups and one was a potential recombinant strain (between subgroups 2 and 3 strains). A new recombinant strain was also identified. Conclusion: HRM curve analysis can rapidly assign most IB viruses found in field presentations to known subgroups. Importantly, HRM curve analysis also identified variant genotypes requiring further investigation. Â© 2010 Authors.

788,Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus: Sequence analysis of small RNA segments from a worldwide virus collection.,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFv) is a member of the Nairovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. It has a triple, single-stranded RNA genome with negative polarity consisting of large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. CCHF virus is enzootic in lifeguard and wild animals in many parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa and is also recognized in Southeastern Europe. Severe disease, manifested by hemorrhagic fever and high mortality rates (up to 50%), is recognized only in humans. We determined the complete sequence of the small genomic RNA segment from various strains of CCHF viruses originating from the outbreaks in Pakistan 2000, Baghdad 1976 and Uzbekistan 1967. Phylogenetic analysis of three sequence data from the small genomic RNA segment available from a number of strains shows that they can be divided into seven subtypes. Superimposed on this model, connections between distant geographic locations indicate the existence of a global reservoir of CCHFv. In some cases, these links may result from long-distance transport of the virus or infected ticks during pet trade and bird migration.

Phylogenetic comparisons of these strains and related sequences, known as T1, T3, T5, T6 and T7, showed that these strains were indeed PStV strains. Moreover, PStV strains appear to be related to each other according to their geographical origins. That is, despite the diversity of symptoms caused by these strains and the overlap of symptom types between strains from different locations, Thai strains are more closely related than strains from the USA or Indonesia. Like other PStV strains, PStV-Thai bean can be considered as strains of common mosaic virus (BCMV), but can be distinguished from bean-infecting strains of BCMV and blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (B1CMV) by sequence and host range. Unlike PStV-Ib, no evidence was found that PStV-Thai strains are recombinants of PStV and B1CMV, although strain T3 may be a recombinant of different PStV sequences.

791,High-throughput sequencing methods for microbiome profiling: application to food animal systems Review,"Analysis of microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing methods began in the mid-2000s, allowing for 1000 to 10,000 sequence reads per sample and megabase data generation per sequence run. This unprecedented sequencing depth has allowed the discovery of the 'rare biosphere' in environmental samples for the first time. The technology was quickly applied to studies in a variety of human subjects. Perhaps these early studies reminded us that although microbes living in mammals are known to outnumber host cells, many of them are unknown members of our second genome, or microbiome (as invented by Joshua Lederberg). because we cannot culture them. High-throughput methods for microbial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing have begun to reveal the composition and identity of archaeal, bacterial, and viral communities at many sites in and on the human body. Research into the microbiota of food production animals has been published over the past few years, and future studies should benefit from protocols and tools developed from large-scale human microbiome studies. However, animal-related production resources such as advanced host genome assemblies and an increasing diversity of host-specific microbial reference genome sequences will be needed to allow for meaningful and robust analysis of 16S rDNA and WGS sequence data.",,"Highlander, S.

792,Influenza transmission reflects seasonality of wild birds throughout the annual cycle,"Influenza A Viruses (IAV) in nature must overcome the changing barriers of transmission caused by the mobility of their primary hosts, migratory wild birds, that change over the annual cycle. Using a phylogenetic network of viral sequences from North American wild birds (2008–2011), we show a transition from intraspecies transmission to interspecies transmission that, together with reclassification, allows IAV to reach viral flux in successive seasons from summer to winter. Our study supports amplification of IAV during summer propagation by the locally persisted and introduced virus from a wide range of latitudes. As birds migrate from their breeding grounds to lower latitudes, they become involved in transmission networks that are more closely linked to other bird species, and transmission of interspecies reassortant viruses peaks during the winter months. We propose that altering migration dynamics could be a critical strategy for pathogens infecting mobile hosts living in regions with strong seasonality.",,"Hill, N. J.;Ma, E. J.;Meixell, B.

793,Microbial Ecology Along the Gastrointestinal System,"The ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal (GI) system undergoes a range of environmental, chemical and physical conditions as it moves from the oral cavity to the anus. These differences in conditions, along with food or other ingested substrates, influence the composition and density of the microbiota, as well as their functional roles, by choosing the most suitable for that environment. Although the number of studies on Archaea, Eukarya and Viruses is limited despite their important roles in this ecosystem, previous studies mostly focused on Bacteria. Also, many studies focusing on the composition of microbiomes are still exploratory, due to the difficulties associated with collecting samples directly from inside humans. Therefore, mechanistic studies are carried out to investigate functions using animal models. However, differences in physiology and microbiomes need to be clarified to help translate animal model findings into human context. This review will highlight Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, and Viruses, discuss differences along the GI tract of healthy humans, and make comparisons to three common animal models: rats, mice, and pigs.",,"Hillman, E.

794,"TTV, a novel human virus with a single-stranded circular DNA genome","TT virus (TTV) was found in 1997 from a hepatitis patient without virus markers. However, the true impact of TTV on liver diseases remains unclear to date. Due to the lack of suitable cell systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still unclear. This review attempts to summarize the current state of TTV outside of TTV's taxonomic diversity. TTV was the first human virus with a single-stranded circular DNA genome. TTV has been considered a member of the Circoviridae, although others have suggested it fits into a new family. TTV differs from ambisense viruses in the Circovirus genus because the former genome is negative-chain. The genome structure of TTV is more closely related to chicken anemia virus in the genus Gyrovirus, but sequence similarity is minimal except for a brief stretch at 3816-3851 of TA278. Currently, the working group proposes the full name of TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and the TTV-like mini-virus TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new strain of Anellovirus (ring). TTVs are common in non-human primates, and human TTV can cross-infect chimpanzees. In addition, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cows and sheep. TTV can be transmitted from mother to child through infection. However, within one year of birth, the prevalence reaches the same level in infants born to both TTV-positive and TTV-negative mothers, even without breastfeeding. The non-coding region surrounding a short 113 nt GC-rich stretch and occupying approximately one-third of the genome is considered to contain the putative origin of replication. Three mRNAs, TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb are expressed by the species. A protein translated from 3.0 kb mRNA is considered the main capsid protein as well as replicase. The nature of the proteins translated by the other two mRNAs is still hypothetical. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Hino, S.",2002.0,,10.1002/rmv.351,0
795,Torque teno virus (TTV): Current status,"Torque tenovirus (TTV), currently classified in the family Anellovirus genus Circoviridae, was first found in a patient with non-AE hepatitis. TTV has a single-stranded circular DNA of âˆ¼3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups, including the SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with a genome of âˆ¼2.9 kb also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2 and 2.6 kb species have joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV variety cannot be explained; It is unclear how TTVs might be viable and why they need such genetic variation. A definitive culture system still does not exist. TTVs are ubiquitous in >90% of adults worldwide, but the human pathogenicity of TTV has not been fully established. Epidemiological studies should identify variants and clinical targets studied and calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer, and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/TTMV-related viruses have been found in chimpanzees, monkeys, African monkeys and tupaia, as well as in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were permanently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three types of mRNA, 3.0-, 1.2-, and 1.0-kb in a 60:5:35 ratio. Recently, at least three mRNAs have been demonstrated in chicken anemia virus. The genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the precise functions of these proteins await further research studies.

796,Association of torque teno virus with chicken anemia virus,"This chapter examines the relationship between Torque teno virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with each of the known open reading frames (ORF) in its antigenomic chain. This structure is different from the structures of circoviruses. TTV and CAV have different genomic sizes, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. The spectrum of the TTV genome is extremely diverse, while the spectrum of the CAV genome is extremely narrow. Although a 36-nt stretch near the origin of replication of TA278 TTV has more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of other genomic regions does not show significant similarity. However, the relative allocation of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are produced by transcription in both. A structural protein with a replicase domain is encoded by frame 1 in every virus, and a non-structural protein with a phosphatase domain is encoded by frame 2. In each virus, a protein on framework 3 induces apoptosis in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is required for CAV replication. TTV proposed to form a new family, Anelloviridae. Given these similarities and differences between CAV and TTV, it seems more plausible to place CAV, the only member of the Gyrovirus genus, together with TTV into Anelloviridae or a new independent family. © 2009 Springer.",,"Hino, S.;Prasetyo, A.

797,Conservation of L and 3C proteinase activities in distantly related aftoviruses,"Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader (L) proteinase is an important virulence determinant in FMDV infections. It has two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) inducing cleavage of the translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the Aphthovirus genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but it shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aftovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using in vitro transcription and translation analysis, we demonstrated that both ERAV and ERBV L proteins have C-terminal processing activity. Moreover, expression of ERAV L, but not ERBV L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in effective inhibition of cap-dependent translation in these cells. We show that EBAV and FMDV L proteinases induce eIF4GI cleavage at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and produces different products that also migrate together with those induced by FMDV 3C. ERBV L proteinase does not induce eIF4GI cleavage, consistent with its inability to turn off cap-dependent translation. We also show that another unique feature of FMDV L, stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by ERAV L proteinase, but not by ERBV L. Functional preservation of different ERAV and FMDV proteinases indicates the possibility that these enzymes may have a similar and important role in the pathogenesis of infections by these distantly related aftoviruses.",,"Hinton, T.

798,"Epidemiology of vampire bat-transmitted rabies virus in Goias, Central Brazil: reassessment based on the GL intergenic region.","BACKGROUND: Vampire bat-related rabies wreaks havoc on both the livestock industry and the public health sector in central Brazil. The geographic distributions of rabies virus variants transmitted from the vampire bat are restricted to mountain chains. These findings were explained by analyzing a highly conserved nucleoprotein gene. This study aims to elucidate the detailed epidemiological characters of rabies virus transmitted from the vampire bat by phylogenetic methods based on the 619-nt sequence containing the unconserved GL intergenic region. RESULTS: Vampire bat transmitted rabies virus isolates separated into 8 phylogenetic lineages in the previous nucleoprotein gene analysis were separated into 10 phylogenetic lineages with significant bootstrapping values. It has been reconfirmed that the distribution of most variants is restricted by mountain chains. Also, variants in undulating areas have narrow distributions and are apparently separated by mountain ridges. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the 619-nt sequence containing the GL intergenic region is more useful than the partial nucleoprotein gene for state-level phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus, while also showing that the distribution of vampire bat-transmitted RABV variants tends to diverge. not only by mountain chains but also by mountain ridges, thus suggesting that the diversity of vampire bat-transmitted RABV variants is constrained by geographic fluctuations.",,"Hirano, S.;Itou, T.;Carvalho, A.

800,"Phylogeny and natural history of primate lentiviruses, SIV and HIV","Studies of primate lentivirus phylogeny over the past decade have established at least five groups of related but genetically distinct simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), each originating from a different African primate species. The hypothesis that HIV-2 (and SIVmac) arose by interspecies transmission from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) was strengthened by further characterization of the SIVsm/SIVmac/HIV-2 virus group. SIV from all four subspecies of African green monkeys (SIVagm) was characterized by a distinctive chimeric genome structure of SIVagm from West African green monkeys. Although these naturally infected primates remain healthy, cross-species transmission to other primate species can result in immunodeficiency caused by SIVsm infection of macaque monkeys (Macaca sp.) and recently SIVagm infection of pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina). Studies of variation in infected individuals have been facilitated by adapting heteroduplex analysis techniques and single-stranded conformational polymorphism of PCR-generated fragments.",,"Hirsch, V.

Subsequently, many conduction experiments were conducted, which led to the establishment of the basic concept of infectious spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The infectious agent was supposed to be a new virus, so TSE was classified as a slow virus infection. In 1982, Prusiner investigated the infectious fraction of scrapie-infected brain homogenate, identified the infectious agent as proteinaceous infectious particles that resist inactivation by nucleic acid-altering procedures, and renamed prion after virion in viral infection.",,"Hizume, M.;Mizusawa, H.",2007.0,,,0

Here we report that feline aminopeptidase N (APN), a cell surface metalloprotease in intestinal, lung and kidney epithelial cells, is a receptor for type II FIPV but not type I FIPV. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) RG-4 that blocks infection of Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells by type II FIPV was obtained by immunizing mice with fcwf-4 cells that are highly susceptible to FIPV. This MAb also blocked infection of fcwf-4 cells by type II feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and infectious gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). On the other hand, it did not prevent infection by type I FIPVs. MAb RG-4 recognized a polypeptide with a relative molecular mass of 120-130 kDa in feline intestinal brush-bordered membrane (BBM) proteins. The polypeptide had aminopeptidase activity and the first 15 N-terminal amino acid sequence was the same as that of the feline APN.

When the polypeptide specificity recognized by these monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was investigated by Western immunoblotting, all of the MAbs reacted with the peplomer glycoprotein (S) of the virus. By competitive binding assay, these MAbs were found to recognize at least 3 different epitopes. Reactivity of these MAbs with 6 viruses classified as FIPV type I (UCD-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, NW-1 and Black), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) type II strain 79-1683, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain 1-71 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains were investigated by TO-163 and SH neutralization tests. All MAbs neutralized FECV strain 79-1683, CCV strain 1-71, and TGEV strains TO-163 and SH, while 6 did not neutralize FIPV type I viruses. Also, MAb against TGEV strain TO-163, which has potent neutralizing activity against 7 TGEV viruses, neutralized CCV strain 1-71, FECV strain 79-1683 and FIPv strain 79-1146, but 6 FIPV type I' i did not neutralize viruses. These results indicated that there are at least 3 epitopes involved in the neutralization of FIPV type II strain 79-1146 and that these epitopes are absent in FIPV type I viruses but present in FECV strain 79-1683, which does not induce feline infection. peritonitis, TGEV strains TO-163 and SH and CCV strain 1-71.

Gross pathological lesions were absent or inconsistent in the majority of cases, but severe and consistent microscopic lesions were found in the brain. and spinal cord characterized by non-purulent panencephalomyelitis. Several virus isolates were obtained in cell cultures (Vero and DF-1) inoculated with brain homogenates of affected ducks and in embryonated duck eggs. After exclusion of other viruses, isolates were identified as flavivirus by flavivirus-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. Subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccination of 2-week-old Pekin ducks with a flavivirus isolate resulted in typical clinical signs and histological lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Inoculated virus was detected by RT-PCR from organ samples of ducks with clinical signs and histological lesions. With a delay of several days, disease was also observed in intermingled contact control birds. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5 and E gene sequences proved that the isolates are representatives of a new phylogenetic group within the XI (Ntaya virus group) of the Flavivirus genus. This Malaysian Duck Tempus Virus (DTMUV), named Perak virus, has moderate genomic RNA sequence similarity to a related DTMUV identified in China.

810,The high genetic variation of viruses of the Nairovirus genus reflects the diversity of dominant tick hosts.,"The genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae) contains seven serogroups of 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses, including several associated with severe human and livestock diseases [for example, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Nairobi sheep disease (NSD), respectively]. Prior to this report, no comparative genetic studies or molecular detection assays have been developed for this virus genus. To characterize at least one representative from each of the seven serogroups, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers targeting the L polymerase-encoding region of the RNA genome of these viruses were successfully designed based on the conserved amino acid motifs contained within. predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis revealed that nairoviruses are a highly diverse group, exhibiting nucleotide and amino acid identity differences of up to 39.4% and 46.0%, respectively. Virus genetic associations correlated well with serological groupings and tick host associations. The hosts of these viruses include both hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) ticks. Virus phylogenetic analysis reveals two major monophyletic groups: hard tick and soft tick vector viruses. In addition, viruses vectored by ticks of the genus Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas also form three separate monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between tick and nairovirus phylogenies are consistent with the possible co-evolution of viruses and tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data, placing the hard tick-soft tick divergence between 120 and 92 million years ago, point to an ancient origin for viruses of the Nairovirus genus. Â© 2003 Elsevier Inc.

811,"Rapid detection, characterization and enumeration of foodborne pathogens","As food safety management develops further, microbiological testing will continue to play an important role in assessing whether the Food Safety Goals are being met. However, traditional microbiological culture-based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. This review discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, research needs and future trends. The advent of biotechnology introduced new technologies that led to rapid diagnostic methods and changing food testing practices. Rapid methods consist of many different detection technologies, from simple differential coating media to the use of complex instruments, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA. The use of non-invasive sampling techniques for live animals came into focus especially with the 1990s epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy associated with the Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease epidemic in humans. Serology is still an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens from entering human food through meat and milk from animals. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is rapid screening of large numbers of samples, most of which are expected to test negative, resulting in faster product availability. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, where the primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible to both enrich a sample and enumerate with pathogen-specific real-time PCR if the enrichment time is short. This can be particularly useful where food manufacturers are asking about the pathogen level in a contaminated product. Another important issue is automation; key factors here are miniaturization and multiple testing; this means that not only is one device flexible enough to test many pathogens, but many pathogens can be detected with a single test. The review is mainly based on the author's scientific work contributing to the field with the following new developments: (i) serological testing for large-scale screening, surveillance, or eradication programs, (ii) detection of Salmonella otherwise on the same day (iii) pathogen following a short log-phase enrichment counting, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biological monitoring of pathogens based on mathematical modeling even in the absence of isolates. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad global health perspective, in the international food supply, and for improving quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture-independent, metagenomic-based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure was emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid analysis remain formidable hurdles to overcome. Â© 2011 Author. APMIS © 2011 APMIS.",,"Hoorfar, J.",2011.0,,10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02767.x,0
812,Biological and biochemical characterization of sheep scrapies in Japan,"Due to the apparent absence of an agent-specific nucleic acid genome, scrapie strains cannot be classified by the genome characterization commonly used for classification of many viruses. However, scrapie strains can be distinguished to some extent by biological features such as infectivity to experimental animals and distribution of neuropathological lesions, and by biochemical features such as molecular mass and relative protease resistance of the disease-specific prion protein isoform (PrPSc). . To pre-characterize the scrapie strains common in Japan, we analyzed the transmissibility of sheep scrapie isolates to mice and the relative proteinase K (PK) resistance of the corresponding PrPSc. The results show that Japanese scrapie strains can be divided into at least three groups based on biological and biochemical characteristics. The first group includes isolates with PrPSc that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of âˆ¼400 days and have relatively high PK resistance. The isolates of the second group contain PrPSc, which is highly resistant to PK digestion but poorly transmitted to mice. The last group consists of PrPSc-associated isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of less than 300 days and have reduced PK resistance. There have been sporadic cases of sheep stripping in Japan since 1982, with only âˆ¼60 officially reported so far. However, the diversity of scrapi strains in the field suggested by our data raises concern that a scrapi strain similar to the parent agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy may exist or arise in Japan. Therefore, continuous surveillance of the scrapie will be required to prevent further spread of the scrapie not only among the sheep population but to other species and to eliminate any potential sheep scrapie risk to public health.",,"Horiuchi, M.;Nemoto, T.;Ishiguro, N.;Furuoka, H.;Mohri, S.;Shinagawa, M.",2002.0,,10.1128/jcm.40.9.3421-3426.2002,0
813,Rabies in Iraq: Trends in Human Cases 2001-2010 and Characterization of Animal Rabies Strains in Baghdad,"Rabies control requires the consistent supply of reliable sources, constructive cooperation between veterinary and public health authorities, and systematic surveillance. These are challenging in all circumstances, but especially during combat. Here, we describe current human rabies surveillance data in Iraq, the results of renewed sampling for rabies in animals, and the initial genetic characterization of circulating rabies strains from Iraq. Human rabies can be reported, with cases reported since 2003 and a marked increase in Baghdad between 2009 and 2010. These changes coincide with the increasing number of dog bites reported. There is no laboratory confirmation of any disease or virus characterization and no systematic surveillance for rabies in animals. To address these issues, brain samples were collected from pets in the Baghdad area and tested for rabies. Three of the 40 brain samples were positive for fluorescent antibody testing and for rabies virus (RABV) using semi-nested RT-PCR. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using partial nucleoprotein gene sequences derived from the samples showed that the viruses belonged to a single virus variant and shared a common ancestor with viruses from neighboring countries 22 years ago (95% HPD 14-32). These include countries in the west, north and east of Iraq, some with other virus variants circulating simultaneously. These results suggest possible multiple entries of rabies into the Middle East and regular cross-border movement of the disease. 4000 years after the original description of the disease consistent with rabies, animals and humans still die from this preventable and neglected zoonosis.

The capsid can be bent into an open torus, giving the virion a biconcave disc or kidney-shaped morphology (largest diameter 120-140 nm), or the capsid can be flat, resulting in a rod-shaped particle (35 x 170 nm). Morphogenesis occurs by budding of preformed nucleocapsids, mainly from the membranes of the Golgi system and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The proposed Berne virus as the family prototype contains a single polyadenylated helix of infectious positive sense RNA, M(r) approximately 6.5 x 10 6 .

The individual animal status in the two herds was further investigated by collecting blood samples, with a positive rate of 49.74% and 24.64%, and the mean positive rate of calves, heifers and lactating cows was 15.94%, 40.16% and 41.7%, respectively. In addition, a clinical survey was conducted on 8170 dairy cattle from 36 herds for diarrhea syndrome, respiratory problems and reproductive failure, and the pathogens of all clinical cattle were further investigated. The results showed that BVDV is one of the main pathogens that infects animals by combining them with various other viruses. Nine BVDV strains were subsequently isolated; Phylogenetic analysis showed that the BVDV subtypes currently circulating in eastern China are BVDV 1a and BVDV 1c. In addition, 1.86% of the 377 cows tested tested positive for the BVDV antigen. This study provided the basis for further studies on vaccination and control strategies for BVDV in eastern China.",,"Hou, P.;Zhao, G.;Wang, H.;He, H.",2018.0,2019-11-01 00:00:00,,0
816,Transcriptome Analysis of Rabbit Spleen Infected with Porcine Cholera Lapinizing Virus Based on High-throughput Sequencing Technology,"In the current study, rabbit spleen was analyzed 12 hours, 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours and 48 hours after infection with porcine cholera lapinized virus (strain C) using high-throughput sequencing. The rabbit genome was used as a reference to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points post-infection. The top 10 DEGs were filtered by importance and we searched for their biological functions through the Uniprot and NCBI databases. At the first three time points, there are 10 co-expressing genes, many of which are associated with immunity and inflammation. The last two time points for the first 10° are the same and B2 M, RLA-DR-ALPHA, CD74 and IGJ are involved in the antiviral immune response. The GO functional annotation revealed that in biological processes, at all time points except 24 hours after infection, the immune response had the most terms, followed by metabolism and regulation. According to the KEGG database, DEGs for 24 hpost infection were enriched for the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, and DEGs for 30 hpost infection were found to have a focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Moreover, DEGs for 36 el 48hpost infection have seven identical pathways that are directly or indirectly related to the antiviral response. These pathways include the proteasome, lysosome, ribosome, chemokine signaling pathways, B cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation pathway, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis pathway. These results provide new insights into gene expression in rabbit spleens. - Provides a theoretical basis for further understanding of infection with strain C and the molecular mechanisms by which rabbits adapt to infection with strain C.",,"Hou, Y.;Zhao, D.;Liu, G.;He, F.;Liu, B.;Fu, S.;Hao, Y.;Zhang, W.",2016.0,,,0
817,Molecular and phylogenetic analyzes of a novel Amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV-1313),"Background: Amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV-As) are naturally occurring, exogenously acquired gammaretroviruses endemic to Southern California wild mice. These viruses replicate in vitro in a wide variety of cell types, including human cells, and can cause both hematological and neurological disorders in both wild animals and inbred laboratory mice. Because MuLV-As also exhibit distinct interference and neutralization properties, the envelope proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and as tools for the transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts, including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the few known MuLV-A has not been established, and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains unclear. Here, we present the complete genetic makeup of a novel amphotropic virus, designated MuLV-1313, and show that this retrovirus, together with other MuLV-As, belongs to a distinct molecular, biological, and phylogenetic class among MuLV strains isolated from numerous laboratory environments. or wild rats. Results: The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to previously isolated MuLV-A, except that this virus replicates efficiently in chicken cells as well as in mammals. Compared with the ENV proteins of other MuLV-As (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 differs in signal peptides and proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein is completely unrelated to what is present in a globally diverse self and a wide variety of murine retroviruses isolated from wild mice. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome with dot plot analyzes comparing each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding nucleotide of the other revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the env gene, was more closely related to the virus. Biologically distinct wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from another area of Southern California was isolated according to any of the 15 MuLV strains whose full-length sequences are available in GenBank. This finding was supported by phylogenetic analyzes and hierarchical clustering of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313; this also placed all MULV-A in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated from a large number of mouse species globally. Similarly, constructing individual dendrograms for each of the Gag, Pol, and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 indicated that amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically specific group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains. Conclusion: The molecular, biological, and phylogenetic features of amphotropic retroviruses, including MuLV-1313, are different from a large family of exogenously or endogenously transmitted ecotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MuLV strains from laboratory and wild mice. Furthermore, both a naturally occurring amphotropic and a biologically distinct ecotropic retrovirus of Southern California hyrax are more closely related to each other in the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus that shows a common origin of these viruses. This is the first report of a complete genomic analysis of a unique phylogenetically distinct group of amphotropic viruses. © 2006 Howard et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Howard, T.

819,Detection of various novel astroviruses from small mammals in China,"Astroviruses infect humans and many animal species, causing gastroenteritis. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and genetic diversity of the astrovirus in small mammals, we tested 968 anal swabs from 39 animal species, most of them bats and rodents. We detected several astroviruses in 10 bat species, including known bat astroviruses and numerous new viruses. Meanwhile, new groups of astroviruses were identified in three wild rodent species, and a remarkably high genetic diversity of astroviruses appeared in Eothenomys cachinus. We detected astroviruses in captive-bred hedgehogs, and an almost full-length genome sequence was determined for one strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire ORF2 sequence suggested that this strain may have a common ancestor with porcine astrovirus type 2. Also, to the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first discovery of astroviruses in shrews and pikas. Our results provide new insights into understanding these small mammals as the natural reservoir of astroviruses.",,"Hu, B.;Chmura, A. A.;Li, J. L.;Zhu, G. J.;Desmond, J. S.;Zhang, Y.

820,Surveillance of Avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and characterization of Class I NDV isolates in commercial breeding farm in China,"To determine the true prevalence of avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in ducks in Shandong province, China, extensive surveillance studies were conducted from July 2007 to September 2008 in breeding ducks of a busy farm. Cloacal and tracheal swabs were obtained from 30 randomly selected birds that appeared healthy each month. While all swabs were negative for recovery of influenza A virus, 87.5% of tracheal swabs and 100% of cloacal swabs collected in September 2007 were positive for Newcastle disease virus isolation. Several NDV isolates were obtained from tracheal and cloacal swabs of apparently healthy ducks. All isolates were apathogenic as determined by MDT and ICPI. The HN gene and the variable region of the F gene (nt 47-420) of four randomly selected isolates were sequenced. A 374 bp region of the F gene and the full length of the HN gene were used for phylogenetic analysis. Four isolates were identified as the same isolate based on their 99.2-100% nucleotide sequence identities, showing a closer phylogenetic relationship to lentogenic Class I viruses. While there was a 1.9-9.9% nucleotide difference between isolates and other Class I viruses in the variable region of the F gene (nt 47-420), there was a 38.5-41.2% nucleotide difference between isolates and Class II viruses. The amino acid sequences of the F protein cleavage sites in these isolates were 112-ERQERL-117. The full length of the HN gene of these isolates was 1851 bp, which encodes 585 amino acids. Homology analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the HN gene showed that there were 2.0-4.2% nucleotide differences between isolates and other Class I viruses, and 29.5-40.9% differences between isolates and Class II viruses. The results show that these isolates are not phylogenetically related to the vaccine strain (LaSota).

821,Genetic diversity and positive selection analysis of the classical swine fever virus envelope protein gene E2 under C-strain vaccination in eastern China.,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes an economically important and highly contagious swine disease worldwide. C-strain vaccination is one of the most effective ways to control this disease. Since 2014, sporadic outbreaks of CSF have occurred in some C-strain vaccinated provinces of China. To decipher the disease etiology, 25 CSFV E2 genes from 169 clinical samples were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that all 25 isolates belonged to subgenotype 2.1. Twenty-three of the 25 isolates clustered in a newly identified subgenotype, 2.1d, and shared some consistent molecular features. To determine whether the entire E2 gene is under positive selection pressure, we used a site-by-site analysis to identify specific codons that underwent evolutionary selection, and seven positively selected codons were found. Three positively selected regions (amino acids 17, 34 and 72) were identified in the antigenicity-related B/C domains of the amino terminal half of the E2 protein. In addition, another positively selected region (amino acid 200) exhibited a polarity change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which may alter the antigenicity and virulence of CSFV. The results show that CSFV strains circulating in Shandong province mostly clustered in subgenotype 2.1d. Furthermore, identification of these positively selected regions may help reveal molecular determinants of virulence or pathogenesis and clarify the driving force of CSFV evolution in eastern China.",,"Hu, D.;Lv, L.;Gu, J.;Chen, T.;Xiao, Y.;Liu, S.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00085,0

823,Deep sequencing of the mouse lung transcriptome reveals prominent expression of long noncoding RNA associated with high virulence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in mice.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play numerous key regulatory roles in a variety of biological processes. However, their functions in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically compared the complete transcriptome response of mouse lung infected with highly pathogenic (A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010, CK10) or non-pathogenic (A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/) using next-generation sequencing. 2010, GS10) H5N1 virus. A total of 126 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) lncRNAs from three copies were determined to be associated with high virulence of CK10, while 94 SDE lncRNAs were determined to be associated with GS10. Functional category analysis suggested that mRNAs co-expressed with CK10-regulated SDE lncRNAs were highly associated with abnormal and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Further canonical pathway analysis also confirmed that these targets are highly rich for inflammatory pathways. Moreover, mRNA co-expressed with 9 lncRNAs and 17 lncRNAs associated with multiple targeted genes was successfully validated by qRT-PCR. A targeted lncRNA (NONMMUT011061) that was markedly activated and correlated with multiple mRNAs was selected for further analysis, including prediction of transcription factors, potential interacting proteins, genomic location, coding ability, and secondary structure construction. More importantly, NONMMUT011061 was markedly induced during highly pathogenic H5N8 virus infection in mice, suggesting a potential universal role of NONMMUT011061 in the pathogenesis of different H5 IAV. Altogether, these results provide a subset of lncRNAs that may play important roles in the pathogenesis of influenza virus and add lncRNAs to the broad repertoire of host factors used by IAV for infection and persistence.",,"Hu, J.;Hu, Z.;Wang, X.;Gu, M.;Gao, Z.;Liang, Y.;Ma, C.;Liu, X.;Hu, S.;Chen, S.;Peng, D.;Jiao, X.;Liu, X.",2018.0,,,0
824,Cloning and sequence analysis of Duck hepatitis B virus genome from Hubei brown ducks,"Seventy serum samples were collected from adult brown ducks in Hubei to elucidate native Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection in DHBV and to characterize the genome structure of DHBV. The complete genome of the DHBV strain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into T vector and sequenced. The results showed that the natural infection rate of DHBV in Hubei was 10%. The PCR isolated DHBV genome (GenBank accession number DQ276978) had 3 024 nucleotides with three overlapping reading frames encoding surface, core and polymerase proteins, respectively. Comparison of the genome sequences of this strain with 17 DHBV strains from GenBank revealed an identity between 89.3% and 93.5% at the nucleotide level. The amino acid sequences of the S protein, the core protein, and the functional domain of the Pol protein were highly segregated among all these DHBV strains. This Hubei strain was found to share more signature amino acids in the polymerase genes with the ""Chinese"" DHBV strains than with those of the ""Western"" country strains. This finding was also supported by a phylogenetic tree analysis. Therefore, this Hubei DHBV strain should be classified as a subtype of Chinese strains.",,"Hu, Q.;Lei, Y. C.;Zhang, Z. Z.;Tian, Y.

825,Computational study of the interdependence between hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the pandemic 2009 H1N1,"Influenza type A viruses are divided into subtypes on the basis of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein facilitates viral attachment and entry into a host cell, and the NA protein aids in the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA require cooperation with important implications for viral replication and fitness. HA protein from early strains of the pig-borne pandemic 2009 H1N1 binds preferentially to human-type receptors, with weak binding to avian-type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in Texas, USA in December 2013, which motivated us to investigate changes in genetic traits that could contribute to the virus's increased virulence. Our time-series analysis on strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA binding preference of this virus in the US, Europe and Asia is characteristic of the porcine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, the trait of seasonal human H1N1 and binding avidity for avian-type receptors were on a steady rise, with a clear increase in 2013 with American strains having the sharpest fluctuation. The first change could improve viral transmission and replication in humans, and the second might increase its ability to cause deep infection in the lungs, which could explain the recent human deaths in Texas. In light of HA and NA co-adaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also investigated the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between HA and NA during virus evolution. Finally, we identified amino acid substitutions critical to the evolution observed in the HA and NA of the virus.",,"Hu, W.",2015.0,,10.1109/tnb.2015.2406992,0

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the causative agent is the key to an adequate response to suspected outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: We present a case highlighting the potential of semiconductor sequencing to rapidly identify novel virus genome sequences. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a method for rapid de novo assembly of novel influenza A H7N9 virus genome directly from a patient's tracheal aspirate using semiconductor sequencer without culture and pre-sequence information. Also, characteristic amino acids were analyzed and phylogenetic analysis was performed for key genes of influenza A virus. RESULTS: Deep sequencing yielded 435,239 reads assigned to H7N9 viruses with an average length of 172 bp, accounting for 18.6% of the total reads (2,339,680). The complete genome of the virus was obtained by de novo splicing within 2 days. The genomic average depth of coverage of Ion Torrent PGM was up to 5679 times. Selected characteristic amino acids were observed, and phylogenetic analyzes showed that the novel H7 virus was genetically close to the 2011 duck H7N3 viruses in Zhejiang. The new N9 sequences were closely related to the gene sequences of N9 derived from H11N9 ducks in Jiangxi in 2011 and H2N9 sequences from Hong Kong in China in 2010 and may therefore have a common ancestry.

828,Different microRNA alterations contribute to various outcomes following EV71 and CA16 infections: Information from high-throughput sequencing in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses show genetic homology, there are some differences between the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16 at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs differed significantly, among which 32 key miRNAs for target prediction presented opposite trends in samples infected with EV71 and CA16. GO and pathway analysis of predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 pathways. Next, regulatory networks of miRNA-transcription factors, miRNA-predicted targets, miRNA-GOs and miRNA-pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analyzed hierarchical GO categories of predicted targets involved in immune system processes, showing that innate and adaptive immunity can be quite different following EV71 and CA16 infections. In conclusion, this report is the first to describe miRNA expression profiles in EV71 and CA16-infected PBMCs using high-throughput sequencing.

However, the factors underlying these differences remain unclear. Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we have performed comprehensive miRNA profiling at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells infected with EV71 and CA16. The results showed that 154 known and 47 novel miRNAs exhibited remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 65 miRNAs, including 58 known and 7 novel miRNAs, showed opposite trends in samples infected with EV71 and CA16. Next, we searched further for target prediction, focusing mainly on 56 known differentially expressed miRNAs. GO and pathway analysis of these targets showed enrichment of 18 biological processes, 7 molecular functions, 1 cellular component and 123 pathways. Among these pathways, Cadherin signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and angiogenesis showed significant changes. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways and transcription factors were identified, suggesting that miRNAs exhibit complex regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. In conclusion, we specifically analyzed hierarchical GO categories of adhesion-related predicted targets. The results showed that the differential changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partially related to airway epithelial barrier function. Taken together, our data provide useful information that helps elucidate different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and may offer new therapeutic targets for these infections.",,"Hu, Y.;Song, J.;Liu, L.;Li, J.;Tang, B.;Zhang, Y.;Wang, J.;Wang, L.;Fan, S.;Feng, M.;Li, Q.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.024,0

We then obtained the miRNAs using solexa sequencing technology and analyzed these differentially expressed miRNAs. Heatmap cluster analysis and GO (ontology, GO) (Gene function, MF, Molecular) analysis were performed on key differences in miRNA expression, and 10 key differences in miRNA expression were selected by RT-qPCR. The result showed that the expression level of 214 kinds of microRNAs (miRNAs) was significantly different in PEDV-infected cells compared with normal PK-15 cells. Among them, 175 kinds of miRNAs were significantly up-regulated, while 39 kinds of miRNAs were significantly down-regulated.

The results showed that PPV4 was found in 2.09% (12/573) among clinical samples studied in Chinese pig herds and 0.76% (1/132) among samples from healthy animals. We also note that PPV4 was not detected in samples taken before 2009.

Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes a variety of clinical manifestations, sometimes with serious neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 develops in the human body is unclear. Using deep sequencing and haplotype analyzes of viruses from various tissues of an autopsy patient, we sought to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 evolved its suitability to invade the central nervous system in humans. A broad spectrum of mutants with different mutations was observed at the initial sites of infection in the respiratory and digestive systems. After viral invasion, we identified a haplotype switch and dominant haplotype, with glycine at VP1 residue 31 (VP1-31G) in viral particles spread to the integumentary and central nervous systems. In vitro viral growth and fitness assays showed that VP1-31G confers growth and fitness advantage in human neuron cells, whereas VP1-31D confers enhanced replication in human colorectal cells. A higher rate of VP1-31G was also found among fatal cases, suggesting that it may facilitate central nervous system infection in humans. Our data provide a first look at EV-A71-like species from oral tissues to the central nervous system in humans, with broad implications for the surveillance and pathogenesis of this reemerging viral pathogen.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> EV-A71 remains. a worldwide burden for public health. Although EV-A71 is the main etiologic agent of hand, foot and mouth disease, it can cause neurological pulmonary edema, encephalitis and even death, especially in children. Understanding the selection processes that drive dispersal and accurately predicting EV-A71 diversity during invasion in humans is critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine research. Here we describe a bottleneck of choice that arises in respiratory and digestive tissues. The glycine substitution at VP1 residue 31 helps viruses overcome the bottleneck and invade the central nervous system. This substitution is also advantageous for replication in neuronal cells in vitro. Considering that fatal cases involve increased glycine substitution in VP1-31, we propose that increased prevalence of VP1-31G may alter viral tropism and aid central nervous system invasion. Our findings provide new insights into a dynamic mutant spectral switch that is active during acute viral infection with emerging viral pathogens.",,"Huang, S. W.;Huang, Y. H.;Tsai, H. P.;Kuo, P.

836,Double ATPase and GTPase activity of replication-associated protein (Rep) of beak and feather disease virus,"Background: Psittacine beak and feather disease affects parrots and causes an immunosuppressive disease that is usually characterized by an abnormal shape and growth of the animal's beak, feathers, and paws. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a single-stranded circular DNA virus and is classified as a member of the Circoviridae family. Two main open reading frames (ORFs) are known to encode a replication-associated (Rep) protein and a capsid-associated (Cap) protein. Methods: The Rep and Cap genes of BFDV were fused with tags and subsequently expressed and purified, respectively. Both ATPase and GTPase activities of the recombinant Rep protein are measured. Substrate and ion preference, optimal conditions, the effects of ATPase and GTPase inhibitors, and the presence of Cap protein on Rep protein's ATPase and GTPase activity are examined. Finally, the effects of the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif and a new GYDG motif of the Rep protein on the ATPase and GTPase activities were investigated by various mutants. Results: Recombinant Rep protein may show ATPase activity and GTPase activity. The rep protein was able to hydrolyze both deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The order of substrate preference between nucleoside triphosphates and deoxynucleoside triphosphates was found to be ATP > GTP > CTP >= UTP and dATP > dGTP > dTTP > dCTP, respectively. Both ATPase and GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein required magnesium ions, and the presence of calcium ions significantly inhibited the ATPase and GTPase activity of the Rep protein. The optimal temperatures for ATPase activity and GTPase activity were both 56 degrees C, while the optimal pH values were both pH 7.5. Both the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein were significantly downregulated by the polynucleotides and 36 bp (located at the origin of replication) dsDNA of the BFDV genome. ATPase activity of BFDV Rep protein was found to be more sensitive to sodium azide than sodium orthovanadate and N-ethylmaleimide. Linoleic acid inhibited GTPase activity of Rep protein more potently than dynasore. This suggested that the Rep protein of BFDV should be classified as an F-type ATPase and a polyunsaturated fatty acid sensitive GTPase. In the presence of 10 ng of Cap protein, the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein were significantly increased. In addition, the BFDV Rep protein contains the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif, and a new GYDG motif. Various deletion and site-directed mutants of the Rep protein affecting these motifs had both ATPase activity and GTPase activity significantly reduced, suggesting that all three motifs contribute to ATPase and GTPase activities; especially. In addition, the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of the deletion mutants of the Rep protein were reversed in the presence of the Cap protein. This is the first example of dual ATPase and GTPase activity reported in the Rep protein of BFDV. (C) 2015 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Huang, S. W.;Liu, H. P.;Chen, J. K.;Shien, Y.

837,Co-infection with multiple strains of bovine papular stomatitis virus,"Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) infects cattle and occupationally humans. Common subclinical infections, frequent recurrent infections, and persistence of the virus in healthy animals constitute a poorly understood, but possibly complex, scenario of maintenance and transmission of BPSV in nature. Here we report the isolation of multiple BPSV strains co-infecting a single animal. Whole-genome analysis of isolated BPSV strains revealed genomic variability that likely influences virus virulence and infectivity. Also, incompatible phylogenetic relationships between viruses suggested genomic recombination.

838,Maintenance and reclassification of gull influenza A viruses in Atlantic North America.,"Gulls are important hosts of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs), and gull AIVs often contain gene segments of mixed geographic and host lineage origins. In this study, the prevalence of AIV in Canada, Newfoundland gulls between 2008 and 2011 was analyzed. The overall prevalence was low (30/1645, 1.8%), but there was a significant peak of infection in the fall. Newfoundland gulls had a high seroprevalence of AIV, and 50% of the gulls sampled showed evidence of previous infection. To shed light on the transmission, reclassification and persistence dynamics of gull AIVs in Atlantic North America, the sequences of 16 gull AIVs were identified and analyzed. Reclassification of transcontinental and waterfowl lineages was common. One wholly Eurasian origin AIV and another with transcontinental reassortant waterfowl lineage virus were particularly noteworthy. These geographic and inter-host group transmission patterns highlight the importance of characterization of gull AIVs as part of attempts to understand global AIV dynamics.",,"Huang, Y.;Wille, M.;Benkaroun, J.;Munro, H.;Bond, A.

839,"A 4-year study of avian influenza virus prevalence and subtype diversity in Newfoundland ducks, Canada.","The Canadian island of Newfoundland is at the eastern tip of North America and has migratory bird links across the North Atlantic Ocean as well as the continental mainland. Here, Newfoundland's St. We report a 4-year epidemiological study of avian influenza virus (AIV) in ducks from the St. The overall prevalence of AIV detection in ducks during this study was 7.2%, with American Black Ducks contributing to the vast majority of samples collected and AIV positives. Baby ducks showed a significantly higher detection rate of AIV (10.6%) compared to adults (3.4%). Seasonally, AIV prevalence rates were higher in the fall (8.4%), but positives were still detected in the winter (4.6%). Preliminary serology tests showed a high incidence of prior AIV infection (20/38, 52.6%). A total of 43 viruses were characterized for HA-NA or HA subtypes; this revealed a wide variety of AIV subtypes and very few subtype recurrences from year to year. Investigation of the movement patterns of ducks in this region showed that this is a largely non-migratory duck population, and this may contribute to the observed pattern of high AIV subtype turnover. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 H1N1 and one H5N4 AIVs showed that these viruses were highly similar to other low pathogenic AIV sequences from North American waterfowl and assigned all gene segments to the American-avian lineage. Notably, H1N1 viruses identified in successive years had homologous genomes. Detection of such homologous AIV genomes over the years has been rare, but demonstrates the role of the environmental reservoir in viral perpetuation.",,"Huang, Y.;Wille, M.;Dobbin, A.;Robertson, G.

Phylogenetic analysis classified the viruses into a single genotype under Class I and four genotypes under Class II. Nineteen viruses classified in genotype VII of Class II were velogenic, while other viruses were either mesogenic or lentogenic for chickens. Some NDV isolates (17/23) did not show neutralizing reactivity with a monoclonal antibody raised against the HN protein of the LaSota strain, reflecting the mutation in the relevant antigenic epitope. When challenged with two genotype VII NDV isolates, disease development of LaSota-vaccinated SPF chickens was prevented, but virus transmission was detected for at least 5 days after challenge. Circulation of the same NDV isolate for up to 13 years revealed the role of an environmental reservoir in maintaining NDV, reinforcing the importance of strict biosecurity measures in addition to vaccination for disease control.",,"Huang, Y.;Yang, S.;Hu, B.;Xu, C.;Gao, D.;Zhu, M.;Huang, Q.;Zhang, L.;Wu, J.;Zhang, X.;Khan, M.

841,"Molecular characterization of a highly pathogenic pig: reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus variant in Hubei, China.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized worldwide as one of the most important pathogens of pigs. In 2006, more than 10 provinces of China experienced an epidemic of epizootic swine disease characterized by high fever, flushed skin, and high morbidity and mortality. From June 2006 to April 2007, we searched some clinical samples in Hubei province by RT-PCR and cloned several major genes shown in this study, the N, GP5 and NSP2 genes. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes revealed that the highly pathogenic PRRSV variant ZB was responsible for the 2006 outbreak of swine disease in Hubei province, similar to variants isolated from other provinces in China, and belonged to the NA-type PRRSV. . In the PRRSV variants, N and GP5 cut approximately 90% identity (sharing only 65% identity with ATCC VR-2332) with some typical NA-type Chinese isolates except the prototypical ATCC VR-2332 and the 2850bp NSP2 gene. All, however, show greater than 97% identity and 97% identity with other highly pathogenic Chinese PRRSV strains. In addition, there are extensive amino acid (aa) mutations in the GP5 protein and 2 deletions in the Nsp2 protein compared with previous isolates. Most of the variants found in the epizootic epidemic of swine diseases in China in 2006 were variants furthest from the typical NA-type PRRSV in the phylogenetic range, and these variations may be responsible for the differences in pathogenicity observed between these variants and the original Chinese PRRSV strains. .

842,Clinical features and phylogenetic analysis of Coxsackievirus A9 in Northern Taiwan in 2011,"Background: Coxsackievirus A9 (CA9) was one of the most common serotypes of enteroviral infections in Taiwan in 2011. Few studies have focused on the clinical manifestations of CA9 infections, after several patient series were reported in the 1960s and 1970s. Our work explores and deepens current understanding of CA9. Methods: We analyzed clinical presentations of 100 culture-proven CA9-infected patients in 2011 by reviewing their medical records and delineated the CA9 phylogenetic tree. Proven CA9 infections, mean (SD) age 4.6 (3.4) years and male/female ratio 1.9. For clinical manifestations, 96 patients (96%) had fever and the mean (SD) duration of fever was 5.9 (3.4) days. Sixty-one patients (61%) developed a skin rash, and the predominant pattern was a generalized, nonpruritic maculopapular rash without vesicular changes. While most patients showed injected throat, only 19 cases (19%) found oral ulcers, of which 6 were diagnosed with herpangina. Complex cases included: aseptic meningitis (n=8), bronchopneumonia (n=6), acute cerebellitis (n=1), and polio-like syndrome (n=1). Phylogenetic analysis for the current strains of CA9 is closest to the CA9 isolate 27-YN-2008 from the border region of mainland China and Myanmar. Conclusions: During the 2011 outbreak in Taiwan, the most common feature of CA9 was generalized febrile exanthema rather than herpangina or hand. , foot and mouth disease. Considering the possibility of prolonged fever and some complications, caution should be exercised in the evaluation of patients and in estimating the clinical course.

843,Multiple infection of porcine Torque teno virus in a single pig and characterization of full-length genomic sequences of four US prototype PTTV strains: inference for genotyping of PTTV.,"Porcine Torque teno virus (PTTV) has recently been shown to contribute in part to the experimental induction of swine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and post-weaning multisystem wasting syndrome in pigs in the United States. Here we report the identification of four different full-length genomic sequences of PTTV strains from a single swine in Virginia. Detailed analyzes of the genomic organization, degree of variability, and features of conserved nucleotide and amino acid motifs of PTTV were performed. The results showed that these four prototype US PTTV strains identified from the same pig represent different genotypes or subtypes, and a revised classification system was subsequently proposed for PPTV. This is the first study to document multiple PTTV infections with different genotypes or subtypes in a single pig. The identification of new PTTV strains from pigs in the United States also paves the way for future disease characterization and genotyping of PTTV. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

844,Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase Protein of Newcastle Disease Virus Determines Tropism and Virulence,"The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) plays a crucial role in the infection process. However, the precise contribution of the HN gene to the pathogenesis of NDV is unknown. In this study, the role of the HN gene in NDV virulence was investigated. Using reverse genetic procedures, the HN genes of a virulent recombinant NDV strain, rBeaudette C (rBC) and an avirulent recombinant NDV strain, rLaSota, were altered. The hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities of the chimeric viruses differed significantly from the parent strains, but the heterotypic F and HN pairs were equally effective in promoting fusion. The tissue tropism of viruses was shown to depend on the source of the HN protein. The chimeric virus with the HN protein, derived from the virulent virus, exhibited a tissue preference similar to that of the virulent virus and vice versa. Chimeric viruses with reciprocal HN proteins gained or lost virulence as determined by a standard test of the intracerebral pathogenicity index of chickens and the mean time to death in chicken embryos (a measure designed to classify these viruses); this indicates that it is a function of virulence. Amino acid differences in HN protein.

The microbiome of RPM has not yet been studied with high-throughput sequencing. RPM eggs, larvae and occluded adult/nymph samples from four houses in Czechia were used for microbiome analyzes by Illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V4 region. A laboratory RPM population was used as a positive control for transcriptome analysis by pyro-sequencing with identification of sequences originating from bacteria. Samples of occluded adult/nymph stages had 100 times more copies of 16S rRNA gene copies than egg and larval samples. Microbiome composition differed between the four houses and between observed growth stadiums. In the adult microbiome, the 10 OTUs comprised 90 to 99% of all sequences. Bartonella-like bacteria comprised between 30 and 70% of the sequences in the RPM microbiome and 25% of the bacterial sequences in the transcriptome. Phylogenetic analyzes of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed two distinct groups of Bartonella-like bacteria forming sister groups: (i) symbiotes of ants; (ii) Bartonella genus. Cardinium, Wolbachia and Rickettsiella sp. found in the microbiomes of all stadiums tested, while Spiroplasma eriocheiris and Wolbachia were identified in the laboratory RPM transcriptome. Microbiomes from eggs, larvae, and engorged adults/nymphs were different. Bartonella-like symbionts were found in all stadiums and sampling sites. Bartonella-like bacteria were the most diversified group within the RPM microbiome. While the presence of identified putative pathogenic bacteria is relevant to human and animal health issues, identification of symbiotic bacteria could lead to new control methods aimed at destabilizing the arthropod host.",,"Hubert, J.;Erban, T.;Kopecky, J.;Sopko, B.;Nesvorna, M.;Lichovnikova, M.;Schicht, S.;Strube, C.;Sparagano, O.",2017.0,Nov,,0

Phylogenetic comparison of the HA-gene revealed a highly homogeneous cluster with other local isolates in recent years, with the A36R-gene mostly related to strains from elephant origin from Germany. Despite causing human disease, the AT/Carinthia/788/07 isolate surprisingly showed a very low virulence in BALB/c mice compared to vaccinia virus upon intranasal inoculation, even at high titers. This is in contrast to previous reports on other CPXV isolates. Using shotgun DNA sequencing, several insertions and deletions were found in genes likely involved in host range, immune regulation and established virulence factors. These preliminary data may indicate that CPXV strains with proven pathogenicity for humans may have reduced virulence in mice and vice versa. In addition, low virulence strains may have the advantage of persisting in less dense rodent populations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Huemer, H.

849,Oral fluids as a live animal sample source to evaluate cross-reactivity and cross-protection following intranasal influenza a virus vaccine in pigs.,"There are many antigenically distinct H1 influenza A virus (IAV) variants currently circulating in North American pigs, complicating vaccine development due to the inability to formulate a vaccine with broad cross-protection. Experimentally, live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines show increased cross-protection compared to inactivated vaccines. However, there is no standardized assay to predict cross protection following LAIV vaccination. The hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody in serum is the gold standard correlation of protection following IAV vaccine. LAIV vaccine does not induce an intact serum HI antibody titer; however, a local mucosal antibody response occurs. Therefore, there is a need for a source of live animal samples that can be used to evaluate LAIV immunogenicity and cross-protection. Here, we evaluated the use of oral fluids (OF) and nasal wash (NW) collected after IAV vaccination as a live animal sample source in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to predict cross-protection compared to conventional serology. Both live virus exposure and LAIV vaccine provided heterologous protection, but protection was the greatest protection against phylogenetically more closely related viruses. IAV-specific IgA was detected in NWand OF samples and was cross-reactive to representative IAV from each H1 cluster. Endpoint titers of cross-reactive IgA in OF from pigs exposed to live virus were associated with heterologous protection. LAIV vaccination provided significant protection, while LAIV immunogenicity was reduced compared to live virus exposure. These data suggest that OF from pigs inoculated with wild-type IAV with surface genes matching the LAIV seed strain can be used in an ELISA to assess the cross-protection and antigenic association of circulating and emerging IAV in the pig.",,"Hughes, H.

Immunoblot comparisons of blCMV, peanut strip mosaic virus (PStV), bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), and azuki bean mosaic virus (AzMV) revealed equal reactivity of 35K coat proteins. Similar comparisons between CAMV and necrotic BCMV strain (NL3 isolate) showed a serological association between 32K coat proteins, the results providing the first evidence of a possible similarity between CAMV and BCMV NL3. Peptides from trypsin digests of coat proteins of many of these legume-infecting potyviruses were analyzed by HPLC. Comparison of peptide profiles confirmed the serological results in distinguishing the two subgroups. The peptide profiles of the coat protein from BICMV, PStV, AzMV and BCMV were almost identical, suggesting that these could be considered strains of a virus.

853,"Addressing global ruminant agriculture issues by understanding the Romanian microbiome: past, present and future","The rumen is a complex ecosystem of anaerobic bacteria, protozoa, fungi, methanogenic archaea and phages. These microbes interact closely to break down plant material indigestible by humans while providing metabolic energy to the host and producing methane in the case of archaea. As a result, ruminant animals produce meat and milk rich in high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals and therefore contribute to food security. As the world population is estimated to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, an increase in ruminant production is necessary to meet global protein demand despite limited land availability, while minimizing environmental impact. While challenging, these goals are achievable but depend on our understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen microbiome to take advantage of global agricultural challenges have continued for decades with limited success, mostly due to a lack of detailed understanding of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture many of these microbes outside the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and meet global livestock challenges through the introduction of animal husbandry and dietary interventions in early life have recently emerged as promising new technologies. Our inability to phenotype ruminants in a high-throughput manner has also hampered progress, but the recent increase in ""omics"" data may allow further development of mathematical models and rumen microbial gene biomarkers as proxies.

Ten cell cultures with CPE were then screened for herpes viruses using two broad reactive herpes virus PCRs. Amplicons were obtained from 9 out of 10 cell cultures and sequenced. Three new herpes viruses were discovered, and phylogenetic analysis of these viruses showed a 63% posterior probability value supporting these viruses to cluster with the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, and a 100% posterior probability of clustering with a lineage containing Alphaherpesvirinae and other unassigned reptilian herpes viruses. It is suggested that they be named Crocodyline herpesvirus (CrHV) 1, 2 and 3. CrHV1 and 2 were isolated from saltwater crocodiles only, and CrHV3 was isolated from freshwater crocodiles only. A duplex PCR was designed that could detect these herpes viruses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues; this is a sample type in which none of the broadly reactive PCRs can detect these herpes viruses.

These data were analyzed in the context of collected travel history and demographic data. Results. In total, 2713 cases of acute hepatitis E were diagnosed, of which 1376 were domestic infections. Travel-related cases remained stable and were mainly associated with Genotype 1 infections. In contrast, large fluctuations were recorded in domestic litigation, with a dramatic increase from year to year in the period 2010-2012. Molecular characterization has shown that native infections have split into two distinct phylogenetic groups, with the emergence of a new group of Genotype 3 viruses coinciding with the recent increase in cases. Results. HEV infection rates are dynamic in England and Wales and are affected by changing trends in cases of local origin. The recent increase in native cases and the emergence of native viruses that were not widely circulated before 2010 suggest that the risk of acquiring HEV is changing.",,"Ijaz, S.;Said, B.;Boxall, E.;Smit, E.;Morgan, D.;Tedder, R.

858,Identification of bovine enteric Caliciviruses (BEC) from cattle in Baden-Württemberg,"Caliciviruses are known to cause different diseases in many animal species. Bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) are associated with diarrhea in cattle. These viruses are classified in the genus Norovirus and are closely related to human noroviruses, the leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans. This raised questions about zoonotic transmission and an animal reservoir for human viruses. Of the 41 stool samples collected for diagnostic purposes from cattle with diarrhea in Aulendorf, Germany, two samples tested positive for BEC. Samples were amplified with newly degenerate BEC-specific primers that amplify a 263 bp portion of the RNA polymerase domain. Analysis of nucleotide sequences showed that these viruses were most closely related to Norovirus genogroup III/2 (Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK) viruses.",,"Ike, A. C.;Roth, B. N.;BÃ¶hm, R.;Pfitzner, A.

859,Herd immunity and fatal flu cases among the poultry and wild bird exposure population in Russian Asia in 2013-2014,"In October 2013, a total of 1,525 blood serum samples were collected from people living in areas at high risk for the outbreak of pandemic-potential influenza viruses in Russian Asia. The presence of antibodies to influenza viruses in the serum was tested in the hemagglutination inhibition test. None of the samples gave positive results with A/H5 and A/H7 antigens. Twelve strains of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) virus were isolated from people who probably died of influenza during the 2013-2014 epidemic season. All strains were similar to vaccine strain A/California/07/09 in antigenic properties and susceptibility to anti-neuraminidase drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Genetic analysis revealed that all strains belonged to group 6, subgroup 6B of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

ORF5 exhibited nucleotide and amino acid identities of 87%Â·5-100% and 87Â·6-100%, respectively, among isolates. In a phylogenetic tree, all European isolates are grouped in a different genotype from the reference American strains (VR-2332, IAF-Klop). Two different clades were identified among the European isolates. Two Czech isolates (V-501 and V-503) and Italian strain PRRSV 2156 were collected on a single branch. The remaining European lineages constituted the second clan. Surprisingly, two separate clustered strains (V-501 and V-516) were isolated from the same flock. In addition, the possible effect of in vitro cultivation on the nucleotide sequence was analyzed.

862,Bats Are an Unused System for Understanding Microbiome Evolution in Mammals,"Mammals evolved in a microbial world, and as a result, microbial symbionts played a role in their evolution. An exciting new sub-discipline of metagenomics addresses how microbes, particularly those found in the gut, facilitate the ecological and phylogenetic radiation of mammals. However, the vast majority of such studies focus on pets, laboratory models, or charismatic megafauna (for example, pandas and chimpanzees). The result is a large number of studies covering several taxa in the mammalian tree of life, leaving broad patterns of microbiome function and evolution unclear. Wildlife microbiome research urgently needs a model system to test hypotheses about metagenomic involvement in host ecology and evolution. We propose that bats (Order: Chiroptera) represent an ideal model system for comparative microbiome studies and provide opportunities to study host phyla, diet, and other natural history features related to the evolution of the gut microbiome.",,"Ingala, M.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of viral DNA, indirect immunofluorescence experiments using monoclonal antibodies, partial nucleotide sequencing of the envelope gene, phylogenetic analysis and PCR-RFLP were performed. These analyzes revealed that parapoxviruses were divided into four groups, and the region sequenced in this study was highly conserved within each group. Each of the Japanese isolates was classified into one of these groups. These findings also indicated that parapoxvirus infections among wild Japanese serows were caused by at least two different parapoxviruses, bovine papular stomatitis virus and orf virus.

864,Identification and characterization of Highlands J virus from a Mississippi dune crane using unbiased next-generation sequencing.,"Advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms, commonly referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, have greatly reduced the time, labor, and cost associated with DNA sequencing. Thus, NGS has become a routine tool for new viral pathogen discovery and will likely become the standard for routine laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases in the near future. This study demonstrated the application of NGS for rapid identification and characterization of a virus isolated from the brain of an endangered Mississippi dune crane. This bird was part of the population restoration study and was found emaciated in 2012, just days after Hurricane Isaac passed through the Mississippi refuge. Postmortem examination identified trichostrongyliasis as the probable cause of death, but an arboviral etiology was strongly suspected when a togavirus was isolated from the Bird's brain due to a virus with morphology. Because individual molecular analyzes were negative for the few known arboviruses, unbiased NGS of Illumina MiSeq was used to definitively identify and characterize the causative viral agent. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viral isolate was Highlands J virus, a known avian pathogen. This study demonstrates the use of neutral NGS for rapid detection and characterization of an unidentified viral pathogen and the application of this technology to wildlife disease diagnosis and conservation medicine.",,"Ip, H.

865,Virus pathotype and deep sequencing of the HA gene of the low pathogenic H7N1 avian influenza virus causing death in Turkey.,"Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of the H7 subtype usually cause mild illness in poultry. However, the evolution of an LPAI virus into a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus results in the production of a virus that can cause serious illness and death. The classification of these two pathotypes is based, in part, on signs of disease and death in chickens, as assessed in an intravenous pathogenicity test, but the impact of LPAI viruses in turkeys is less well understood. During investigation of LPAI virus infection in turkeys, three week old groups of birds vaccinated with A/chicken/Italy/1279/99 (H7N1) showed signs of severe illness and died or were euthanized within seven days of infection. The virus was detected in many internal tissues and organs from the birds whose medicine was culled. To examine the possible evolution of the infecting virus into a highly pathogenic form in these turkeys, sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene cleavage site was performed by analyzing multiple cDNA amplicons from swabs and tissue sample extracts using Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing. . In addition, an RT-PCR test has been developed to detect the HPAI virus. There was no evidence of the presence of HPAI virus either in the virus used as the vaccine or in swab from infected birds. However, a small proportion (<0.5%) of virus carried in individual tracheal or liver samples contained a HPAI virus-specific molecular signature at the HA cleavage site. All signature sequences were identical and resembled the HPAI viruses collected during the Italian epizootic in 1999/2000. We hypothesize that the detection of HPAI virus in tissue samples following infection with A/chicken/Italy/1279/99 reflects amplification of a virus present at very low levels in the mixed inoculum, but strikingly, we did not observe any new HPAI virus signatures. amplified DNA analyzed by deep sequencing.",,"Iqbal, M.;Reddy, K.

Evaluation of the mean binary homology of nucleotide sequences of PRRSV isolates showed a trend towards increasing heterogeneity over time.

868,Genome segment B of the highly virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein VP1 is phylogenetically distinct from all other IBDV strains.,"full-length cDNA clone of the very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) BD 3/99 strain B segment was constructed and the full-length nucleotide sequence was constructed. The nucleotide sequence encoding VP1, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of BD 3/99, is aligned with 17 other strains of IBDV, including six highly virulent, three classically virulent, five classically attenuated, one antigenic variant and two serotype 2 strains. . The VP1 genes of all highly virulent strains were 97.5% to 99.8% identical. Except for an atypical Australian strain, 002-73, all classical virulent or attenuated and antigenic variant strains were 97.5% to 100% identical. Serotype 2 strains deviated only 4-6% from serotype 1 classically virulent or attenuated strains; however, in contrast, highly virulent strains differed from serotype 2 strains by 10.5% to 12.5%, as well as classical virulent or attenuated strains. Analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence of VP1 revealed 17 commonalities, including 8 unique amino acid substitutions in multi-lethal strains. In the phylogenetic tree, highly virulent strains formed a separate cluster, and all other strains were grouped together, including classical virulent, attenuated, and antigenic variant strains, and even serotype 2 strains. It is suggested that VP1 of the very virulent IBDV is phylogenetically distinct from all other IBDV strains and likely originates from a hitherto unidentified source.",,"Islam, M.

869,Whole genome analysis of porcine astroviruses detected in Japanese pigs reveals genetic diversity and possible intra-genotypic recombination.,"Porcine astroviruses (PoAstVs) are the ubiquitous enteric virus of pigs distributed in various countries around the world. The clinical significance of the infection is unknown, as PoAstVs have been detected in healthy-appearing pigs. However, AstVs have recently been associated with a serious neurological disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of the nearly complete genome of 36 PoAstVs detected by a metagenomic approach in feces of Japanese pigs. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison, 10, 5, 15 and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, PoAstV4 and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was found in individual stool samples from eight pigs. ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 phylogenetic trees of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their topology. PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities within each genotype at all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 strain showed significant sequence variation in ORF2 from other PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains, respectively. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence of multiple possible intra-genotype recombination events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4; this suggested that recombination may have contributed to genetic diversity and played an important role in the evolution of Japanese PoAstVs.",,"Ito, M.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Akagami, M.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Kishimoto, M.;Naoi, Y.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Aoki, H.;Ichimaru, T.;Mukono, I.;Ouchi, Y.;Yamasato, H.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.02.008,1
870,Whole genome analysis of Japanese bovine toroviruses reveals natural recombination between porcine and bovine toroviruses,"Bovine toroviruses (BToVs) belong to the subfamily Toroviridae within the family Coronaviridae and are pathogens that cause enteric disease in cattle. In Japan, BToVs are distributed throughout the country and cause gastrointestinal infection in calves and cows. In this study, complete genome sequences of two Japanese BToVs and partial genome sequences of two Japanese BToVs and one porcine torovirus (PToV) from remote regions of Japan were determined and genetic analyzes were performed. Pairwise nucleotide comparison and phylogenetic analyzes revealed that Japanese BToVs share high identity with each other and show high similarity with strain BToV Breda1 in S, M, and HE coding regions. Japanese BToVs showed high similarities with porcine toroviruses in the ORF1a, ORF1b and N coding regions and in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, suggesting a natural recombination event. Recombination analyzes mapped putative recombinant breakpoints to the 3' ends of the ORF1b and HE regions. These findings demonstrate that the interspecies recombinant nature of Japanese BToVs results in a closer association between BToV Breda1 and PToVs.",,"Ito, M.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Otomaru, K.;Sato, M.;Masuda, T.;Haga, K.;Oka, T.;Yamasato, H.;Omatsu, T.;Sugimura, S.;Aoki, H.;Furuya, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2016.0,Mar,,0

872,New bioinformatics strategies for prediction of directional sequence changes in influenza virus genomes and surveillance of potentially dangerous strains,"Background: With the significant increase in microbial and viral sequence data from high-throughput DNA sequencers, new tools are needed for comprehensive analysis of large sequence data. We have developed a ""Bulk Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM)"" that can characterize large numbers, even millions, of genomic sequences in a single plane. Influenza virus is one of the zoonotic viruses and shows clear host tropism. Important topics for bioinformatics studies of influenza viruses are prediction of genomic sequence changes in the near future and surveillance of potentially dangerous strains. Methods: To characterize sequence changes in influenza virus genomes after invasion from other animal hosts to humans, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide compositions were found in the whole genome sequences of influenza A and B viruses, with a clear host-dependent clustering (self-organization) of sequences. found. Results: Viruses isolated from humans and birds differed from each other in mononucleotide composition. In addition, host-dependent oligonucleotide compositions that could not be explained by the host-bound mononucleotide composition were revealed by oligonucleotide BLSOMs. Retrospective time-dependent direction changes of mono- and oligonucleotide compositions visualized for human strains on BLSOMs can provide predictive information about sequence changes in newly invaded viruses from other animal hosts (for example, pig-derived pandemic H1N1/09). : Based on the host-dependent oligonucleotide composition, we propose a strategy for the prediction of direction changes in virus sequences and for surveillance of potentially dangerous strains when introduced into human populations from non-human sources. Because of their medical and social significance, millions of genomic sequences from infectious microbes and viruses have become available, and BLSOM can characterize big data and support efficient knowledge discovery.

874,Molecular characteristics of infectious bursal disease viruses from asymptomatic broiler flocks in Europe,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) exists in several different antigenic and pathogenic forms. The immunosuppression caused by this virus in young chickens is not always associated with clinical signs of disease. Antigenic variant viruses originally identified in the United States typically do not cause clinical signs of disease, but can cause significant immunosuppression through destruction of B lymphocytes. Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, we conducted a study of asymptomatic broiler chicken flocks for IBDV in Europe. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the viral protein 2 (VP2) gene of four isolates from Spain and four from France indicated that they may differ from the classical and highly virulent (vv) IBDV strains found in Europe. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene showed that all eight viruses were more similar to US variant viruses than to classical viruses. In two viruses, one from France and the other from Spain, threonine was observed at amino acid position 222 and serine at position 254. These two substitution mutations are characteristic of Delaware variant viruses. In addition, all eight viruses had mutated amino acid position 318 from glycine to aspartic acid, another substitution mutation commonly found in US variant viruses. Although import restrictions prevent us from directly testing the antigenicity of these viruses, their nucleotides and predicted amino acid sequences suggest that they may be antigenically distinctive compared to classical and vvIBDV commonly found in Europe. Confirmation of the existence of antigenic variant IBDV strains in Europe requires additional immunological studies to elucidate the exact nature of viral epitopes. Our data support the need for these immunological studies.",,"Jackwood, D. J.;Cookson, K. C.;Sommer-Wagner, S. E.;Le Galludec, H.;De Wit, J. J.",2006.0,,10.1637/7528-032006r1.1,0
875,Diversity of genome segment B from infectious bursal disease viruses in the United States.,"Several phylogenetic lineages of the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) genome segment B have been described. Although this genome segment has been shown to contribute to virulence, little is known about the genetic lineages that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 IBDV strains collected from 2002 to 2011 in the United States were examined. The majority (47) of these viruses were from California, although they were from nine different states. A 722-base pair region near the 5' end of genome segment B, starting at 168 nucleotides and ending at 889, was analyzed and compared to sequences available in GenBank. Nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that mutations were frequently observed and evenly distributed throughout the region. Amino acids at positions 145, 146, and 147 were found to change frequently when the predicted amino acids were aligned. Six different amino acid triads were observed, and the very lethal (vv) IBDV strains (based on the presence of the vvIBDV genome segment A sequence) all had the T145, D146 and N147 triad. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic analysis of the 67 nucleotide sequences revealed four important genome segment B lineages among US viruses. One contained genome segment B sequences typically found in vvIBDV and three contained genome segment B sequences without vvIBDV. When available sequences in GenBank were added to the analysis, two additional strains without US viruses were observed; one contained viruses from China and the other contained viruses from Ivory Coast. Although the samples tested were not representative of all poultry producing regions in the United States, all serotype 1 viruses from states other than California belonged to a genome segment B lineage. Three other strains observed in the United States were populated only with viruses found in California, except for the serotype 2 strain, where the type strain was a serotype 2 virus from Ohio. The data provide further evidence for the importance of genome segment B identification during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV strains.

876,Different evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-controlled and uncontrolled avian infectious bronchitis viruses in commercial poultry.,"To determine the genetic and epidemiological relevance of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates from commercial poultry to attenuated live IBV vaccines, we performed a phylogenetic network analysis on the full-length S1 sequence for Arkansas (Ark), Massachusetts (Mass), and Delmarva/1639. (DMV/1639) type viruses were isolated from clinical cases by 3 different diagnostic laboratories in 2015. Phylogenetic network analysis of archaeal isolates showed two dominant groups associated with 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this type of IBV. In addition, a series of satellite groups were observed for the Ark-type virus surrounding the two dominant populations; this is probably due to the fact that mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine remain in the herd. Phylogenetic network analysis of mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to vaccine sequences from different manufacturers. No satellite groups were observed for Masstype viruses, which is consistent with the persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was used for DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a diffuse network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains thrived under negative selection, while Ark-type viruses thrived under positive selection. These data support the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine use plays a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and that phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine-derived isolates; this is important for us to understand the role of the creature. vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of these viruses.",,"Jackwood, M.

The PB2 gene of A/duck/Vietnam/340/01 (H9N3) virus had lysine at position 627. Based on molecular characterization of specific amino acid residues on the surface and relevant internal protein-coding genes, Vietnamese H5N1 and H9N3 virus isolates showed specificity to the avian cell surface receptor and sensitivity to currently licensed anti-influenza A virus chemotherapeutics. Our findings suggest that the H5N1 and H5N2 viruses circulating among geese and ducks at LBMs in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2001 and 2003 are not close ancestors of clade-1 viruses associated with deadly human infections in Vietnam.

879,Genetic analysis of avian influenza viruses: co-circulation of avian influenza viruses with allele A and B nonstructural gene in Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) ducks wintering in Japan.,"The 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) pandemic influenza virus strains have genes related to avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The nonstructural (NS) gene of AIVs plays an important role in host-viral interaction. However, little is known about the degree of diversity of this gene in Northern pintail (Anas acuta) ducks overwintering in Japan. This study describes the characteristics of pintail-derived H1N1, H1N2, H1N3, H5N2, H5N3, H5N9 and H7N7 viruses. It turned out that most of the viruses are avian strains and are not associated with pandemic and seasonal flu strains. However, NP genes of 62.5% (5/8) viruses were found to be closely associated with an A/swine/Korea/C12/08, indicating genetic material exchange and continued mammalian associated evolution of AIVs. In addition, all viruses except Aomori/422/07 H1N1 contain the PSIQSRGLF motif, which is commonly found in avian, porcine, and human H1 strains. Aomori/422/07 H1N1 has a PSVQSRGLF motif that is identical to a North American strain. These findings are linked to an important transcontinental, Asia-America biogeographic interface.

880,Isolation and characterization of H9N2 influenza virus isolates from avian respiratory disease outbreak,"This study reports the isolation and characterization of the H9N2 virus responsible for the disease characterized by symptoms such as respiratory distress, head swelling, runny nose, decreased feed intake, cyanotic comb, decreased egg production, and death. Virus isolation from allantoic fluid inoculated with tracheal aspirates and whole genome sequencing of the two isolates were performed on an Ion-Torrent sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H9N2 isolates were reasortant viruses showing a G1-like lineage for HA, NA and NP, a Hok/49/98-like lineage for PB1 and PA, and a PK/UDL-01/05-like lineage for PB2. . , an IL/90658/00-like strain for NS and an unknown strain for the M gene. Analyzes of the HA cleavage site showed a series of (333PARSSRGL340) indicating that these isolates have low pathogenicity. Isolate 2 has leucine at amino acid position 226, a substitution associated with mammalian adaptation of avian influenza virus. Isolate 1 has the S31N substitution in the M2 gene associated with drug resistance, as well as the R57Q and C241Y mutations in the NP gene associated with human adaptation. The result reported here provides in-depth information on H9N2 viruses circulating in domestic poultry of India and supports a policy of active effort to control and manage H9N2 infections in Indian poultry.",,"Jakhesara, S.

881,Emergence of a genotype I variant of the avian infectious bronchitis virus in the northern part of India,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the leading causes of a persistent economic burden for poultry industries worldwide. IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. IBV infection causes respiratory and nephrogenic symptoms in broilers. In addition, its infection causes a decrease in fertility and hatchability in laying birds. Using next-generation sequencing, we have identified the first complete genome sequence of a variant IBV from an outbreak in the northern Indian state of Haryana. In the phylogenetic analysis of the IBV isolate, genotype I clustered with strain 1 (GI-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the S gene of the IBV isolates showed a high level of identity with the strains isolated from Tamil Nadu and the reference vaccine strains. Our result suggests that the IBV virus isolated from unvaccinated chicken flocks in northern India may be a returning strain originally evolved from the live attenuated vaccine strains used in the region. Full genome sequencing of additional IBV isolates from India is essential to understanding the epidemiology of IBV in India.",,"Jakhesara, S. J.;Nath, B.;Pal, J. K.;Joshi, C.

882,"Pathotypical and Sequence Characterization of Newcastle Disease Viruses from Vaccinated Chickens Showing Genotypes II, IV and XIII and Circulation in India","Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a highly contagious disease that continually plagues the global poultry industry. The nature and molecular epidemiology of NDVs prevalent in recent outbreaks in India are poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize NDVs prevalent in vaccinated herds in India using whole genome sequencing and biological pathotyping. Twelve site isolates were collected from outbreaks occurring in different regions of India and characterized as velogenic according to the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and amino acid sequence in the F protein cleavage region. Twelve of the field isolates and five commonly used vaccine strains were selected for whole genome sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM technology, providing complete genome sequences for ten field isolates and all vaccine types. The genome of all isolates was found to be 15×192 nt in length and there was a high level of conservation between APMV-I viruses and multiple genomic features. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary distance calculations placed the isolates into genotypes II, IV, and XIII. A review of other recently reported strains provided preliminary evidence of VI, VII and XVIII genotypes circulating in India. Comparison between field and vaccine virus sequences revealed unique genomic and amino acid differences in key antigenic regions of the F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes, and these substitutions can be targeted for site-directed mutagenesis to assess the impact on virus pathogenicity.

884,Sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene of infectious bronchitis viruses: identification of a new phylogenetic group in Korea.,"Twelve Korean infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) were isolated in the field from chickens suspected of being carriers of infectious bronchitis between 2001 and 2003. The S1 glycoprotein genes of these IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were divided into three groups according to the RFLP patterns obtained using the HaeIII restriction enzyme. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP model, a common model in Korea. Three more isolates were associated with the Arkansas strain pattern, but there were some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variable RFLP patterns. For a comparison with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. The isolates that received Korean IBV had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology among themselves and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. Regarding the deduced amino acid sequence, Korean IBV isolates had 71.5%-99.3% similarity to each other and 44.9%-80.3% similarity to non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some IBV isolates appeared to belong to a new group, distinct from non-Korean IBV strains or previously isolated Korean IBV strains. Specifically, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 represented a distinct group. These findings suggest that Korean IBVs are constantly evolving.",,"Jang, J. H.;Sung, H.

885,Antigenic and genetic analyzes of foot and mouth disease virus type A isolates for selection of the candidate vaccine strain reveal the emergence of a variant virus responsible for the most recent outbreaks in India.,"Recent reports have shown the existence of two antigenic and genetic groups (genotypes VI and VII) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A in India, which differ from vaccine strains. To select the appropriate field isolate as the candidate vaccine strain, antisera are tested in a neutralization assay against representative isolates from both the genotypes and the two vaccine strains in use. Two candidate vaccine strains from both genotypes are selected by close antigenic match to field isolates. In conclusion, IND 81/00 (genotype VII) had better antigenic coverage (antigenic association (r)-value > 0.40 with 79% of 2002-2003 isolates) than IND 258/99 (genotype VI). ) is obviously given; r-value > 0.40) with 42% of 2002-2003 isolates.

It hatched later in the same breeding season. This article describes clinical observations, diagnostic procedures, and epidemiological research conducted to elucidate the source of infection. Diagnosis was confirmed by serology, virus isolation, and sequence analysis of a 493-bp long fragment of the VP1 gene. The phylogenetically causative virus was closely related to pathogenic GPV strains isolated from Poland and the United Kingdom in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The Swedish isolate showed less homology with the pathogenic strains and attenuated vaccine strains from Hungary and Asia. Epidemiological research showed that the virus was first introduced to a contract farm (farm A) and then transferred to the farm (index farm) that sent the newly hatched goslings and birds for autopsy. The exact time and source of entry of the virus into farm A could not be determined with certainty. Possible sources of infection include backyard goose eggs subcontracted to farm A for hatching, wild geese infested with pasture-breeding goose on farm A, and a group of Canadian goose eggs (Branta canadensis). hatched in the same machine as eggs produced by wild geese and produced by farm A.",,"Jansson, D.

889,ViQuaS: an enhanced line of reconstruction for viral half-species spectra produced by next-generation sequencing,"MOTIVATION: The combined effect of high replication rate and low fidelity of viral polymerase in most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses results in the formation of a viral half-species. Uncovering information about half-species populations greatly benefits the study of disease progression, antiviral drug design, vaccine design, and viral pathogenesis. We present a new line of analysis called ViQuaS for viral half-species spectrum reconstruction using short next-generation sequencing reads. ViQuaS is based on a new reference-supported de novo assembly algorithm for generating local haplotypes. A significantly extended version of an existing global strain reconstruction algorithm is also used. RESULTS: Benchmark results showed that ViQuaS outperformed the other three previously published methods ShoRAH, QuRe and PredictHaplo with at least 3.1-53.9% improvements in recall, 0-12.1% in precision, and 0-38.2% improvements in F-score. at least 0.006-0.143 improvements in KL-divergence and 0.001-0.035 in root mean square error in terms of strain frequency estimation over the next best algorithm under strain sequence assembly and various simulation settings.

890,Mixed triad: allied viruses in unique final isolates of highly virulent type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus detected by deep sequencing,"UNLABELED: In February 2013, very severe acute clinical symptoms were observed in calves, heifers and dairy cattle on several farms in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, Germany. Deep sequencing revealed the coexistence of three distinct genome variants within the highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2) isolates. While the majority of the population (about 95%) harbored one copy of a 222-nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7-NS2 coding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. In addition, unusual mutations were found in both variants within the highly conserved p7 protein and near the p7-NS2 cleavage site. Using a reverse genetic system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it can be shown that during replication, non-duplication genomes are generated de novo from duplicating genomes. The major variant with duplication is necessarily accompanied by the minor variant without duplication. RNA secondary structure prediction allowed analysis of the unique but stable mix of three BVDV variants and also provided explanation for their production. Finally, our results suggest that the duplicated variant plays a major role in the highly lethal phenotype. IMPORTANCE: This study highlights the importance of whole-genome deep sequencing combined with manual in-depth data analysis for the search for viruses in basic research and diagnosis. Here, we investigated highly virulent isolates of bovine viral diarrheal virus from a series of outbreaks in 2013. We discovered a unique special feature of the viral genome, an unstable duplication of 222 nucleotides that was eventually deleted by viral polymerase activity, resulting in an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all investigated isolates. Our work is of great importance for the field because we show that these insertion/deletion events allow for another genome plasticity of plus-strand RNA viruses, in addition to the well-known polymerase-induced single-nucleotide variations that are generally considered major. basis for viral adaptation and evolution.",,"Jenckel, M.;Hoper, D.;Schirrmeier, H.;Reimann, I.;Goller, K.

891,"Identification of two novel reassortant avian influenza a (H5N6) viruses in songbirds in Korea, 2016","Background: On November 20, 2016, two new strains of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIVs) were isolated from three song swans (Cygnus cygnus) in Gangjin Bay, South Jeolla province, South Korea. Identification of HPAIVs in wild birds is important as there is a potential risk of transmission of these viruses to poultry and humans. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gangjin H5N6 viruses were classified in the Asian H5 line 2.3.4.4 lineage and were distinguishable from H5N8 and H5N1 HPAIVs previously isolated in Korea. Except for the polymerase acidic (PA) gene, viruses were most closely associated with A/duck/Guangdong/01.01SZSGXJK005-Y/2016 (H5N6) (98.90 ~ 99.74%). The PA genes of the two novel Gangjin H5N6 viruses were most closely related to AIV isolates previously characterized from Korea, A/hooded crane/Korea/1176/2016 (H1N1) (99.16%) and A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7). ) (98.65%). The absence of newer viruses for A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) indicates the need for analysis of new wild avian AIVs isolated in Korea as they may provide further clues as to the origin of these new reassortant H5N6 viruses. Conclusions: Although research continues on the origins and epidemiology of these infections, the most likely route of infection for songbirds has been through direct or indirect contact with reassortant viruses spread by migratory wild birds in Korea. Continuous monitoring of AIVs in wild birds will help reduce this risk, as H5N6 HPAIVs can potentially infect poultry and humans.",,"Jeong, J.;Woo, C.;Ip, H. S.;An, I.;Kim, Y.;Lee, K.;Jo, S.

Although many studies have focused on infection and pathogenic mechanisms, the transcriptome profile of the host cell on CVA16 infection is still largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we compared the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of human embryonic kidney 293T cells infected with and not CVA16. We highlight that the transcription of SCARB2, a cellular receptor for both CVA16 and EV71, is upregulated approximately 10-fold in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. Upregulation of SCARB2 transcription induced by CVA16 may increase the likelihood of subsequent CVA16/EV71 infection, resulting in co-infection with two viruses in a single cell. This explanation would partially explain the co-circulation and genetic recombination of multiple EV71 and CVA16 viruses. Based on the correlation analysis of miRNAs and genes, we speculated that the high expression of SCARB2 is modulated by downregulation of the miRNA has-miR-3605-5p. We also found that differentially expressed miRNA target genes are mainly reflected in extracellular membrane (ECM)-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm pathways; these may be associated with clinical symptoms of patients infected with CVA16, such as aphthous ulcers, cough. , myocarditis, somnolence and potentially meningoencephalitis. The miRNAs hsa-miR-149-3p and hsa-miR-5001-5p may result in upregulation of genes in these morbid pathways related to CVA16 and may also cause clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study illuminated the changes in 293T cells upon CVA16 infection at the transcriptome level, including highly upregulated SCARB2 and ECM-receptor interaction and genes in the circadian rhythm pathways and key miRNAs in gene expression regulation.

Here we investigated the possible involvement of viral infection in the disease. Using sequence-independent PCR amplification, astrovirus sequences were generated from a case of gout. Full-length genomic sequencing and sequence analysis of three strains of goose astrovirus (GoAstV) revealed that they belonged to a novel avastrovirus most closely related to viruses classified within the Avastrovirus 3 strain. GoAstV was detected in 16/16 gout cases collected from two provinces, supporting a pathogenic role for the novel avastrovirus.",,"Jin, M.;Wang, X.;Ning, K.;Liu, N.;Zhang, D.",2018.0,,10.1007/s00705-018-3932-5,0
902,Genome sequencing and characterization analysis of a Beiffing isolate of chicken coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) is classified as a member of the coronavirus genus in the family coronaviridae. The enveloped virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kilobases with a 5' cap structure and a 3' polyadenylation pathway. The complete genome sequence of the Beijing isolate, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), was determined by cloning sequencing and primary walking. The entire genome is 27733 nucleotides long and has ten open reading frames: 5'-orf1a-orf1ab-s-3a-3b-em-6a-6b-n-3'. Alignment of the genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate with that of two AIBV strains and one SARS coronavirus, respectively, was performed. The genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate was 91.2% similar to that of the IBV strain LX4 (incomplete, 1940 bp size). However, the full-length genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate was 85.2% identity to IBV Strain Beaudette and only 50.8% homology to that of the SARS coronavirus. The results showed that the IBV genome has a remarkable variation. And the IBV Beijing isolate is not closely related to the SARS coronavirus. Phylogenetic analyzes based on whole genome sequence, S protein, M protein and N protein also showed that AIBV Beijing isolate was the only virus in group III and was free from SARS coronavirus.

903,Detection and molecular characterization of enteric viruses in breeding turkeys,"This study was conducted to detect and characterize enteric viruses (rotavirus, astrovirus, reovirus and coronavirus) in breeding houses. Five turkey brood herds were selected. Fecal samples were collected from all flocks at 1 week and then biweekly until the birds were 9 weeks old. Stool samples were collected in groups of five. Of the 193 pools (""samples"") tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, 47.2%, 30.6%, and 10.4% samples were positive for astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus, respectively. No coronavirus was detected in any of the samples. Overall, 118 (61.1%) samples were positive for one or more enteric viruses. Of the 118 samples, 70 (59.3%) were positive for a single virus and 48 (40.7%) were positive for a combination of viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the polymerase gene showed that astroviruses clustered into two groups with sequence similarity ranging from 85.6 to 100% at the nucleotide level. Based on the NSP4 gene sequences, the rotaviruses clustered in a group and had 96.3% to 99.9% sequence similarity at the nucleotide level. Based on the S4 gene sequences, reoviruses clustered in a single group with sequence similarity of 96.9% to 100%. The different amino acid sequences of all three viruses may affect the antigenicity and/or pathogenicity of these viruses and may merit further study. The presence of two or three different viruses in combination can affect turkey health and disease dynamics. © 2010 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Jindal, N.;Patnayak, D. P.;Chander, Y.;Ziegler, A.

904,Molecular characterization of foot and mouth disease virus in Hong Kong from 2001-2002,"Most molecular epidemiological studies of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) are based on comparisons of the VP1 gene sequence. In this report, the nucleotide sequences of the VP1 coding region of O/HKN/3/01, O/HKN/5/01, O/HKN/12/01, O/HKN/7/02 and O FMDV type O strains were analyzed between 2001 and 2002. /HKN/10/02 isolated from the disease outbreak in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Hong Kong SAR) was detected and compared with the sequences of other FMDVs. The results revealed that the VP1 gene of the five isolates had identical nucleotide (nt) sequences (639 nt) encoding 213 amino acids and no changes were found in critical amino acid regions 144 (Val), 148 (Leu). It is found in the VP1 protein epitope (amino acids 140-160, 200-213) or at amino acids 145-147, which includes the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence), 154 (Lys) and 208 (Pro). It takes part in the adsorption of the virus into the host cell. Analysis of the VP1 gene nucleotide sequence revealed that the five isolates studied were most closely related to FMDVs found in Hong Kong from 1991 to 1999 and Taiwan in 1997. Moreover, critical amino acids on the antigen epitope of common Hong Kong isolates and serotype O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 vaccine strain showed relative conservatism, they were genetically distantly related, suggesting variation between common Hong Kong FMDV strains and vaccine strain.

908,Rat hepatitis E virus: geographic cluster within Germany and serological detection in wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus),"Zoonotic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in industrialized countries is thought to result from transmission from wild boar, domestic pig and deer as reservoir hosts. Detection of HEV-specific antibodies in rats and other rodents suggested that these animals may represent an additional source for human HEV transmission. Recently, a new HEV (ratHEV) was detected in Norwegian rats from Hamburg, Germany, showing the typical genome organization but a high nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation relative to other mammalian and avian HEV strains. Here we describe the multiple detection of ratHEV RNA and HEV-specific antibodies in Norway rats from additional cities in northeastern and southwestern Germany. Whole genome analysis of two new strains from Berlin and Stuttgart confirmed the association of ratHEV with Norwegian rats. Available data showed continued presence of this virus in rat populations in Berlin and Hamburg. Phylogenetic analysis of a short segment of the open reading frame 1 confirmed a geographic clustering of corresponding sequences. Serological studies using recombinant ratHEV and genotype 3 capsid protein derivatives showed antigenic differences that could be due to high amino acid sequence variation in the immunodominant region. The high number of animals showing only ratHEV RNA or anti-ratHEV antibodies suggested a non-persistent infection in the Norway rat. Future studies must prove the transmission routes and zoonotic potential of the virus in rat populations. The recombinant ratHEV antigen produced here will allow future seroepidemiological studies to differentiate between ratHEV and genotype 3 infections in humans and animals. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Johne, R.;Dremsek, P.;Kindler, E.;Schielke, A.;Plenge-BÃ¶nig, A.;Gregersen, H.;Wessels, U.;Schmidt, K.;Rietschel, W.;Groschup, M.

HEV genotypes 1-4 were subsequently identified in human hepatitis E cases with different geographical distribution and different modes of transmission. In pigs, wild boars and other animal species, genotypes 3 and 4 were identified in parallel and their zoonotic potential was confirmed. Until 2010, these genotypes were the only known representatives of the Hepeviridae family, along with avian HEV strains that infect chickens. Subsequently, additional HEV-related viruses were detected in wild boars, different HEV-like viruses were identified in rats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, fox, bats and deer, and a distantly related agent was identified from closely related salmon. This review summarizes the characteristics, phylogenetic relationships, host association, and proposed involvement in diseases of HEV-like viruses known so far.

911,Rabies epidemiology in southeastern Europe,"Rabies is endemic in a number of countries in Southeast Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. With the possible eastward enlargement of the European Union, rabies elimination programs are likely to be increased in new member states to reduce the disease burden. A clear understanding of the epidemiology of the virus in this part of Europe is vital before such programs are implemented. With the exception of Turkey, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the major disease reservoir in Southeast Europe. However, cases of rabies in the dog (Canis familyis) are regularly reported. Unlike northern Europe, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) does not appear to be a vector in the south. This study summarizes the current rabies situation in Southeast Europe and demonstrates phylogenetic relationships between viruses in many countries in the region. Rabies virus RNA was extracted from the original samples and a fragment of the nucleoprotein gene amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR. Automated sequencing was used to derive nucleoprotein gene sequences and these were used to prepare a molecular phylogeny of rabies viruses in southeastern Europe. In Bulgaria, the dog is the main vector for rabies in contact with humans and livestock. However, other species may also act as reservoirs for the disease, complicating the development of elimination strategies. The fox is the main reservoir species for rabies in Romania, although cases are regularly reported in dogs. Despite a gradual decline in canine rabies, urban pockets of the disease persist in many regions of Turkey. There is also some evidence that the fox is an important vector for rabies and may be responsible for increases in cattle rabies in the Aegean region of the country. Throughout the region, there is evidence of cross-border movement of rabies by both wildlife and dog vectors.",,"Johnson, N.;Freuling, C.;Vos, A.;Un, H.;Valtchovski, R.;Turcitu, M.;Dumistrescu, F.;Vuta, V.;Velic, R.;Sandrac, V.;Aylan, O.;MÃ¼ller, T.;Fooks, A.

912,The fed antibiotic carbadox induces phage gene transcription in the pig gut microbiome.,"Carbadox is a quinoxaline-di-N-oxide antibiotic fed to more than 40% of young pigs in the United States and shown to induce phage DNA transduction in vitro; however, the effects of carbadox on porcine microbiome functions are poorly understood. We investigated the longitudinal effects of Carbadox on porcine gut microbial gene expression (fecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (fecal dsDNA viromes) in vivo. Microbial metagenome, transcriptome and virome sequences have been annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function using the FIGfam (isofunctional homologous sequences) and SEED subsystems databases. When beta diversity of microbial FIGfam annotations were compared, control and carbadox communities were different 2 days after carbadox introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-related low expression of FIGfams (n = 66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization and RNA metabolism (q < 0.1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects in certain populations. Interestingly, carbadox treatment resulted in increased expression of FIGfams related to all stages of the phage lytic cycle 2 days after the addition of carbadox (q â‰¤0.07), suggesting carbadox-mediated induction of prophages and phage DNA recombination. These effects were reduced with 7 days of continuous carbadox in the bait, suggesting an acute effect. In addition, viromes contained several genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics, but these did not change in frequency with time or treatment. The results show reduced bacterial growth and metabolism, prophage induction, and potential transduction of bacterial fitness genes in porcine gut bacterial communities as a result of carbadox administration. SIGNIFICANCE FDA regulations for agricultural antibiotic use have focused on antibiotics important to human medicine. Carbadox is an antibiotic that is not used in humans but is frequently used in US pig farms. It is important to examine the possible side effects of Carbadox use because it has been shown to promote bacterial evolution, which may indirectly affect antibiotic resistance in bacteria of clinical importance. Interestingly, this study shows greater prophage gene expression in the faeces of carbadox-fed animals 2 days after initiation of in-feed carbadox treatment compared to the faeces of unmedicated animals. Importantly, the phage genetic material isolated in this study contained genes that could confer resistance to antibiotics important in human medicine; this suggests that human antibiotic resistance genes are mobile between bacteria via phages. This study underlines the side effects of antibiotics and shows that the effects of various antibiotics should be considered when antibiotics are used or new regulations are considered.",,"Johnson, T.

913,Illumina MiSeq 16S amplicon array analysis of bovine respiratory disease-associated bacteria in lung and mediastinal lymph node tissue,"Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is caused by the growth of single or multiple pathogenic bacterial species in lung tissue following stress and/or viral infection. Next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method recently used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However, it has not yet been used to study the microbiome of the bovine lower respiratory tract. The aim of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in postmortem lung and lymph node tissue samples collected from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and associated mediastinal lymph node postmortem tissue samples were collected from calves diagnosed with BRD and clinically healthy calves by veterinary laboratory pathologists. NGS 16S amplicon libraries targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) were used to identify operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results: Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were the OTUs most detected in the lungs and lymph nodes of calves that died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella, and Bacteroides had greater relative abundance in postmortem lung samples from fatal BRD cases in dairy calves compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundance in postmortem lymph node samples collected from fatal BRD cases in dairy calves compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two contigs of the Leptotrichiaceae sequence were then joined from the shotgun sequences enriched with bacterial DNA. Results: Microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node from calves deceased from BRD and clinically healthy HF calves were characterized. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genera. This suggests that we have identified a new strain of bacteria associated with BRD.",,"Johnston, D.;Earley, B.;Cormican, P.;Murray, G.;Kenny, D. A.;Waters, S. M.;McGee, M.;Kelly, A. K.;McCabe, M.

914,Identification of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 in poultry farms in Indonesia.,"Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (AIV-H9N2) has been established in domestic poultry in Asia and Africa. AIV-H9N2 has not been previously reported in Indonesia. Here we describe the presence of AIV-H9N2 in poultry farms in Indonesia. Ninety-nine cases have been observed in various provinces of Indonesia. Clinical signs, pathological lesions and egg production were recorded. Validation was performed using virus isolation, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and sequencing. Secondary data of Eurasian lineages were downloaded from GenBank to establish the hemagglutinin (HA) phylogeny. For neuraminidase, the five sequences with the highest similarity to each sequence found in this study were downloaded. The phylogeny was extracted using the Neighbor-Joining method in the MEGA6 package. Forty-nine AIV-H9N2-positive cases were observed, of which 35 tested positive for AIV-H9N2 only. The age of the infected chickens was 43.17 Â± 16.56 weeks and their egg production was 35.85% Â± 17.80% lower than before the epidemic. The BLAST search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the HA-encoding gene identified in this study shares 98% sequence identity with A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM719/2014(H9N2), while the neuraminidase-encoding gene sequences share 94%. 98% and 100% identity with three different influenza viruses. The phylogeny indicates that the HA of AIV-H9N2 found in this study forms a distinct cluster with sequence data from some Vietnam and China. NA sequence data form three separate clusters. We conclude that AIV-H9N2 is prevalent in many provinces in Indonesia. Herd biosecurity and vaccination against this virus subtype must be implemented rapidly to reduce economic losses in the poultry industry. Comprehensive and strict AIV surveillance is essential to prevent the veterinary and public health consequences of the circulation of this virus in Indonesia.",,"Jonas, M.;Sahesti, A.;Murwijati, T.;Lestariningsih, C.

Here are the results of a coronavirus screening using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR for the avian greylag goose (Anser anser), wild pigeon (Columbia livia), and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Coronaviruses were found in cloaca swab samples from all three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40 out of 163 birds sampled were positive for the coronavirus, while two out of 100 pigeons sampled and one in five mallards sampled tested positive. Infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared to virus negative birds, demonstrating the clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyzes of the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences showed that all of the novel coronaviruses described in this study diverged from group III coronaviruses. All novel avian coronaviruses harbored the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3â€² untranslated regions, such as the other previously described group III coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus.

Sequence data placed in front of the 5' untranslated genomic region were analyzed with maximum stinginess, bootstrapping and stinginess. We tested the proposed classifications of the group and analyzed the development of symptoms associated with Pestivirus infections in cattle.

Our phylogenetic analyzes showed that the previously identified genotypes were monophyletic. except genotype 1a. Based on our cladograms, we suggest the presence of more than 12 monophyletic groups within the BVDV 1 strain. Mapping of clinical symptoms suggests that the emergence of some genotypes may have resulted from a change in the pathogenic process.

917,Homologous recombination in bovine pestiviruses - Phylogenetic and statistical evidence,"Bovine pestiviruses (Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1 (BVDV 1) and Bovine Viral Diaarrea Virus 2 (BVDV 2)) belong to the Pestivirus (Flaviviridae) genus, which consists of positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant economic losses worldwide. To further investigate the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in the virus, we used phylogenetic and bootstrap analyzes to systematically screen for alignments of previously sequenced genomes. Previously published data suggested that homologous crossover may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the genomic rearrangements observed in cytopathic (cp) strains of bovine pestiviruses. However, homologous recombination involves not only homologous crossovers but also the replacement of a homologous region of the acceptor RNA. Furthermore, cytopathic strains represent evolutionary dead paths as they are only isolated from fatal cases of mucosal disease. Here we report evidence of homologous inter-genotype recombination in the genome of a non-cytopathic (ncp) strain of Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1, type strains of the Pestivirus genus. We also show that intra-genotype homologous recombination can be a common phenomenon in both Pestivirus strains. This evidence indicates that homologous recombination contributes to the diversification of bovine pestiviruses in nature. Implications for virus evolution, taxonomy and phylogenetics are discussed.

In particular, sequences of the avian retrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) are frequently found integrated into the FWPV genome. Some FWPV strains carry remnants of REV long terminal repeats (LTRs), while other strains have been shown to contain inserts of nearly full-length REV provirus in their genomes. In this study, we detected heterogeneous FWPV populations carrying the REV LTR or full-length REV provirus genome in a Merriam's wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami). The bird presented papules scattered on the hairless areas of the head. Avipoxvirus-like virions were observed in lesions by transmission electron microscopy and the presence of FWPV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing performed on nucleic acid extracted from skin lesions revealed two populations of FWPV genomes carrying a 197-nt residue of the REV LTR or a 7939-nt-long fragment corresponding to the full-length REV provirus. Specifically, PCR amplification using primers targeting FWPV sequences flanking the REV insertion site confirmed the natural occurrence of heterogeneous FWPV genome populations in an additional clinical sample from another fowl disease-affected turkey. In addition, sequencing of a historical FWPV isolate from chickens in the USA in 2000 also revealed the existence of two FWPV-REV genome populations. The results here show distinct FWPV populations containing variable segments of the REV genome integrated into their genomes. These different genome populations are likely the result of homologous recombination events that occur during FWPV replication.",,"Joshi, L. R.;Bauermann, F. V.;Hain, K. S.;Kutish, G. F.;ArmiÃ©n, A.

922,Production of henipavirus nucleocapsid proteins in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Hendra and Nipah viruses are newly emerged, zoonotic viruses and their genomes have nucleotide and predicted amino acid homologies that place them in the Paramyxoviridae family. Currently, these viruses are classified in the new genus Henipavirus within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. The genes encoding the HeV and NiV nucleocapsid proteins were cloned into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector pFGG3 under the control of the GAL7 promoter. High expression of these proteins (18-20 mg l-1 yeast culture) was obtained. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the primary structure of both proteins with 92% sequence coverage obtained using MS/MS analysis. Electron microscopy showed the association of typical herringbone structures of purified recombinant nucleocapsid proteins characteristic of other paramyxoviruses. The nucleocapsid proteins showed stability in yeast and can be easily purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation. HeV nucleocapsid protein was detected with sera from fruit bats, humans, HeV-infected horses, and NiV nucleocapsid protein was immunodetected with sera from fruit bats, humans, and pigs. The development of an efficient and cost-effective system for the production of henipavirus nucleocapsid proteins could aid in the development of reagents for the diagnosis of viruses.

Here, we characterize ALV-J strain PDRC-59831, a newly studied US isolate of ALV-J. Five-day-old chicken embryos were infected with this virus, and chickens developed myeloid leukosis and hemangioma within 2 months of hatching. To investigate the pathogenesis mechanism, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations in the MET gene in two of the five hemangiomas studied. This integration locus was not seen in the previous study characterizing ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis. MET is a known proto-oncogene that acts through various signaling pathways and is implicated in many neoplasms.

924,Common sites of viral integration identified in B-cell lymphomas caused by avian leukosis virus,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces B-cell lymphoma and other neoplasms in chickens by integrating in or near cancer genes and disrupting their expression. Four genes (MYC, MYB, Mir-155, and TERT) were previously identified as co-integration sites in these virus-induced lymphomas and are thought to play a causal role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing to identify additional genes that trigger tumorigenesis in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. In addition to the four previously included genes, we identify other genes as co-integration sites, including TNFRSF1A, MEF2C, CTDSPL, TAB2, RUNX1, MLL5, CXorf57 and BACH2. We also analyze the genome-wide ALV integration environment in vivo and find increased frequency of ALV integration near transcriptional start sites and within transcripts. Previous work has shown that ALV prefers a weak consensus sequence for integration in cultured human cells. We validate this consensus sequence for in vivo ALV integration in the chicken genome. IMPORTANT Avian leukosis virus induces B-cell lymphomas in chickens. Previous studies have shown that ALV can induce tumors through insertional mutagenesis and that several genes are involved in the development of these tumors. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing to reveal the genome-wide landscape of ALV integration in ALV-derived B-cell lymphomas. We find high levels of ALV integration near transcription start sites and use co-integration site analysis to greatly increase the number of genes involved in the development of these tumors.

926,Genetic heterogeneity of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolates from Turkey: identification of a new subgroup in BVDV-1.,"The genetic heterogeneity of Turkish ruminant pestiviruses was investigated by phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences encoding complete Npro. A total of 30 virus isolates obtained from 15 provinces across the country between 1997-2005 were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Virus isolates mostly originate from cattle, and one isolate from sheep. All bovine isolates belonged to BVDV-1, sheep isolates belonged to BVDV-2. Fifteen isolates formed a new subgroup within BVDV-1, provisionally termed BVDV-1l. The remaining bovine isolates were typed as BVDV-1a (n = 4), BVDV-1b (n = 4), BVDV-1d (n = 3), BVDV-1f (n = 2) and BVDV-1h (n = 1). ). The isolates assigned to BVDV-1l originated from various geographic regions in different years. There was no correlation between genetic grouping and the locations where the isolates were obtained. In most cases viruses originating from a farm belonged to the same subgroup (n = 5). This study shows that the newly detected BVDV-1l subgroup is dominant and widespread in Turkey. In addition, an ovine virus isolate was identified as the first BVDV-2 member reported in Turkey. A serological study using samples from western Turkey showed that BVDV-2 was also found in cattle.

927,Virus shedding in a porcine monocyte cell line,"The spread of seventeen virus strains classified into five virus families in a porcine monocyte cell line (SW/K99) was studied at the point of infective progeny production. The viruses studied were adapted for growth in a porcine epithelial cell line (KSEK6) and were previously proven to show clear CPE. These viruses were repeatedly passaged in monocyte cultures independent of CPE formation. Passage level 3 cultures were titrated for infectivity using KSEK6 cells. Of the viruses studied, only Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) was able to replicate in monocytes. Four ADV strains, two virulent and two attenuated strains were compared for their growth in the two cell lines. The final amount of infective progeny measured at 72 hours of incubation at 36.5 degrees C was in almost similar order between the 2 cell lines. However, the amount of infective progeny produced at 24 h incubation was higher in SW/K99 cells than in KSEK6 cells. CPE formation was also more pronounced in SW/K99 cells at an early incubation. The data show that the viral susceptibility of monocytes to ADV is higher than that of epithelium. Other viruses were abortive in monocytes.",,"Kadoi, K.",2002.0,,,0

The full-length CAV DNA of this strain was cloned into the bacterial plasmid pTZ57R/T to generate the pTZ-CAV molecular clone. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of viral proteins of IR CAV were compared with those of representative CAV sequences, including reference and commercial vaccine strains. IR CAV was not associated with vaccine strains and was also found to contain glutamine at positions 139 and 144, confirming previous studies that such mutations are associated with slow virus propagation rate in cell culture. pTZ-CAV was digested with PstI to release IR CAV DNA and then transfected into MSB1 cell by electroporation. Transfected cells showed cytopathic effect similar to virion-initiated infection. One-day-old specific pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated with regenerated virus from transfected MSB1 cells and compared to chicks vaccinated with IR CAV.

929,Partial sequence of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of avian adenoviruses: a reference panel for general diagnostic PCR in poultry.,"Adenoviruses are common infectious agents in different poultry species. The traditional, serological typing of new isolates with virus neutralization tests is now in transition to be replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first proposed PCRs for the detection of adenoviruses were designed to target the hexon gene, the main capsid protein. In birds, members of three different genera of the family Adenoviridae can be found. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs had to be prepared for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene has recently been described. This method has proven to be an effective alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses regardless of their genus affiliation. Poultry adenoviruses (FAdVs) isolated from chicken to date contain twelve serotypes classified into five virus types (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has yet to be determined from only three FAdV species, which represent three species. In the current study, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was complemented by those of the remaining FAdVs. The newly identified sequences will facilitate the identification of new FAdV isolates as an existing species or as a putative new FAdV. Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for amplification of hexon and other genes can be designed and performed based on preliminary species classification.",,"KajÃ¡n, G.;Sameti, S.;Benko, M.",2011.0,,10.1556/AVet.2011.006,0

JEV can cause febrile illness and encephalitis mainly in humans and horses and occasionally cattle. In late September 2010, a 114-month-old cow showed neurological symptoms similar to those observed in previous cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in cattle; therefore, we performed virological and pathological tests on cows. As a result, JEV was isolated from the brain of the affected cow. We determined the complete genome sequence of the JEV isolate, which we named JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, including the envelope (E) gene region and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Our phylogenetic analyzes of the E region and the whole genome indicated that the isolate belongs to JEV genotype 1 (G1). The isolate, JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, was most closely related to several JEV G1 isolates from Toyama Prefecture, Japan in 2007-2009 by phylogenetic analysis of the E region. In addition, nucleotide alignment revealed that the deletion in the 3'UTR was identical between JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010 and several other JEV G1 isolates identified in Toyama Prefecture in 2008-2009. A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed for the detection of anti-JEV antibodies in the affected cow, and the test detected 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)-sensitive HI antibodies against JEV in the serum of the affected cow. Histopathological examination revealed non-suppurative encephalomyelitis in the affected cow, and immunohistochemical assay detected JEV antigen in the brain. Based on the findings of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis observed in the central nervous system, JEV antigen detected in the brain, JEV isolated from the brain and HI antibodies sensitive to 2-ME against JEV detected in the serum, we diagnosed the case with cow JE. .

932,Flu Vaccine Review,"Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae RNA virus family and are classified into three different types based on their major antigenic differences; Influenza A, Influenza B, and Influenza C. Influenza viruses cause annual human epidemics, both seasonal and pandemic. Seasonal flu epidemics caused by influenza A and B viruses result in 3-5 million serious cases and thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Influenza pandemics caused by the influenza A virus occur at unpredictable intervals. Influenza A virus will cause epidemics and pandemics as it spreads from migratory birds, pigs, horses and humans. Fomites can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing. Pandemics are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality compared to seasonal influenza. In the last century, four such pandemics have occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009. Influenza B causes only human-to-human spread, with particular emphasis on the fact that no other hosts are involved, thus not included in pandemics. Influenza C is a mild illness.[1] It causes seasonal flu attacks, such as Northern infections from September to March, while Southern infections occur from May to September. Due to the diversity in viruses responsible for infections in these two seasons; He needs two different sets of vaccines.

934,Avian influenza as a zoonotic agent (highly pathogenic),"The zoonotic agents that challenge the world every year are influenza A viruses. In the past, human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses occurred periodically. Wild waterfowl are carriers of all variants of influenza virus A subtypes and therefore most likely form the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. While avian influenza viruses in natural avian reservoirs generally have low pathogenicity (LPAIV), some have gained virulence by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible biliary poultry. So-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) cause mass mortality in susceptible birds and cause enormous economic losses when poultry is affected. Besides a number of avian influenza virus subtypes with sporadically infected mammals, HPAIV H5N1 Asia shows strong zoonotic features and has been transmitted from birds to different mammalian species, including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses may originate directly from avian influenza viruses or may arise after genetic reclassification between avian and mammalian viruses. So far, HPAIV H5N1 already meets two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype it has never been seen in the human population and has infected at least 438 people and caused serious illness and high lethality in 262 people to date (August). 2009). Achieving effective human-to-human transmission would complete the emergence of a new pandemic virus. Therefore, fighting H5N1 at its source is a prerequisite for reducing the pandemic risks posed by this virus. Other influenza viruses considered pandemic candidates are descended from the H2, H7, and H9 subtypes, all of which have infected humans in the past.

Î”gag is a partial retroviral core protein gene, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. Here we present the 3.5 kb nucleotide sequence from the 3' end of Î´gag to the 3' end of proviral MH2 DNA molecularly cloned to elucidate the genetic makeup of the virus and other mht- and myc-containing oncogenic virus as well as with the chicken proto-myc gene. The following results were obtained: (i) Î´gag-mht generates a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides ending with a stop codon near the 3' end of mht. The 3' 969 nucleotides of mht up to the stop codon are 80% sequenced with the onc-specific raf sequence (94% homologous at the amino acid level removed) of murine sarcoma virus 3611. (ii) The myc sequence is preceded by an RNA splice acceptor region shared with the cellular proto-myc gene, beyond which it is in line with the avian retrovirus MC29 and chicken myc sequences to the 3'-termination codon and 40 noncoding nucleotides. proto-myc. Thus myc forms a second MH2-specific gene together with a 5' retroviral exon. (iii) myc is followed by the 3'-terminal c region of about 400 nucleotides, which is in line with that of Rous sarcoma virus except for a displacement near the 5' end of the long terminal repeat. It was concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the Î”gag-mht gene, which is closely related to the Î”gag-raf transforming gene of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is closely related to the transforming gene of MSV 3611.

The H3N2 virus, A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013, consisted of genes from two sources: (i) hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes derived from human and human-like H3N2 porcine viruses, and (ii) pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that each reassortant may have arisen independently in Japanese pigs. A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 has strong antigenic reactivity with antisera produced for some seasonal human strain viruses isolated during or before 2003, whereas A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 has antisera reactivity against viruses isolated after 2004. found. was clearly weaker. In addition, antisera against some strains of seasonal human lineage H1 viruses did not react with A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 or A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013. These findings suggest that the emergence and spread of these reassortant SIVs is a potential public health risk.

942,Genetic analyzes of avian influenza viruses in Mongolia between 2007 and 2009 and their association with Korean isolates from domestic poultry and wild birds.,"This study was conducted to monitor wild birds based on concern that they could spread the avian influenza virus (AIV) between Mongolia and Korea, which share the same migration route. From the 1,528 stool samples analyzed, 21 low-pathogenic AIVs were isolated from 2007 to 2009. Nineteen AIV positive stool samples were identified as Anseriformes by DNA barcode. The most commonly isolated subtype was H3 (61.9%) and the most common hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination was H3N8 (52.4%). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to assess their genetic relationship to domestic poultry and wild birds in Korea. The H3 and H7 surface genes belonged to the Eurasian ancestry and were grouped together with Korean wild birds and poultry. While most N8 genes phylogenetically clustered with viruses isolated in Eurasia, 1 of the Mongolian viruses and some Korean viruses belonged to the North American ancestry. The polymerase acidic protein of the internal gene was indistinguishable from the highly pathogenic AIV of the goose/guangdong/1/1996 (gs/ gd)-like virus H5N1. Our study shows that Mongolian AIV isolates genetically evolve with multiple genotypes and are closely related to AIV in poultry and Korean wild birds.

943,Isolation of reassortant H13N2 virus from a mallard stool sample in South Korea,"Background: Virus subtype H13N2, A/mallhead/Kr/SH38-45/2010 (H13N2), was first isolated from a mallard fecal sample in South Korea. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes revealed that this virus arose through genetic mixing between the Eurasian and North American gene pools, and possibly between wild ducks and gulls. The H13 and N2 surface genes clustered in a group with Eurasian isolates from gulls and wild birds, respectively. The PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS segments belong to the Eurasian lineage, while the PB1 gene is clustered in the North American lineage. They also showed an avian-related pattern in the phylogenetic analysis: the M gene was similar to subtype H13 viruses in gulls, while other segments were similar to avian influenza viruses of other subtypes from wild ducks. Conclusions: The data suggest that the novel reassortant H13N2 virus isolated in South Korea may have arisen by genetic reclassification between intercontinental and interspecies transmission in wild birds.

An outbreak of AIV infection has occurred on an emu farm housing 40 four-month-old birds. Various degrees of hemorrhages were discovered in the affected emus tissues. Microscopically, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed. Electron microscopy revealed round or oval virions with a diameter of 80 nm to 120 nm surrounded by a pointed envelope. The virus was classified as low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) according to OIE standards. It was named A/Emu/HeNen/14/2004(H9N2)(Emu/HN/2004). The HA gene (168315p) was amplified by RT-PCR and compared to other animal H9N2 AIV sequences in the US National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database GenBank.

945,Phylogenetic relationships and pathogenicity variation of two Newcastle disease viruses isolated from domestic ducks in southern China.,"Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is an OIE listed disease caused by virulent avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) strains, which are enzootic and cause great economic losses in the poultry industry. Genotype VII and genotype IX NDV viruses were the dominant genotype circulating in China and may possibly be responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken flocks in recent years. While ducks and geese often exhibit invisible infections. Methods In this study, we investigate the whole genome sequencing, clinicopathological characterization and transmission of two virulent Newcastle disease viruses, SS-10 and NH-10, isolated from domestic ducks in Southern China in 2010. Results: Sequences based on F and whole gene phylogenetic analysis showed that SS-10 (genotype VII) and NH-10 (genotype IX) belong to class II. The deduced amino acid sequence was <sup>(112)</sup>RRQK/RRF<sup>(117)</sup> at the fusion protein cleavage site. Animal experiment results showed that SS-10 virus isolated from ducks was highly pathogenic for chickens and geese, but low pathogenic for ducks. It can be detected from spleen, lung, kidney, trachea, small intestine, bursa fabric, thymus, pancreas and cecal tonsils, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and can be transmitted to naive contact birds. It can also infect chickens, ducks and geese by pure contact. However, the NH-10 virus isolated from ducks can infect some chickens, ducks and geese, but only cause the chickens to die. In addition, it can infect pure contact chickens, ducks and geese. Conclusion: Two NDV isolates showed different biological properties in terms of pathogenicity and transmission in chickens, ducks and geese. Therefore, there is no species preference for chicken, duck or goose viruses, and more attention should be paid to the interspecies transmission of VII NDVs between ducks, geese and chickens for the control and eradication of ND.",,"Kang, Y.;Li, Y.;Yuan, R.;Li, X.;Sun, M.;Wang, Z.;Feng, M.;Jiao, P.;Ren, T.",2014.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-11-147,0
946,Phylogenetic and pathotypical characterization of Newcastle disease viruses circulating in southern China and transmission in different birds.,"Although the highly pathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been frequently isolated from poultry in China since 1948, the mode of transmission among avian species is largely unknown. Given that various wild bird species play a role as sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks and pigeons at live bird markets (LBMs) in Southern China as part of an H7N9 surveillance program. To simulate the natural transmission of different animal species in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVs (GM, YF18 and GZ289) isolated from different birds to assess the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses. chickens, ducks and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated chickens, ducks and pigeons with an EID50 of 106 of each virus by intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hours after infection, naive contact groups were housed with those vaccinated with each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results showed that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in Guangdong Province, South China, and that NDV from different birds has different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. Therefore, we recommend continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, particularly chickens, and highlight the need for studies of virus-host association.",,"Kang, Y.;Xiang, B.;Yuan, R.;Zhao, X.;Feng, M.;Gao, P.;Li, Y.;Li, Y.;Ning, Z.;Ren, T.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00119,0

Histological examination, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopic observation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. The lesions were characterized by epithelial hyperplasia, acanthosis, ballooning degeneration of the spinous layer, and stratum granulosum. A parapoxvirus was isolated from the skin lesions of affected sheep and characterized genetically and antigenically. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the PCR product showed a pattern specific to orf virus (ORFV) and the isolate reacted with monoclonal antibodies against ORFV. The partially deduced amino acid sequence of the viral envelope gene was principally the same as that of Japanese ORFVs. These results showed that the epidemic was caused by parapoxvirus infection. The isolated virus could be classified as ORFV and was closely related mainly to Japanese ORFVs but not foreign ORFVs or other parapoxviruses.",,"Kanou, Y.;Inoshima, Y.;Shibahara, T.;Ishikawa, Y.;Kadota, K.;Ohashi, S.;Morioka, K.;Yoshida, K.;Yamada, S.",2005.0,Jul,,0
948,Classification of Dutch and German avian reoviruses by sequencing the ÏƒC protein,"We amplified, cloned and sequenced (part of) the open reading frame of the S1 segment encoding the ÏƒC protein of avian reoviruses isolated from chickens with different disease conditions in Germany and the Netherlands from 1980 to 2000. These avian reoviruses were analyzed. phylogenetically and compared with sequences of avian reoviruses in the Genbank database. Avian reoviruses can be grouped into 5 different genotyping clusters, and this classification was the same when the sequences were compared to the 5â€² end, 3â€² end of protein C or the entire open reading frame. Therefore, sequencing of any part of the gene encoding the ÏƒC protein appears reliable for classification. We could not detect a correlation between the ÏƒC sequences of avian reoviruses and the disease state from which they were isolated. The sequences found in the Netherlands and Germany, such as those in Taiwan, are more diffuse than the known avian reovirus ÏƒC sequences in the USA and Australia. We did not establish temporal or geographic differences in the avian reoviruses studied.",,"Kant, A.;Balk, F.;Born, L.;Van Roozelaar, D.;Heijmans, J.;Gielkens, A.;Ter Huurne, A.",2003.0,,,0
949,Characterization of isolated partial genomic sequences of Hepatitis E virus and genotype 3 HEV in young pigs from Finland.,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections occur in pigs worldwide. Swine infection is usually subclinical, but HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic agents that cause sporadic, native cases of human hepatitis E. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and dynamics of total HEV infections in young pigs. 273 faecal samples collected from six farms to genetically characterize the resulting HEV isolates and to examine the phylogenetic relationships of HEV isolates occurring in different pig farms in Finland. Fecal shedding of HEV of individual piglets was monitored in two farms selected from five farms identified as HEV RNA positive. HEV excretion was detected in 87.5% of piglets during the study. Piglets contracted primary HEV infection 3-8 weeks after weaning and when transferred to breeding farms, nearly all (96.6%) of pigs with an available sample on this occasion were still shedding the virus. According to the phylogenetic analysis, all HEV isolates obtained belonged to HEV genotype 3, subtype e, and the separate, farm-specific isolate originating from 10 out of 11 farms studied. The results of our study show that HEV infections in young pigs are quite common and HEV RNA-positive pigs pose a possible risk of infection for pig breeders by enabling HEV transmission from farms to fattening farms, and there are genetic variations in HEVs from different origins. farms are formed.",,"Kantala, T.;Heinonen, M.;Oristo, S.;Von Bonsdorff, C.

950,Supersize me: How whole genome sequencing and big data are transforming epidemiology,"In epidemiology, identifying 'who infects whom' allows us to measure key features such as incubation times, heterogeneity in transmission rates, duration of contagiousness, and presence of high-risk groups. Although invaluable, the existence of many plausible routes of infection complicates this and makes epidemiological contact tracing uncertain, logistically prohibitive, or both. The recent emergence of next-generation sequencing technology is transforming our ability to understand high-resolution disease transmission, sometimes even from host to host scale, by allowing the identification of traceable differences in the pathogen genome. We review recent examples of the use of pathogen whole genome sequencing for forensic monitoring of transmission routes and focus on specific issues that evolutionary dynamics need to be supported by epidemiological information about the most likely timing of events and possible transmission routes. . We also discuss the potential pitfalls in over-interpreting these data and highlight that combining this technology with complex mathematical and statistical approaches has the potential to produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of infectious disease transmission and control. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Kao, R.

951,Next-generation sequencing technologies: tool to study avian virus diversity,"Increasing globalization, climate changes and the wildlife-livestock interface have resulted in the emergence of new viral pathogens or zoonoses that have become a serious concern for bird, animal and human health. High biodiversity and bird migration facilitate the spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods, which aim to be limited to the group of virus-specific or viral agents, preclude the identification of new viruses or viral variants. Recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches provide better diagnosis and disease control by providing culture-independent methods useful for understanding viral diversity and discovery of novel virus. This review discusses the different possible steps of an NGS study using sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify novel avian viruses and their diversity. NGS leads to the identification of a wide variety of novel viruses, such as picobirnavirus, picornavirus, orthoreovirus, and avian gamma coronavirus associated with guinea fowl, and is also used to characterize viral diversity among avian species. The review also briefly discusses the areas of viral-host interaction and disease-associated causation with newly identified avian viruses.",,"Kapgate, S. S.;Barbuddhe, S.

Unlike other parvoviruses, the VP1-specific region does not contain the phospholipase A2 sequence motif. Recent experimental studies have suggested that parvoviruses are candidate pathogens in cases of enteric disease syndrome. Current diagnostic methods for detection of avian parvovirus include PCR, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent testing using recombinant VP2 or VP1 capsid proteins. Moreover, sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms have allowed rapid and simultaneous detection of parvovirus from affected and healthy birds.

Astroviruses are a recently identified cause of animal gastroenteritis, which includes two species currently suspected to cause human diarrhea. Using pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, we analyzed human fecal samples from different continents for astrovirus-related RNA sequences. Based on variants of the two known human astrovirus species and genetic distance criteria, we identified three new astrovirus species, all distantly related to mink and ovine astroviruses, and tentatively named them HMOAstV strain AC. The complete genome of strain A displayed all the conserved features of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the three groups of astroviruses (HAstV, AstV-MLB, and HMOAstV) currently found in human feces were more closely related to animal astroviruses, suggesting that human astroviruses can emerge periodically from zoonotic transmissions. Based on the pathogenicity of its closest phylogenetic relatives in animals, further investigation into the role of HMOAstV in human gastroenteritis, which has been detected so far in Nigeria, Nepal and Pakistan, is warranted. © 2009 SGM.",,"Kapoor, A.;Li, L.;Victoria, J.;Oderinde, B.;Mason, C.;Pandey, P.;Zaidi, S.

957,A novel method for multiplexed target enrichment of MinION next-generation sequencing libraries using PCR-generated baits.,"Enrichment of targeted regions within complex next-generation sequencing libraries commonly uses biotinylated baits to capture desired sequences. This method provides high read coverage over targets and their flanking regions. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently released the Minion, a sequencer with a USB3.0 interface. To date, no particular method for enriching Minion libraries has been standardized. Here, we describe a simple and efficient way for multifold enrichment of MinION libraries, using biotinylated PCR-generated baits in a novel approach, overcoming technical limitations regarding the chemistry of sequencing-adapters and the length of DNA fragments. Using Phage Lambda and Escherichia coli as models, we selectively enrich for specific targets, significantly increasing the corresponding read coverage, eliminating unwanted regions. We show that by capturing genomic fragments containing target sequences, we recover reads that expand targeted regions so that they can be used to identify potentially unknown flanking sequences. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method in multiplexed form by pooling enriched libraries derived from two different E. coli strains and analyzing them in parallel. We evaluated the optimal bait size for large fragment libraries and for the first time defined a standardized method for target enrichment on the Minion platform.",,"Karamitros, T.;Magiorkinis, G.",2015.0,2015-12-01 00:00:00,,0

The aim of this study was to use viral metagenomics to examine possible viral involvement in this diarrheal and to identify the intestinal virome with a focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrheal and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected flocks were analyzed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and the nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence-independent amplification. Samples from diarrheal piglets from the same herds were pooled, while samples from healthy piglets were analyzed separately. A total of 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and a positive control of mock metagenome, were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The obtained sequence data were subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. Eight different mammalian virus families (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) were detected in healthy samples, while four were detected in pooled diarrheal samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the diarrhea investigated. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the diarrhea under investigation is caused by known mammalian viruses. The results, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses are present in the gut as early as 24-48 hours after birth, suggesting immediate postnatal infection or possibly transplacental infection.",,"Karlsson, O.

962,Understanding the evolutionary relationship of hemagglutinin protein from influenza viruses using phylogenetic and molecular modeling studies.,"The current H1N1 (2009) swine flu is epidemic in nature and is responsible for global economic losses and deaths. Among the eight gene segments of H1N1, hemagglutinin (HA) plays an important role in the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface, and entry of viral RNA into the host cell leads to infection. In this study, the 1952 sequences of H1N1 (2009) HA from Mexico City and the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of different subtypes of the pandemic influenza A virus were studied, and the results showed the closest association with the H1N1 (2009) Mexico strain. H1N1 (2007) Norwegian Mallard strain. Analysis of the predicted secondary structures from the protein sequence revealed that reduction of alpha helices was observed in many areas of the sequences between 2005 and 2010. Conversely, structural level analysis is required to critically assess functional significance. Therefore, a structural level search was performed for the above mentioned proteins by establishing the 3D structure of these proteins through homology modeling. Models were validated and structural-level similarities were evaluated by overlapping. Next, docking studies were performed to find the mode of binding of sialic acid (SA) with influenza HA.

963,Possible risks posed by single-stranded DNA viruses of pigs associated with xenotransplantation,"Routine large-scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is approaching clinical reality thanks to several cutting-edge technologies, particularly the ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, the use of pig organs in humans carries risks, such as the undesired interspecies transfer of viruses and the adaptation of these porcine viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent advances in virology have led to the identification of large numbers of viruses in many niches, including the emergence of metagenomic techniques to characterize whole viromes. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group common in mammalian virome studies. Specifically, ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a tendency to adapt to new hosts and interspecies barriers. Pig-associated ssDNA viruses include torque tenosus viruses (TTSuV) in the family Anelloviridae, porcine parvoviruses (PPV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV), both in the family Parvoviridae, and porcine circoviruses (PCV) in the family Circoviridae. confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses to the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant information available on the prevalence, preference and pathogenicity of porcine-associated ssDNA viruses, careful screening and monitoring is required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed.",,"Karuppannan, A.

964,"Phylogenetic relationships of the G gene sequence of bovine transient fever virus isolated in Japan, Taiwan and Australia.","The G gene encoding the neutralization antigen of bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) was characterized to describe the molecular epidemiology of the virus in Japan and genetic relationships among Japanese, Taiwanese and Australian isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the gene are highly conserved among Japanese strains regardless of the year of isolation and are closely related to Taiwanese strains. By phylogenetic analysis, Japanese and Taiwanese strains were clearly classified into three chronological clusters: 1966, 1984-1989, and 1996-2004, indicating that outbreaks of cattle transient fever can occur almost simultaneously by the same genotype in both countries. On the other hand, the Australian strains were distantly related to these East Asian strains and were placed in the independent fourth cluster of the phylogenetic tree. Three amino acid substitutions at residues 224, 271 and 499 in the neutralizing epitopes are suggested to be responsible for the antigenic variations of bovine ephemeral fever virus, two of which form novel glycosylation sequences. The cross-neutralization test using bovine transient fever virus isolated in Japan showed that the vaccine developed based on the oldest Japanese strain, YHL, is still effective in controlling bovine transient fever in Japan.

966,Analysis of codon usage pattern evolution in avian rotaviruses and their preferred host.,"Rotavirus infection is a worldwide problem with the emergence of quite different viruses classified into 8 species (AH). Here we report the evolutionary evaluation of codon usage patterns in the virus-host system in avian rotavirus (AvRV) of the RVA, RVD, RVF and RVG strains (preferably affecting birds). Nucleotide contents, codon usage bias (CUB), relative synonym codon usage (RSCU), and effective codon number (ENCs) values were investigated by targeting the major inner capsid viral protein (VP6) of these AvRV strains to overexpress. The results confirm that evolutionary traits influence rotavirus (RV) genetic diversity and the effect of host natural selection on AvRV codons. Synonym codon usage patterns were evaluated by following multivariate statistical procedures on all available AvRV encoding gene sequences. RSCU trees housed all AvRV species and preferred host sequences in a single topology, confirming greater affinity of AvRVs with host chicken cell genes. Similarly, codon adaptation index (CAI) results also showed higher adaptation of AvRVs to the chicken host. Codon preference analysis of RVs revealed that the VP6 gene is more proficiently expressed in the yeast system, whereas codon optimization may be required for efficient expression in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. The findings provide fundamental evidence of the dynamics of AvRV evolution and host adaptation that can be used for additional research on avian species in the future.",,"Kattoor, J. J.;Malik, Y.

967,CRISPRs of Enterococcus faecalis and E. hirae isolates from pig feces have species-specific repeats but share some common discriminant sequences.,"Clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are currently a topic of interest in microbiology due to their role as a prokaryotic immune system. While research of CRISPR distribution and characterization to date has focused on pathogenic bacteria, less is known about CRISPR in commensal bacteria, where it may have an important role in the ecology of the microbiota of humans and other animals and act as a recorder of interactions. between bacteria and viruses. A combination of PCR and sequencing was used to determine the prevalence and distribution of CRISPR sequences in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus hirae isolates from faeces of healthy pigs. Both type II CRISPR-Cas and Orphan CRISPR (without Cas genes) were detected in 195 isolates examined. CRISPR-Cas was detected in 52 (46/88) and 42% (45/107) isolates of E. faecalis and E. hirae, respectively. The prevalence of Orphan CRISPR sequences was higher in E. faecalis isolates (95%, 84/88) compared to E. hirae isolates (49, 53/107). Species-specific repeat sequences were identified in Orphan CRISPR sequences, and 42 unique spacer sequences were identified. Only two spacers matched previously characterized porcine virome sequences, and many were apparently derived from chromosomal sequences of enterococci. Surprisingly, 17 (40%) of the spacers were detected in both species. Shared spacer sequences are evidence of a lack of species specificity in the agents and mechanisms responsible for the integration of spacers, and the abundance of spacer sequences corresponding to bacterial chromosomal sequences reflects specific interspecific interactions in the gut microbiota.",,"Katyal, I.;Chaban, B.;Ng, B.;Hill, J.

968,Insights on bovine rumen plasmidoma,"Plasmids are self-replicating genetic elements that can mobilize between different hosts. Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process that has been recognized as a powerful and shaping evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the overall plasmid population in bovine rumen environment, which harbors a complex and dense microbiota of paramount importance to humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total rumen plasmid DNA, termed rumen plasmid, and subjected it to deep sequencing by analyzing it using the Illumina paired-end protocol and public and custom-built bioinformatics tools. The large number of plasmid contigs aligned with plasmids of rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various time points suggest that not only bacterial taxa but also their plasmids are defined by ecological niche. The bacterial phylum distribution of the plasmid was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. However, both shared the dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Clearly, the rumen plasmidoma has a highly mosaic structure that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmid with two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it was revealed that the rumen plasmid encodes functions that are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and may provide advantages to its hosts. suggests that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are related to their environment, as previously implied for viruses.",,"Kav, A.

970,Characterization of emerging Newcastle disease viruses isolated in Taiwan between 2002-2008,"To elucidate the epidemiological relationships between ND outbreaks and genetic lineages, a portion of the F gene (535 bp) and the full-length HN gene (1922 bp) of recent Taiwanese NDVs isolated in 2002-2008 were amplified by reverse transcription (RT). -polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Only some of the above amplified PCR products of the F and HN genes (374 and 1713 bp) and their deduced amino acid residues were compared with 60 other NDVs from GenBank. Most recent Taiwan isolates (29/30) clustered in subgenotype VIIe, while only one isolate was classified as subgenotype VIIc. All 29 isolates of subgenotype VIIe were further subclassified and tentatively designated sub-genotypes VIIe2 (13 isolates), VIIe3 (5 isolates), and VIIe4 (11 isolates). Subgenotype VIIe2 isolates with the 112R-RQKR-F117 motif and amino acid residue substitutions at positions 23 (L to F) and 90 (T to A) were collected over the period 2002-2005. Subgenotype VIIe3 isolates with the 112R-RKKR-F117 motif and amino acid residue substitutions were found at positions 74 (E to G) and 75 (A to G) within the epitopes and at positions 114 (Q to K) within the cleavage region of the F protein. It was collected between 2003-2006. Subgenotype VIIe4 isolates with the 112R-RQKR-F117 motif and amino acid residue substitutions at positions 23 (L to F), 26 (I to T), and 90 (T to A) were collected during 2007-2008. All NDV isolates in this study exhibited a high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), all classified as velogenic-type NDVs. Subgenotypes VIIe2 and VIIe4 viruses currently predominate and play a role in many of the recent ND outbreaks in Taiwan.

971,Baculovirus infection of caterpillar (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) feeding on leaf blades of spiny or smooth-edged grass (Festuca spp.),"Susceptibility of the armyworm, Mythimna unipuncta (Haworth), to infection by a baculovirus (NPV) isolated from a Kentucky caterpillar population, in two suspected progenitors of longgrass, Festuca mairei and Festuca arundinacea subsp. phenas with intact or removed spiny leaf margins to test whether leaf spines erode or puncture the peritrophic matrix (PM) and facilitate the migration of virions to sites of infection in midgut tissue. PCR amplification and sequencing of selected genes from the virus and phylogenetic inference from aligned sequences were performed to identify and classify the virus. Edge spines had no effect on percent infection or days of death of newly moulted 5th stages fed with spiny or smooth-edged F. mairei leaf blades 24 hours before and after droplet feeding doses of 10(8) or 10(9) OBs ml. (one). Fifth instar, fed with spiny or smooth-edged grass blades, had similarly undamaged PMs when viewed with a scanning electron microscope. The fourth stage, virus-treated F. arundinacea subsp. phenas leaf blades did not differ in rates of days to death, prickly edges intact or removed, infected or dead. The food bolus moves in a liquid medium within the PM, and frass dissections showed that the margin spines were contained within a food bolus separated from the PM by non-thorny plant material rather than adjacent to the PM; therefore, the friction of the edge spines with the PM may be low. These results suggest that caterpillars will not be less susceptible to baculovirus infection when feeding on tall fescue varieties with straight leaf edges planted for better livestock performance compared to those fed standard barbed-edged varieties. We believe this is the first study to investigate the effects of a natural physical structure on PM degradation and infection by a baculovirus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

972,Genetic variability of swine circovirus 2 in vaccinated and unvaccinated commercial farms,"Vaccines against swine circovirus 2 (PCV2) are now widely used to control diseases caused by the virus. Although vaccines protect pigs against disease, they do not induce sterility immunity and therefore infections with PCV2 persist on farms. Due to its high evolutionary rate, PCV2 is expected to adapt rapidly to environmental pressures such as vaccination. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular variation of PCV2 in relation to vaccination. PCV2 variability was investigated in infected pig samples from five farms where vaccination was never administered and two farms where pigs had been vaccinated for at least 2 years. For genetic analysis, complete PCV2 genomes were amplified and subsequently pooled with vaccination status from the serum of eight vaccinated, infected pigs and 16 unvaccinated, infected pigs. The variability of viral populations was quantified using next-generation sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. The number of cleavage sites was similar in the uninoculated (n=109) and inoculated pools (n=96), but the distribution of these regions across the genome was different. Most importantly, in the capsid gene, the number of cleaved regions was only observed in the unvaccinated population. Based on structural analysis, some low-frequency amino acids are expected to result in viruses with low biological compatibility. In contrast, D294 in the replicase represents a new amino acid that is dominant and unique in the grafted pool. This study showed that variable populations of PCV2 circulate on commercial farms and that this variability is different in samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated farms.",,"Kekarainen, T.;Gonzalez, A.;Llorens, A.;Segales, J.",2014.0,Aug,,0

Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and can affect human health on a global scale, as observed with human noroviruses. By scanning stool samples from bats in Hungary, calicivirus RNA was detected in samples of Myotis daubentonii and Eptesicus serotinus bats. To characterize bat caliciviruses in more detail, large portions of the viruses' genome sequence were determined. Phylogenetic analyzes and molecular modeling definitively identified the two viruses as candidate members within the family Caliciviridae; one calicivirus strain resembles members of the Sapovirus genus, and the other bat calicivirus is more closely related to the porcine caliciviruses of the proposed Valovirus genus.

Phylogenetic tree based on the 322 bp F gene sequences of PPRV from five different locations clustered them into lineage 4 along with other Asian isolates. While the 425 bp N gene sequences revealed a different branching pattern, three different clusters were obtained for the Nigerian, Turkish and Indian isolates.

978,Epidemiology of human and animal cobuviruses,"Kobuviruses are members of the Picornaviridae family. Initially, members of the genus Kobuvirus were named according to their host species. Viruses found in humans are called “Aichi virus”, those from cattle are called “bovine cobuvirus”, and viruses isolated from pigs are called “porcine cobuvirus”. Currently, the taxonomy of cobuviruses has been proposed and the virus species renamed. Changed ""Aichi virus"" to ""Aichivirus A"", ""bovine cobuvirus"", ""Aichivirus B"" and ""porcine cobuvirus"" to ""Aichivirus C"". Among Aichivirus A, three different members have been identified, including Aichi virus 1 (human Aichivirus), canine cobuvirus 1, and murine cobuvirus 1. Aichi virus is globally distributed in 1 human and has been described at a low incidence (0-3%) in sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis. Aichi virus 1 has been reported to be associated with various types of clinical disease, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever, purulent conjunctivitis, and respiratory symptoms. Studies from Japan, Spain, Germany, and Tunisia have shown a high prevalence of antibodies to Aichi virus 1 in populations. Aichivirus B, or formerly known as bovine cobuvirus, was first reported in 2003. Since then, Aichivirus B has been reported from various countries around the world. The overall prevalence of Aichivirus B ranges from 1% to 34.5%, with the highest prevalence found in cattle with diarrhea in Korea. Aichivirus C or swine cobuvirus is commonly found in pigs. Aichivirus C has been found in both diarrhea and healthy pigs, and the positive rate for this virus ranges from 3.9% to 100%. Aichivirus C has been reported to have a high prevalence in wild boars in Hungary. The accumulated data of biological, pathological and epidemiological studies of kobuviruses are still limited.

However, like any new assay, regulatory applications of HTS need method standardization. Therefore, our three laboratories initiated a study to evaluate the performance of HTS for potential detection of viral incidental agents by adding model viruses in different cellular matrices to mimic putative materials for biomaterial production. Based on different physical and biochemical properties and commercial availability, four model viruses were selected: human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and human reovirus (REO). Additionally, porcine circovirus (PCV) has been tested by a laboratory. For HTS, it was prepared for HTS by adding intact viruses or extracted viral nucleic acids to different HeLa cell matrices (resuspended whole cells, cell lysate or total cellular RNA) individually or by mixing. Data were acquired using different sequencing platforms (Roche 454, Illumina HiSeq1500 or HiSeq2500). Bioinformatic analyzes were performed independently by each laboratory using available tools, pipelines and databases. The results showed that comparable virus detection was achieved in the three laboratories regardless of sample processing, library preparation, sequencing platform, and bioinformatics analysis: 0.1 to 3 viral genome copies were detected per cell for all model viruses used. This work highlights the potential of using HTS for the sensitive detection of incidental viruses in complex biological samples containing cellular backgrounds. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Recent high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies have resulted in unexpected discoveries of known and novel viruses in a variety of sample types, including research materials, clinical materials, and biological products. Therefore, HTS can be a powerful tool to supplement existing methods for demonstrating the absence of incidental or unwanted viruses in biological products, especially when using a new cell line. However, HTS is a complex technology with different platforms that require standardization for the evaluation of biologics. This collaborative study was conducted to investigate the detection of different virus strains using two different HTS platforms. Results from independently conducted studies demonstrated a similar sensitivity of virus detection regardless of the different sample preparation and processing procedures and bioinformatics analyzes performed in the three laboratories. Comparable HTS detection of different virus strains supports the development of reference virus materials in the future for standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.",,"Khan, A.

984,Viral diversity and clonal evolution from stepless genomic data,"Background: Clonal expansion is a process by which a single organism reproduces asexually, giving rise to a diversifying population. It is pervasive in nature, from in-host pathogen evolution to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Standard phylogenetic tools are based on full-length genomes or population consensus sequences (phased genotypes) of individual pathogens. Although high-throughput sequencing technologies can sample population diversity, short sequence reads unique to them preclude evaluating whether two reads originate from the same clone (phase-free genotypes). This obstacle severely limits the application of phylogenetic methods and the investigation of intra-host dynamics of acute infections using this rich data source. Methods: We present two measures of diversity to study the evolution of clonal populations using phase-free genomic data, eliminating the need to construct full-length genomes. Our method follows a maximum likelihood approach to predict evolution rates and times to the most recent common ancestor, based on a comfortable molecular clock model; independent of the growth model. Deviations from neutral evolution indicate the presence of selection and bottleneck events. Conclusions: We evaluated our methods in silico and then compared them with current approaches to the well-characterized 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We then applied our method to high-throughput genomic data from marburgvirus-infected non-human primates and extracted the time of infection and the rate of intra-host evolution and determined purifying selection in viral populations. Conclusions: Our method has the power to use minor variants found in less than 1% of the population and capture genomic diversity within days of infection, making it an ideal tool for the study of acute RNA viral infection dynamics.",,"Khiabanian, H.;Carpenter, Z.;Kugelman, J.;Chan, J.;Trifonov, V.;Nagle, E.;Warren, T.;Iversen, P.;Bavari, S.;Palacios, G.;Rabadan, R.",2014.0,Oct,,0

In this study, we report the isolation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV/Peacock/India/2012) in autopsy brain tissue sample of wild peacock from North India. The complete genome of the virus was found to be 15,186 nucleotides (nts) with six genes in the order 3â€²-Nâ€“PMF-HN-L-5â€², restricted to a 55-nts leader region at 3â€. A sequence of 114 nts fragments at the ² end and 5â€² end. Sequence analysis of the fusion protein revealed the dibasic amino acid cleavage site <sup>112</sup>RRQKRF<sup>117</sup>, which is a characteristic motif of the virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in genotype II of Newcastle disease virus and showed the lowest mean percentage of divergence (6%Â) with other genotype II counterparts. The isolate was characterized as mesogenic (intermediate pathotype) based on mean time to death in embryonated chicken eggs (63Â h) and intracerebral pathogenicity index in day-old chicks (1.40). The report highlights the dynamic ecology of NDV strains circulating in a wild avian host during the 2012 North Indian outbreak. In addition, genotypic and pathotypic characterizations of the isolate may aid in the development of a homologous vaccine against the circulating NDV strain in the avian population.",,"Khulape, S.

986,Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the fusion protein cleavage region of isolates that acquired Newcastle disease virus from Iran.,"Nine Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks in different regions of Iran were characterized at the molecular level. Sequence analysis revealed that the isolates share two pairs of arginine and one phenylalanine at the N-terminus of the fusion (F) protein cleavage site, similar to other velogenic isolates of NDV previously characterized. Eight of the nine isolates had the same amino acid sequence as VOL95, a 1995 Russian NDV isolate. However, one isolate, MK13, showed 5 amino acid substitutions, of which 3 were reported for other velogenic NDV isolates. These results show that the source of ND outbreaks in different regions of Iran in 1995-1998 was VOL95.",,"Kianizadeh, M.;Aini, I.;Omar, A. R.;Yusoff, K.;Sahrabadi, M.;Kargar, R.",2002.0,,,0

989,Genetic variability in hepatitis B viruses,"In 1988, it was reported that the complete nucleotide sequences of 18 hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains were clustered into four genetic groups (A to D), with more than 8% difference between groups. This classification of strains in terms of genome sequence has since proven to be an important tool in understanding the epidemiology and evolution of HBV and has been expanded to include three more genotypes. Parallel to the HBV genotypes identified in humans, HBV strains isolated from different primates and hepadnaviruses found in groundhogs, ground squirrels, ducks and herons were studied. Sequence differences between HBV genotypes can lead to structural differences at the pregenome level and also to dramatic differences at the translational level when specific and commonly occurring mutations occur. There is increasing evidence that the clinical picture, response to treatment, and long-term prognosis may vary depending on which genotype infects the patient. Therefore, evaluation of traditional serological patterns in a patient should take into account the genotype of the infecting strain. Nucleotide variability among HBV strains has been used in many studies to monitor transmission routes, and as it has become increasingly clear that differences between HBV genotypes are important, the need for reliable and easy methods to distinguish HBV genotypes has emerged. This review summarizes information on HBV genotypes in relation to their genetic, structural and clinically relevant differences and their origin and evolution in the context of hepadnaviruses in general.",,"Kidd-Ljunggren, K.;Miyakawa, Y.;Kidd, A.

990,Identification of plant protein kinases in response to abiotic and biotic stresses using SuperSAGE.,"Plants are sessile organisms that are exposed to many environmental adversities. In order to survive, they must effectively sense and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. During this process, protein kinases are essential in sensing environmental stimuli and trigger signaling cascades. Kinases are among the largest and most important gene families for biotechnological purposes and present many challenges to bioinformaticians due to the combination of various regions as well as conserved domains. Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] is an important legume that has adapted to different agro-climatic conditions including drought, humidity and varying temperatures. For this product, combining the SuperSAGE method with high-throughput sequencing technology will generate reliable transcriptome profiles with millions of tags counted and statistically analyzed. One approach to assessing biotic and abiotic stresses was accomplished by generating more than 13 million cowpea SuperSAGE tags, which can be obtained from the leaves/roots of plants under abiotic (mechanical damage and salinity) or biotic (CABMV, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus) stresses. Annotation and identification of tags binding to previously well-defined ESTs by BlastN allowed for back-identification of kinases. Annotation efficiency depended on the database used, and KEGG was seen as a good resource for annotated ESTs, especially when complemented with an independent Gene Ontology category, as well as Gene Index using selected species. Using different approaches allowed the identification of 1,350 kinase candidates considering biotic libraries and 2,268 related to abiotic libraries based on a combination of both adequate descriptions and GO terms. Additional searches in kinase-specific databases allowed the identification of a relatively low number of additional kinases, revealing the lack of kinase databases for non-model organisms, particularly plants. Regarding the kinase families, a total of 713 potential kinases were classified into 13 families of the CMGC and STE groups. Regarding differentially expressed kinases, 169 of 713 potential kinases were identified (p < 0.05), 100 up-regulated and 69 down-regulated when comparing different libraries, resulting in a comprehensive panel of differentially expressed kinases under biotic and abiotic stresses. allowed. non-model plant such as cowpea.

991,Estimating the global spread of H5N1 avian flu,"The spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Asia, Europe and Africa has had enormous effects on the poultry industry and poses a significant threat to human health. The ways in which the virus spreads and will spread between countries have been discussed extensively, but have not yet been analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway of 52 individual entry events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 out of 21 entries of H5N1 into countries in Asia are most likely via poultry and 3 out of 21 via migratory birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely via migratory birds. In Africa, the spread was probably partly by poultry (2/8 introduction) and partly by migratory birds (3/8). Our analyzes estimate that H5N1 is more likely to be transmitted to the Western Hemisphere via infected poultry and to the United States mainland by subsequent movement of migratory birds from neighboring countries rather than eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergy between trade and wildlife movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control.

992,Characterization of the complete genome of circular single-stranded DNA virus from pig faeces in Korea.,"Porcine circular single-stranded DNA viruses have been newly identified from pig feces in Korea. This virus was referred to as bovine feces-associated circular DNA virus (BoSCV)-like virus discovered in pig feces. However, extensive features of the virus have not been described. Therefore, this research focuses on finding a complete genome sequence and analyzing the genetic characteristics of the virus. The virus, now called pig feces-associated circular DNA virus (PoSCV Kor) in Korea, consists of 2,589 bases that form a circular structure. Between the 5' ends and 3' ends of the two putative ORFs, each stem-loop structure has two main ORFs that reversely encode the replicase and capsid protein. This feature is the same as PoSCV in New Zealand, but different from chimpanzee fecal-associated circular virus (ChiSCVs) and BoSCV, which have a stem-loop structure. It is therefore certain that PoSCV Kor is genetically very similar to PoSCV; same number of nucleotide bases and amino acid identity of replicase and capsid protein (96% and 93%, respectively). This fact can be confirmed by the finding that PoSCV Core and PoSCV are in the same cluster by phylogenetic analysis based on comparison with the full sequences of other circular ssDNA viruses.",,"Kim, A.

Strains have been commonly identified in commercial poultry farms as well as in great-grandparent and grandparent rearing farms. In the field, CIAV strains from breeder farms had no clinical effect, but commercial farm strains were associated with depression, growth retardation, and anemia, regardless of the strain originating group. In addition, we identified 7 CIAV genomes similar to vaccine strains from vaccinated and unvaccinated breeder flocks. These data indicate the need for further studies on pathogenicity and vaccine efficacy against different groups of CIAV, together with continuous CIAV surveillance and genetic analysis in breeder farms.

Clinical manifestations characterized by signs of anorexia, depression and irritability were observed. Isolated A/ostrich/Korea/H829/2014 (H5N8) virus had a cleavage site motif containing multiple basic amino acids typical of HPAI virus. The phylogenetic tree of the hemagglutinin gene of the H5 HPAI virus showed that this ostrich H5N8 virus belonged to viruses 2.3.4.4 along with the H5N8 strains isolated from ducks and wild birds in South Korea in 2014. Pathologically, redness, enlargement and bleeding in the pancreas, spleen, brain brittleness and hydropericardium were prominent. Histological legions were observed in the pancreas, spleen, liver, lung, heart, and brain, and influenza A nucleoproteins were detected in the same organs by immunohistochemistry.

However, the main etiologic agent is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the diversity of viruses found in proventriculus samples from South Korean flocks diagnosed with TVP between 2003 and 2012 with that of healthy flocks in South Korea. An average of 21,538,726 sequence reads of each sample was generated by high-throughput sequencing. 160 nt long. Enrichment in viral sequences indicated that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although we could not identify a TVP pathogen matching the known morphology, picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an association with TVP. Five samples yielded 1,045-1,720 bp contigs with 81-84% nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). Whole genome analysis showed that the new picornavirus strain QIA01 was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7% nt and 95.5% aa sequence identity), but differed in the structural region and partial 2A peptides (56.2%). . nt and 23.9% aa array ID). In addition, the QIA01 virus was similar to chicken megrivirus (87.0 nt and 95.6% aa sequence identity) recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in Hungary.

To test the effect of antibody neutralization of HGF on anti-cancer T cell immunity, we generated surrogate antibodies reactive to the mouse homologue of the epitope targeted by YYB-101. First, we inoculated a chicken with human HGF and monitored changes in the B cell repertoire with next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then extracted the VH gene repertoire from the NGS data, segmented it according to sequence homology, and classified the components according to the change in the number of unique VH sequences within each component and the frequencies of the VH sequences following immunization. These changes must be accompanied by preferential proliferation and somatic hypermutation or gene conversion of B cells encoding HGF-reactive antibodies. One component showed significant increases in the number and frequency of hosted genes encoding unique VH sequences and antibodies that are reactive to human HGF and compete with YYB-101 for HGF binding. Some of the antibodies also responded to mouse HGF. The selected VH sequences shared 98.3% identity and 98.9% amino acid identity. Therefore, the antibodies encoded by them are all likely to respond to the epitope targeted by YYB-101.",,"Kim, S.;Lee, H.;Noh, J.;Lee, Y.;Han, H.;Yoo, D.

1001,Prevalence and genetic characteristics of porcine circovirus types 2 and 3 in Korea,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), threaten the swine industry worldwide. Five PCV2 genotypes have recently been identified: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d, and PCV2e. In addition, a novel porcine circovirus was identified from a pig case with dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure based on metagenomic analysis and classified as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCV2 and PCV3 in clinical samples. RESULTS: A total of 471 samples (161 lung and lymph node tissue samples from 34 farms and 310 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV2. Among these, 171 samples from 59 farms positive for PCV2 were genotyped. Another 690 samples (296 lung and lymph node tissue samples from 91 farms, 108 aborted fetus samples from 26 farms, and 286 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV3. Based on the PCV2 genotyping results, PCV2d was the most common genotype (10 of 171 samples), and coinfections with combinations of PCV2a, 2b, and 2d were identified in 48 samples from 17 farms. A total of 14 samples from 11 farms were positive for both PCV2 and PCV3. 57 samples (9.8%) from 32 farms (23.2%) were positive for PCV3. Among 108 aborted fetuses from 26 farms, only 2 samples were positive for PCV3. Based on sequence comparisons, PCV2d shares 89.6-91.0% and 93.2-94.3% homology with PCV2a and PCV2b, respectively; 98.6-100% homology is shared between PCV2d strains. The PCV3 strains identified in this study share 98.0-99.5% homology. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concluded that PCV2d became the most dominant genotype in Korea.

Here we describe the first complete genome sequences of rotavirus F (strain 03V0568) and G (strain 03V0567) with a length of 18,341 and 18,186 bp, respectively. Both viruses have open reading frames for the rotavirus proteins VP1 to VP7 and NSP1 to NSP5 located in 11 genome segments. Nucleotide sequence identities to other rotaviruses ranged from 29.8% (NSP1 gene) to 61.7% (VPI gene) for rotavirus F and 29.3% (NSP1-2 gene) to 65.9% (NSP2 gene) for rotavirus G, thus confirming their classification. different types of viruses. The encoded proteins revealed remarkable sequence differences between rotavirus strains. In contrast, non-coding 5'-terminal sequences of genome segments were highly conserved across all rotavirus strains. Different 3'-terminal consensus sequences exist between rotavirus A/D/F, rotavirus C, and rotavirus B/G/H. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that rotaviruses split into two main branches, namely rotavirus A/C/D/F and rotavirus B/G/H. Within these clades, rotavirus F was mainly clustered with rotavirus D and rotavirus B and rotavirus G. In addition, differentiation between mammalian and avian rotavirus A strains, the host-specific evolution of rotavirus B and C, as well as an ancient reclassification event between avian rotavirus A and D, is illustrated by phylogenetic data.

These data were used to explore the population dynamics of FMDV at both herd and host level, to evaluate the effect of the host on viral herd structure, and to identify transmission links with viruses recovered from other farms in the same outbreak series. In 7 samples from 6 different animals, a total of 5 consensus level variants were identified, in addition to 104 subconsensus variants, 22 of which were shared among 2 or more animals. Further analysis revealed differences in herd structures from samples obtained from the same animal, suggesting the existence of different viral populations that evolved independently at different lesion sites within the same infected animal.",,"King, D.

1008,Rapid serotyping of infectious bronchitis virus isolates by hemagglutination-inhibition test,"The hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test has recently been evaluated as a method for typing suspected infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates. Hemagglutination (HA) antigen was prepared from each isolate by phospholipase C treatment of virus concentrated from the allanto-amniotic fluids of infected chicken embryos. An HI test was performed with the HA antigen of each isolate against a battery of 17 antisera prepared against different strains of IBV classified by virus neutralization (VN). The HI test identified Ark 99 and Holland isolates similar to strains previously classified by VN. The two isolates included in this study were not inhibited by any reference antiserum and therefore appeared antigenically different. The isolates were also evaluated by the VN and the results of the VN and HI methods were accepted. The results therefore suggest that the HI test may be useful for a rapid, hypothetical identification of new IBV isolates.",,"King, D. J.;Hopkins, S. R.",1984.0,,,0
1009,Advanced bioinformatics profiling of VIDISCA libraries for virus detection and discovery,"VIDISCA is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation method designed to enrich viral nucleic acids from samples prior to highly multiplexed low-depth sequencing. Reliable detection of known viruses and discovery of new distinct viruses from NGS data require specialized analysis tools that are both sensitive and accurate. Existing software was used to design a new bioinformatics workflow for high-throughput detection and discovery of viruses from VIDISCA data. The workflow leverages the molecular biology of VIDISCA library preparation, particularly the use of the Mse1 restriction enzyme, which generates biological copy library inserts from the same genomes. The workflow performs total metagenomic analysis for classification of non-viral sequences, including parasites and host, as well as virus-specific analysis. To increase the downstream analysis speed, the ribosomal RNA is sequenced and the remaining reads are clustered at 100% identity. Known and new viruses are precisely detected by alignment to a virus-only protein database, and false positives are removed. A new cluster profiling assay takes advantage of viral biological replicates produced by Mse1 digestion using read clustering to flag the presence of short genomes in very high copy numbers. Importantly, this analysis enables the identification of highly repetitive sequences even if no homology is detected, as demonstrated here by the detection of a novel gokushovirus genome from human fecal matter. The workflow was validated using readout data from serum and stool samples from HIV-1 positive adults and serum samples from pigs infected with atypical porcine pestivirus.",,"Kinsella, C.

The differences between the two biotypes of BVDV – cytopathogenic (cp, Figure 2) and non-cytopathogenic (ncp) viruses – are also discussed, classifying them according to the recombinative events to which the virus genome is subjected. For now, based on the results of recent studies, it appears that recombinative events of the amino-terminus of the nonstructural p80 enzyme protein (Figure 3) of BVDV are mainly responsible for the transformation of ncp BVDV - mainly nature - to cp BVDV and thus to the development of mucosal disease. , MD.",,"Kiss, I.;Kecskemeti, S.",1998.0,Jul,,0
1012,Rescue of different avian boraviruses from proventricular dilatation disease cases: identification of a candidate etiologic agent.,"BACKGROUND: Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a deadly disease that threatens domesticated and wild psittacine birds worldwide. It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the ganglia of the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to disorders of the central nervous system as well as irregular enteric motility and consequent wasting. For nearly 40 years, a viral etiology for PDD has been suspected, but to date no candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly associated with the disease. RESULTS: Analysis of 2 PDD case-control series independently collected on different continents using pan-viral microarray revealed a boravirus hybridization signature in 62.5% (5/8) of PDD cases and none (0/8) in controls. Ultra-high-throughput sequencing was used to recover the complete viral genome sequence from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a boravirus-like genome organization for this agent with a high degree of sequence variation from all previous boravirus isolates. We propose the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. More specific ABV PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV detection rate among PDD cases (71, n = 7%) compared to controls (0%, n = 14); Fisher's Exact Test). Partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates that we have now rescued from them and an additional case set reveal at least 5 different ABV genetic subsets. CONCLUSION: These studies clearly demonstrate the existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse boraviruses and present a compelling candidate for the search for the etiologic agent of PDD.",,"Kistler, A.

1014,Current Information on Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3): A New Virus with As-yet Unknown Impact on Porcine Industry Review,"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) is a recently identified virus belonging to the Circoviridae family. It represents the third member of the Circovirus genus capable of infecting pigs, along with PCV-1, which is considered non-pathogenic, and PCV-2, one of the most economically relevant viruses for the swine industry worldwide. PCV-3 was first found in 2015 by metagenomic analyzes in tissues of pigs suffering from swine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, myocarditis, and multisystemic inflammation. The absence of other common pathogens as potential infectious agents of these conditions has raised the suspicion that PCV-3 may play an etiological role in disease occurrence. Subsequently, the viral genome was detected in apparently healthy pigs, and retrospective studies showed that PCV-3 was already present in pigs by the early 1990s. In fact, available evidence indicates that PCV-3 is a fairly common virus worldwide. Recently, virus DNA has also been found in wild boar, expanding the scope of infection susceptibility among the Suidae family; furthermore, the potential reservoir role of this species for domestic pig has been proposed. Phylogenetic studies with PCV-3 partial and full sequences available from around the world revealed high nucleotide identity (>96%), although two main groups and several subsets were also identified. It has also been suggested that the most dated to about 50 years ago belonged to a common ancestor. Considering the economic importance and known effects of PCV-2 on the swine industry, a new member of the same family as PCV-3 should not be neglected. Studies on epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunity and diagnosis are warranted in the next few years. Therefore, the current review will update current knowledge and future research trends on PCV-3.",,"Klaumann, F.;Correa-Fiz, F.;Franzo, G.;Sibila, M.;Nunez, J. I.;Segales, J.",2018.0,,,0
1015,Occurrence and phylogenetic analysis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory disease outbreaks in Norway.,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. The seroprevalence of BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in respiratory disease outbreaks is unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in BRD outbreaks and to conduct a phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. BRSV infection was detected serologically and/or virologically in 18 of 21 (86%) outbreaks and as a single viral agent in most cases. When serology showed the presence of bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view that BRSV is the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of BRSV-positive samples indicated that existing circulating Norwegian BRSVs, along with other Northern European isolates, belonged to genetic subgroup II. An isolate from an outbreak that occurred in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a distinct clade in subgroup II, clearly distinct from the existing Scandinavian sequences. Currently circulating BRSV can be split into two different strains co-existing in the same geographic area. Sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the G protein. The results showed that BRSV is the most important etiologic agent of BRD outbreaks in Norway and often acts as the sole viral agent. Phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains and several previously published isolates supported the geographic and temporal clustering theory of BRSV.",,"Klem, T.

1016,Reliable classification and recombination analysis of porcine endogenous retroviruses,"Prevention of interspecific infection with porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) is crucial for xenotransplantation. Previous studies have identified the potential risk of infection for the PERV Î³1 subfamily A, B, and C. Replication competent PERV Î³1 proviruses assigned to a particular subfamily and hybrid viruses resulting from retroviral recombination events between subfamilies were observed. Future porcine genome sequencing projects will reveal large numbers of new PERV proviruses from additional breeds and animals. Evaluation of these viral genomes should be done to assess the potential risk of retroviral interspecies infection. In this study, we tested common sequence comparison methods for classification of PERV sequences and detection of hybrid clones. Examination of polymorphic nucleotide positions was found to be the most appropriate procedure.

Types 3 and 7 were found to be the same and associated with serotype 2. All nine other BEVs were included in serotype 1 or 2. Not all strains in each serotype were the same and antigenic variants were designated as subtypes. Antigenic associations not revealed by VN were shown in the CF and IP tests. Bovine enterovirus strains, whose antisera have the widest intratypical reactivity, were proposed as prototypes.

1023,Gentian mosaic virus: A New Species in the genus Fabavirus,"SUMMARY A viral isolate named N-1 obtained from a gentian (Gentiana scabra) plant showing mosaic symptoms mechanically infected nine plant species in six families. These plants are known as hosts of fabaviruses. The N-1 isolate consisted of isometric particles with a diameter of 30 nm and contained two RNA molecules of approximately 6.0 and 3.6 kb in length, as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNAs are individually encapsulated in two of the three particle types. Each particle contained two different proteins with Mr values of 39.3 x 10(3) and 26.6 x 10(3) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequences of the RNAs revealed that each encodes a single large polyprotein, where the putative functional proteins are arranged in a similar fashion to those in Legume wilt virus 1 (BBWV-1) and Legume wilt virus 2 (BBWV-). 2) They are members of the genus Fabavirus (Comoviridae family). Analysis of the inferred amino acid sequences of the proteins showed that those of isolated N-1 shared 38% to 66% identity with those of BBWV-1 and BBWV-2, but only 16 to 42% identity with a comovirus, Cowpea mosaic virus. . Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase placed isolate N-1 in a separate lineage from BBWV-1 and BBWV-2. In the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the N-1 isolate BBWV-1 showed distant serological association with BBWV-2 and another fabavirus, Lamium mild mosaic virus. Our results show that N-1 represents a new Fabavirus strain. We propose the name Gentian mosaic virus for this new strain.",,"Kobayashi, Y.

1024,The Cattle Virus Virus: A Schedule,"Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is a bovine pathogen, a member of the Flaviviridae family, a genus of pestivirus that also includes Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV or swine cholera virus) and Border Disease Virus of sheep (BDV). It causes significant economic losses mainly associated with reproductive failure. Pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses about 40 nm in diameter. The nucleocapsid is probably icosahedral. The genome consists of a single-stranded positive RNA encoding approximately 430 kD of protein product. Genetic expression consists of the synthesis of a polyprotein that is processed together and post-translationally. Two biotypes can be distinguished based on its ""in vitro"" behavior: non-cytopathic (ncp) and cytopathic (cp), most likely derived from ncp by mutations and/or recombination. BVDV can cross the placenta and infect the fetus, causing problems ranging from fetal death to the birth of a permanently infected (P) calf, depending on the fetal age at the time of infection. PI animals are immuno-tolerant to the virus and spread it in all secretions. Only the ncp biotype was isolated from PI animals. Superinfection of a PI animal with a cp strain causes mucosal disease, which is always fatal. Since 1993, outbreaks of serious, sometimes hemorrhagic disease caused by ncp BVDV have occurred in Canada and the USA. Genomic and serological differences between ""traditional"" strains and viruses isolated from these outbreaks, including subtypes I and II of BVDV, both cp and ncp strains. Analyzes of the non-coding 5'-UTR region of the genome of pestiviruses from different species (bovine, ovine, porcine) indicate that there are at least 3 genotypes within the genus. A new classification of these viruses based on genomic sequence rather than type of origin has been proposed. Genomic heterogeneity exists in the BVDV genome, which presents 3 hypervariable regions, 2 of which are in the major neutralizing protein. The prevalence of BVDV antibodies in the cattle population in Argentina is 70% and the prevalence of persistent infections is around 1%.",,"Kobrak, A.;Weber, E. L.",1997.0,,,0

Recently, next-generation sequencing has been used to generate genomic sequences of several members of the Varicellovirus genus. Here, currently available varicellovirus genomic sequences were used for phylogenetic, recombination and genetic distance analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A phylogenetic network containing the genomic sequences of individual species was constructed and suggested a potential constraint between ungulate and non-hoofed viruses. Intraspecies genetic distances were found in hoof viruses (pseudorabies virus (SuHV-1) 1.65%, bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1) 0.81%, equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV-1) 0.79%), equine herpes virus type) was higher. 4 (EHV-4) 0.16%), non-hoofed viruses (feline herpes virus type 1 (FHV-1) 0.0089%, canine herpes virus type 1 (CHV-1) 0.005%, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) ) 0.136% ) ). The G + C content of ungulate viruses was also higher compared to non-hoofed viruses (FHV-1 45.8%) (SuHV-1 73.6%, BHV-1 72.6%, EHV-1 56.6%, EHV-4 50.5% , CHV-1 31.6%, VZV 45.8%), suggesting a possible link between G + C content and intraspecies genetic diversity. Varicellovirus clade terminology is variable between different species, and we propose a standardization based on genomic genetic distance. A recent study reported no recombination among the sequenced FHV-1 strains, but both splitstree and bootstrap screening and PHI analysis in the current study showed recombination. We also found that the recently sequenced Brazilian CHV-1 strain BTU-1 may contain a genetic signal from an unknown varicellovirus in the UL50 gene. CONCLUSION: Together, the data contribute to a better understanding of varicellovirus genomics, and we also propose a new clade nomenclature scheme based on genetic distances.",,"Kolb, A.

Phylogenetic analyzes were performed on field viruses originating from naturally infected animals, the BDV vaccine strain 'Dessau', four commonly used laboratory strains and the new BDV subtype No/98. Four regions of the BDV genome were analyzed: the complete p40, p10 and p24 genes and the 5'-untranslated region of the X/P transcript. BDV isolates from the same geographic region clearly showed a higher degree of identity to each other than BDV isolates from other regions, regardless of host species and year of isolation. Five different clusters can be formed within endemic areas, corresponding to the geographic regions from which the viruses originate: (i) a Swiss, Austrian and Liechtenstein Rhine valley group geographically closely related to the neighboring Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria II group (ii) in the western part of Germany; (iii) a third group, the so-called Bavarian I group, whose formation is limited to Bavaria; (iv) bordering on the territory of these federal states in the eastern part of Germany, with the southern Saxony-Anhalt and northern Saxony group; and (v) a mixed group of samples from different regions of Germany; but they were mainly from the federal states of Thuringia and Lower Saxony.

In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of the 11 genes of HMG035 and NGRBg8 strains was of bovine origin. Therefore, it has been suggested that the HMG035 and NGRBg8 strains are derived from a common origin, and the NGRBg8 strain was hypothesized to represent a sample of bovine RVA strains transmitted to humans. Our findings provide clear evidence for direct cattle-to-human interspecies transmission of RVA strains.",,"Komoto, S.;Adah, M. I.;Ide, T.;Yoshikawa, T.;Taniguchi, K.",2016.0,9,,0
1035,Reclassification of Human and Animal Rotavirus Gene Segments in Emerging DS-1-Like G1P 8 Rotavirus Strains,"The emergence and rapid spread of novel DS-1-like G1P[8] human rotaviruses in Japan has recently been reported. More recently, such intergenogroup reassortant strains have been identified in Thailand, implying the continued spread of unusual rotavirus strains in Asia. During surveillance of rotavirus in Thailand, three DS-1-likes with G3P[8] (RVA/Human-wt/THA/SKT-281/2013/G3P[8] and RVA/Human-wt/THA/SKT-) intergenogroup reasortant strain) 289/2013/G3P[8]) and G2P[8] (RVA/Human-wt/THA/LS-04/2013/G2P[8]) genotypes were identified in stool samples from hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the complete genomes of SKT-281, SKT-289 and LS-04 strains. In full genomic analysis, all three strains displayed unique genotype constellations containing both genogroup 1 and 2 genes: G3-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 for strains SKT-281. and G2-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 for strain SKT-289 and LS-04. Apart from the G genotype, the unique genotype constellation of the three strains (P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2) is usually shared with the DS-1-like G1P[8. ] strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that nine out of 11 genes of SKT-281 and SKT-289 strains (VP4, VP6, VP1-3, NSP1-3 and NSP5) originated from DS-1-like G1P[8] strains, with the remaining VP7 and NSP4 genes in equine and bovine, respectively. was found to originate. Therefore, strains SKT-281 and SKT-289, DS-1-like G1P[8], appeared as reasortant strains to animal-derived human and/or animal rotaviruses. On the other hand, seven of the 11 genes of the LS-04 lineage (VP7, VP6, VP1, VP3, and NSP3-5) appear to originate from locally circulating DS-1-like G2P[4] human rotaviruses, while three of their genes (VP4, VP2, and NSP1) are DS- It is assumed to be derived from 1 like G1P[8] strains. Notably, the remaining NSP2 gene of the LS-04 strain appeared to be of bovine origin. Therefore, the LS-04 strain was hypothesized to be a multiple reclassification strain relative to DS-1-like G1P[8], locally circulating DS-1-like G2P[4], bovine-like human and/or bovine rotaviruses. Overall, the great genomic diversity among DS-1-like G1P[8] strains seemed to have been established by reclassification involving human and animal strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report on whole genome-based characterization of DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains with genotypes G3P[8] and G2P[8] that originated in Thailand. Our observations will provide important insights into the evolutionary dynamics of emerging DS-1-like G1P[8] strains and related reassortants.",,"Komoto, S.;Tacharoenmuang, R.;Guntapong, R.;Ide, T.;Tsuji, T.;Yoshikawa, T.;Tharmaphornpilas, P.;Sangkitporn, S.;Taniguchi, K.",2016.0,,,0

Researchers collected nasopharyngeal swabs of all sick pigs whenever possible. An H9N2 influenza virus was isolated from the pig population. The complete genome of an isolate designated A/Swine/Guangdong/L1/2010(H9N2) was sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank. The results of the analyzes showed that the A/Swine/Guangdong/L1/2010(H9N2) sequence was similar to that of several avian influenza viruses.

Chickenpox is the result of primary infection by VZV. During the viremic phase, VZV infects peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spreads to the environment. It causes typical lesions in skin cells. Apoptosis has been demonstrated in different cell types by other Î±-herpesviruses. VZV-infected T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively, were examined in this in vitro study by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. All infected cell types showed signs of apoptosis: a lower DNA content, DNA fragmentation, loss of membrane integrity, and an altered nuclear morphology. The observed results led to the suggestion that VZV could induce apoptosis during in vivo infection in PBMC subpopulations. © 2003 scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

To study the evolution of FMD viruses (FMDV) and aid disease control measures, genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of 43 epizootic-representing domain isolates were performed. The nucleotide sequence of the VP1 coding region was determined for viruses and used in this study. Two serotype A strains, A/Arg/00 and A/Arg/01 (preload value 1000/1000), and two different serotype strains O/Arg/00 (848/1000 bootstrap value) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that A/Arg/01 and O/Arg/00 viruses may be related to ancient South American isolates, while the origin of A Argentina 2000 viruses remains unclear.

1040,The heterogeneity of ruminant pestiviruses: Academic interest or an important basis for the development of vaccines and diagnostics?,"Pestiviruses cause economically important diseases of livestock. Members of pestiviruses are bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and borderline disease virus (BDV). Phylogenetic analyzes based on the entire nucleic acid sequence encoding Npro provide statistically significant separation of established species and subgroups within species. BVDV-1 strains isolated in Germany can be associated with at least five different subgroups. In contrast, all BVDV-2 isolates detected so far in Germany are closely related and belong to a subgroup. A group of virus isolates from sheep and zoo animals is clearly different from the established pestivirus strains and may be termed BDV-2. The antigenic relationship of pestiviruses was investigated using virus isolates and antisera identified in cross-neutralization experiments. Six antigenic groups were distinguished, corresponding to the genetic clusters BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2 and Giraffe-1. A significant antigenic difference was also observed between members of subgroups 1a and 1b of BVDV-1.

1042,Virological and pathological characterization of an avian H1N1 influenza A virus,"Gene segments from avian H1N1 influenza A viruses have been remapped with other influenza viruses to create pandemic strains over the past century. However, little effort has been made to understand the characteristics of avian H1N1 influenza viruses. Here, we present the genome sequence and molecular and virological characterization of an avian influenza A virus, A/wildbird/Korea/SK14/2014 (A/SK14, H1N1), isolated from migratory birds during the winter in South Korea. 2014-2015. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to the Eurasian avian lineage. Although the A/SK14 virus retained its avian-receptor binding preference, it also exhibited detectable human-like receptor binding and was able to replicate in differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. In animal models, A/SK14 virus was moderately pathogenic in mice and the virus was detected in nasal washes of vaccinated guinea pigs, but not in direct contact guinea pigs. Although A/SK14 shows moderate pathogenicity in a mammalian model and has no evidence of transmission, our results suggest that the dual receptor specificity of the A/SK14-like virus may allow a faster adaptation to mammals and further continuous surveillance and risk assessment activities.",,"Koo, B.

1043,Evolution of thymidine and thymidylate kinases: the possibility of independent capture of TK genes by different virus groups,"Phylogenetic analysis of viral and cellular thymidine and thymidylate kinases was performed using computer assisted methods. Multiple alignments and temporal phylogenetic trees were generated for two families of these enzymes, including a) mammalian thymidine kinases (TK), smallpox viruses, African swine fever virus, E. coli, and bacteriophage T4; and b) thymidylate kinases (ThyK) of yeast and poxviruses and distantly related herpes virus proteins with both enzymatic activities. Analysis of the alignment of TKs of the first family highlighted three strongly conserved divisions. Two of these corresponded to motifs A and B of the purine NTP-binding pattern. The third, C-terminal segment, showing the highest protection, contained a modified Zn finger motif. It is speculated that this motif may be involved in TK oligomerization. Phylogenetic trees constructed by three different methods suggested that cellular TK genes could be captured independently by T4 bacteriophage, African swine fever virus, avian pox virus, and other smallpox virus. The observed tree topologies seem to contradict popular virus-host coevolutionary schemes and imply that different subdivisions of smallpox viruses diverged from their hosts at earlier stages in evolution. The deoxynucleoside monophosphate kinase of bacteriophage T4 has been shown to be related to the ThyK family. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that ThyK genes were probably acquired independently by phage T4, smallpox viruses and herpes viruses.",,"Koonin, E. V.;Senkevich, T. G.",1992.0,Apr,,0
1044,Characterization of Ovine herpesvirus 1 RKZ isolate,"The cytopathic effect (CPE), mainly characterized by round cell foci, was observed in cultures of primary plexus choroid cells from healthy lambs following cryopreservation. It was possible to transmit the infectious agent to other primary cells of sheep origin by co-cultivation with infected cells. High percentage of sheep (65-80% in 3 different herds from Slovakia) were found to be infected with this infectious agent by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Electron microscopy of cells with CPE revealed the presence of herpes virus particles. Viral DNA was isolated from infected cells using pulsed gel electrophoresis and also used as probe in Southern blot analysis. The probe specifically reacted only with DNA from cells infected with Ovine herpesvirus 1 (OvHV-1), but not with DNA from other ruminant herpesviruses. Some of the HindIII restriction fragments of DNA of RKZ, named OvHV-1 isolate, were cloned. A portion of the H9 clone was sequenced, identifying a gene encoding a polypeptide homologous to the conserved herpes virus VP23 structural protein. Comparing the sequence of this clone with the VP23 sequences of other herpes viruses, it was concluded that OvHV-1 can be classified within the genus Rhhadinovirus of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. Sequencing the DNA of the RKZ isolate to the H9 clone enabled the establishment of a sensitive and highly specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of OvHV-1.",,"KopÃ¡Äek, J.;RejholcovÃ¡, O.;KoptidesovÃ¡, D.;ÄŒiampor, F.;Rijsewijk, F.

Variability of the binding pattern has been demonstrated for CSFV as well as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strains and isolates. The mAb panels against E2 and EO resulted in very different reactivity patterns.

The complete genome sequences of selected influenza A viruses distributed worldwide are publicly available, and several longitudinal genome studies of human, avian, and porcine influenza A viruses have been performed. All downloadable sequences of influenza A viruses available on the GISAID Platform (Global Initiative for Sharing Global Influenza Data) were first analyzed through the web servers of the Influenza Virus Resource at NCBI. Phylogenetic study of the circulating human pandemic H1N1 virus showed that the new variant has a distinctive evolutionary feature. There is no single way for pandemic H1N1 to acquire new genes from other distinguishable viruses recently circulating in local human, pig or domestic poultry populations from various geographic regions. The wide genetic diversity among all segments found in the pandemic H1N1 genome indicates that multiple entry of the virus occurred during 1999-2009. Initial interspecies transmission may have occurred in the long-term past, and subsequent rearrangement steps give rise to three lineages: classical SIV common in North America, avian-like SIV in Europe, and related bird-like SIV in Asia.

Bioinformatics provides approaches to information gathering and updating that were unimaginable two decades ago. Metagenomics is the field of bioinformatics that helps improve our knowledge of the composition of microbial species in production or in domestic animals, humans or the environment. Objectives: This study describes the main steps of a metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic research of swine dysentery as an important animal disease is cited as an example. Materials and methods: Intestinal contents from three clinically diseased fattening pigs were sampled from three different parts of the intestine (ie, cecum, colon, and rectum). All DNA was extracted from the samples, then sequenced with next-generation sequencing technology. The 1,782,466 reads produced were collected and analyzed. Reads were adjusted by the Kraken bioinformatics tool against archaeal, bacterial and virus genome databases. The results of the alignments were visualized with the Krona tool. Results and Discussion: The presented case study helps the reader understand how metagenomic studies work and provides new professional insights into the microbiome of selected organs in different organisms. The ratios of different taxa provide insight into the gut microbial communities in diseased animals. In addition, a short review is presented to show the application possibilities of metagenomics in the field of animal health. Bioinformatics is an emerging field, and knowledge of the methods, possible implications, and limitations is essential for clinicians and researchers alike.

1053,Deep sequencing analysis reveals transient microbiota changes associated with the development of bovine digital dermatitis.,"Bovine digital dermatitis (DD) is the leading cause of lameness in dairy cattle worldwide. Despite 35 years of research, the exact etiologic agent associated with the disease process is still unknown. Previous studies have shown that multiple bacterial species are associated with the lesions, with spirochetes being the most reliably identified organism. This study details the deep sequencing metagenomic evaluation of 48 step DD biopsy specimens collected during a 3-year longitudinal study of disease progression. More than 175 million sequences were evaluated using both shotgun and 16S metagenomic techniques. According to the shotgun sequencing results, there was no evidence of fungal or DNA viral etiology. The bacterial microbiota of biopsy specimens progresses through a systematic series of changes associated with the new morphological lesion scoring system developed as part of this project. This scoring system was validated as the microbiota of each stage was statistically significantly different from the other stages (P<0.001). The microbiota of control biopsy specimens was very diverse and became less diverse as lesions developed. Although Treponema spp. predominant in advanced lesions, they were relatively low in newly identified early lesions associated with the onset of the disease process. Treponema spp consortium.

In two samples, viruses from Picobirnavirus and porcine astrovirus were also detected, while in one sample, viruses from the Torovirus strain were found positive. In addition to viral sequences, sequences from bacteria, archaea, nematode, Protista and amoeba were also detected in the samples examined.

1058,Virus terminology below the species level: a standard terminology for strains and virus variants adapted to laboratory animals assigned to the Filoviridae family,"The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) regulates the classification of viruses by taxa, but is not responsible for nomenclature for taxon members. International expert groups, such as the ICTV Working Groups, recommend classifying and naming viruses and their strains, varieties and isolates. The ICTV Filoviridae Working Group has recently presented an updated classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Later, and in collaboration with many other filovirus experts, a consistent nomenclature for native genetic variants and isolates was developed, aimed at simplifying the retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases. This is the first important step towards a viral genome annotation standard sought by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Here, this work has been extended to include in vitro-obtained filoviruses by artificial selection by passing them through laboratory hosts. Pre-developed template for native filovirus genetic variant naming (<virus name> <isolation host-suffix>/<country of sampling>/<sampling year>/<genetic variant assignment>-<isolate assignment>) is preserved, but variants adapted to laboratory animals for adapting the type of information added to each field. For example, the full-length description of an Ebola virus Mayinga variant adapted from ""Vector"" at the State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center would be similar to ""Ebola virus VECTOR/C.porcellus-lab"" to cause disease in guinea pigs after seven passages. /COD/1976/Mayinga-GPA-P7"". We recommend using the full-length designation in databases and in the method section of publications, as recommended for names of native filovirus variants.

1060,Taxonomic rearrangement of the family Bornaviridae,"Knowledge about bornaviruses has expanded significantly over the past decade. A possible reservoir of mammalian Borna disease virus has been identified, different boraviruses have been detected in birds and reptiles, and endogenous boravirus-like elements have been discovered in the genomes of vertebrates of various species. Previous sequence comparisons and alignments have shown that members of the current Bornaviridae family are phylogenetically diverse and are not adequately classified in the current boravirus taxonomy supported by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV). We provide an update of these analyzes and describe their impact on classification. We propose to keep the family name Bornaviridae and the genus Bornavirus, but reorganize the species classification. PAirwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) of bornavirus genomes and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) comparison of genomic and protein sequences indicates that this genus should contain at least five species, in combination with other currently published phylogenetic analyzes and known biological characteristics of bornaviruses. : Mammalian 1 bornavirus (classical Borna disease virus and divergent Borna disease virus isolate No/98), Psittaciform 1 bornavirus (avian/psittacine bornaviruses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7), Passeriform 1 bornavirus (avian/canarybornaviruses C1, C2) , C3, LS), Passeriform 2 bornavirus (estrildid finch bornavirus EF) and Waterbird 1 bornavirus (avian bornavirus 062CG). This classification is also compatible with the biological characteristics of these viruses and their vertebrate hosts. A snake boravirus proposed to be designated Loveridge's garter snake virus 1 should be classified as a member of an additional species (Elapid 1 boravirus) not assigned to a genus in the family Bornaviridae. Avian bornaviruses 5, 6, MALL and another ""reptile bornavirus"" (""Gaboon viper virus"") should not be classified until further information is available.

1061,Reorganization and expansion of the nidoviral family Arteriviridae,"The Arteriviridae family currently includes a single Arterivirus genus. This genus includes four species as taxonomic homes for equine arthritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-raising virus (LDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), respectively. A revision of this classification is urgently needed to accommodate the latest description of eleven highly different simian arteriviruses in various African non-human primates, a novel arterivirus in an African forest giant opossum, and a new arterivirus in common brushtails in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus terminology does not conform to the latest version of the International Code for Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses. Here we outline an updated, modified and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence truncations are generated based on a newly constructed open reading frame 1b phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of coding-whole arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current Arterivirus genus has been replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDVÂ +Â PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFVÂ +Â simian arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for arterivirus from forest giant opossums) and Dipartevirus (common brushtail) arterivirus). The current strain Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus has been split into two strains to accommodate clear differences between the European and American PRRSV ""types"", both of which have now received virus status. The current strain Simian hemorrhagic fever virus has been subdivided into nine strains to accommodate the twelve known simian arteriviruses.

Genomic sequence information is limited for members of the Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, Qalyub, Sakhalin and Thiafora nairovirus species. To further characterize these species, we used next-generation sequencing and historical virus culture samples to identify 14 complete and nine coding-complete nairoviral genome sequences. Viruses not previously sequenced include the Abu Mina, Clo Mor, Great Saltee, Hughes, Raza, Sakhalin, Soldado, and Tillamook viruses. In addition, we present genomic sequence information on additional isolates of previously sequenced Avalon, Dugbe, Sapphire II and Zirqa viruses. Finally, we identified Tunisian virus, previously thought to be a phlebovirus, as an isolate of Abu Hammad virus. Phylogenetic analyzes indicate that Sapphire II virus should be reassigned to Dera Ghazi Khan nairovirus and Hazara, Tofla and Nairobi sheep disease viruses should be reassigned to new strains. We also propose new strains for the Kasokero group (Kasokero, Leopards Hill, Yogue viruses), the Ketarah group (Gossas, Issyk-kul, Keterah/soft tick viruses), and the Burana group (WÄ“nzhÅ u tick virus, HuàngpÃ). tick virus 1, TÇŽchéng tick virus 1).

1063,Incidence of endogenous viral genes and susceptibility or resistance to Marek's disease in two strains of white leghorn chickens selected for egg production,"Endogenous viral (ev) genes related to avian leukosis virus were classified in two differently selected Leghorn strains to investigate whether such genes affect production properties. The K strain was selected for resistance to Marek's disease (MD) and high egg production and egg weight, while the S strain was selected only for MD susceptibility. Except that the founders of the K strain included a few commercial birds, both strains were derived from a common genetic basis. DNA restriction fragment length analyzes of strain 110 K and strain 94 S revealed the presence of 8 different ev genes, 6 of which were identical to predefined loci. This result was confirmed by assays for group-specific antigen (gs-antigen), the product of the gag region of ev-genes. The gs-antigen levels in birds closely followed that estimated from data from the ev-genes described previously. Both strains had a similar average number of ev-genes per bird (3.5 and 3.2 for S and K strains, respectively). However, strain K carried only five different house genes while strain S carried seven. Four of these loci were present in both strains. Ev genes absent or less frequently occurring in strain K included those encoding either infectious endogenous virus (ev-10 and possibly ev-19) or internal viral plug proteins (ev-3). Only ev genes that are transcriptionally silent or encode the viral envelope gene were present with increasing frequency in the K lineage. The results show that selection for egg traits and/or resistance to Marek's disease reduces the frequency of endogenous producing house genes. virus or viral plug proteins.",,"Kuhnlein, U.;Gavora, J.

1064,Natural peste des petits ruminant virus infection: New pathological findings resembling other morbillivirus infections.,"In this study, pathological and virological findings were defined in 15 sheep and 6 goats who died from natural peste des petits ruminant virus infection in Turkey. Pathological findings included erosive ulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulation necroses in the liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in lymphoid tissues. Syncytial cells were particularly prominent in the oral mucosa, pulmonary alveoli, liver, and lymphoid tissues. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions were observed in epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and abomasal mucosa. Immunolabeling of the viral antigen was observed in myocytes of the kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart, and tongue, as well as in its more typical locations. In this study, the first peste des petits ruminants, which are endemic in Kırıkkale, Turkey's Central Anatolia Region, are reported and explained in detail. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathological findings in natural peste des petits ruminant virus infection provide a basis for similarity to other morbillivirus infections such as canine disease and disease of marine mammals. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyzes showed that the 448-bp genome fragment was amplified in 18 cases (18/21, 85.7%).

1065,Emergence of new reassortant H6N2 avian influenza viruses in ducks in India,"Recent reports of human infection by H6 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIV), common in terrestrial poultry, indicate that the virus has evolved into a possible pandemic strain. Here we report the antigenic and genetic characterization of two H6N2 viruses isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in Kerala and Assam, India in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The hemagglutination inhibition assay revealed antigenic divergence between the two isolates, supported by amino acid differences at 55 positions (15.98%) between hemagglutinin (HA). is pathogenic to poultry and susceptible to oseltamivir. However, Kerala14 had the V27I mutation marker for amantadine resistance in M2. Assam15 virus had an additional N-linked glycosylation on HA2 (position 557) compared to Kerala14 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that both viruses belonged to different lineages (Eurasian and Asian II). The phylogeny of neuraminidase and internal gene segments revealed that both viruses are novel reassortants and genetically distinct with different gene constellations. The results suggest the independent entry of two H6N2 viruses into India and migratory wild birds of the Central Asian transit route may be the source of H6N2 viruses in ducks in India. Therefore, continuous AIV surveillance in poultry and wild birds is essential for the early detection of the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential and the control of their spread.",,"Kumar, M.;Nagarajan, S.;Murugkar, H.

1067,Hepatitis E virus: current scenario,"Hepatitis E infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a common cause of acute hepatitis in developing countries with poor sanitation and hygiene. The virus is classified into one serotype and four genotypes (1-4). Genotypes 1 and 2 only infect humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 infect other animals, especially pigs. In endemic areas, large outbreaks of acute hepatitis caused by genotype 1 or 2 viruses often occur due to fecal-oral transmission, usually through contamination of drinking water. The disease is particularly severe (20-30% death) among pregnant women, with a high attack rate in young adults (ages 15-45). HEV appears to be a zoonotic disease by transmission from pigs, wild boars and deer or by foodborne transmission. Chronic infections are rare, except in immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients. A subunit vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease, but is not yet commercially available. Our understanding of HEV has undergone major changes in recent years, and in this article we review the available knowledge regarding the molecular biology, pathobiology, and epidemiology of HEV infection. We also review current therapeutic interventions and strategies used to control HEV infection, with emphasis on possible approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against HEV.

1069,Muscovy duck reovirus ÏƒC protein is atypically encoded by the smallest genome segment,"Although musk duck reovirus (DRV) shares characteristics with chicken isolated reovirus, commonly called avian reovirus (ARV), the two virus strains are antigenically different. Similar to the previously identified DRV ÏƒB-encoded gene (1201 bp in length), three other double-stranded RNA small genome segments of DRV were cloned and sequenced. They were 1325, 1191, and 1124 bp in length, respectively, and contained conserved terminal sequences common to ARVs. They coded for single expression products except the smallest (S4), which contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). BLAST analyzes revealed that proteins encoded by the 1325 and 1191 bp genes share high levels of identity with ARV ÏƒA and ÏƒNS, respectively, and to a lesser extent with their other orthreovirus counterparts. No homology was found for the p10 protein encoded by S4 ORF1. The 29.4 kDa product encoded by S4 ORF2 appeared to be 25% identical to ÏƒC encoded by ARV S1 ORF3, a cell attachment oligomer that induces type-specific neutralizing antibodies. The addition of large gaps in the N-terminal portion of the DRV protein was necessary to improve DRV and ARV ÏƒC amino acid sequence alignments. However, a leucine zipper motif was preserved and secondary structure analyzes predicted a three-stranded α-helix helix feature at this amino portion. Thus, despite extensive sequence variation, DRV ÏƒC has been suggested to be structurally and possibly functionally related to ARV ÏƒC. This study provides evidence for the diversity of polycistronic S class genes of reoviruses isolated from birds and raises the question of the relative classification of DRV in the Orthoreovirus genus.",,"Kuntz-Simon, G.;Le Gall-ReculÃ©, G.;de BoissÃ©son, C.;Jestin, V.",2002.0,,,0

Data on the microbiomes of these organisms are needed, as these ticks are abundant in the slums of major cities, agricultural areas, and popular tourist areas and frequently attack humans and animals. Using the metagenomic 16S profile, we evaluate bacterial communities associated with I. persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi and D. reticulatus ticks collected from the Novosibirsk region of Russia. A total of 1214 ticks were used for this study. DNA from ticks was pooled according to tick species and sex. Sequencing of the V3-V5 domains of 16S rRNA genes was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform. The following bacterial genera were common in the populations studied: Acinetobacter (all three tick species), Rickettsia (I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus), and Francisella (D. reticulatus). B. burgdorferi sensu lato and B. miyamotoi sequences were detected in I. persulcatus and I. pavlovskyi, but not in D. reticulatus ticks. Pooled samples of all studied tick species contained bacteria from the Anaplasmataceae family, although their occurrence was low. DNA from A. phagocytophilum and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was first observed in I. pavlovskyi ticks. Significant interspecies differences were observed in the number of bacterial taxa and in-species diversity due to tick sex. Bacterial communities associated with I. pavlovskyi ticks showed a higher biodiversity compared to I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus ticks. Bacterial community structure was also diverse among tick species studied, as demonstrated by permutational analysis of variance using the Bray-Curtis difference metric (p = 0.002). Inter-sex variation was confirmed by the PERMANOVA test in I. persulcatus (p = 0.042) and I. pavlovskyi (p = 0.042) ticks.

The relationship between initial and recurrent viruses is unclear. To determine the molecular epizootiology of recurrent LPAI, we performed phylogenetic analysis with partial nucleotide sequences of four gene segments (HA, NA, NP and PB2) from eight chicken-derived H9N2 viruses. Recurrent H9N2 viruses showed higher nucleotide similarity to 1996 Korean isolates in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes than other Eurasian viruses and formed a separate cluster with early Korean isolates and some isolates from migratory and domesticated ducks in Japan and China. Phylogenetic analysis with internal genes showed that some Korean isolates form a cluster in China and Taiwan with other subtypes such as H5N1, H6N1 and H6N2.

1077,Different vaccination routes affect infectivity and pathogenesis of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection in chickens and domestic ducks.,"H5N1 type A influenza viruses, classified as Qinghai-like virus (section 2.2), are a unique strain of type A influenza viruses with the capacity to produce significant morbidity and mortality in gallinaceous and anseriform birds, including domestic and wild ducks. The aim of this study was to determine the pathogenesis and susceptibility of chickens and domestic ducks to the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/224/05 (H5N1) when administered via the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. Chickens and ducks were more susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus when exposed intranasally compared to ingestion routes (intragastric or orally fed infected chicken meat), as evidenced by low infectious and lethal viral doses. In the ingestion exposure pathogenesis study, pathological changes associated with virus detection included hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation. These changes were generally observed in most of the internal organs of chickens 2 to 4 days after inoculation (DPI) and are similar to the lesions and virus localization seen in birds in natural cases or in experimental studies performed intranasally. Dietary exposure to the virus caused systemic infection in ducks characterized by moderate lymphocytic encephalitis, necrotizing hepatitis and pancreatitis, and a corresponding virus was demonstrated in the lesions. In ingested chickens and ducks, lesions, virus or both were first demonstrated in the upper digestive tract at 1 DPI, suggesting that the digestive tract is the first site affected by the consumption of infected meat or gavage of the virus in liquid medium. . However, as demonstrated in the infectivity study in chickens, nutritional infection required higher exposure doses to establish infection in chickens compared to intranasal exposure. These data suggest that upper respiratory exposure to H5N1 HPAI virus in birds results in viral infection and transmission more than consumption of infected meat unless it contains high doses of virus, as in cannibalized infected carcasses.

1078,Virological Surveillance and Pre-Antigenic Characterization of Influenza Viruses in Pigs in Five European Countries from 2006 to 2008,"This study presents the results of virological surveillance for swine flu viruses (SIVs) in Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain from 2006 to 2008. Our main aims were to clarify the emergence of the three SIV subtypes - H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2. - at regional levels, to identify novel reassortant viruses and antigenically compare SIVs with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from acute respiratory disease outbreaks in pigs were investigated by virus isolation. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of a total of 169 viruses, 81 were classified as 'bird-like' H1N1, 36 as human-like H3N2 and 47 as human-like H1N2. Only five new reasortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human-like HA and three H1N2 viruses had a bird-like HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were found in England and Northwest France. Cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests against selected ancient and novel human influenza viruses with hyperimmune sera showed a strong antigenic association between human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and H1N2 and H3N2 human-like SIVs, confirming their common origin.

Different reassortants of the pandemic ""swine"" H1N1 influenza A vaccine (121XP, X-179A and X-181) viruses, as well as wild-type A/California/07/2009(H1N1) and A/PR/8/34 strains, embryonated eggs and DNA/ RNA is used for Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq sequencing. The RNA sequences of these viruses, published in NCBI, were used as reference for alignment of sequencing reads generated in this study. The consensus sequences of these viruses differed from the NCBI-accumulated sequences at a few nucleotides. The 121XP stock obtained by reverse genetics was more heterogeneous than the X-179A and X-181 stocks prepared by conventional reassortant technology. Passaged 121XP virus contained four non-synonymous mutations in the HA gene. One of these mutations (Lys226Glu) was located in the Ca antigenic region of HA (18% of the population). Two non-synonymous mutations were present in the HA of X-179A-derived viruses: Pro314Gln (18%) and Asn146Asp (78%). The last mutation in the Sa antigenic site was also detected at a low level (11%) in wild-type A/California/07/2009(H1N1) virus and was present as a complete substitution in derived X-181 viruses. From the X-179A virus. In the inherited X-181 viruses, two mutations occurred in HA: a silent mutation A1398G (31%) in one group and G756T (Glu252Asp, 47%) in another group. The last mutation was located in the conservative region of the antigenic region Ca. The RNA sequencing protocol was found to be robust, reproducible, and suitable for monitoring the genetic consistency of influenza vaccine seed stocks.",,"Laassri, M.;Zagorodnyaya, T.;Plant, E.

1080,Genomic and phylogenetic characterization of viruses in the Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes of the Bunyaviridae family Orthobunyavirus genus.,"comprehensive characterization of the genetic diversity of viruses found in vector and vertebrate host populations is essential for the early detection and response of emerging pathogenic viruses, but genetic characterization of many important viral groups remains incomplete. The Simbu serogroup of the Orthobunyavirus genus, the Bunyaviridae family is an example. The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important animal species. Here, we report the complete genome sequences for 11 viruses in this group, focusing on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and binary divergence analyzes demonstrated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, at the same level as seen among the other five species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported divergence thresholds between species, the data suggested that these two complexes should in fact be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic branch apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence differences between viruses of this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to levels of difference between other orthobunyavirus serogroups. The genetic data also suggested relatively high levels of natural reclassification, with three potential reclassification events, including two well-supported events involving viruses known to infect humans.",,"Ladner, J.

CaPV infections produce similar symptoms in sheep and goats, and the three viruses are serologically indistinguishable. As there are conflicting views on the host specificity of CaPVs, particularly for goat pox and sheep pox viruses, the development of rapid genotyping tools will facilitate more accurate disease diagnosis and surveillance for better management of capripox outbreaks.

1088,Bird flu - Commercial poultry elimination still not visible,"Avian influenza viruses are highly contagious microorganisms that primarily affect birds. However, it has also been isolated from a number of mammals, including humans. Avian influenza virus can cause great economic losses in the poultry industry due to its high mortality. Although there are pathogenic variants that are low virulence and usually cause only mild clinical symptoms, the H5 and H7 subtypes can mutate into a low to highly virulent (pathogenic) virus and should be considered in eradication strategies. The primary source of infection for commercial poultry is direct and indirect contact with waterfowl and wild birds, which form a natural reservoir of the virus. Live poultry markets, exotic birds and ostriches also play an important role in the epidemiology of avian influenza. Secondary transmission of avian influenza virus (i.e. between poultry farms) is primarily attributed to fomites and humans. Airborne transmission is also important, and the virus can spread in humans via aerosol. Diagnostic tests detect viral proteins and genes. Virus-specific antibodies can be monitored by serological testing, where virus isolation and identification are complementary procedures. The number of bird flu outbreaks seems to be increasing - outbreaks have been reported in Italy, Hong Kong, Chile, Netherlands, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, China, Pakistan in the last 5 years, United States, Canada, Southern Africa and Malaysia. In addition, increasing numbers of human, in some cases fatal, avian flu cases have paralleled outbreaks in commercial poultry. There are great concerns about the possibility of a new virus subtype with pandemic potential emerging from these outbreaks. For human health, eradication of the virus from poultry is essential; however, the large number of small poultry holdings, the lack of control experience and resources, and the international scale of transmission and infection make rapid control and long-term prevention of relapses extremely difficult. In the western world, renewed interest in free-range housing poses a threat to future epidemics. Increasing ethical objections to the massive slaughter of birds require a different approach to bird flu eradication.",,"Landman, W. J. M.;Schrier, C. C.",2004.0,,,0
1089,Three new canine papillomaviruses promote taxonomic cord formation,"More than 100 human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been identified and their entire genomes sequenced. Most of these HPVs can be classified into three different genera: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-papilloma viruses (PVs). It should be noted that only one or few PVs have been identified for each animal species. However, four canine PVs (CPV) (COPV, CPV2, CPV3, and CPV4) have been identified and their entire genomic sequences published. Based on their sequence similarities, they belong to three different clades. In this study, circular viral DNA was amplified from three dogs showing signs of pigmented plaques, endophytic papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Analysis of DNA sequences revealed that these are three novel viruses (CPV5, CPV6 and CPV7) whose genomes contain all conserved sequence elements of known PVs. The genomes of these seven CPVs were compared to classify them appropriately. Interestingly, binary sequence alignments of putative amino acid sequences as well as phylogenetic analyzes revealed that CPV5 grouped well with CPV3 and CPV4, while CPV7 grouped with CPV2, but neither group matched with other classified PVs. However, CPV6 is grouped with COPV, a lambda-PV. Based on this evidence, the division of CPVs into three distinct categories can therefore be supported. Thus, similar to HPVs, it may be that known and currently unknown CPVs are related and form only a few branches or genera. © 2009 SGM.",,"Lange, C. E.;Tobler, K.;Ackermann, M.;Panakova, L.;Thoday, K.

In this review, we focus on therapeutic approaches to several of the more important tick-borne viruses from these 3 families. These viruses are the newly discovered tick-borne phleboviruses known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) and thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), Heartland virus and Bhanja virus from the Bunyaviridae family, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Powassan virus.

The 'One World, One Health' perspective provides us with an ideal framework for understanding and potentially reducing the spread of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate change on the island contribute to more frequent contact between humans, livestock and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen spread events. Madagascar's long geographic isolation, combined with the recent and repeated introduction of agriculture and invasive species, is likely to remain uncharacterized by a number of circulating pathogens in lemur populations. Therefore, the application of new approaches for de novo pathogen discovery is imperative. To this end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from two critically endangered wild lemur species (Indri indri and Propithecus diadema) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results demonstrate several unidentified vector-borne parasites circulating in lemurs, some of which can cause disease in wildlife, livestock and humans.

To investigate the diversity of deltacoronavirus in animals in the Middle East, we tested fecal samples from 1,356 mammals and birds in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Four new deltacoronaviruses from eight birds from four species were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR): FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a wild boar, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE -HKU30 from five quails . Complete genome sequencing showed that FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 belong to the same CoV species, suggesting recent interspecies crossing, possibly along the food chain, between hawks and their prey, rose hips and pigeons. Western blot detected specific anti-FalCoV UAE-HKU27 antibodies in 33 (75%) of 44 hawk serum samples, supporting true infection in hawks after virus acquisition. QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 belongs to the same CoV species as the swine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and the sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), previously discovered in pigs and tree sparrows, and supports bird-to-swine transmission. Recombination involving spike protein is common among deltacoronaviruses, which can facilitate interspecies transmission. FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28, and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 originated from recombination between white eye coronavirus HKU16 (WECoV HKU16) and magpie robin coronavirus HKU18 (MRCoV HKU18), QuaCoV UAE-HKU30, PorCoV HKU15/SpCoV HKU17. and munia coronavirus HKU13 (MunCoV HKU13) and PorCoV HKU15 from the recombination between SpCoV HKU17 and bulbul coronavirus HKU11 (BuCoV HKU11). Birds in the Middle East are host to a variety of deltacoronaviruses with potential for interspecies transmission.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In an attempt to explore the diversity of deltacoronavirus among mammals and birds in Dubai, four novel deltacoronaviruses were detected in stool samples from eight of them. four different species of birds: FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a wild boar, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from five quails. Genome analysis has revealed evidence of recent interspecies crossing between hawks and their prey, rosehips and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as transmission from birds to pigs. Recombination, known to occur frequently in some coronaviruses, was also common among these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly in the spike region. Such recombination involving receptor binding protein may contribute to the emergence of new viruses that can infect new hosts. Birds in the Middle East are home to a variety of deltacoronaviruses with potential for interspecies transmission.",,"Lau, S. K. P.;Wong, E. Y. M.;Tsang, C. C.;Ahmed, S. S.;Au-Yeung, R. K.

1097,Chickens harbor a variety of picornaviruses resulting from potential interspecies transmission by recombination,"While chickens are an important reservoir for emerging pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, little is known about the diversity of picornaviruses in poultry. We discovered a previously unknown variety of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected by reverse transcription-PCR in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens, and their partial 3Dpol gene sequences formed five different clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades, including six new picornavirus strains (ChPV1, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from clade II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from clade III, ChGV1 from clade IV) and one extant strain (Avian encephalomyelitis virus). revealed seven different picornaviruses. from clade V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes display distinct phylogenetic positions and genome features from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Furthermore, ChPV1 could potentially belong to a new genus with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, particularly in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. However, these new picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses of other avian species (Paserivirus A-associated ChPV1, ChPV2 and ChPV3, Avisivirus A and Duck hepatitis A virus, ChPV4 and ChPV5, Melegrivirus A, ChGV1 to Gallivirus A). Also, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus with P2 and P3 regions, possibly originating from Melegrivirus A. Chickens are an important reservoir for a variety of picornaviruses that can cross the barriers of avian species through mutation or recombination. Â© 2014 Authors.",,"Lau, S. K. P.;Woo, P. C.

Knowledge of the diversity of viromes found in reservoir species could lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens. In this study, we expand knowledge of astrovirus diversity in pigs by reporting the genetic characterization of an unknown astrovirus lineage. Phylogenetic analyzes provided evidence that this porcine astrovirus lineage is unique and does not share a recent common ancestor with any known mamastrovirus.

1099,Molecular variation in the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleoprotein gene (ORF7),"The nucleoprotein gene (ORF7) of 15 European isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was sequenced and compared with the corresponding sequences of other PRRSV isolates (2 European and 13 American) and one isolate other arteriviruses (lactate dehydrogenase elevation). virus (LDV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and equine arthritis virus (EAV). Phylogenetic relationships were established using neighbor aggregation and thrift methods. Four lineages (PRRSV, LDV, SHFV and EAV) were distinguished. Two more PRRSV genotypes, European and American, can be identified. The European genotype of PRRSV is highly conserved. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in PRRSV ORF7 revealed four stable regions that are conserved, likely due to requirements for nucleocapsid function and/or structure. No fixed accumulation of mutations in ORF7 could be pinpointed when studying synonymous or nonsynonymous mutations. In vivo passage of European PRRSV had little effect on the ORF7 sequence: only a small number of synonymous substitutions could be detected in ORF7, confirming its low variability.

1101,Molecular characterization of serotype A foot and mouth disease viruses circulating in Vietnam in 2009.,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is the main cause of endemic outbreaks in Vietnam in recent years. In this study, six serotype A foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV) collected from endemic outbreaks in four different provinces of Vietnam in January and February 2009 were genetically characterized for their whole genome sequences. Genetic analysis based on the complete viral genome sequence showed that they are closely related and share 99.0-99.8% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic and inferred aa analysis of the capsid-encoding gene VP1 showed that all six Vietnamese strains were classified in genotype IX out of a total of 10 major genotypes worldwide and shared 98.1-100% aa identity with each other. They were closely related to type A strains most recently isolated in Laos (A/LAO/36/2003, A/LAO/1/2006, A/LAO/6/2006, A/LAO/7/2006 and A/LAO). /8/2006), Thailand (A/TAI/2/1997 and A/TAI/118/1987) and Malaysia (A/MAY/2/2002) share 88.3-95.5% nucleotide (nt) identities. In contrast, Vietnamese type A strains showed low nt identities of 77.3% to 80%, with two old type A FMDVs isolated in Thailand in 1960 (a15thailand iso43) and in 1975 in the Philippines (aphilippines iso50). It showed IDs ranging from 9. A multiple alignment based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the gene encoding Type A FMDV capsid VP1 revealed three amino acid substitutions between strains of Vietnam and strains from other Southeast Asian countries (Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines). Alanine was replaced with valine at residue 24, asparagine with arginine at residue 85, and threonine with serine at residue 196.

1102,Heterogeneity and genetic variation of serotypes O and Asia 1 isolated in Vietnam.,"Six field foot and mouth disease viruses (FMDVs), including four serotype O and two serotype Asia 1 strains, were collected from endemic outbreaks in 2005, 2006 and 2007 from four different provinces in Vietnam. Viruses were isolated and genetically characterized for their complete genomic sequences. Genetic analysis based on whole genomic coding sequences revealed that the four serotype O FMDVs are related, sharing 95.2% nucleotide (nt) identity and 97.5-97.6% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic analysis and a phylogenetic tree based on the VP1 gene of FMDV showed that the four extant Vietnamese serotype O strains had a high level of identity with other serotype O representatives of the Mya-98 lineage of the Southeast Asian (SEA) topotype. All four viruses clustered in the Mya-98 lineage of the SEA topotype, sharing 92.3-95.6% nt and 93.4-96.7% aa identity. This finding of the Mya-98 lineage differed from previous reports that Vietnamese serotype O strains belonged to the Cam-94 strain of SEA topotype and two other topotypes, Middle East-South Asian (ME-SA) and Cathay. For the two serotypes Asia 1 FMDV, genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences as well as the VP1 gene revealed that they belonged to two genogroups, IV and V. Genogroup V, isolated in 2007, was very closely related to the pandemic Asia 1 strain that caused FMD outbreaks in 2005 in China (Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, FJ906802) and Mongolia (Asia1/MOG/05, EF614458). and shared 99.0. -99.3% nt and 99.5-100% aa identity. In contrast, the second strain As1/VN/LC04/2005 of genogroup IV isolated in 2005, all referenced Vietnam serotype Asia 1 strains found in GenBank databases, sharing 86.4-100% nt and 90.9-100% aa. was closely associated with identity with each.

1104,Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of H9N2 Korean avian influenza viruses and evaluation of the pathogenic potential of isolate MS96.,"Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of five Korean isolates of H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) showed that these viruses were closely related and likely originated from the same source. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 subunit of H9 subtype isolates revealed that Korean AIV isolates differ from isolates in the Hong Kong poultry markets in 1997. None of the Korean AIVs had multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site that conferred high pathogenicity on some of them. H5 and H7 AIVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleoprotein and matrix gene showed that Korean isolates clustered with AIVs of Eurasian origin. The pathogenic potential of one of the isolates (MS96) was evaluated after several passages in 14-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). The fourteen-day ECE derivatives of MS96 showed increased HA titer in eggs and embryo mortality; this was evident after the third pass in the 14-day ECE. Sequence analysis of the cleavage site of MS96 after passages three and ten in the 14-day ECE showed no changes in the amino acid sequence. Pathogenicity of MS96 after the tenth passage in 14-day-old eggs (MS96p10(ECE14)) was tested with 4-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens. The 14-day derivative MS96p10(ECE14) showed greater tissue tropism than the parent virus and caused more severe clinical manifestations. In addition, after intranasal vaccination of 86-week broiler breeders and 30-week layers, the MS96p10(ECE14) derivative caused more severe depression symptoms than the parent virus and a temporary decrease in egg production.",,"Lee, C.

1106,Characterization of low pathogenicity H5 and H7 Korean avian influenza viruses in chickens,"To date, all isolated highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses that cause systemic infection with high mortality in poultry species are known to belong to either the H5 or H7 subtypes. HPAI viruses may arise due to the addition of multiple basic amino acids to the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein after administration of low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses to poultry. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic characteristics of H5 (n = 4) and H7 (n = 3) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses isolated from wild birds in Korea using the nucleotide sequences of all 8 gene segments. viral genome. We also evaluated the infectivity, contagiousness and pathogenic potential of these viruses in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all viruses used in the study clustered in the Eurasian lineage and were similar to viruses isolated in Asian countries sharing the East Asian-Australian migratory bird flight path. Our H5N2 isolates cannot be reproduced and transmitted in chickens, but H7N8 isolates can be reproduced efficiently and transmitted to exposed chickens. Furthermore, as our H7N8 isolates cause watery diarrhea in chickens, these viruses not only serve as progenitors of new strains of HPAI but also potentially cause clinical disease in poultry. Although there have been no reports of LPAI mutations in HPAI in these regions, wild bird surveillance studies should focus on monitoring the introduction and transmission of HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5 and H7 viruses.

1113,"Genome sequence of the pitchfork-like disease virus, a yatapoxvirus","The genome sequence of Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), an unclassified member of the Yabaxvirus genus, has been determined. Excluding terminal hairpin rings, the YLDV genome is 144,575 bp long and contains 1883 bp of inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). Within 20 nucleotides of the terminal is a sequence conserved in other poxviruses that is required for resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that are 180 nucleotides in length or conserved in other smallpox viruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed towards the terminals, while ORFs in the central region of the genome are encoded in both DNA strands. In the central region, ORFs have a conserved position, orientation and sequence compared to vaccinia virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors or structural proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more distinct and have no counterpart in other smallpox viruses in seven cases. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; Examples include two proteins with affinity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with affinity to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a type I interferon-binding protein.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that chicken-adapted H9N2 viruses (A/chicken/Korea/96006/96 [CK/Kor/96006-like]) acquired aquatic avian gene segments by reclassification, and that these reclassified H9N2 viruses were detected more frequently in small poultry species. put it. more than industrial poultry. Conversely, gene segments from viruses such as CK/Kor/96006 were also detected in most viruses from domestic ducks. Interestingly, domestic ducks rather than wild waterfowl harbored close relatives of all eight gene segments of the H3N2 CIV that prefer to bind to bird receptors. Therefore, it is assumed that bi-directional viral transmission events occur between terrestrial and aquatic poultry, particularly within the non-industrial poultry system. These events contributed to the production of a new reassortant, H3N2 CIV.

Using high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP), we determined the vRNA binding profiles of NP for two H1N1 IAV strains in virions. Contrary to the current vRNA packaging model, NP does not bind vRNA uniformly in strains A/WSN/1933 and A/California/07/2009, instead each vRNA segment exhibits a unique binding profile that includes enriched or weak sites. In the NP association. Surprisingly, both H1N1 strains have similar but different NP binding profiles despite extensive sequence conservation. The peaks identified by HITS-CLIP were confirmed as true NP binding sites based on insensitivity to DNA antisense oligonucleotide-mediated RNase H digestion. Furthermore, nucleotide content analysis of NP peaks revealed that these regions are relatively G-rich and U-poor compared to genome-wide nucleotide content, indicating a yet unidentified sequence bias for NP association in vivo.

This study aimed to use high-throughput sequencing technology to determine the complete genomic sequence of the live attenuated vaccine strain of ILTV. Results: The complete genomic sequence of the Serva vaccine strain of ILTV was determined, annotated and compared with the combined ILTV reference sequence. The genome size of the Serva strain was 152,628 bp with a G+C content of 48%. A total of 80 predicted open reading frames were identified. The Serva strain had 96.5% DNA sequence identity with the assembled ILTV sequence. Notably, the assembled ILTV sequence was found to lack four major sequence regions, including two copies of a 1,563 bp sequence in the 528 bp and 594 bp sequences and repeat regions in the UL29 and UL36 genes, respectively. Significant differences in the size of the predicted translation products of 4 other genes (UL54, UL30, UL37 and UL38) were also identified. More than 530 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified. Most SNPs were located within three genomic regions corresponding to the sequence from the SA-2 ILTV vaccine strain in the ordered ILTV sequence. Results: This is the first complete genomic sequence of a single ILTV lineage. This sequence will facilitate future comparative genomic studies of ILTV by providing a suitable reference sequence for sequence analysis of other ILTV strains. © 2011 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Lee, S.

1120,Dicer-2- and Piwi-mediated RNA interference in mosquito cells infected with Rift Valley fever virus,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae) transmitted by mosquitoes. It infects humans and ruminants, causing dramatic epidemics and epizootics in Africa, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Although recent studies have demonstrated the importance of non-structural protein NSs as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about the infection of mosquito vectors. Here, we examined RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines: Aag2 cells from Aedes aegypti and U4.4 and C6/36 cells from Aedes albopictus. In contrast to mammalian cells, where NSs form nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NSs expression such that NSs filaments never formed in the nucleus of U4.4 cells and were lost early post-infection in the case of Aag2 cells. In contrast, in C6/36 cells, nuclear filaments of NSs were visible for the entire duration of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing showed very low viRNA production in C6/36 cells known to be Dicer-2 deficient but expressing some viRNAs presenting a Piwi signature. In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced large amounts of viRNA that predominantly matched the S segment and showed signatures of Dicer-2 and Piwi. While 21-nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were prominent during early infection, the population of 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNAs (piRNAs) gradually increased and later became predominant during acute infection and persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined actions of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways triggered an effective antiviral response, which, among other actions, allowed the suppression of filament formation of NSs and the establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared sufficient to elicit an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a super-infecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.",,"Leger, P.;Lara, E.;Jagla, B.;Sismeiro, O.;Mansuroglu, Z.;Coppee, J.

1121,To investigate the contribution of bacteriophages to antibiotic resistance,"Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on our planet. They infect susceptible bacterial hosts in which they reproduce or persist. In the latter case, phages can give new functions to their hosts as a result of gene transfer, thus contributing to their adaptation (short-term) and evolution (long-term). In this context, the role of phages in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial hosts in natural environments has not yet been clearly resolved. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of thirty-three viromes from different habitats to investigate whether phages harbor ARGs. Our results show that human-associated viromes do not or rarely carry ARGs, suggesting that viromes from non-human sources (e.g. pig feces, raw sewage, and freshwater and marine environments) contain a large reservoir of ARGs, thus suggesting that phages can play. part of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Given this, the role of phages should not be underestimated and should be taken into account when designing strategies to tackle the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.",,"Lekunberri, I.;Subirats, J.;Borrego, C.

1123,Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression from recombinant vectors indicate that the binding protein G of bovine respiratory syncytial virus differs from that of human respiratory syncytial virus.,"Bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus causes a severe lower respiratory tract disease in calves, similar to the disease in children caused by human respiratory syncytial (HRS) virus. Although there is antigenic cross-reactivity among other major viral structural proteins, the major glycoprotein G of BRS virus and that of HRS virus are antigenically different. G glycoprotein has been implicated as the binding protein for the HRS virus. We performed a molecular comparison of the glycoprotein G of the BRS virus with its HRS virus counterparts. CDNA clones corresponding to BRS virus G glycoprotein mRNA were isolated and analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. BRS virus G mRNA contained 838 nucleotides excluding poly(A) and had a large open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BRS virus G polypeptide showed only 29-30% amino acids with either subgroup A or B HRS virus G protein. However, despite this low level of identity, there were strong similarities in the predicted hydropathy profiles of the BRS virus and HRS virus G proteins. A cDNA molecule containing the complete BRS virus G major open reading frame was inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of the vaccine virus by homologous recombination, and a recombinant virus containing the BRS virus G protein gene was isolated. This recombinant virus expressed BRS virus G protein as demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence of infected cells. BRS virus G protein expressed from the recombinant vector was transplanted and expressed on the surface of infected cells. Antiserum of BRS virus G protein made using recombinant vector to immunize animals recognized BRS virus binding protein but not HRS virus G protein and vice versa, confirming the absence of antigenic cross-reactivity between BRS and HRS virus binding proteins. Based on the data presented here, we conclude that BRS virus should be classified within the genus Pneumovirus in a separate group from HRS virus and that it is not more closely related to HRS virus subgroup A than HRS virus subgroup B.",,"Lerch, R.

1124,Real-time PCR for simultaneous detection and genotyping of bovine viral diarrhea virus,"Since Belgian herds have two genotypes of bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV), their differentiation is important for disease surveillance. A quantitative real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect and classify bovine viral diarrheal viruses of genotypes I and II. A pair of primers and two TaqMan probes specific to the highly conserved regions of the 5â€²UTR were designed. The FAM and VIC labeled probe sequences differed by three nucleotides, allowing differentiation between genotypes I and II. The assay detectability of the genotype I and II real-time PCR assay was 1000 and 100 replicates, respectively. Highly reproducible data were obtained as the coefficients of variation of the threshold cycle values between studies were less than 2.2%. Accurate classification of genotypes I and II viruses was evaluated using reference strains of both genotypes and characterized field isolates. Application to clinical diagnosis was evaluated on pooled blood samples by post-study measurement of fluorescence associated with FAM and VIC. 100% agreement with the traditional RT-PCR method confirmed that this new technique can be used for routine detection of permanently infected immuno-tolerant animals.

1125,Detection and genotyping of bovine diarrhea virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain amplification of the 5' untranslated region,"reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to distinguish bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses and to determine the genotype of BVDV isolates. For this purpose, primer pairs were selected in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). Primers B(E) and B2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus specific. Two primer pairs, B3B4 and B5B6, were specific for BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with primer pairs B3B4 or B5B6 for the 107 BVDV isolates tested, but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates grouped into genotype II, sequence analysis of PCR fragments confirmed that they were classified according to this genotype.",,"Letellier, C.;Kerkhofs, P.;Wellemans, G.;Vanopdenbosch, E.",1999.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(98)00267-3,0
1126,Avian Influenza Virus Surveillance in Wild Birds in Georgia: 2009-2011,"Located on the border of Europe and Asia, the Caucasus is important for the migration and overwintering of wild waterfowl. Three flight paths, Central Asia, East Africa-West Asia and Mediterranean/Black Sea flight paths, converge in the Caucasus region. Therefore, the Caucasus region can act as a migration bridge for influenza virus transmission when it collects in high concentrations during post-breeding, migration and wintering periods of birds. Since August 2009, we have established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds using five sample sites geographically spread across suitable habitats in both eastern and western Georgia. We obtained paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh stool samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 bird orders, 84 of which were real-time RT-PCR positive for avian influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were detected. The overall prevalence of AIV was 1.6%. We observed the highest prevalence (5.3-9.8%) in great gulls during autumn migration, and the highest prevalence (4.2-13%) in Black-Headed Gulls in spring. In ducks, we observed an increased prevalence of AIV in autumn post-molt aggregations and in the cessation period (6.3%), but at lower levels than in other post-molt regions further north in Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak during the wintering period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological monitoring of the breeding colony of Armenian Gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive upon arrival at the breeding colony, but remained negative for AIV serologically and virologically, unlike other geographic gull AIV data, during the time the brood spent in the breeding grounds. regions. We show that close phylogenetic relatives of viruses isolated in Georgia originate from a wide geographic area throughout Western and Central Eurasia, and likely from areas represented by multiple distinct migration pathways linking different host subpopulations. © 2013 Lewis et al.",,"Lewis, N.

1127,Evolution of the foot-and-mouth disease virus: effects of recombination and selection,"Foot and mouth disease virus is an economically important animal virus that exhibits extensive genetic and antigenic heterogeneity. In order to examine the evolutionary forces affecting the population dynamics of the foot-and-mouth disease virus, individual genes and coding genomes for Eurasian (Asia1, A, C and O) serotypes were examined in terms of phylogenetic relationships, recombination, genetic diversity. and choice. Our analyzes suggest that paraphyletic relationships between serotypes are not as common as previously suggested and that convergent evolution may obscure phylogenetic relationships. We provide evidence that the identification of recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoint patterns between and within serotypes is highly dependent on the level of genetic diversity and convergent characters found in a given dataset, as well as the methods used to detect recombination. Here, we also investigate the effect of adaptive positive selection on capsid proteins and nonstructural 2B, 2C, 3A and 3Cpro genes to identify regions of the genome involved in genetic diversity and antigenic diversity. Two different categories of positive selection at the amino acid level were examined; conservative (stabilizing) selection that preserves certain phenotypic properties of an amino acid residue and radical (stabilizer), and selection that significantly alters the phenotype and potentially the functional and/or structural properties of the protein. Approximately 29% of the residues in the capsid proteins were under positive selection. Of these, 64% were under the influence of destabilizing selection, 80% were under the influence of stabilizing selection, and 44% had phenotypic traits affected by both types of selection. Most of the residues under selection (74%) were located outside of known antigenic regions; suggestive of additional uncharacterized epitopes and genomic regions related to antigenic drift.

1128,Close association between 2009 H1N1 virus and South Dakota AIV strains,"Although previous publications have suggested that the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was reclassified from swine viruses in North America and Eurasia, its close ancestry still remains unclear due to the large evolutionary distance between the 2009 H1N1 virus and previously isolated strains. Since the emergence of 2009 H1N1 influenza, there has been great interest in influenza, with the result that large numbers of influenza virus sequences have been deposited in public sequence databases. Explosion analysis showed that the recently presented 2007 South Dakota avian influenza virus strains and other North American avian strains contain genetic segments very closely related to the 2009 H1N1 virus; this suggests that these avian influenza viruses are very close relatives of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Phylogenetic analyzes also show that 2009 H1N1 viruses are related to both avian and swine flu viruses circulating in North America. Because migrating wild birds are preferred to pigs as carriers for spreading influenza viruses over great distances, it is very likely that birds played an important role in the intercontinental evolution of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Understanding the evolutionary path of the emerging influenza virus is essential to find a way to prevent emerging cases. This study reveals the close relationship between the 2009 pandemic virus and North American avian viruses and highlights the increased surveillance of influenza in birds to understand the evolution of 2009 pandemic influenza.

Its high occurrence could pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes that result in the emergence and spread of PCV3 are poorly understood. Here, the possible origin, genotypes and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 are determined based on available genomic sequences. The closest ancestor of PCV3 was found to be within 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two main genotypes were identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. The effective population size of PCV3 was found to increase rapidly from late 2013 to early 2014, and this was associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproduction number (Re) and higher evolution rate were found compared to other single-stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection was identified on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2). It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, may have allowed PCV3 to evade the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",,"Li, G.;He, W.;Zhu, H.;Bi, Y.;Wang, R.;Xing, G.;Zhang, C.;Zhou, J.;Yuen, K.

The identified genes were named UL1, UL2, UL3, UL4, UL5, UL6 and UL7 homologues of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). DEV UL3.5, located between UL3 and UL4, had no homologue in HSV-1. The regulation and transcriptional orientation of the eight genes were in line with their homologues in HSV-1. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the alignment of the deduced amino acids of the eight proteins with their homologues in 12 alpha-herpesviruses. In the UL1, UL3, UL3.5, UL5 and UL7 protein trees, branches were more closely related to the Mardivirus genus. However, phylogenetic trees of UL2, UL4 and UL6 proteins showed a great distance from Mardivirus; this indicates that DEV evolved differently from other viruses in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and formed a single branch within this subfamily.

1132,"Characterization of genes encoding UL24, TK and gH proteins from duck enteritis virus (DEV): an evidence for DEV classification","Duck enteritis virus (DEV) has been classified in the family Herpesviridae, but has not been grouped in any genus so far. The four overlapping fragments were amplified from the DEV genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The combined length of the four fragments was 6202 bp, containing genes encoding uniquely long (UL) 24, thymidine kinase (TK) and glycoprotein H (gH) proteins. UL24 overlapped with TK by 64 nucleotides (nt) in a head-to-head transcription orientation, and TK and gH had the same transcription orientation. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these 3 derived DEV proteins with 12 other alphaherpes viruses showed 5 highly conserved sites in UL24 as well as 5 consensus sites in TK and 4 consensus sites in gH. RNA polymerase II transcriptional control elements were identified in all UL24, TK and gHs of DEV. These elements included core promoters, TATA motifs and polyadenylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis was calculated for the genetic classification of DEV in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae along with 12 other alphaherpes viruses. The result showed that DEV was more closely associated with avian herpes viruses other than infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) than with other alphaherpes viruses. In conclusion, according to the phylogeny-based analysis and homology comparison of the functional domains of UL24, TK and gH, DEV should be classified into a separate genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily in the family Herpesviridae. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Li, H.;Liu, S.;Kong, X.",2006.0,,10.1007/s11262-005-0060-6,0

This study attempts to address the underlying secondary mechanisms after H9N2 AIV infection. Initially, nine-day-old specific pathogen-free chickens were divided into control (uninfected) and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Using Illumina sequencing, histological examination, and quantitative real-time PCR, H9N2 AIV was found to cause intestinal microbiota disruption, injury, and inflammatory damage to the intestinal mucosa. Escherichia genus in particular, especially E. coli, increased significantly (p < 0.01) five days after infection (dpi), while Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and other probiotic organisms decreased significantly (p < 0.01). Simultaneously, mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin 3 and occludin), TFF2 and Muc2, was significantly decreased (p < 0.01), indicating destruction of intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions and damage to the mucin layer. build. Moreover, mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-22, IFN-alpha and IL-17A in intestinal epithelial cells was significantly upregulated, resulting in inflammatory response and intestinal damage.

To investigate the genotypes of hepatitis E viruses (HEV) detected in the sera of patients from different regions of China. Methods The partial genome of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of 45 HEV strains identified from 14 cities of China (nt6461-6860, nt5994-6294) was amplified and sequenced using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Results. Of the 45 strains, 41 (91%) share the same genotype as the HEV Burmese strain (B), with nucleotide identities greater than 98% with the representative HEV Chinese strain. Only 4 HEV strains differ significantly from 3 prototype strains of HEV; nucleotide identities 77% - 80% with HEV Burmese/Chinese strain, 74% - 76% with Mexican strain, and 74% - 77% with newly discovered HEV USA/swine strain, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these 4 strains may represent 2 distinct subtypes of a novel HEV genotype that differ significantly from the prototype Mexican, Burmese and USA/swine strains.

1140,Identification and genomic analysis of two strains of duck-derived Tembusu virus in southern China.,"Egg-laying duck flocks in southern China's Guangdong province have been suffering from a widely spread infectious disease, with sudden egg drops and deaths since the winter of 2010. However, the causative pathogen was unknown. We obtained two independent virus isolates, FS and JM, from diseased duck flocks and sequenced the entire length of open reading frames (ORFs) and identified them as duck-borne Tembusu virus by PCR detection. Two isolates FS and JM shared high sequence similarity to isolates of duckorigin Tembusu virus that first emerged in eastern China in April 2010. Burst analysis shows that FS and JM have the highest similarity ([99%) of all ORF sequences. BYD-1 (first reported duck-derived Tembusu virus) and JS804 (first reported goose Tembusu virus) show that full-length genomes are highly conserved in waterfowl Tembusu viruses. This study shows that duck-derived Tembusu viruses spread rapidly from eastern China to southern China, causing widespread infections. The high conservation of duck-derived Tembusu virus strains provides a genomic basis for selecting strains for vaccine preparation to better protect against this novel virus infection. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",,"Li, L.;An, H.;Sun, M.;Dong, J.;Yuan, J.;Hu, Q.",2012.0,,10.1007/s11262-012-0753-6,0

In a retrospective analysis of 32 bovine encephalitis of unknown etiology, 3 other infected animals were identified using PCR and in situ hybridization for viral RNA. Viral RNA was limited to the nervous system and was detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions were diffuse neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing preferentially distributed in gray matter, most severe in the cerebellum and brainstem with increasing density caudally in the spinal cord. These results suggest that infection with BoAstV-NeuroS1 is a potential cause of neurological disease in cattle.",,"Li, L.;Diab, S.;McGraw, S.;Barr, B.;Traslavina, R.;Higgins, R.;Talbot, T.;Blanchard, P.;Rimoldi, G.;Fahsbender, E.;Page, B.;Phan, T.

1143,A wide variety of circoviruses infect livestock and are commonly found in human and chimpanzee faeces.,"Circoviruses are known to infect birds and pigs and cause a wide variety of severe symptoms with significant economic implications. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and identified 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans and wild chimpanzees from Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States. Distinctive genomic features and phylogenetic analyzes indicate that some viral genomes are part of a previously unrecognized genus in the family Circoviridae, which we tentatively refer to as ""Cyclovirus"", whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all known species in the genus Circovirus. Detection of Circoviridae in feces of US adults was limited to porcine circoviruses, which are also present in most US pork products. To determine whether the different cycloviruses found in human faeces outside the US are of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples from farm animals commonly eaten in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human fecal samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel and chicken meat samples indicated that the majority of the 25 Cyclovirus species identified may be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly greater than previously recognized, and that frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses in both human and animal diseases, found in 7 to 17% of non-US human feces and 3% to 55% of non-US meat samples tested, is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes.

1146,Isolation and genetic analysis revealed that there were no dominant new strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus circulating in Southern China during 2004-2008.,"Between 2004 and 2008, twenty-seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from dead or diseased chickens from different poultry farms in Southern China and the S1 gene was sequenced from them. Phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene sequences of 27 isolated strains along with 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all but one isolated and published IBV strains clustered in six different I-VI genotypes. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II and III and form a large phylogenetic branch without new dominant strains, while all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V, which is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II and III. Study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 distinct cleavage motifs, 2 motifs specific to isolated strains and 7 motifs specific to published strains, in which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, and this motif is absent from the new dominant strain. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences showed that amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions were polymorphic and diverse, showing no evidence of dominant genetic variation among isolated strains. Taken together, there were no dominant new strains circulating in Southern China during 2004-2008. However, circulating IBV strains are constantly evolving with genetic compositions far from vaccine strains; this explains why there were persistent but infrequent outbreaks in commercial herds in Southern China during 2004-2008. In addition, continued surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is extremely important to guard against the sudden emergence of new dominant strains. © 2009 Elsevier BV",,"Li, L.;Xue, C.;Chen, F.;Qin, J.;Xie, Q.;Bi, Y.;Cao, Y.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.022,0

Results: In this study, using deep sequencing of viral particles enriched from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure, we identified and characterized a new bocavirus we named Canine bocavirus 3 (CnBoV3). The three major ORFs of CnBoV3 (NS1, NP1, and VP1) shared less than 60% identity with those of other bocaviruses, characterizing it as a novel strain based on ICTV criteria. Reverse PCR showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in the liver.

1149,Viruses in dogs with diarrhea include the novel cobuviruses and sapoviruses.,"Dogs' close interactions with humans and surrounding wildlife often provide opportunities for interspecific virus transmission. To initiate an unbiased characterization of eukaryotic viruses in the gut of dogs, deep sequencing of partially purified viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from the feces of 18 diarrheal dogs was used in this study. Known canine parvoviruses, coronaviruses, and rotaviruses were identified and the genomes of the first reported canine cobuvirus and sapovirus were characterized. First-sequence canine picornavirus and canine cobuvirus, the closest genetic relative of the diarrhea-causing human Aichi virus, were detected at high frequency in the stool of both healthy and diarrhoeic dogs. Canine sapovirus has formed a new genogroup within the genus Sapovirus, which is also a group of viruses associated with human and animal diarrheal diarrhea. These results highlight the high frequency of new virus detection possible even in animal species that have been extensively studied using metagenomic approaches and provide viral genomes for further disease-association studies.",,"Li, L.

1151,"Genetic characterization of continuously evolving highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza viruses in China, 2012-2016","H5N6 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and zoonotic disease causing recurrent endemics in East Asia. At least 155 H5N6 outbreaks, including 15 human infections, have been reported in China. These repeated outbreaks have raised concern that the H5N6 virus could be transmitted to humans and cause a pandemic. In February 2016, peacocks on a breeding farm exhibited a highly contagious disease. Post-mortem investigations, including RT-PCR and virus isolation, confirmed that the highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza virus was the causative agent and the strain was named A/Pavo Cristatus/Jiangxi/JA1/2016. In animal experiments it exhibited high pathogenicity in chickens and an estimated median lethal dose of ~104.3 TCID50 in mice. A phylogenetic analysis showed that JA1/2016 clustered in H5 section 2.3.4.4. The FG594-like H5N6 virus from Guangdong Province was the possible precursor of JA1/2016, with an estimated time of divergence of June 2014. We also found that H5N6 influenza viruses can be classified into the following two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 2 influenza viruses have not been detected since the end of 2014, whereas Group 1 influenza viruses have continuously evolved and reintroduced with the ""gene pool"" circulating in southern China. classified and this has resulted in the rise of new subtypes of the influenza virus.

1152,Isolation and characterization of the novel goose parvovirus-related virus reveals the evolution of waterfowl parvovirus.,"Short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) has been occurring consistently in China since 2015. It is caused by a new goose parvovirus-associated virus (NGPV) and can severely restrict the growth of ducks. In this study, seven NGPV dyes were isolated from different regions in China between 2015 and 2016. To better understand the correlation between NGPV and goose parvovirus (GPV), we performed whole genome sequencing and a comprehensive analysis of the NGPV genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis showed that NGPV is an offshoot of GPV and shares 92.2%-97.1% nucleotide identity with GPV. Compared with classical GPV, five consensus nucleotide mutations in all seven NGPV isolates and two 14 nucleotide pair deletions in six NGPV isolates were found in opposite terminal repeats, twelve and eight synchronous amino acid changes were found in the replication protein and capsid Viral gene regulation, humoral immune responses, and NGPV protein, respectively, which may be important for host transfer. In particular, SDLY1602 was shown to be a recombinant strain with potential major GPV vaccine strain 82-0321v and minor GPV wild strain GDaGPV. This is the first report to show that recombination between two classical GPV strains creates a circulating NGPV strain.

1153,A range of UV-inducible autolytic vectors for high-throughput screening,"high-throughput screening scheme is often a prerequisite for directed evolution of enzymes or metagenomic analysis of DNA samples. To test the intracellular enzymes of interest (for example, when Escherichia coli is used), in many cases chemical or enzymatic cell lysis is required, which can be tedious and costly. In this study, a series of UV-inducible autolytic vectors were created to offer a simpler method of cell lysis that does not require the use of additional fluid. The SRRz lysis gene cassette from bacteriophage Lambda was cloned downstream of a UV-inducible promoter, recA promoter or umuDC promoter and was also inserted into the backbone of pUC18 and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. SRRz expression and cell lysis were induced by UV irradiation. For both the recA and umuDC promoters, the lysis efficiency at 30 Â°C was found to be consistent and over 60% when measured using Î²-galactosidase as the reporter. However, at 37 °C the lysis profiles were found to be irregular. UV lysis in 96-well plates also produced consistent lysis results comparable to those obtained with lysozyme treatment, demonstrating the utility of these autolytic vectors in high-throughput screening. This set of artificial SRRz autolysis units should be transferrable to other vectors. Surprisingly, E. coli BL21(DE3) was also found to partially degrade under UV irradiation, with a lysis efficiency of 44.5% at 30 Â°C and 22.5% at 37 Â°C.

However, traditional methods for studying genome termini are challenging due to time-consuming protocols and their inefficiencies where critical details are easily lost. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it a powerful tool for studying genome termini. In this study, we sequenced one iridovirus genome and twenty phage genomes using NGS and confirmed for the first time that the high-frequency sequences (HFSs) found in NGS reads are indeed terminal sequences of viral genomes. We also established a criterion to distinguish between termini type and viral packaging mode. We also obtained additional terminal details such as terminal repeats, multiple terminals, asymmetric terminals. With this approach, we were able to simultaneously detect genome termini details as well as obtain the complete sequence of bacteriophage genomes. Theoretically, this application could be further extended to analyze larger and more complex genomes of plant and animal viruses.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding genes that play many different and complex roles in viral infections. Finding: Aiming to determine the effect of PPV infections on the cellular miRNAome, we used high-throughput sequencing to sequence two miRNA libraries prepared from porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells under normal conditions and during PPV infection. There was differential miRNA expression between uninfected and infected cells: 65 miRNAs were upregulated and 128 miRNAs were downregulated.

Gene Ontology analysis of host target genes and KEGG function annotations suggested that miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including cellular metabolic processes, immune system processes, and gene expression. Results: These data show that a large set of miRNAs are expressed in PK-15 cells and some miRNAs are changed in PPV-infected PK-15 cells.

To understand their genomic features, the full-length genome of S1 and SY0608 isolates was sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that their genome compositions differed significantly and shared only 88.5% nucleotide identity with each other. Genetic diversity and amino acid substitutions are not randomly distributed in the genome and are mainly focused on ORF1a, ORF3 and ORF5. The highly pathogenic strain SY0608 had 30 amino acid deletions at amino acid positions 480 and 532-560 compared to strain S1. Alignment of the Nsp1-Nsp8, GP2-GP5, M, and N amino acid sequence of S1 and SY0608 with other PRRSV isolates indicated that variation is mainly found in Nsp2, GP3, and GP5 proteins. Compared with strain S1, strain SY0608 showed some potential glycosylation site mutations at amino acid positions 26 and 39 in GP5 that may be associated with viral antigenicity.

Here, we investigated the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of ALV-J-infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify genes and miRNAs involved in ALV-J invasion. In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens. miR-23b expression was up-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control spleens, and transcriptome analysis revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression was down-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to uninfected. spleen. A dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that IRF1 is a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression (P = 0.0022) significantly reduced IRF1 mRNA levels and suppressed IRF1-3'-UTR reporter activity. In vitro experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression potentiates ALV-J replication, whereas miR-23b loss of function inhibits ALV-J replication. IRF1 overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication and IRF1 knockdown increased ALV-J replication. Also, IRF1 overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased IFN-Î² expression.

Coronavirus-like particles were observed in homogenized tissue suspensions of the brain of dead piglets by electron microscopy, and a wild strain of PHEV was isolated, characterized and named PHEV-CC14. Histopathological examinations of dead piglets showed features of non-suppurative encephalitis and some neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic and had neuronophagia. Similarly, mice vaccinated with PHEV-CC14 were found to have symptoms of depression, arched waists, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in standing and swinging front paws. Furthermore, PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in the cortices of dead piglets and infected mice promoted viral infections of the nervous system. Next, the major structural genes of PHEV-CC14 were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed, and the strain shared 95%-99.2% nt identity with other PHEV strains available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that the wild strain clustered into a subclass with a HEV-JT06 strain. These findings suggested that the virus has a strong tropism for the CNS, thereby inducing nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets. At the same time, the estimated risk of widespread transmission showed a certain variation among the PHEV strains currently circulating around the world. First of all, the information presented in this study not only provides a good reference for the experimental diagnosis of PHEV infection for pig breeding, but also promotes the development of new effective vaccines.",,"Li, Z.;He, W.;Lan, Y.;Zhao, K.;Lv, X.;Lu, H.;Ding, N.;Zhang, J.;Shi, J.;Shan, C.;Gao, F.",2016.0,,,0

1163,A systematic analysis of the miRNA transcriptome in lymphoma caused by Marek's disease virus reveals novel and differentially expressed miRNAs.,"Marek's disease is a lymphoproliferative neoplastic disease of chicken that poses a serious threat to poultry health. T-cell lymphoma caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV) is also an excellent biomedical model for neoplasia research. Recently, miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in mediating neoplastic transformation. To investigate the host miRNA expression profiles during the tumor transformation stage of MDV infection, we performed deep sequencing in two MDV-infected samples (spleen with tumor and MD lymphoma from the liver) and two uninfected controls (non-infected spleen and lymphocytes). In total, 187 and 16 known miRNAs were identified in chicken and MDV, respectively, and 17 new chicken miRNAs were further confirmed by qPCR. We identified 28 down-regulated miRNAs and 11 up-regulated miRNAs in MDV-infected samples by bioinformatic analysis. Of the nine further tested by qPCR, seven were confirmed. gga-miR-181a, gga-miR-26a, gga-miR-221, gga-miR-222, gga-miR-199*, and gga-miR-140* were down-regulated and gga-miR-146c in MDV-infected tumors was upregulated in spleens and MD lymphomas. In addition, 189 putative target genes were predicted for the seven differentially expressed miRNAs. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed interactions of gga-miR-181a with MYBL1, gga-miR-181a with IGF2BP3 and gga-miR-26a with EIF3A. Differential expression of miRNAs and predicted targets strongly suggest that they contribute to MDV-induced lymphogenesis.",,"Lian, L.;Qu, L.;Chen, Y.;Lamont, S. J.;Yang, N.",2012.0,,,0

We previously reported that northern pig-tailed macaques are also susceptible to HIV-1. Here, we sought to evaluate the role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-limited immune responses to HIV-1 infection, to make this animal a potential model of HIV/AIDS and to explore its virus control mechanism. viral replication and disease progression. As a first step, we first cloned and characterized the classic MHC class I gene of northern pig-tailed macaques. In this study, we identified 39 MHC class I alleles, including 17 MHC-A and 22 MHC-B alleles. Of these identified alleles, 30 were novel and 9 were identical to alleles previously reported from other macaque species. The MHC-A and MHC-B loci were both duplicative in rhesus macaques and southern pig-tailed macaques. In addition, we also detected patterns of positive selection in northern pig-tailed macaques, revealing the presence of equilibrium selection with 20 positive selection sites at the peptide binding site. Analysis of B and F peptide binding pockets in northern and southern pig-tailed macaques and rhesus macaques revealed that they would likely share several common peptides. Therefore, this study provides important MHC immunogenetic information and adds value to northern pig-tailed macaques as a promising HIV/AIDS model.",,"Lian, X. D.;Zhang, X. H.;Dai, Z. X.;Zheng, Y.

All strains were determined to be velogenic with plaque. formation, mean time to death (MDT) of embryonated eggs, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). Acid guanidinium-thiocyanate method was used for the preparation of virus RNA. A 908bp nucleotide fragment was amplified by RT-PCR starting from the N-terminus of the F gene, and the PCR segments were cloned and sequenced into the PGEM-T vector. The similarities of the nucleotide sequences (1-519bp) of the F gene (1-125) and the predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed by comparing 12 NDV isolates with the NDV vaccine strains Lasota, B1, H1 and V4 as well as classical NDV strains. and recent epizootic strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains were from two new genotypes; The NDV strains that caused the ND epidemic in western China between 1998 and 1999 were genotype VIIa, while the strains from Qinghai province (1979-1985) were genotype VIII found predominantly in South Africa.

To investigate the distribution of BLV provirus variants, 42 isolates from Argentina and Japan were screened for a segment of the env gene by nested PCR followed by DNA sequencing. The nucleotide sequences were compared with other previously characterized BLV variants from different geographic regions (Belgium, France, Italy, North America, Australia, Japan and Argentina). Most of the analyzed segments had a tendency for nucleotide substitution without changing the amino acid. The generated phylogenetic tree showed the relationships and differences between proviruses and within each. Most of the samples in Argentina formed a cluster. All but one specimens from Japan also formed a cluster, and some showed high homology with isolates from Australia and the USA.

(534 basis points). A portion of the amplified F protein DNA product (nucleotide sequence 47-418) and deduced amino acid sequences were phylogenetically compared with those from strains previously reported in Taiwan and other geographic regions. Our results showed that all Taiwan isolates (n = 20) collected between 2003 and 2006 belong to the VIId genotype according to the phylogenetic tree. In addition, all six Taiwanese isolates obtained in 2003 carry the motif 112R-RQK-R116 and have amino acid L23 replaced by F23 (assigned Group 1). On the other hand, 12 of 14 Taiwanese isolates obtained between 2004-2006 have the motif 112R-RKK-R116 and have amino acid G74 instead of E74 (assigned as Group 2). To our knowledge, these are the first reported VIId isolates to have the sequences G74/112R-RKK-R116 within the F0 protein. These isolates obtained between 2003 and 2006 are considered the velogenic type, as NDV-infected chickens have high mortality, severe clinical manifestations, typical postmortem lesions, and a high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). Group 2 viruses have become dominant and responsible for the majority of Taiwanese outbreaks in recent years. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it can be hypothesized that these isolates evolved from previously reported local strains, with the Group 2 family appearing last in genotype VIId.

1170,Live attenuated nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus vaccine provides broad cross-protection against novel variant strains,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections cause huge economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide, and the emergence of new variant strains complicates disease control. This study investigated the genetic and protective properties of emerging Korean IBV strains. A phylogenetic analysis showed that several new isolates formed 2 distinct clusters (new cluster 1 and 2) that differed from other pre-existing clusters. The new cluster 1 IBV strains represented recombinants between the Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and strain QXIBV. The new cluster 2 IBV strains showed lower amino acid homology (<58.7%) compared to previous isolates. We evaluated the protective efficacy of commercial IBV vaccines (strain H120 and K2) against these new isolates. In cross-protection studies, strain H120 did not provide adequate protection against these variants. However, the highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine, strain K2, provided significantly higher levels of protection against variants (P < 0.05 or better) compared to chickens vaccinated with H120. These results suggest that the K2 vaccine may be helpful in reducing the economic losses caused by emerging IBV recombinants (new cluster 1) and variants (new cluster 2).

1175,High prevalence of hepatitis e virus in Swedish deer - a phylogenetic characterization and comparison of virus from different regions,"BACKGROUND: The hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects a number of species, including humans, pigs, wild boars and deer. Zoonotic transmission may contribute to the high HEV seroprevalence in the human population of many countries. A new distinct HEV from the Swedish deer (Alces alces) was recently identified by partial genome sequencing. Because only one strain was found, its classification within the HEV family, prevalence of deer, and zoonotic potential were uncertain. Therefore, we searched samples from 231 deer in seven Swedish counties for HEV and sequenced a nearly complete deer HEV genome. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to classify this virus within the Hepeviridae family and to search for potential host-specific determinants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Deer's HEV prevalence was determined by PCR (active infection marker) and serological assays (past infection marker) of serum and 51 fecal samples from 231 Swedish deer. Active and past infection markers were found in 67 (29%) animals, with 34 (15%) positive for HEV RNA, 43 (19%) seropositive for anti-HEV antibodies, and 10 (4%) both markers. . The number of young individuals positive for HEV RNA was greater than that of older individuals, and the number of individuals positive for anti-HEV antibody increased with age. The high-throughput sequenced deer HEV genome was 35-60% identical to existing HEVs. Partial sequences of ORF1 from 13 deer strains showed high similarity between them, forming a distinct monophyletic lineage with a common ancestor to the HEV genotypes 1-6, containing members known for zoonotic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high frequency of HEV in Swedish deer, with 30% of animals showing current and past infection markers. Deer are therefore an important animal repository of HEV. The phylogenetic relationship indicated that deer HEV belonged to genotype 1-6 group, which includes strains that also infect humans, thus indicating a potential for zoonotic transmission of this HEV.",,"Lin, J.;Karlsson, M.;Olofson, A.

1182,"Hypothesis on source, transmission and characteristics of infection by avian influenza A (H7N9) virus - based on field epidemiological research analysis and gene sequence analysis","Summary: On March 31, 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human infections with influenza A (H7N9) virus have occurred in Shanghai and Anhui provinces of China. H7N9 cases were later detected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It is estimated that the virus first spread to the north along the route followed by migratory birds, and then spread to neighboring provinces with the sale of poultry. Epidemiological studies have been carried out on samples taken from the external environment of infected cases, routes of transmission, farmers' markets and live poultry markets. Phylogenetic study of viral sequences from human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Taihu Lake were highly homologous with those from the external environment. This suggests that avian viruses carried by waterfowl combine with virus carried by migratory birds, giving rise to the avian influenza virus H7N9, which is highly pathogenic to humans. It is possible for the virus to be transmitted to domestic poultry and then to humans through local wild birds, or further spread through trade in wholesale poultry markets. The epidemic in the first half of the year was brought under control with the measures taken to warm up the weather, end the poultry trade and facilitate health communication. However, the source of infection in the triangle area around Lake Taihu still remains. The H7N9 outbreak will likely hit the area later and next spring when migratory birds return, and may even spread to other areas. Therefore, great attention should be paid to wild birds in Lake Taihu as the reservoir and spreader of the virus: research and study of this population is essential.",,"Ling, F.;Chen, E.;Liu, Q.;Miao, Z.;Gong, Z.",2015.0,,10.1111/zph.12110,0

In this communication, we report the identification of five virus-derived polypeptides in TRT virus-infected BS-C-1 cells. The Mr of these polypeptides was estimated from their electrophoretic mobilities in SDS-polyacrylamide 6% to 15% gradient gels as 38K, 35K, 30K, 19K and 15K. The virus specificity of four of these five individuals (38K, 35K, 30K, and 19K Mr polypeptides) was confirmed by their dominance as products of in vitro translation of mRNA from TRT virus-infected BS-C-1 cells. An additional virus-specific polypeptide with predicted Bay 22K was revealed by in vitro translation and may be a non-structural polypeptide or a small structural protein. All six polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with a murine antiserum. Three other polypeptides (129K, 57K and 45K) were also immunoprecipitated. The 57K, 45K, and 15K Mr polypeptides are glycosylated, and the 57K glycopolypeptide may be a disulfide-linked dimer of the 45K and 15K glycopolypeptides. Another major glycopolypeptide of 83K Mr was observed, but virus specificity could not be confirmed.

1188,Genetic characterization and mutation analysis of Qihe547 Aujeszky disease virus in China,"Background: Aujeszky disease virus (ADV) can cause neurological disease in young pigs, respiratory disease in aged pigs, and miscarriage or delivery of mummified fetuses or stillborn newborns. The reemergence of Aujeszky disease (AD) in pig farms vaccinated with live vaccine (Bartha-K61) has caused significant economic losses to the Chinese pig industry since late 2011. A field ADV named Qihe547 was isolated from pigs with suspected AD clinical presentation. symptoms. To better understand the genetic characteristics and mutations of Qihe547 ADV, the whole genome was sequenced and analyzed. Results: The genomic length of Qihe547 ADV was 143,404 bp with a G+C content of 73.59%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire genome of the ADV strains revealed that the Chinese ADV strains were placed in a three-subgroup group. Qihe547 ADV was closely related to these new ADV strains isolated in China since 2012. Qihe547 presented multiple hypervariable regions compared to overseas ADV strains. Amino acid (AA) insertion or deletion was observed in 34 genes of Qihe547 ADV. In addition, multiple AA mutations were found in major protective antigen genes (gB, gC and gD genes). Differences of potential antigenic peptides in major protective antigens between Qihe547 ADV and ADV Bartha were discovered in the dominant antigenic regions of gB (AA59-AA126, AA507-AA734), the extracellular region of gC and gD. Conclusion: High diversity was observed between Qihe547 and foreign ADV isolates. AA variations in key functional regions of the major protective antigen (gB, gC, and gD) of ADV Qihe547 and differences in potential antigenic peptides may contribute to virus immunity and may be a partial reason for virus evasion.

1190,"Multiple reassortant H5N5 avian influenza viruses in ducks, China, 2008","Three highly pathogenic H5N5 avian influenza viruses (HPAI), A/duck/Guangdong/wy11/2008 (WY11), A/duck/Guangdong/wy19/2008 (WY19) and A/duck/Guangdong/wy24/2008 (WY24) It was isolated from ducks in southern China in April 2008. Here, we characterized these viruses by performing sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes of their viral genes, assessing their virulence in ducks and mice, and performing cross-protection experiments in chickens. Sequence analysis showed that the HA genes of these H5N5 viruses showed 97.1-97.8% homology to the A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) influenza virus and the NA genes of the A/duck/Hunan/5613/2003 (H6N5) influenza virus belonging to the Eurasian lineage. . Genotypic analysis showed that these H5N5 viruses are multiple reassociators between H5N1, H5N2, H6N2 and H6N5 viruses. Analysis of the HA sequence showed that these H5N5 viruses clustered in section 2.3.4. In animal experiments, these H5N5 viruses caused 50% mortality in ducks and 100% in chickens. In cross-protection experiments, the clade 2.3.2 avian influenza vaccine could only provide 75% protection against the H5N5 virus challenge in chickens. Furthermore, the H5N5 virus replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice, indicating that H5N5 viruses have the potential to infect mammalian hosts. Because ducks serve as reassortant vessels by playing important roles in the formation of new subtypes of influenza viruses, it is important to monitor the emergence of this new subtype of influenza viruses in waterfowl to understand their ecology and evolution and to control the spread of new influenza viruses. viruses. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Liu, C.

1191,Development of a reverse genetic system for small ruminant morbillivirus: rescue of recombinant virus to express Echinococcus granulosus EG95 antigen.,"Peste des petits ruminants and cystic hydatidosis may be simultaneously endemic in a particular region. Its pathogens are small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV) and Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus), respectively. Formerly called peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), SRMV is classified in the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus is an ideal vaccine vector for delivering immunogenic proteins. In this study, a reverse genetic system was developed to rescue a recombinant SRMV (Nigeria 75/1 strain) expressing the E. granulosus EG95 antigen in vitro. Although recombinant SRMV replicates more slowly than its parent virus, it can effectively express the EG95 antigen in cells by Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry analyses. An EG95 subunit vaccine is widely used for the prevention of cystic hydatidosis in parts of China. If SRMV expressing EG95 is proven to induce effective immune responses against both diseases in a future animal experiment, it would be a potential bivalent vaccine candidate.",,"Liu, F.;Li, L.;Liu, Y.;Sun, C.;Liu, C.;Wu, X.;Wang, Z.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.12.008,0

If genetically modified using reverse genetics, SRMV would be a useful vector for expressing foreign proteins in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a recombinant SRMV was rescued by reverse genetics to efficiently express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in vitro. Based on the green fluorescence traced properties of recombinant SRMV, eight mammalian cell lines (BHK-21, F81, MDBK, RK13, MDCK, PK15, Vero and GT) were selected to determine their susceptibility to SRMV infection.

1193,Identification and analysis of novel viral and host dysregulated MicroRNAs in variant pseudorabies virus-infected PK15 cells,"Pseudorabies (PR) are one of the most devastating diseases in the pig industry. To identify changes in microRNA(miRNA) expression and post-transcriptional regulatory responses to PRV infection in porcine kidney epithelial (PK15) cells, we sequenced a small RNA (sRNA) library prepared from infected PK15 cells and compared it to a library prepared from uninfected ones. Cells using Illumina deep sequencing. Here we found 25 novel viral miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing, and 20 of these miRNAs were validated by stem loop RT-qPCR. Surprisingly, unlike the usual miRNAs encoded by Î±-herpes viruses that are clustered in the large delay transcript (LLT), these new viral miRNAs are throughout the PRV genome, such as Î²-herpes viruses. Viral miRNAs are predicted to target multiple genes and form a complex regulatory network. GO analysis of viral miRNAs on their host targets was involved in complex cellular processes including metabolic pathway, bioregulation, stimulus response, signaling process and immune response. Moreover, 13 host miRNAs were expressed after infection with PRV with a significant difference: 8 miRNAs were up-regulated and 5 miRNAs were down-regulated, which could affect viral replication in the host cell. Our results provided new insight into the properties of miRNAs in response to PRV infection, which is important for further investigation of the function of these miRNAs.",,"Liu, F.;Zheng, H.;Tong, W.;Li, G.

It was 7691 nucleotides long and had 5”² and 3” terminal noncoding regions of 626 and 315 nucleotides, respectively. The poly(A) tail contained at least 22 residues and the single open reading frame encoded a 2249 amino acid polypeptide. The VP1 gene was also sequenced from nine southeast China field isolates and three attenuated DHV-I vaccine strains. In phylogenetic analysis of isolates and other published sequences, attenuated and tissue-adapted isolates (including ZJ-V) clustered as genotypes that differed significantly from unpassaged field isolates in chicken/duck embryos. There were two consistent amino acid substitutions (E129 - V129 and A142 - S142) between all domain isolates and all tissue adapted. The carboxyl terminal region was generally the most variable, with six consistent differences from the four attenuated Chinese isolates field isolates (S181 â†' L181, H183K184 â†' R183G1841, N193 â†' D193, E205 â†' K205, R217 â†' K217, N235 â†' D235).

The mean time to death and the intracerebral pathogenicity index were used to evaluate the virulence of the isolates. Pathogenicity tests showed that all 10 isolates were velogenic strains. The main functional region of the F gene, consisting of 535 nucleotides, was amplified and sequenced by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site in all 10 isolates was 112RRQKRF117, which is a typical velogenic strain sequence and is consistent with the results of in vivo pathogenicity tests. For genotyping, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the isolates belonged to genotype VII virus. Only one strain, WG, was found to be genotype IX virus. This strain was closest to F48E9, which was isolated in China in 1946 and used as a standard challenge strain in vaccine evaluation in China. Therefore, genotype IX virus still causes sporadic infections in geese in China. Further phylogenetic analyzes on the genotype VII strains found that all these strains could be divided into 5 subgenotypes and most of the isolates (8 strains) were classified as VIId, a dominant genotype responsible for most of the Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks since its end. last century in China.

DNA fragments of 1022 and 1152 base pairs, respectively, were amplified among ARV isolates, indicating no significant deletions or insertions in these regions. Fragments amplified from vaccine strains and field isolates were digested with five different restriction enzymes, Bcn I, Hae III, Taq I, Dde I and Hinc II, respectively. Restriction fragment profiles observed on polyacrylamide gels showed heterogeneity between vaccine and Taiwan isolates. All tested ARV isolates showed distinct restriction enzyme degradation patterns and were clearly distinguishable. Strain typing based on cleavage sites in the sigmaC-encoding gene of ARV showed that viruses can be classified into four different groups. A phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the gene encoding SigmaC revealed that Taiwanese ARV isolates were classified into four distinct groups; this indicates that genotyping is consistent with typing based on restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism of the sigmaC encoding gene of ARV. The results suggested that restriction enzyme analysis following polymerase chain reaction provides a simple and rapid approach for the characterization of ARV isolates.

Eurasian ancestry. These results suggest that internal protein genes can be transferred from the Americas to the Eurasian avian host. Thus, the occurrence of interregional influenza virus transmission between North American and Eurasian birds has also been confirmed. The fact that reassortants can be produced in migratory ducks between the North American and Eurasian avian virus lineage further highlights the importance of global surveillance among migratory ducks.",,"Liu, J.;Okazaki, K.;Bai, G.;Shi, W.;Mweene, A.;Kida, H.",2004.0,,10.1023/B:VIRU.0000032791.26573.f1,0

METHODS: Two clinical specimens were collected from outpatient HFMD patients. Viral isolation was performed by inoculation of RD cells and then serval. The VP4-VP2 region of the two viral isolates was amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods, and then the PCR products were sequenced; Molecular typing was used to determine the serotype of these two viral isolates. Finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed between these two Gansu viral isolates and 16 CVA4 strains downloaded from the GenBank database. RESULTS: Two Viruses were isolated by inoculating RD cells from clinical specimens from two HFMD patients and identified as CVA4 using molecular typing methods. The homology of nucleotide sequences in the VP4-VP2 region between the two Gansu CVA4 strains was 94.6% and the homology of amino acid sequences was 100%. Compared to the prototype strain of CVA4 (Strain High Point/USA/1948), the homology of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences was 85.5%-85.8% and 99.3%, respectively. It revealed that two Gansu CVA4 strains were present in the independence group.

Surveillance studies have shown that H9N2 subtype viruses are found in domestic poultry worldwide and can infect mammalian species, including humans. Here, we genetically analyzed the HA and NA genes of five H9N2 viruses isolated from migratory ducks in Hokkaido, Japan, the migration route from Siberia between 1997 and 2000. The results showed that the HA and NA genes of these viruses belonged to the same lineage, respectively. Compared with A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97-like and A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97-like viruses, HA and NA of migratory duck isolates had a close association with that of isolated H9N2 viruses. Chicken in Korea indicates that Korean H9N2 viruses may have been derived from migratory ducks. The NA genes of the five isolates were in the same cluster as those of the N2 viruses that caused a human pandemic in 1968; this suggests that the NA genes of previous pandemic strains are still circulating in waterfowl reservoirs.

A comparative genome analysis showed 93% similarity to Hungarian porcine bufavirus. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyzes of genome sequences showed a close association of porcine bufaviruses with human and monkey bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common ancestors supported the recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and pig populations, respectively. A real-time PCR method was developed to screen 60 stool samples for porcine bufavirus DNA, and eight positive samples were found in two neighboring farms, indicating a relatively low prevalence (13.3%).

Clad 7.2 viruses were first detected in chickens in northern China in 2006, and vaccines specifically targeting the branch have been developed and used in poultry in China since 2006. During routine surveillance and disease diagnosis, we isolated seven H5 viruses between 2011 and 2011. Carrying 7.2 HA genes 2014. Here we did extensive studies to understand how 7.2 H5 viruses evolved in chickens in China. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that the seven viruses derived genes from other influenza viruses to form two subtypes (four H5N1 viruses and three H5N2 viruses) and four genotypes. All of the viruses were antigenically entrained from viruses in the 7.2 sequence isolated in 2006. Pathogenicity studies of four viruses, one from each genotype, revealed that all of the viruses were highly pathogenic in chickens, but none replicated in ducks. The four viruses bind only to avian receptors and are replicated only in the turbinates and/or lungs of mice; none were lethal to mice at 10%<sup>6</sup> 50% egg infective dose (EID<sub>50</sub>). Our study shows that although 7.2 viruses are not eradicated from poultry by vaccination, they do not become more dangerous to other animals (eg ducks and mice) and humans. IMPORTANT: Animal influenza viruses can acquire the ability to infect and kill humans. H5N1 viruses have been a concern in recent years due to their clear pandemic potential. We divided the H5N1 influenza viruses into different phylogenetic branches according to their HA genes. Clade 7.2 viruses were detected in chickens in various provinces of northern China in 2006. Vaccines for these viruses were later developed and have since been used to control infection of poultry. Here, we analyzed the genetic and biological characteristics of seven clade 7.2 viruses isolated from chickens between 2011 and 2014. After approximately 9 years of circulation in chickens, clade 7.2 viruses still bind to avian-type receptors only and the low pathogenicity for mice suggests that these H5 viruses pose a low risk to human public health.",,"Liu, L.;Zeng, X.;Chen, P.;Deng, G.;Li, Y.;Shi, J.;Gu, C.;Kong, H.;Suzuki, Y.;Jiang, Y.;Tian, G.;Chen, H.",2016.0,2001-11-01 00:00:00,,0

The complete gene of the NDV isolate was sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Pathogenicity assay was conducted in pigeons, chickens and ducks. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain clustered with Class II viruses was phylogenetically quite similar to the NDV strains isolated from pigeons in China, but far from the virus prevalence in chickens and vaccine strains used in China. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein confirmed that the isolate contained the virulent motif (112)RRQKRF(117) at the cleavage site, but did not cause disease manifestations in chickens and ducks. However, the isolate had virulence in pigeons, resulting in severe nervous manifestations and a high rate of death. Pigeons were recognized as a potential source of NDV infection and disease for commercial poultry flocks. Therefore, new vaccines to prevent NDV infection in pigeon flocks should be developed as soon as possible and strict biosecurity measures should be taken to reduce the risk of pigeon Newcastle disease epidemic.",,"Liu, M.;Qu, Y.;Wang, F.;Liu, S.;Sun, H.",2015.0,,10.3382/ps/pev106,0
1215,High reversal potential of a cell-adapted vaccine candidate against highly pathogenic swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,"The modified live vaccine (MLV), based on the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV), tends to rapidly reverse virulence after circulating in host animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the virulence reversion potential of HP-PRRSV MLV and to identify elements within the HP-PRRSV genome that contribute to this phenomenon. A blind passage, cell adaptation strategy was attempted to attenuate an HP-PRRSV strain JX143 isolated during the atypical PRRS epidemic in 2006. The two attenuated candidate passages 87 (JXM87) and passage 105 (JXM105) used as MLVs showed the best balance of safety and efficacy in 4-week old piglets (unpublished data). Two studies were conducted in which candidates were evaluated for return to virulence via five back passages in susceptible piglets (21 +/- 3 days old). Both study results showed an increase in clinical signs, fever and lung lesions in susceptible pigs, as well as a reduction in mean daily weight gain from passage 3, showing that both candidates regained virulence regardless of the transition level. The increase in relevant parameters was accompanied by an increase in viremia in piglets: JXM87 virus titer, Pass 1 (P1) 4.40 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL to P4 5.75 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub> increased to /mL and the JXM105 virus titer increased from P1 3.78 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL to P4 6.42 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on clinical samples (serum, lung tissue) from P4 animals. Sequence analysis comparing P4 materials with parental strains revealed 10 amino acid mutations in 4 proteins for JXM87 and 14 amino acid mutations in 9 proteins for JXM105, respectively. Interestingly, five amino acid mutations were identical for the two candidates located in the nsp1beta, GP5a and nsp10 coding regions, suggesting that nsp1beta, GP5a and nsp10 may contribute to virulence in HP-PRRSV.",,"Liu, P.;Bai, Y.;Jiang, X.;Zhou, L.;Yuan, S.;Yao, H.;Yang, H.;Sun, Z.",2018.0,Dec,,0

The genbank isolated from humans and animals in Turkey was retrieved from GenBank and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. There were three genotypes and 11 subgenotypes of HEV prevailing in China. Rabbit HEVs of controversial genotype are also common in China. Genotype 1 was the most isolated genotype before 2000 and was mainly detected in Xinjiang, Beijing, and eastern China. However, genotype 4, which was detected in most regions of China in the last 10 years, surpassed genotype 1 in isolation frequency throughout the country. Genotype 3 HEV strains were found only in eastern China and were thought to have been imported from Japan. Both genotypes 3 and 4 were found in humans, and swine and cross-species transmission of the two genotypes from pigs to humans may have occurred in Northeast, Northwest, Northern, Eastern and Southern China.

Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play important roles in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive virus infection remain unclear. Methods: In this study, porcine small RNA transcriptomes of PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterized by high-throughput sequencing. MiRDeep2 software was used to predict novel porcine-encoded miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on a substantial 12 DE miRNA. Physical and functional interactions between immune-related target genes of DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analyzed using the STRING database. Results: 306 annotated and 295 new miRNAs were identified from PCMV-infected and uninfected pig organs, respectively, by alignment with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs, respectively, were significantly differentially expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and thymus after PCMV infection. According to the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs associated with immune system processes, regulation of biological processes, and metabolic processes were enriched in each sample. Integrated expression analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that significantly differential expression of specific miRNAs under pressure from PCMV infection in central immune organs interferes with the expression of genes involved in important immune-related signaling pathways. , thereby promoting viral infection.

Pathogenicity experiments conducted in this study showed that the virus was highly pathogenic for chickens but low pathogenic for mammalian hosts, as evidenced by the reduced infection of mice. Analysis of whole genome sequences and genetic evolution indicated that A/Swan/Shanghai/10/09 (SW/SH/09) could be derived from strain A/silky Chicken/Shantou/475/2004 (CK/ST/04). Homologous to influenza viruses isolated in 2007 from chicken, duck, pika, little egret, swan, mandarin duck and stick-headed goose in Hunan, China, Qinghai, Mongolia, Russia, Japan, Korea, Laos, and Hong Kong, 2007-2011 shows that the virus has retroinfected a variety of wild birds from chicken, and significant spread of the virus via overlapping migratory flight paths still continues. On the basis of molecular analysis, we found that the deletion of the glycosylation site (NSS) at amino acid 156 of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein was compared with other Clade 2.3.2 viruses isolated between 2007 and 2007. 2011. More importantly, sequence analysis of the SW/SH/09 virus revealed drug-resistant mutations in the matrix protein (M2) and neuraminidase (NA) genes.

1227,Porcine microRNA transcriptome response to infectious gastroenteritis virus infection,"Infectious gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; family Coronaviridae) causes great economic losses in the pig industry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may play a role in the mammalian immune response. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected porcine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing produced 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. Reads were aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19 and 284 annotated miRNAs were identified. Some miRNAs are differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression between normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 44 were significantly down-regulated. Root loop RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples and the results were consistent with sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes indicated that differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report on the identification of ST cell miRNAs and comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, revealing miRNA molecular regulatory mechanisms for viral infection, expression of viral genes, and expression of immune-related genes. The results presented here will aid research into the prevention and treatment of viral diseases.",,"Liu, X.;Zhu, L.;Liao, S.;Xu, Z.;Zhou, Y.",2015.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0120377,0
1228,Whole genome sequence analysis of a dominant infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain in China,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the main diseases caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in poultry flocks worldwide. In the study, the whole genome sequence of strain A2, a dominant IBV strain in China, was sequenced and analyzed. The results showed mutations, insertions and deletions scattered throughout the genome. The A2 virus had the highest identity to S14 and BJ in terms of the whole genome, with a greater distance to the Massachusetts strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolate A2 clustered together with most Chinese strains. The results of this study suggest that strain A2 may play an important role in the evolution of IBV, and A2-like IBVs are the dominant strains in China. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Liu, X.

1229,Phylogenetic diversity and genotypic complexity of H1N1 subtype swine flu viruses isolated in mainland China.,"Background: Following the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1, close attention has been paid to H1N1 subtype swine flu viruses (H1N1 SIV) by the scientific community in many countries. A large-scale series analysis of the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database on H1N1 SIVs was performed from 1992 to 2011, primarily submitted by scientists in China. The aim of this study was to elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H1N1 SIVs, to identify and combine the lineages and genetic traits of H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. Results: Most of the strains were isolated from Guangdong and Shandong provinces of China during 2008-2010. Based on phylogenetic and genotypic analyses, all H1N1 SIV strains can be classified into 8 lineages and 10 genotypes. All strains had characteristics of low pathogenic influenza viruses. Viruses of different lineage are characterized by different amino acid residues at their receptor binding sites. Viruses containing the PB2 genes of the classical swine, early-season human, and late-season human lineage may be more contagious to humans. Some genotypes were directly related to human influenza viruses, including strains harboring genes derived from human influenza viruses. Results: There was phylogenetic diversity and complexity in H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. These H1N1 SIV strains were closely related to other subtypes of influenza viruses, particularly human influenza viruses. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that new strains and genotypes of H1N1 SIVs are emerging in mainland China. These findings provided new and fundamental information for a better understanding of genetic and evolutionary traits and monitoring of H1N1 SIVs in mainland China.

1230,Application of a Molecular Method for Classification of Human Enteroviruses and Relation to Clinical Symptoms,"Background/Purpose: A new molecular classification scheme has recently been adopted that groups all enteroviruses into four types, designated human enteroviruses A (HEV-A) to D. In this study, we tried to show the correlation between this molecular classification scheme and the clinic. manifestations in patients. Methods: We retrospectively reclassified clinical isolates of enteroviruses from the previous 4.5 years using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in our virology laboratory and reviewed the clinical manifestations of 138 pediatric patients. Results: From five serotypes, 23 isolates were reclassified to HEV-A group, 110 isolates to 16 serotypes to HEV-B group, five isolates to HEV-C group, and no isolates from HEV-D group. HEV-A strains caused significantly more hand-foot-mouth disease (p < 0.001), herpangina (p = 0.029), and myoclonic jerks (p < 0.001) compared to HEV-B strains. However, HEV-B strains caused significantly more pharyngitis (p = 0.043), respiratory tract infections (p = 0.046), nausea and vomiting (p = 0.007), and aseptic meningitis (p = 0.001). The only death in our report was caused by coxsackievirus A16, which belongs to the HEV-A group. Conclusion: The relationship between the molecular classification of enteroviruses and associated disease patterns is an important finding. We suggest that this molecular classification can be applied in a clinical laboratory as an alternative method under certain conditions, such as limited antiserum availability or questionable serotyping results, to identify nontypeable isolates.

1231,Origin and evolution of the Nipah virus,"Nipah virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, is classified as a Biosafety Level-4 agent and a category C priority pathogen. Nipah virus disease is endemic in South Asia, and outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Singapore, India and Bangladesh. Bats of the genus Pteropus seem to be the natural reservoir of this virus. The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity of Nipah virus, to estimate the origin date and spread of the infection. The mean value of the Nipah virus N gene evolution rate was 6.5×10-4 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD: 2.3×10-4-1.18×10-3). Time-scale phylogenetic analysis showed that the root of the tree emerged in 1947 (95% HPD: 1888-1988) when the virus entered Southeast Asian regions. Separation of sequences in two main sections (I and II) indicates that Nipah virus had two different entries: one corresponding to section I in 1995 (95% HPD: 1985-2002) and the other in 1985 (95% HPD: 1971) -1996) II. Phylogeographic reconstruction showed that the epidemic followed two different paths, spreading to other regions. Trade in infected pigs may have played a role in the spread of the virus. Bats of the genus Pteropus, which can travel long distances, may have contributed to the spread of the infection. Statistically supported regions selected as negative may reflect the stability of the viral N protein.",,"Lo Presti, A.;Cella, E.;Giovanetti, M.;Lai, A.;Angeletti, S.;Zehender, G.;Ciccozzi, M.",2016.0,,10.1002/jmv.24345,0
1232,Comparative genomics uncovers multiple pathways to reciprocity for tick-borne pathogens,"BACKGROUND: A number of important human and livestock pathogens use ticks as their primary host vectors. It is currently unknown whether this way of infecting a host occurred once or many times during evolution. RESULTS: To address this question, we performed a comparative genomic analysis on a range of bacterial pathogens from seven genera (Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Coxiella and Bartonella) and species from three different host vectors - ticks, lice and fleas. The final set of 102 genomes used in the study encoded a total of 120,046 protein sequences. We found that no genes or metabolic pathways were found in all of the tick-borne bacteria. However, we found that some genes and pathways were found in subsets of tick-borne organisms, while not found in bacteria transmitted by lice or fleas. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that the ability to transmit pathogens by ticks has emerged multiple times throughout evolution. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of tick transmissibility to date.",,"Lockwood, S.;Brayton, K. A.;Broschat, S. L.",2016.0,07 02,,0
1233,A universal protocol for generating consensus-level genome sequences for foot-and-mouth disease virus and other positively-sense polyadenylated RNA viruses using Illumina MiSeq.,"BACKGROUND: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is revolutionizing molecular epidemiology by providing new approaches to undertake whole genome sequencing (WGS) in diagnostic settings for a variety of human and veterinary pathogens. Previous sequencing protocols have been subject to biases, such as those encountered during PCR amplification and cell culture, or have been restricted by the need for large amounts of starting material. Here, we describe a simple and robust methodology for constructing whole genome sequences on Illumina MiSeq. This protocol is specific for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) or other polyadenylated RNA viruses, eliminating both the use of PCR and the need for large quantities of initial templates. RESULTS: The protocol was successfully validated using a representative panel of viruses from all seven serotypes as well as five FMDV positive clinical samples from the 2001 outbreak in the United Kingdom. In addition, this protocol was successfully used to recover 94% of an FMDV genome previously identified as cell culture negative. Genome sequences from three other non-FMDV polyadenylated RNA viruses (EMCV, ERAV, VESV) were also obtained with minor protocol changes. We calculated that a minimum coverage depth of 22 reads is required to produce an accurate consensus sequence for FMDV O. This was obtained in 5 FMDV/O/UKG isolates and type O FMDV from the 5' genomic excluded serotype panel. termini and the area immediately adjacent to the poly(C) region. RESULTS: We developed a universal WGS method for FMDV and other polyadenylated RNA viruses. This method works successfully from a limited amount of starting material and eliminates the need for genome-specific PCR amplification. This protocol has the potential to generate consensus-level arrays in a routine high-throughput diagnostic setting.",,"Logan, G.;Freimanis, G. L.;King, D.

1234,Neutral Characterization of Anopheles Mosquito Blood Meals by Targeted High-throughput Sequencing,"Understanding mosquito host selection is important for assessing vector competence or identifying disease reservoirs. Unfortunately, the availability of an unbiased method for comprehensively evaluating the composition of insect blood baits is very limited, as most current molecular analyzes only test for the presence of a few preselected species. These approaches also have limited ability to detect the presence of multiple mammalian hosts in a single blood meal. Here, we describe a new high-throughput sequencing method that enables simultaneous analysis of 96 mosquitoes and provides a comprehensive and quantitative perspective on the composition of each blood meal. In silico, we confirmed that universal primers targeting mammalian mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA) should amplify more than 95% of mammalian 16S rRNA sequences found in the NCBI nucleotide database. We performed this method on 442 female Anopheles punctulatus sl mosquitoes collected from Papua New Guinea (PNG). While human (52.9%), dog (15.8%) and pig (29.2%) were the most common hosts detected in our study, we also detected DNA from mouse, one marsupial species and two bat species. Our analyzes also revealed that 16.3% of mosquitoes feed on more than one host. Analysis of the human mitochondrial hypervariable region I in 102 human blood meals showed that 5 (4.9%) of the mosquitoes clearly fed on more than one individual. Overall, analysis of PNG mosquitoes demonstrates the potential of this approach to identify suspect hosts and characterize mixed blood meals, and demonstrates how this approach can be adapted to assess interindividual variations between human blood meals. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to any disease-infecting arthropod and can be easily customized to search for non-mammalian host sources.",,"Logue, K.;Keven, J. B.;Cannon, M.

1236,Columbian circoviruses detected in free-range pigeons from southern Brazil: insights on PiCV evolution.,"Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is taxonomically classified as a member of the genus Circovirus, family Circoviridae. The virus contains a single-stranded DNA genome of about 2 kb, with small differences in length between different isolates. The occurrence of PiCV infections in pigeons (Columba livia) has been documented worldwide over the past 20 years; however, there are still no reports of PiCV detection in Brazil. This study identifies seven PiCV genomes obtained by high-throughput sequencing from domesticated pigeons of Southern Brazil and shows a high frequency of PiCV infection via quantitative real-time PCR. Phylogenetic classification was performed by maximum likelihood analysis of whole genomes, ORF V1 (Rep) and ORF C1 (Cap). The results show that whole-genome or Cap-based analysis allows for PiCV classification in five major branches (groups A to E), where Brazilian sequences are classified as A, C or D. Recombination analyzes were performed with Simplot and RDP4, and the results show that both Rep and Cap ORFs contain several recombination hotspots, indicating an important role for such events in PiCV evolution.",,"Loiko, M.

Because their populations are well established in urban and urban areas, they represent a potential reservoir of viruses that infect humans or pets from wildlife. In this study, we evaluated fecal virus of juvenile and adult foxes from peri-urban areas in central Croatia. The predominant mammalian viruses were fox picobirnavirus and parvovirus. The highest viral read count (N = 1412) was attributed to a novel fox circovirus and the complete viral genome was de novo assembled from high-throughput sequencing data. Fox circovirus is very similar to canine circoviruses identified in diseased dogs in the USA and Italy, and fox circovirus, a neurological disease recently discovered in the UK.

1240,Specificity of antibody against RD 114 viral polymerase,"The use of antiserum against RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDP) of type viruses has allowed separation of these enzymes from cellular enzymes that can use RNA templates for DNA synthesis. Such serums also allowed some degree of subclassing of the viruses themselves, as well as discrimination between other RDP-containing viruses. Thus, within the type C family, viper, chicken, and mammalian viruses are easily distinguished, while within the mammalian group, the polymerases of the two novel primate isolates, woolly monkey and gibbon monkey, appear to differ from viruses of lower mammals. The newly identified RD 114 virus, which is currently being evaluated as a human candidate virus, was also differentiated from sub-mammalian viruses by polymerase inhibition tests. The main internal protein of the RD 114 virus differs from all other type C viruses both antigenically and by virtue of a unique isoelectric point. In the absence of other criteria for species classification, it has been suggested that polymerase inhibition tests may provide evidence for a group of primate viruses that may hopefully include RD 114. If so, this would provide strong circumstantial evidence for the human origin of RD 114. This report describes experiments with a hyperimmune guinea pig antiserum prepared against purified RD 114 RDP. The RD 114 RDP appears to be more closely related to the RDP of the two primate viruses than the RDP of viruses from sub-mammalian and non-mammalian species.

Understanding the effects of antibiotics on bacterial communities in different gut regions is essential to understanding the full benefits and consequences of in-feed antibiotics. In this study, we identified lumenal and mucosal bacterial communities from the small intestine (ileum) and large intestine (caecum and colon) plus stool and characterized the effects of dietary antibiotics (chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine and penicillin (ASP250)) on the body. these communities. Metagenomic analyzes of 16S rRNA gene sequence and bacterial membership and functions revealed dramatic differences between small and large intestine locations, including enrichment of Firmicutes and phage-encoding genes in the ileum. The large intestine microbiota encoded numerous genes for degrading plant cell wall components and these genes were absent in the ileum. The mucosa-associated ileal microbiota harbors a greater diversity of bacteria than the lumen, but has similar membership to the mucosa of the large intestine; this suggests that most gut microbes may associate with the mucosa and act as a vaccine for the lumen. Adverse effects on the microbiota of the animals fed the antibiotic resulted in differentiation from those of the control animals and the ileum, Lachnobacterium spp. in all intestinal regions and resistance genes to antibiotics were not applied.

1244,Automatic classification of tailed bacteriophages according to their neck organization,"Background: The genetic diversity observed among bacteriophages remains a major barrier to the identification of homologs and comparison of their functional modules. Although several classes of homologous proteins can be identified in the structural module that contribute to head and tail structure, proteins attached from head to tail (or neck) are usually more distinct. Nevertheless, molecular analyzes of several tailed phages belonging to different morphological classes suggested that only a limited number of structural solutions were used to generate a functional virion. To challenge this hypothesis and analyze protein diversity in the virion neck, we developed a specific computational strategy to deal with sequence variation in phage proteins. We searched for homologues of a set of proteins encoded in the structural module using a phage learning database. Results: Using a combination of iterative profile-profile comparison and gene context analyses, we have shown that we can identify a range of head, neck and tail proteins in the most tailed bacteriophages of our database. Classification of phages based on neck protein sequences identifies 4 Types corresponding to known morphological subfamilies. Further analysis of the most abundant Type 1 yields 10 Clusters characterized by consistent sets of head, neck and tail proteins. We developed Virfam, a web server that automatically identifies proteins of the phage head-neck-tail module and assigns phages to the most closely related phage cluster. This server was tested with 624 new phages from the NCBI database. 93% of tailed and unclassified phages can be assigned to our head-neck-tail-based categories, thus highlighting the large representation of virion architectures identified. Species and Clusters describe consistent subgroups of Caudovirales that are associated with various virion traits. Results: Our method and web server is capable of automatically classifying most tailed phages, detecting their structural modules, assigning a function to a group of head, neck and tail genes, providing their morphological subtypes, and localizing these phages within a ""head-neck"". -tail""-based classification. It should enable the analysis of large phage genome sets. In particular, it should contribute to the classification of the abundant unknown viruses found in the assembled contigs of metagenomic samples.",,"Lopes, A.;Tavares, P.;Petit, M.

1245,Mapping of subgroup epitopes of the rotavirus protein VP6,"VP6, the most abundant protein of rotaviruses, contains epitopes that allow these viruses to be classified into four subgroups (SG) based on the presence or absence of two epitopes, designated I and II. Subgroup-specific epitopes are conformational and appear to be present on the trimeric but not on the monomeric VP6. In VP6, we identified some amino acids that determine the reactivity of the subgroup-specific mAbs 255/60 and 631/9. A single amino acid mutation at positions 172 (Met to Ala) or 305 (Asn to Ala) was sufficient to change the subgroup specificity of the human rotavirus Wa VP6 protein from SGII to SGI/II, as any of these mutations resulted in the protein's SGII mAb 631/ 9 must be recognized by the SGI mAb 255/60 while retaining its capacity to interact with it. In the case of the SGII epitope, mutation of two adjacent amino acids (Ala305 Asn306 to Asn305 Ala306) in the porcine rotavirus YM VP6 protein (SGI) enabled the protein to be efficiently recognized by the SGII mAb 631/9, while the YM VP6 protein increased its capacity to interact with mAb 255/60 . These results suggest that both subsets of mAbs interact with an antigenic domain in VP6, which consists of at least two regions of the protein, and may be close in the constructed VP6 trimer, although distant in the linear sequence.",,"Lopez, S.;Espinosa, R.;Greenberg, H.

1248,Innate immune recognition of poxviral vaccine vectors,"The study of poxviruses pioneered the field of vaccinia after Jenner's remarkable discovery that 'vaccinating' with phylogenetically related cowpox virus confers immunity against a devastating disease such as smallpox. The study of smallpox viruses continues to enrich the field of virology, as the global eradication of smallpox provides a unique example of the potential of effective immunization. Other smallpox viruses have since been developed as vaccine vectors for clinical and veterinary applications and include modified vaccine virus strains such as Ankara and NYVAC, as well as avipox viruses, avian pox virus, and canary pox virus. Despite the empirical development of poxvirus-based vectored vaccines, it is only now emerging that we need to better understand how the innate arm of the immune system drives adaptive immunity against smallpox viruses and how this knowledge relates to vaccine design strategies. topics covered in this article.

1249,Classical swine fever virus diversity and evolution,"By analyzing nucleotide sequence data generated from both the E2 (gp55) and NS5B genes of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), we were able to separate 115 CSFV isolates into two main groups, in addition to previously published data from the 5'NCR. groups, five subgroups and two different isolates. Further separation was possible with the analysis of sequence data from the E2 region. Three sequencing-based methods were compared with monoclonal antibody (MAb) typing and limited restriction enzyme (RE) mapping. Although both the MAb and RE methods confirmed the previous classification, the resolution was lower. We estimated an approximate evolutionary rate for CSFV from an analysis of virus variation observed in a single geographic area over a 6-year period. Applying this recommended ratio to each of our deduced CSFV subgroups allowed us to calculate approximate divergence dates for each subgroup.",,"Lowings, P.;Ibata, G.;Needham, J.;Paton, D.",1996.0,,,0
1250,Evaluation of a monoclonal antibody panel for Lyssavirus typing in Mexico.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a panel of eight antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies developed in Europe to identify different strains of rabies virus isolated from various animal species from various geographic regions in Mexico. 51 virus-positive brain tissue samples from various animal species and humans were studied. Material from these samples was used to infect mice whose brains were then tested by indirect immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibodies described above. Strains of the virus showing antigenic variations were sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to confirm the results. No mouse brain samples showed a pattern of antigenic reactivity indicating the presence of a Lyssavirus other than the classical rabies virus. However, four antigenic variations were found from the classical rabies serotype 1. The antibodies panel was judged useful for rapid classification of the rabies virus in Mexico. Autochthonous antigenic variations are likely to arise among strains circulating in that country; this is a scenario that may explain some of the failures observed with certain vaccines. Therefore, there is a need to produce antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies with site-specific rabies virus strains.",,"Loza-Rubio, E.;Vargas, R.;HernÃ¡ndez, E.;Batalla, D.;Aguilar-SetiÃ©n, A.",1995.0,,,0

1252,In vitro and in vivo identification of structural and sequence elements in the 5' untranslated region of Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus required for internal initiation.,"Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoPV) is a newly identified insect virus classified as a putative member of the genus Iflavirus. The virus has a large, positive-sense RNA genome that encodes a single polyprotein that shares physicochemical properties with those of its members. It is from the Picornaviridae family. The 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) plays an important role in picornavirus translation initiation as it contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation. To investigate translation in EoPV, a wide variety of mutations were designed within the 5' UTR and the effects of these changes were studied in vitro and in vivo using a bicistronic structure. The results showed that deletions within the first 63 nt had little effect on IRES activity, while core IRES function was located within the C and D root loops, as their removal significantly abrogated IRES activity. In contrast to these findings, removal of root ring G containing two cryptic AUGs resulted in a notable increase in IRES activity, which was further explored by site-directed mutagenesis at these two positions. It was also confirmed that initiation of protein synthesis occurs at AUG6 (position 391-394) and not at AUG just downstream of the polypyrimidine pathway. Mutation of the polypyrimidine pathway (CCTTTC) had a slight effect on EoPV IRES activity. Also, mutations of the RAAA motif led to an approximately 40% reduction in IRES activity in vitro, but these results were not supported by in vivo experiments. In conclusion, this study reveals that the EoPV IRES is unique, although it shares features with type II IRESs.",,"Lu, J.;Zhang, J. M.;Wang, X. C.;Jiang, H.;Liu, C. F.;Hu, Y. Y.",2006.0,Dec,,0
1253,Phylogenetic analysis of eight genes of the H9N2 subtype influenza virus: A mainland Chinese strain with genes from early circulating isolates.,"The H9N2 subtype influenza virus has become widespread worldwide and in China. Previous studies have shown that at least three sublineages have been established in terrestrial poultry of the Eurasian bird. In this presentation, eight full-length genes of an H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (Ck/SH/F/98) were obtained. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies were performed by comparing eight genes with those of all H9N2 strains available from GenBank. The results showed that four genes of Ck/SH/F/98 (genes HA, NA, M and NS) were included in the subsequence represented by the early mainland Chinese strain, Ck/BJ/1/94. However, the other four RNP genes of Ck/SH/F/98 did not show close association with those of the three known sublineage viruses. Therefore, Ck/SH/F/98 was a natural reasorant between different sublineages. In addition, comparison showed that Ck/SH/F/98 could be a putative precursor of a later isolate Dk/ST/1605/01 from southern China with at least six closely related genes, both of which display Ck/SH genes. . /F/98 and the first isolates were always in circulation. Further comparison in terms of molecular markers of HA1 species specificity revealed that DK/ST/1605/01 also more closely resembled Ck/SH/F/98 than a previous common duck strain. The results supported the idea of bidirectional transmission between land and waterfowl, emphasizing the importance of raising concerns about the natural evolution of all eight genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Lu, J.

1254,Turkey Fecal Microbial Community Structure and Functional Gene Diversity Revealed by 16S rRNA Gene and Metagenomic Sequences,"The primary aim of this study was to better understand the microbial composition and functional genetic diversity associated with turkey fecal populations. To achieve this, libraries of 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic clones were sequenced from turkey stool samples. Analysis of 382 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the most abundant bacteria were closely related to Lactobacillales (47%), Bacillales (31%), and Clostridiales (11%). The sequences Actinomycetales, Enterobacteriales, and Bacteroidales were also identified, but represented a smaller fraction of the community. Analysis of 379 metagenomic sequences showed that most of the clones were similar to bacterial protein sequences (58%). Bacteriophage (10%) and avian viruses (3%) sequences were also represented. Most of all metagenomic clones potentially encoding bacterial proteins were similar to low G+C Gram-positive bacterial proteins, particularly from Lactobacillales (50%), Bacillales (11%), and Clostridiales (8%). Bioinformatic analyzes revealed the presence of genes encoding membrane proteins, lipoproteins, hydrolases, and functional genes associated with the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds. The results of this study further confirmed the dominance of Firmicutes in the avian gut and highlighted the value of combining 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing data analysis to study the microbial composition of bird fecal microbial communities.",,"Lu, J.

1255,Goose genome sequence leads to insights into waterfowl evolution and susceptibility to fatty liver.,"Background: Geese were domesticated more than 6,000 years ago, making them one of the first domesticated poultry. Geese have rapid growth, disease resistance and high liver lipid storage capacity and can be easily fed with roughage. Here we sequence and analyze the whole genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it to that of terrestrial bird species. Results: The draft sequence of the entire goose genome was obtained by shotgun sequencing and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics shows that significant differences occur between the geese genome and those of other terrestrial bird species, particularly in terms of major histocompatibility complex, Myxovirus resistance, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other genes related to disease resistance in geese. In addition, analysis of transcriptome data also reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in geese susceptibility to fatty liver disease and associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low cholesterol levels. The results of this study suggest that deletion of the goose lep gene may be the result of positive selection, thus allowing the liver to adopt energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration. Conclusions: This is the first report describing the complete goose genome sequence and adds to the available genomic resources for studying waterfowl. The findings in this study are useful not only for genetic breeding programs, but also for the study of lipid metabolism disorders.",,"Lu, L.;Chen, Y.;Wang, Z.;Li, X.;Chen, W.;Tao, Z.;Shen, J.;Tian, Y.;Wang, D.;Li, G.;Chen, L.;Chen, F.;Fang, D.;Yu, L.;Sun, Y.;Ma, Y.;Li, J.;Wang, J.",2015.0,,10.1186/s13059-015-0652-y,0

1257,Beyond whole genome consensus: unraveling PRRSV phylogenomics using next-generation sequencing technologies,"The highly heterogeneous swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of an economically important swine disease with characteristic symptoms of reproductive losses in breeding sows and respiratory diseases in young piglets. The virus can be broadly divided into genotypes 1 and 2, similar to Europe and North America, respectively. In addition to this intra-species variability, the influence of coexisting viral half-species on disease development has received much attention recently; thanks to the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Genomic data generated from the enormous sequencing capacities of NGS have allowed PRRSV to be studied at an unprecedented rate and detail. Unlike traditional sequencing methods that require knowledge of conserved regions, NGS allows de novo assembly of whole viral genomes. Evolutionary variations from different genotypic strains provide valuable information about functionally important regions of the virus. With the advancement of advanced bioinformatics tools, ultra-deep NGS technologies enable low-frequency co-evolving quasispecies detection.

1258,Genomic variation in macrophage cultured European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus Olot/91 revealed using ultra-deep next-generation sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a disease with significant economic impact worldwide. The etiological agent of this disease is the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Increasing evidence suggests that microevolution within a coexisting half-species population can lead to high sequence heterogeneity in PRRSV. RESULTS: We developed a pipeline based on an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing approach to first construct the complete genome of a European PRRSV strain Olot/9 cultured on macrophages and then capture rare variants representing a mixed half-species population. Olot/91 differs by approximately 5% from the reference Lelystad strain, and a total of 88 variants were detected in the mixed population with frequencies as low as 1%. These variants include 16 non-synonymous variants concentrated in genes encoding structural and non-structural proteins; Including glycoproteins 2a and 5. CONCLUSION: Using an ultra-deep sequencing methodology, the complete genome of Olot/91 was constructed without any prior knowledge of the sequence. Rare variants that make up small fractions of the heterogeneous PRRSV population can be successfully detected to allow further investigation of microevolutionary events.",,"Lu, Z.

1260,Identification of viruses with two- and three-part double-stranded RNA genomes in the stool of children with gastroenteritis,"Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of nucleic acid extracted from stool specimens of children with diarrhea revealed the presence of group A rotavirus in 50 (23.4%) of 214 specimens tested and group C rotavirus in 1 (0.5%) of 214 specimens tested. Another example demonstrated the presence of three bands (with apparent length of 2.92, 2.37 and 1.32 kbp) which were shown to be composed of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by enzymatic digestion analysis. It was demonstrated by electron microscopy that the sample contained virus particles with a diameter of 32-34 nm. Based on morphology and genomic features, this virus has so far only been detected in chickens by Leite et al. In 1990 and tentatively named 'picotirnavirus'. A sample containing a 'picobirnavirus' was also detected from the same group of 214 individuals. Thus, small icosahedral viruses with two or three segmented dsRNA genomes appear to infect humans.

Cameroon offers a unique opportunity for epidemiological studies as there is no FMD vaccination. To gain insight into the natural ecology of the virus, we conducted a prospective study involving serological, antigenic and genetic aspects of FMD virus (FMDV) infections among different livestock production systems in the Far North of Cameroon. We found serological evidence of FMDV infection in more than 75% of the sampled animals, with no significant prevalence differences observed among the sampled groups (i.e. market, resident, cross-border trade, and mobile). We also found reactive antibodies to five of the seven FMDV serotypes (A, O, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) among the sampled animals. Finally, we were able to genetically characterize viruses from clinical and subclinical FMD infections in Cameroon. Serotype O viruses are divided into two topotypes (West and East Africa). SAT2 viruses were grouped with viruses from Central and North Africa, particularly within the subclade that caused the major epidemic in North Africa in 2012, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This research will guide future interventions for the control of FMD, such as improved diagnosis, guidance for vaccine formulation, and epidemiological understanding to support progressive control of FMD in Cameroon.",,"Ludi, A.;Ahmed, Z.;Pomeroy, L.

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial 3D genomic region showed that a bat virus belongs to the Enterovirus G (EV-G, formerly Porcine enterovirus B) strain. Bat infection was promoted by 1.1 x 106 RNA copies with relatively high concentrations of EV-G per gram of feces. All other bat viruses belonged to either the bat-related genus Mischivirus or an unclassified group Picornaviridae remotely related to the genus Sapelovirus. Members of this unclassified sapelovirus-related group had RNA secondary structures in their 3-untranslated region, similar to structures unique to enteroviruses and occurring in bat-associated coronaviruses, suggesting ancient recombination events. Based on sequence distances, several picornaviruses from European and Chinese bats were likely homologous, suggesting connectivity of virus populations. Because of their high mutation rate and diversity, picornaviruses can be useful tools for bat and virus ecology studies.",,"Lukashev, A. N.;Corman, V.

1263,Evolutionary relationships among parvoviruses: virus-host coevolution among autonomous primate parvoviruses and links between adeno-associated and avian parvoviruses.,"While the current classification of parvoviruses is based on virus host range and helper virus dependence, little data is available on evolutionary relationships between viruses. We identified and analyzed 472 parvovirus sequences with (almost) full-length genomes of 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the Parvoviridae family. Our phylogenetic analysis of open reading frames as well as full-length genomes distinguished three evolutionary groups of parvoviruses from vertebrates: (i) human helper dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) bovine, squirrel and autonomic primate parvoviruses, including human viruses B19 and V9; and (iii) parvoviruses from rodents (except squirrels), carnivores and pigs. Each of these three evolutionary groups can be subdivided in the evolutionary history of parvoviruses, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and multiple interspecies transitions. No parvovirus from invertebrates clustered with vertebrate parvoviruses. Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among parvoviruses, independent evolution of their genes, and recombination between parvoviruses from rodents. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of autonomous human and monkey parvoviruses exactly matched the topology of the primate family tree, based on analysis of primate mitochondrial DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were evolutionarily linked to avian parvoviruses and not to other palmate parvoviruses. Two lineages of human parvoviruses may have originated from independent ancient zoonotic infections. Our results provide an argument for the reclassification of Parvovirinae based on evolutionary relationships between viruses.",,"Lukashov, V.

1264,Evolutionary relationships among Astroviridae,"All available sequences for members of the Astroviridae family were collected to examine evolutionary relationships among astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two well-established groups: one containing mammalian astroviruses, ovine astrovirus an outlier, and the other containing avian astroviruses. All virus types and serotypes of human astroviruses represented individual lineages within the tree. All human viruses clustered separately and together from non-human viruses, which oppose their common evolutionary origin and continued animal-to-human transitions. The branching order of mammalian astroviruses was the opposite of that of the host species, suggesting at least two interspecies transmission, possibly involving pigs, cats, and humans, via intermediate hosts. Analysis of synonym (Ds) and non-synonymous (Da) distances revealed that negative selection predominates in the evolution of astroviruses, with Ds:Da ratios up to 46 for comparison of the most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of all open reading frames (ORFs) based on D's resulted in loss of tree structures in virus species and ORF2, even with serotypes of human astroviruses and branched from almost a single node, suggesting their ancient divergence. Strong selection against nonsynonymous substitutions, hence its low number, is not evidence of a recent divergence between lineages and, together with the location of the oldest extant human astrovirus strain (1971) away from the common node of serotype 4, suggesting that intraserotype diversification arose from an earlier date. progress.",,"Lukashov, V.

1265,In-Silico Identification of Plant miRNAs in Mammalian Breast Milk Exosomes - A Small Step Forward?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting protein translation or targeting mRNA cleavage. They play many important roles in living organism cells; however, knowledge of the functions of miRNAs has become more extensive upon recent reports of their identification in biological fluids and the abundance of plant-derived miRNAs in human plasma and serum. With these findings in mind, we performed a rigorous bioinformatics analysis of publicly available, raw data from high-throughput sequencing studies on the composition of miRNAs in human and pig breast milk exosomes to determine the fraction of food-derived miRNAs. Various processing and filtering steps were applied to improve accuracy and avoid false positives. The above-mentioned analyzes identified 35 and 17 miRNA species belonging to 25 and 11 MIR families, respectively. In human samples, the highest abundance levels were ath-miR166a, pab-miR951, ptc-miR472a and bdi-miR168, while zma-miR168a, zma-miR156a and ath-miR166a were identified in pig breast milk exosomes. largest quantities. Consensus prediction and annotations of potential human targets for selected plant miRNAs suggest that the aforementioned molecules can interact with mRNAs encoding several transcription factors, protein receptors, transporters and immune-related proteins, thereby potentially affecting the human organism. Taken together, the presented analysis shows evidence of abundant plant miRNAs in mammalian breast milk exosomes and also points to new possibilities arising from this discovery.",,"Lukasik, A.;Zielenkiewicz, P.",2014.0,Jun,,0

Replication of the virus was not altered by 5 iodo 2' deoxyuridine, suggesting that it is a ribovirus. The infectivity of the virus was not destroyed by chloroform and remained stable for 90 minutes at 56°C. The virus bound to the CEK cell monolayer at a maximum of 75 minutes had a retention period of 9 to 10 hours before virus maturation and release. Immunofluorescence studies of infected cells showed that the first antigen was detected 6 hours after infection and all fluorescent antigen was confined to the cytoplasm.

Despite the endemic nature of BPV infections, identification of BPV types in Brazilian cattle is still only sporadic. However, in a recent analysis of a partial segment of the L1 gene, we observed remarkable diversity among the detected BPV strains. The aim of this study was to determine the phylogenetic position of the previously identified wild strain BPV/BR-UEL2 detected in the Brazilian state of ParanÃ¡. Since previous analysis of the partial L1 sequence showed that this strain is most closely related to BPV type 4, strain-specific primers were designed. Phylogenetic analysis using full L1 ORF sequences revealed that BPV/BR-UEL2 is associated with BPV types classified in the Xipapillomavirus genus and shares the highest L1 nucleotide sequence similarity with BPV type 4 (78%).

Recently, the severe acute form has only been associated with some hypervirulent BVDV-2 strains. This article reports the detection of BVDV-1b associated with an acute and fatal BVD outbreak in a Brazilian cattle herd. Depression, anorexia, watery diarrhea, sialorrhea and malaise were observed in six cattle. One of these animals was evaluated for laboratory, clinical and pathological changes. Laboratory findings were not specific; clinically the animal was frail, with dehydration and erosive mouth lesions. Pathological changes were predominant in the tongue, esophagus and rumen. An RT-PCR assay using primers was performed to partially amplify the 5â€² untranslated regions (5â€²UTR) of the BVDV genome and identified BVDV in all clinical samples analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of lymph node-derived BVDV revealed that this strain clustered within BVDV subtype 1b.

The S1 genes of these isolated strains and vaccine strains showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 65.2% to 82% and amino acid homologies ranging from 58.4% to 81.9%. Meanwhile, the mainly nephropathogenic Chinese IBV strains isolated in this study can be divided into six variant strains (CH I-CH VI), and the current vaccine strains used in China constituted the Mass variant strain, which is evolutionarily distant from the Chinese isolates. Furthermore, CK/CH/GD/NC10, CK/CH/GD/KP10 and our previous isolates TC07-2 formed the CH VI lineage, which showed greater evolutionary distances than other strains.

1273,Pathogenicity and genomic characterization of a pseudorabies virus variant isolated from the Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig population in China.,"Pseudorabies (PR) or Aujeszky disease (AD) is a worldwide economically important viral disease caused by the pseudorabies virus (PRV). Recently, PR outbreaks have occurred in large herds of Bartha-K61-vaccinated pigs in many regions of China. Here, we isolated a PRV variant named TJ strain from a Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig farm in China, evaluated the pathogenicity of the TJ strain in susceptible animals, and analyzed its complete genomic sequence obtained by 454 pyrosequencing. The inoculation-forced experiment in sheep showed that the classical Bartha-K61 vaccine could not provide full protection against challenge with the PRV TJ strain. In mice, the 50% lethal dose (LD<inf>50</inf>) of strain TJ (10<sup>2.3</sup> TCID<inf>50</inf>) was lower than the conventional one. PRV SC strain (10<sup>3.0</sup> TCID<inf>50</inf>). Also, the TJ strain exhibited higher mortality for pigs compared to the SC strain. The genome of the PRV TJ strain was determined to be 143,642bp long, encoding 67 open reading frames. The TJ strain clustered on an independent branch with some recent PRV isolates from China in the phylogenetic tree, which is relatively distant from previous PRV isolates. The TJ strain showed unique variations in viral proteins that play a key role in the viral replication cycle. Taken together, the TJ strain is a highly pathogenic PRV variant with unique molecular signatures. More studies are needed to investigate the relationship between the virulence change of the PRV variant and the sequence differences.",,"Luo, Y.;Li, N.;Cong, X.;Wang, C.

It was isolated in specific pathogen-free eggs and molecularly characterized in the hypervariable region of the virus protein (VP). From GenBank or previously reported and vaccine strains in Italy. The new genotype displays distinctive molecular features at key positions of the VP2 hypervariable region affecting charged or potentially glycosylated amino acids that are virtually associated with significant changes in virus properties.

Based on multiple sequence alignment, several characteristic point mutations were detected in the open reading frames of the Chinese isolates. In addition, two deletions and one insertion were identified at the unique short region and terminal repeat short region junctions in Chinese isolates, and the insertion was a feature of the new Chinese isolates. According to a phylogenetic analysis, the GaHV-2 genome has diverged significantly over the past two decades in China. Based on the internal repeat long region, the new isolates were closely related to very virulent or very virulent plus strains. In addition, new Chinese isolates were separated from previously isolated J-1 and 814 strains. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that Chinese GaHV-2 strains contain characteristic sequences, particularly novel isolates. The genetic variation observed in new Chinese GaHV-2 strains over the past two decades may be related to the observed changes in pathogenic traits and virulence.",,"Lv, H.;Zhang, Y.;Sun, G.;Bao, K.;Gao, Y.;Qi, X.;Cui, H.;Wang, Y.;Li, K.;Gao, L.;Pan, Q.;Wang, X.;Liu, C.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.027,0
1277,Gene expression analysis of pig whole blood cells infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus using high-throughput sequencing technology.,"Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. FMDV infects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs, sheep, goats, cattle and various wildlife species and remains a major threat to the livestock industry worldwide. In this study, a transcriptome analysis of whole blood from FMDV-infected pigs was performed using the double-ended Illumina sequencing technique to understand the interactions between the pathogen and its host cells. During infection with FMDV, a total of 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 110 up-regulated genes and 10 down-regulated genes. Gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genes (KEGG) enrichment were performed to further investigate DEGs involved in interactions between virus and host. The GO annotation showed enrichment of a number of DEGs in categories involved in host-virus interactions, such as stimulus response, immune system process, and regulation of biological process. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that DEGs are primarily involved in the ribosome signaling pathway and immune-related signaling pathways. Ten DEGs, including immune-related genes BTK1, C1QB, TIMD4, and CXCL10, were selected and validated using quantitative PCR; this showed that the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with the results of in silico expression analysis. In conclusion, this study presents the first transcriptome analysis of FMDV-infected porcine whole blood cells, and the results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the diagnosis and control of FMD as well as the interactions between FMDV and host cells.",,"Lv, J.;Ding, Y.;Liu, X.;Pan, L.;Zhang, Z.;Zhou, P.;Zhang, Y.;Hu, Y.",2018.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0200081,0

About 90 viruses have been isolated, including 24 new for science. Newly recognized infections of vertebrates, including humans, have been described. Many unusual epidemic situations were analysed. Persistent efforts have been established to prevent bioterrorist activities and their consequences. Widespread outbreaks of epidemics with unusually high death rates have occurred in southern Russia over the past four years, such as West Nile fever (WNF; i.e. fever caused by West Nile virus) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). We determined infection rates in humans, domestic and wild animals, mosquitoes and ticks from natural and synanthropic biocenoses [Text note: ""Synanthropic"" means roughly all species that live in or near humans (see lice, fleas) as in homes (see house mice). ), parks (cf.

Prior to the onset of the current emergence of epidemic WNF, three genetic variants of this virus had been isolated in the USSR, two African and one Indian. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences of epidemic strains showed significant similarity with strains from the USA and Israel and differences from strains isolated in the same USSR regions 20-30 years ago. In addition to the strains of genotype 1, we isolated strains of the second and third strains and a strain of a fourth genetic variant. The nucleotide differences of these strains from all three genotypes were approximately 30%.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed on Coxsackie-virus B5 (CVB5) isolated during this outbreak. Methods: Five throat swabs, 21 stools, and 14 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 29 inpatients during this outbreak. Viral isolation and real-time RT-PCR were then performed for all samples. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A 16 (CA16), and pan-enterovirus (PE) viral nucleic acid were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The phylogenetic tree based on all VP1 sequences was constructed among CVB5 isolates from 2 stool and 3 CSF samples of 5 hospitalized patients and other published data from GenBank. Results: Real-time RT-PCR results showed that PE nucleic acid positive rates of throat swab, stool, and CSF samples were 60.0% (3/5), 61.9% (13/21) and 85.7% (12/14), respectively. . All of these samples were negative for EV71 and CA16. The isolation rates of throat swab, stool and CSF samples were 20.0% (1/5), 25.0% (5/21) and 29.0% (4/14), respectively. With both VP1 and 5'-UTR sequences and molecular typing, BLAST showed that CVB5 is the main pathogen. Analysis among 5 positive isolates based on complete VP1 sequences showed 97.9% - 99.5% homology. Data from homologous comparisons showed that these isolates had the highest nucleotide acid identity with the Changchun CVB5 CC10/10/Changchun strain (97.1% vs 98.1%), which caused an outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Changchun in 2010. and lower identity (89.0% vs. 89.6% and 91.8% vs. 92.5%) with strain COXB5/Henan/2010 and 03001N isolated from Pingdingshan, Henan in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

It is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), a double-stranded (ds) RNA virus classified in the Orbivirus genus, family Reoviridae. There are at least twenty-four BTV serotypes worldwide, of which five (1, 2, 4, 9 and 16) have been recently identified in Europe. BTV infects ruminants and its distribution in temperate and tropical regions of the world is dependent on the activity and abundance of some vector competent species of Culicoides sandflies. The outer capsid protein of BTV, VP2, is a major protective antigen and the primary determinant of the virus serotype. For the first time, the authors completed sequence analysis of full-length VP2 genes from reference strains for each of the 24 BTV serotypes and their amino acid sequences were extracted. Multiple alignments of VP2 gene (protein) sequences revealed that the level of nucleotide (amino acid) sequence variation between serotypes ranged from 29% (23%) to 59% (73%), confirming that segment 2/VP2 was the most variable.

1288,Genome-Wide Identification and Quantification of Cis- and trans-Regulated Genes Responding to Marek's Disease Virus Infection by Analysis of Allele-Specific Expression,"Marek's disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpes virus. Selecting for increased genetic resistance to MD is a control strategy that can enhance vaccine control measures. To identify high-confidence candidate MD resistance genes, we performed a genome-wide screen for allele-specific expression (ASE) between the F(1) lines of two inbred chicken lines that differed significantly in MD resistance. High-throughput sequencing was used to initially profile transcriptomes from pools of uninfected and infected individuals 4 days after infection to identify any gene that exhibits ASE in response to MDV infection. RNA sequencing identified 22,655 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3,773 genes, of which 5,360 exhibit significant allelic imbalance. Illumina GoldenGate assays were then used to quantify regulated regulatory variation in the gene (cis) and elsewhere in the genome (trans) by examining the expression differences between F(1) individuals and artificial F(1) RNA pools over six time periods in 1,536. Allelic imbalance as a result of Cis-regulatory changes from the most important SNPs identified by RNA sequencing was confirmed in 861 of the 1,233 GoldenGate assays successfully examined. We also identified seven genes that only show trans-regulation in infected animals and ~500 SNPs that show a complex interaction between cis- and trans-regulatory changes. Our results suggest that ASE analyzes are a powerful approach to identify regulatory variation responsible for differences in transcript abundance in genes underlying complex traits. And genes with SNPs exhibiting ASE provide a strong basis for further investigating causal polymorphisms and genetic mechanisms for MD resistance. Finally, the methods used here to identify specific genes and SNPs have practical implications for applying marker-assisted selection to complex traits that are difficult to measure in agricultural species, while differences in expression are expected to control some of the phenotypic variance.",,"Maceachern, S.;Muir, W.

1289,"Potential strategies for the control of blue tongue, a viral disease transmitted by Culicoides of ruminant livestock and wildlife, which has emerged globally.","Bluetongue (BT) is a non-zoonotic arboviral disease of some wild and domesticated species of ungulates. The causative agent, the bluetongue virus (BTV), spreads to temperate and tropical regions of the world by biting Culicoides midges. Control of BTV infection is complicated by the large number of virus serotypes and the ubiquity of its sandfly vector and its opportunistic feeding behavior. The global distribution of BTV infection has changed recently, perhaps in part due to climatic influences on sandfly species living in different regions. The purpose of this review is to evaluate realistic strategies that can be used to control or prevent future outbreaks of BT and other Culicoides-transmitted diseases. More importantly, optimal control of emerging, rapidly evolving arbovirus diseases such as IT will require integrated countermeasures that reduce all aspects of the virus transmission cycle.

1291,Novel molecular mechanisms of virus-mediated carcinogenesis: oncogenic transformation of cells by retroviral structural protein Envelope,"Classified within retroviruses, RNA tumor viruses have been isolated and described over the past 100 years since the first was reported in 1908 to induce tumors in a variety of animals, including chickens, mice, and rats, and even humans. Tumor viruses have historically been divided into two groups, acute transforming RNA tumor viruses and non-acute RNA tumor viruses. Acute transforming RNA tumor viruses are essentially replication-defective and rapidly induce tumors by expressing viral oncogenes captured from the cellular genome in host cells. The first oncogene derived from the Rous sarcoma virus was the src non-receptor tyrosine kinase identified to play important roles in signal transduction. On the other hand, non-acute RNA tumor viruses consisting only of the gag, pro, pol and env regions but do not carry oncogenes are replication competent and can activate cellular proto-oncogenes by inserting them near the viral long terminal repeat. Proto-oncogenes induce tumors with a long incubation period called promoter insertion. These molecular mechanisms are thought to induce tumors. However, very recently several reports have disclosed that the retroviral structural protein Envelope can directly induce tumors in vivo and transform cells in vitro. These are very unusual examples of natural retroviral structural proteins with transformation potential. In this review, we look at the history of oncogenic retrovirus research and summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by retrovirus Envelope proteins.",,"Maeda, N.;Yoshikai, Y.",2007.0,,10.2222/jsv.57.159,0

Here we present serological and virological evidence of infection in various animals in homes in Bali, Indonesia, in 2005 and 2006. Serum and swab samples from poultry, pigs, dogs and cats were collected using a stratified random sampling design. Antibodies to HPAIV-H5 were detected in sera using the standard hemagglutination inhibition test, and the presence of HPAIV-H5N1 in swabs was confirmed using the egg inoculation technique, a hemagglutination test, and molecular methods. The phylogeny and virus distribution were inferred using BEAST and SPREAD software. The results showed that the seroprevalence of backyard chickens to waterfowl, poultry to pigs and study year varied significantly across the province (P < 0.001). Seroprevalence in dogs and cats was 1.85% and 7.50%, respectively. In addition, HPAIV-H5N1 has been isolated in all species except cats. Isolation rates also varied between species and between years of surveillance. Virus distribution analysis showed that isolates from Bali grouped into two major branches with good statistical support.

The FMD-causing agent was thus the first vertebrate virus discovered shortly after the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus of plants. It was not until 1920 that Waldmann and Pape created a suitable animal model for the study of FMD virus using guinea pigs, and later with the development of in vitro cell culture systems for the virus, the chemical and physical properties of FMD. The virus was elucidated throughout the rest of the twentieth century, culminating in a full description of the three-dimensional structure of the virion in 1989. FMD virus is classified as a species in the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. The virus is acid labile and its genome RNA contains a characteristic polyC pathway located approximately 360 nucleotides from the 5-² terminal. There are seven main serotypes and numerous subtypes in the world. The World Reference Laboratory for FMD is located in Pirbright, Surrey, UK and undertakes surveillance of FMD outbreaks through serotyping as well as genotyping of virus isolates. A major FMD outbreak occurred in the UK in 2001 and was caused by a virulent FMD virus strain that had its origins in Asia.

It was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012 and has since been discovered in the United States, Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, and Laos. PDCoV was experimentally proven to cause diarrhea in pigs and was positive in pigs from Guangdong, southern China. In our study, 252 fecal and intestinal samples from suckling piglets and pigs with diarrhea were investigated for common enteric viruses. We found prevalences of PDCoV (21.8%), swine epidemic diarrhea virus (65.5%), infectious gastroenteritis virus (0%), rotavirus group A (25.0%), and porcine cobuvirus (68.7%). We isolated 13 PDCoV strains and discovered that PDCoV infections are often coinfections with cobuvirus rather than the commonly associated swine epidemic diarrhea virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene and N gene revealed that 11 of the 13 PDCoV strains belonged to the Chinese ancestry. As for the left two strains, a single strain (CHN-GD16-05) belonged to American and Korean ancestry, while another strain (CHN-GD16-03) was similar to a Thai strain, but only in the S gene.

1300,Avian Flu Virus Review,"Influenza viruses are classified as A, B or C based on the antigenicity of their nucleoproteins and matrix proteins. Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of two of their surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. All avian influenza viruses are type A viruses. While most avian influenza viruses are avirulent, a limited number of subtypes cause serious illness in birds. This difference in pathogenicity between avian influenza viruses is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site of viral hemagglutinin. Since 1997, there have been numerous reports of human infection by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. The acquisition of the ability to cause human-to-human transmission by avian flu viruses would expose the human population to a flu epidemic crisis. Here, we review the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses in humans. [References: 8]",,"Makino, A.;Kawaoka, Y.",2005.0,Dec,,0

This study investigated cellular miRNA expression profiles operating in response to influenza virus in the early phase of infection, which may be useful for understanding and control of viral infection. A549 cells were infected with different subtypes of influenza virus (pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). MiRNAs were extracted 24 hours after infection and then used for DNA library construction. All DNA libraries with different indices were pooled at equal concentration, followed by high-throughput sequencing based on the MiSeq platform. MiRNAs were identified and counted from sequencing data using MiSeq reporter software. miRNA expressions were classified as up- and down-regulated miRNAs compared to those found in uninfected cells. For the most part, each subtype of influenza A virus triggered upregulated responses in miRNA expression profiles. Hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-23b, and hsa-miR-30e* were up-regulated when infected with all three subtypes of influenza A virus. The target prediction results showed that virus infection can trigger genes in cellular process, metabolic process, developmental process and biological regulation. This study has provided some insight into cellular miRNA profiling in response to various subtypes of influenza A viruses that cause epidemics in the circulation and in the human population. Regulated miRNAs may be involved in virus-host interaction or host defense mechanism, which should be investigated for effective antiviral therapeutic interventions.",,"Makkoch, J.;Poomipak, W.;Saengchoowong, S.;Khongnomnan, K.;Praianantathavorn, K.;Jinato, T.;Poovorawan, Y.;Payungporn, S.",2016.0,Feb,,0

Reverse blot or conventional sequencing approaches have disadvantages in the study of 18S rRNA diversity, and a next-generation 454 sequencing approach has been investigated. The 18S rRNA gene was amplified using RLB primers linked to 96 unique sequence identifiers (MIDs). Theileria positive samples from African buffalo (672) and cattle (480) from South Africa were pooled in batches of 96 and sequenced using the GS Junior 454 sequencer to produce 825711 informative sequences. Sequences were extracted based on MIDs and analyzed to identify Theileria genotypes. While the genotypes observed in buffalo and cattle were confirmed in this study, no new genotypes were discovered. Genotypes showed specific geographic distributions, most likely linked to vector distributions. The host specificity of the buffalo and bovine genotypes was confirmed and the relative parasitemia trends as well as the prevalence data indicate preference for different hosts. Mixed infections are common in African buffalo, which carry more genotypes than cattle. Relational or exclusionary co-infection profiles were observed between genotypes that may have implications for speciation and systematic: more Theileria species than currently recognized may be found, particularly in cattle and buffalo. Analysis of the primers used for the diagnosis of Theileria parva shows that no new genotypes will be amplified by existing primer sets, confirming their specificity. T. parva SNP variants occurring in the 18S rRNA hypervariable region were confirmed. The next-generation sequencing approach is useful in gaining comprehensive knowledge of 18S rRNA diversity and prevalence of Theileria, and allows the evaluation of systematic and diagnostic analyzes based on the 18S gene.",,"Mans, B.

Many TSE agents are present in the environment and infection is controlled by public health measures. These include the disappearance of kuru with the end of ritual cannibalism, the dramatic reduction of epidemic bovine encephalopathy (BSE) by removal of contaminated feed, and the absence of endemic scrapie in geographically isolated Australian sheep with susceptible PrP genotypes. While prion protein modeling provides an intense focus on common types of protein misfolding and amyloid formation in a variety of organisms and diseases, the biological properties of infectious TSE agents and their recognition as foreign entities by the host reveal several fundamental new directions for efficient research. For example: (1) unrecognized microbial agents in the environmental metagenome that can cause latent neurodegenerative disease, (2) evolutionary social and protective functions of different amyloid proteins in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals, and (3) the innate immune response to stress as a beneficial amyloid formation (infectious and non-infectious).

The virus is classified into genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two strains (11 and 16) of the GI genotype have circulated widely in South America for decades. The GI-11 strain is a special South American strain, while the GI-16 strain is distributed in Asia, Europe, and South America. Here, we obtained the entire genome of two Uruguayan strains of the GI-11 and GI-16 strains using Illumina high-throughput sequencing.

The complete genomes of GI-11 and GI-16 strains have 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and have the same genomic organization. Phylogenetic discordance analysis reveals that both strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between the European Asian strains of the GI-16 lineage and the ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that retained the full-length S1 sequences of the parental strains but were extremely similar in the remainder of their genomes.

Using bovine digital dermatitis (DD) as a disease model, we present a new strategy to study the pathogenesis of complex infections. RESULTS: The strategy combines meta-transcriptomics with high-density peptide-microarray technology to screen for microbial genes expressed in vivo and host antibody response at the site of infection. Bacterial expression patterns supported the assumption that treponems were the major DD pathogens, but also showed active involvement of other phyla (primarily Bacteroidetes). Bacterial genes involved in chemotaxis, flagellar synthesis, and protection against oxidative and acidic stress were among the major factors defining the disease. RESULTS: The remarkable variation observed in bacterial expression, antigens, and host antibody responses among individual cows pointed to microbial variability as a hallmark of DD. Persistence of infection and DD re-infection in the same individual are common; therefore, high microbial diversity may impair the host's capacity to mount an efficient immune response and maintain immune memory against DD. Common antigenic markers identified here using high-density peptide microarray address this issue and may be useful for future preventive measures against DD.",,"Marcatili, P.;Nielsen, M.

VP2 hypervariable region. Although sequence data were obtained from samples collected from three different flocks over a 3-year period, only limited sequence variation was observed. Few nucleotide changes were silent and the deduced amino acid sequences were identical. Thus, the dominant virus population in the field appears to represent a homogeneous antigenic pool. Compared with the VP2 sequences of several IBDV strains, this dominant pool was found to be closely related to the highly virulent (vv) IBDV viruses identified in Europe and Asia. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the lead polyprotein coding sequence of a representative Tunisian isolate further confirmed its assignment to the vv genotype.

1318,Two fiber genes of nearly equal length are a common and distinctive feature of Fowl adenovirus C members.,"The whole genome or genome region was sequenced, containing two fiber genes of the two reference strains and a domain isolate representing both serotypes of Fowl adenovirus C. Two fiber genes were uncovered in the genomes of all three isolates. The fiber-1 and fiber-2 genes of several Fowl adenovirus C isolates were also sequenced. Serotypes 4 and 10 both have two fiber genes. The genome region containing the fiber gene was also sequenced for the reference strain of Fowl adenovirus B. Only one fiber gene was revealed in this strain. The predicted amino acid sequences were compared with currently published fiber sequences of different adenovirus isolates and an amino acid substitution within fiber-2 was detected in all Fowl adenovirus C isolates isolated from chickens with hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome compared to apathogenic isolates.

1319,When African swine fever plays out at home - Description of an epidemic in Namibia,"Introduction - African swine fever (ASF) is considered the most serious health threat to the global swine industry and is caused by a complex linear double-stranded DNA virus (ASF virus, ASFV) currently classified as the only member of the Asfarviridae family. . Purpose - To describe an outbreak of ASF that occurred in Namibia, where it was managed during international cooperation led by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e Molise ""G. Caporale"" (Teramo, Italy). Materials and methods - The ASF outbreak occurred in the Omaruru (Namibia) area and affected a small herd of about 100 pigs. The herd was part of a hunting farm and was very close to a small slaughterhouse where wild boars were recently slaughtered. The clinical manifestations begin abruptly and affect pigs of different age classes. Two pig autopsies were performed for diagnostic purposes: histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. Results - At autopsy, generalized hemorrhagic lesions were seen in all pigs examined. Microscopically, recent hemorrhages were observed with a severe lymphocytolysis in all lymphoid tissues. Laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis of ASF. The epidemic was finally resolved by stigma. Discussion - ASFV infection in Africa is strictly linked to the ""silvatic cycle"" involving wild boars and ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex. Mechanisms of transmission from wildlife and domestic pigs are still unclear, but ticks likely play a key role. Therefore, the ASF outbreak described here may represent the prototype of ASF in South Africa. In this region, eradication of ASFV seems unlikely and ASF control should focus on biosecurity measures. As in this report, acute ASF usually occurs with very high morbidity and mortality, at least in previously unexposed pigs. On the contrary, subclinical and chronic infections are more common in endemic areas. Pathological findings are extremely helpful for diagnosing and eliminating ASF. A number of hemorrhagic diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Anamnestic and epidemiological data help to properly handle the diagnostic process. Conclusions - The latest outbreak in Eastern Europe confirms further confirmation of ASF, a serious transboundary disease still negatively affecting the swine industry worldwide. The epidemiological and pathological features described here have diagnostic value and are important for promptly eliminating the spread and economic impact of the disease.",,"Marruchella, G.;Maseke, M.;Scacchia, M.",2014.0,Dec,,0
1320,Phylogenetic analysis of rabies viruses from Sudan provides evidence of a viral clade with a unique molecular signature.,"Rabies is endemic in Sudan and remains a constant threat to public health, as transmission to humans is mainly dog mediated. In addition, large-scale animal losses each year cause economic and social dilemmas. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 143 rabies viruses circulating in Sudan collected from 10 different animal species between 1992 and 2006. Partial nucleoprotein sequence data (400 bp) were obtained and compared with available sequence data of African classical rabies virus (RABV). isolates. The Sudanese sequences formed a distinct cluster within the African 1a group, which included few sequences clustered with sequences from Ethiopian RABV. These latter sequences share an Aspartic Acid at position 106 (Asp106) with all other African group 1a members, in contrast to the remaining Sudan strains that encode Glutamic Acid (Glu106) at this location. Furthermore, when representatives of other African and European ancestry are aligned, Glu106 is unique to Sudan, supporting the concept of a single distinct virus strain circulating in Sudan. High sequence identity in all Sudan isolates studied indicates the presence of a single rabies virus biotype, with the domestic dog as the main reservoir. Crown Copyright © 2009.",,"Marston, D.

Group A rotaviruses (GARVs) cause up to 1 million child deaths each year, mainly in developing countries, and human vaccines are now available in many countries. Rotavirus-associated enteritis is a major problem in livestock, particularly in young calves and piglets. Early epidemiological studies of GARV in humans identified either sporadic cases or outbreaks caused by atypical, animal-like GARV strains. Whole genome sequencing of human and animal GARV strains revealed striking genetic heterogeneity in 11 double-stranded RNA segments across different rotavirus strains, providing evidence for frequent intersections between the evolution of human and animal rotaviruses as a result of multiple repetitive events. interspecies transmission and subsequent adaptation.

Common infectious causes of diarrhea in lambs and kids in the first month of life are bacterial or parasitic in nature. However, despite remarkable advances in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies over the past decade, diarrhea is still a common and costly syndrome that affects newborn small ruminants. Recent advances in diagnostic and metagenomic research of the enteric medium have allowed the discovery of a number of new viruses, although their pathobiological characteristics are largely unknown.

1327,Pestivirus infections at the interface of wild and domesticated ruminants in the French Southern Alps,"In alpine pastures, interspecies transmission has recently been implicated in the epidemiology of pestivirus infection. The aim of this study was to investigate pestivirus infections in wild and domestic ruminants sharing pastures in the French Southern Alps. Animal sera were screened for pestivirus antibodies to the pestivirus NS3 protein with a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All 38 native flocks tested were positive for pestivirus-specific antibodies. Individual seroprevalence reached 76.5% (95% CI [95% CI]: [74.2-78.8%]) of 1383 sheep tested. For wild ruminants, 38.7% (95% CI: [33.8-43.9%]) of 369 ibex tested, 28.7% (95% CI: [17.4-38.1%]) and 22.2% of 72 roe deer. (95%) 27 mouflons CI: [6.5-37.9%]) were seropositive. Virus screening was performed by a conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on spleen samples from hunted wild animals (.n=.160) and 15 domestic ruminants (clinically suspected to be permanently infected). Three pestivirus strains were isolated from positive sheep samples by RT-PCR. Viruses were classified in the genotypes BDV-3, BDV-Tunisia and BDV-6. For the first time, a strain (strain RUPI-05) was isolated from a mountain chamois and clustered in the BDV-6 genotype, showing 92% identity with the sheep isolate from the same area in the 5'-UTR region. Thus, an active circulation of pestiviruses was demonstrated in both wild and domestic ungulates in the French Southern Alps. The results indicate that interspecies crossing is likely to occur between sheep and chamois.",,"Martin, C.;Duquesne, V.;Adam, G.;Belleau, E.;Gauthier, D.;Champion, J.

1328,Recombination in eukaryotic single-stranded DNA viruses,"While single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses that infect humans and domesticated animals do not usually cause major disease, arthropod-derived ssDNA viruses of plants do, severely restricting food production in most temperate regions of the world. Besides the well-known ssDNA viruses that infect plants and animals, it has recently become clear, through metagenomic studies of ssDNA molecules, that a large number of other diverse ssDNA viruses are also present in nearly all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host sequences of these viruses likely span the tree of life and will likely become important components of global ecosystems. Various evidence suggests that an important evolutionary process during the formation of this global ssDNA virus diversity was probably genetic recombination. Highly homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination, and genome component reassortment are known to occur within and between a variety of different ssDNA virus strains, and here we look at the diverse roles these different types of recombination can both play from day to day. everyday biology and the long-term evolution of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical and selective factors underlying the patterns of genetic variation detectable among ssDNA viruses and discuss how all of these should be taken into account when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution.

Material and methods: The affected herd consisted of 25 Deutsch Fleckvieh cows and their calves. The farm does not contain BHV-1 and the annual milk production averages 6500 kg. Disease cases and clinical manifestations from September 2002 to April 2003 were collected and analyzed. Evidence of BVDV-antibodies was carried out by indirect antibody-ELISA. BVDV-antigens were detected by antigen-ELISA and immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Isolated viruses were classified as BVDV-2 using monoclonal antibodies and PCR. Results: Six cows and one heifer fell with hemorrhagic enteritis. Two of these cows were euthanized and one cow died during illness. Six cows gave birth or gave birth prematurely. In addition, four calves died and three calves born weak or had severe diarrhea were euthanized. Two calves remained persistently infected. As the cause of the disease, infection of the flock with BVDV-2 was diagnosed. Outcome and clinical relevance: The results show that the flock was BVDV-2 naive prior to infection. The virus must have circulated in the herd for some time, even without the presence of permanently infected animals.",,"Martin, R.;Kuhne, S.;Mansfeld, R.",2005.0,,,0

In Cuba, the presence of BCoV was first reported in 2006. Since then, sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur. This study aimed to deepen the knowledge about the evolution, virulence molecular markers and epidemiology of BCoV in Cuba. A total of 30 samples collected between 2009 and 2011 were used for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the partial or complete S gene. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were performed using partial or complete S gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were placed in a single cluster supported by 100% bootstrap and posterior probability values of 1.00. Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were also clustered with US BCoV strains corresponding to GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses.

1332,Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization.,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity has an impact on the antigenic composition of PRRSV and may create differences in susceptibility to neutralization between isolates. Susceptibility to neutralization may be an important feature of PRRSV isolates, as neutralization-resistant isolates are likely to pose a significant challenge for the development of vaccines that confer broad protective immunity. However, little information is available to understand or categorize the viral neutralization phenotype of PRRSV isolates. In conclusion, the main purpose of this study is to determine whether PRRSV isolates differ in their neutralization susceptibility and can be classified into different categories according to their neutralization phenotype. For this purpose, a panel of 39 PRRSV isolates and a set of 30 hyperimmune monospecific sera were used in cross-neutralization experiments. The results of this study show that PRRSV isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization, and the k-means clustering system allows isolates to be classified into four different categories based on their neutralization phenotype: highly susceptible, susceptible, intermediate, and neutralization-resistant. Other analyzes using two additional clustering systems that take into account individual data for classification of isolates confirmed that the classification obtained by k-means was correct in most cases, and in only a few cases the classification was less stringent. The GP3, GP4 and GP5 sequences were analyzed, but no correlation was found between the sequence of predefined neutralizing epitopes or the number of N-linked glycosylation sites in different proteins and the neutralization phenotype of the isolates. These data provide the first systematic assessment of the overall neutralization sensitivities of a panel of various PRRSV isolates. Classification of isolates provides a useful tool to facilitate the systematic characterization of neutralizing antibody production elicited by new vaccine candidates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"MartÃ­nez-Lobo, F.

1338,Viral metagenomics shows domestic pigs as a potential reservoir for Ndumu virus,"Background: Increasing demand for pork has resulted in a massive expansion of pork production in Uganda. This resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can serve as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Results. Serum samples were collected from 16 domestic pigs from five sites in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% were mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and swine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, the two RNA-derived pools (B and C) had sequences showing 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta, suggesting that these sequences were less likely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. Conclusions: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. The NDUV had previously only been isolated from kitchen mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, especially given the increased risk of human-animal-mosquito contact.

The antigenic relationship between SPV and vaccine was also analyzed using immunoprecipitations and revealed little if any cross-reactivity. The growth characteristics of SPV in tissue culture were examined by light microscopy and revealed both a delayed and different cytopathology from the vaccinia virus. While SPV causes foci in porcine kidney cells that are not apparent until at least 4 days after infection, the vaccine rapidly forms plaques on these cells. The kinetics of DNA accumulation, protein expression, and RNA transcription of SPV have been studied, indicating that each of these aspects of the SPV growth cycle is significantly delayed compared to vaccinia virus.

1342,Genomic integration of the lambda EG10 transgene in gpt delta transgenic rodents,"Background: Transgenic gpt delta mouse and rat models have been developed to perform gpt and Spiassays for in vivo mutagenicity tests. Animals were constructed by integrating lambda EG10 phage DNA into the genome as a transgene. The inserted position of the transgene on the chromosome was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis; however, the exact location and order of the added link was unknown. To determine the location and pattern of genomic integration of transgene copies, genomic DNAs extracted from C57BL/6J gpt delta mice and F344 gpt delta rats were applied to whole genome sequencing and co-pair analysis. Results: The result confirmed that the multiplexed lambda EG10 transgenes are inserted in a single location on mouse chromosome 17. The linkage contains 70 bp of overlapping genomic sequence and has short homology at both ends. A copy number analysis suggested that the inserted transgenes could contain 41 links from other types, such as head-to-tail linkages and rearranged aberrant links. He suggested that the number of intact copies could be around 40 at the maximum. In F344 gpt delta rats, the transgenes are placed in a single location on rat chromosome 4. The linkage does not contain an overlapping sequence, but the 72-kb genomic sequence containing a gene was deleted. Inserted transgenes may contain 15 end-to-end linkages and two rearranged linkages. He suggested that the number of intact copies could be at most 14. A germline base substitution in the gpt gene rescued from gpt delta rats was characterized. Results: Exactly inserted positions of the lambda EG10 transgene were identified in the genome of gpt delta transgenic rodents. The copy number and arrangement of the transgene were analyzed.

1343,A new line of duck circoviruses detected in Velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca) supports great diversity among these virus species.,"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of circoviruses in wild bird populations in Poland. Circoviruses have immunosuppressive properties and can interfere with the health of wild birds. Method: 83 birds from 23 species were tested by wide-range nested PCR. The resulting PCR products were sequenced and new primers were designed to analyze the full-length viral genome. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to find any association with known circoviruses. Results: The circovirus DNA sequence was found in 4 birds. All specimens were obtained from the velvet predator (Melanitta fusca), a sea duck of the subfamily Merginae. On the Baltic coast, birds that tested positive for circovirus were found dead in fishing nets. At autopsy, only slight weakening was seen in the carcasses of two of the two scooters, while the other two birds appeared healthy. The resulting full-length circovirus sequence revealed the presence of 1,988 nucleotides and typical features (ie Cap, Rep and ORF3). The nucleotide similarity to other duck circoviruses was 84 to 86%. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome and cap gene showed that the novel circovirus is related to known duck circoviruses, particularly subtypes sometimes called duck circovirus genotype 1, but not genotype 2. Results: In this study, we reported. A new strain of duck circovirus has been detected in the velvet spider, a species of sea duck. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the novel virus sequence support previous reports that duck circovirus (DuCV) is a highly diverse species. The viral sequence from the velvet predator suggests that DuCV may infect birds from the subfamily Anatinae. More studies are needed to prove whether the velvet scoter and other sea ducks serve as a reservoir for DuCV.",,"Matczuk, A. K.;Krawiec, M.;Wieliczko, A.",2015.0,,10.1186/s12985-015-0352-y,0
1344,B-cell epitopes of African equine disease virus serotype 4 recognized by the immune equine sera,"Identification of antigenic proteins and mapping of their epitopes are important for the development of diagnostic reagents and recombinant vaccines. B cell epitopes of African equine disease virus (AHSV) have been previously mapped on VP2, VP5, VP7 and NS1 using mouse, rabbit and chicken monoclonal antibodies. A comprehensive study of the humoral immune response to AHSV-4 antigenic peptides from five vaccinated horses was conducted. A fragmented genome phage display library was constructed expressing a whole genome-wide repertoire of AHSV-4 peptides. The library was selected for affinity for binders on immobilized polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from horse sera collected before and after immunization with an attenuated AHSV-4 monovalent vaccine. DNA inserts of the binding phages were sequenced by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Data were normalized using sequences selected by preimmune IgG. More sequences were mapped to the genes encoding NS3, VP6 and VP5 than any other genes. However, VP2 and VP5 each had more antigenic regions than each of the other proteins. This study identified a set of epitopes to which the equine humoral immune system responds during vaccination with AHSV-4.",,"Mathebula, E. M.;Faber, F.

In some populations, PARV4 infection is rare and evidence of exposure is only found in individuals with risk factors for parenteral infection and other blood-infected individuals. transmitted viruses. In other settings, seroprevalence studies suggest an endemic, age-related pattern of transmission, independent of any specific risk factors. The clinical impact of PARV4 infection remains unclear, but reported disease associations include an influenza-like syndrome, encephalitis, acceleration of HIV disease, and fetal hydrops. In this review, we begin to report progress updates in the recent literature, now focusing on the study of cohorts in different geographic settings, including insights from Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and discussing whether there are characteristics of viral or host populations. forms the basis of striking differences in epidemiology. We review progress in understanding viral phylogeny and biology, diagnostic approaches, and insights that can be gained from studies of closely related animal pathogens. Important questions about pathogenicity remain unanswered, but we highlight new evidence supporting a possible link between PARV4 and an encephalitis syndrome. Conclusive evidence that PARV4 is endemic in certain populations should guide ongoing research efforts to understand its risk factors and modes of transmission, and to gain new insights into the human health impact of this virus.",,"Matthews, P.

1346,Whole genome-based classification of rotaviruses reveals a common origin between human wa-like and porcine rotavirus strains and human DS-1-like and bovine rotavirus strains.,"Group A rotavirus classification is currently based on the molecular properties of the two outer layer proteins, VP7 and VP4, and the middle layer protein VP6. Since reclassification of all 11 rotavirus gene segments plays a key role in establishing rotavirus diversity in nature, a classification system based on all rotavirus gene segments is desirable to determine which genes influence rotavirus host range restriction, replication, and virulence. as well as to study the epidemiology and evolution of rotavirus. In order to establish such a classification system, in addition to those found in the databases, gene sequences coding from VP1 to VP3, VP6 and NSP1 to NSP5 were determined for human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to different G and P genotypes and used in phylogenetic identification. Relationships among all rotavirus genes. Based on these phylogenetic analyses, appropriate identity thresholds were determined for each gene. For the VP4 gene, an 80% nucleotide identity cut-off value fully correlated with the 27 established P genotypes. For the VP7 gene, a nucleotide identity cut-off of 80% largely overlapped with established G genotypes, but identified four additional distinct genotypes consisting of murine or avian rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analyzes of the VP1 to VP3, VP6 and NSP1 to NSP5 genes showed the presence of 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 5, 7, 11 and 6 genotypes, respectively, based on nucleotide identity cut-offs of 83%. , 84%, 81%, 85%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85% and 91%. Consistent with these data, a revised nomenclature of rotavirus strains has been proposed. The new classification system includes (i) different genotypes, possibly following separate evolutionary paths; (ii) interspecies transfers and multiple reclassification events; and (iii) certain gene constellations that reveal a common origin between (a) human Wa-like rotavirus strains and porcine rotavirus strains, and (b) a common origin between human DS-1-like rotavirus strains and bovine rotaviruses. These close evolutionary links between human and animal rotaviruses highlight the need for close simultaneous monitoring of rotaviruses in animals and humans.

Multiple new genotypes were identified and assigned genotype numbers by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group: R9 (VP1), C9 (VP2), N9 (NSP2), T12 (NSP3), E14 (NSP4), and H7 and H11 (NSP5). The genotype constellation of L338 was unique: G13-P[18]-I6-R9-C9-M6-A6-N9-T12-E14-H11. The remaining six equine RVA strains showed a highly conserved genotype constellation: G3/G14-P[12]-I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7, quite different from the other. constellations of known non-equine RVA genotypes. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the sequences of these equine RVA strains were distantly related to the non-equine RVA strains, with at least three lineages present within the equine RVA strains. Few reclassification events were observed. Interestingly, three RVA strains from Argentina had the E12 genotype, while three RVA strains from Ireland and South Africa had the E2 genotype. The unusual E12 genotype has so far been identified in Argentina only among RVA strains collected from guanaco, cattle and horses, suggesting geographic isolation of this NSP4 genotype.

1350,Molecular evolution and epidemiological links study of Newcastle disease virus isolates in Iran from 1995 to 2016,"In the case of Newcastle disease virus, it has been suggested that many factors such as host adaptation, avoidance of immune response and selective pressures result in the evolution of viruses and the emergence of genetic variants. Numerous studies on virus classification and global epidemiological links have provided consistent data. Here, we performed a molecular analysis study of Newcastle disease viruses circulating in Iran (1995-2016). According to evolutionary differences, VIg, VIj, VIIj, VIId, XIIIa and XIIId subgenotype isolates have been circulated in the country over a 21-year period. Based on data analysis, VIg isolates shared the highest sequence identity with Russian and Polish isolates of the VIg subgenotype, while isolates of VIj subgenotype (2012) were most similar to a virus isolated in India in 2015. Analysis of the evolutionary divergence of the VIIj subgenotype suggests that Chinese and Ukrainian viruses may have played a crucial role in the emergence of VIIj isolates. Evolutionary divergence studies have also shown that XIIIa isolates circulating in Iran may have resulted in the emergence of adapted variants of the XIIId subgenotype. Therefore, we propose that evolutionary and epidemiological study of virulent Newcastle disease viruses can help provide accurate molecular data on variants circulating in the region, thereby aiding the design of more efficient recombinant vaccines.",,"Mayahi, V.;Esmaelizad, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3536-5,0
1351,Protective efficacy of a recombinant bacterial artificial chromosome clone of a highly virulent Marek's disease virus containing a reticuloendotheliosis virus long terminal repeat,"Marek's disease virus (MDV), an alphaherpes virus, causes Marek's disease (MD), a lymphoproliferative disease in poultry characterized by T-cell lymphomas, nerve lesions, and death. Vaccination is used worldwide to control MD, but increasingly virulent field strains may overcome this protection and trigger the need to create new vaccines. Previous studies revealed that insertion of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of a very virulent MDV, Md5 strain completely attenuated the resulting recombinant virus, rMd5 REV-LTR BAC. In maternal antibody positive (Mab+) chickens at passage 40. In the current study, the protective efficacy of rMd5 REV-LTR BAC was evaluated. First, passage 70 was determined to be completely attenuated in maternal antibody negative chickens and was chosen as the optimal crossover level for use in protective efficacy studies. Second, three trials of protective efficacy were conducted comparing the rMd5 REV-LTR p70 BAC with the CVI988/Rispens vaccine.

1352,Comparison of sample sequences of the Salmonella typhi genome with the sequence of the complete Escherichia coli K-12 genome,"Raw sequence data, representing the majority of a bacterial genome, can be obtained at a fraction of the cost of a completed sequence. To demonstrate the utility of such a resource, 870 single-stranded M13 clones of the Salmonella typhi Ty2 genome were sequenced from a shotgun library. The sequence reads on average over 400 bases and sampled the genome with an average spacing of every 5,000 bases. A total of 339,243 base unique sequences were generated (approximately 7% representation). The sample of 870 sequences was compared with the rest of the GenBank database, which can be considered a complete Escherichia coli K-12 genome as well as a collection of sampled sequences. Despite the incomplete S. typhi dataset, interesting categories can be easily distinguished. Sixteen percent of the sequences identified from S. typhi had close homologues between known Salmonella sequences (P < 1e-40 in BlastX or BlastN), reflecting the proportion of these genomes that were previously sequenced; 277 sequences (32%) had no significant orthologs across the entire E. coli K-12 genome (P > 1e-20), of which 155 (18%) had no close similarity to any sequences in the database (P > 1e) . -5). Eight of the 277 sequences had similarities with genes in other E. coli strains or plasmids, and six sequences showed evidence of sequence residues of novel phage lysogens or phage integrations, including a member of the lambda family (P < 1e-15). Twenty-three sample sequences had significantly closer similarity to a sequence in the database than organisms (including Shigella and Citrobacter) other than the E. coli/Salmonella line. These sequences are new candidate lateral transfer events to the S. typhi strain or deletions in the E. coli K-12 strain. Eleven possible associations of insertion/deletion events greater than 100 bp were observed in the sample; this indicates that more than 150 such events can distinguish S. typhi from E. coli K-12.

RNA and DNA were extracted either directly from samples or from viral capsid-enriched preparations and then subjected to MPS-based non-specific virus detection by degenerate oligonucleotide primer (DOP) PCR. MPS by 454, Illumina MiSeq, and Illumina HiSeq were compared on independent samples. Using these methods, virus detection was achieved in a reproducible manner. Unclassified sequences from CHO cells typically represented cellular sequences not yet submitted to databases used for sequence identification. The sensitivity of MPS-based virus detection was consistent with theoretically expected limits based on dilution of virus in cellular nucleic acids. Capsid priming increased the number of viral sequences detected. Potential viral sequences were detected in several samples; in any case, these sequences were either artificial or (based on additional studies) were not shown to be associated with replication competent viruses. Virus-like sequences were more likely to be identified in BLAST searches using virus-specific databases that did not contain cellular sequences. The viral sequences detected included the previously described retrovirus and retrovirus-like sequences in CHO, Vero, MDCK and High Five cells, and the nodavirus and endogenous bracovirus sequences in High Five insect cells. Sequences of bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine hocovirus and porcine circovirus were detected in some reagents. A recently described parvo-like virus found in some nucleic acid extraction resins has also been identified in cells and in extraction controls from some samples.

Many of these genes encode proteins that interact directly with effector elements of the host immune system. These immunodeficiency viral proteins include secreted mimics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these immune modulatory proteins encoded by myxoma virus are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERF-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homolog; and (5) T7, an interferon-gamma receptor homologue, the origin of viral strategies designed to disrupt immune regulation by host cytokines is evaluated in the context of myxoma virus biology in immunocompetent hosts.",,"McFadden, G.;Graham, K.;Ellison, K.;Barry, M.;Macen, J.;Schreiber, M.;Mossman, K.;Nash, P.;Lalani, A.;Everett, H.",1995.0,May,,0

T6, K43 and K87 strains were more than 99% homologous to previously described strains C and D. A fourth novel strain (K32) was most closely related to the previously described strain B. Phylogenetic analysis of the strains revealed that New Zealand strains were more closely related to Australia than European or North American strains. The New Zealand A strain shared 99.5% nucleotide and 98.7% amino acid homology with the Australian Vic S strain.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of three main geographic populations of LI virus in the British Isles, i.e. Irish, Welsh and English LI viruses that cause encephalomyelitis in animals, mainly sheep, and co-exist in the same tick population. British LI virus occurs in Scotland, England, Ireland and Norway. Irish and Welsh LI viruses occur only in Ireland and Wales, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis also predicts that the LI virus originally arose in Ireland, with one lineage being brought to Great Britain via Wales and later to the borders of Scotland, from where it spread to Scotland, northern England and Norway. More recently, the British LI virus has been reintroduced to Ireland and also south-west England. Lineage divergence dates calculated from synonymous substitution rate indicate that LI virus originated in the British Isles less than 800 years ago, with most LI virus spreads occurring in the last 300 years. Combining these data with historical records, it appears that livestock movement may play a role in the spread of the LI virus.",,"McGuire, K.;Holmes, E. C.;Gao, G. F.;Reid, H. W.;Gould, E.

1357,Type-specific antigenicity of avian reoviruses,"The type specificity of neutralizing activity against avian reoviruses in chicken antiserum was affected by the antiserum production method. The neutralizing activity produced in response to virus infection had higher type specificity than that produced by immunization with inactivated virus emulsified in adjuvant. Induction of type-specific neutralizing activity using reasortant viruses was shown to be associated with the sigma C (sigmaC) virion protein. Antigenic classification of virus strains was attempted based on immunoprecipitation of sigmaC protein by chicken antiserum and results were similar to those obtained by reciprocal serum neutralization tests. Unidirectional immunoprecipitation of sigmaC protein against some heterologous viruses by antisera made it difficult to assign individual viruses to serogroups, similar to what was reported in mutual neutralization tests, showing that the type specificity of the sigmaC protein is not absolute. Neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies against sigmaC protein of the RAM1 strain of avian reovirus suggested that there are distinct type and group-specific antigenic areas on the sigmaC protein, and that group-specific areas may be associated with induction of the antibody. heterologous viruses.",,"Meanger, J.;Wickramasinghe, R.;Enriquez, C.

1361,Molecular epidemiological investigation and phylogenetic analysis of bovine influenza D virus in Japan,"Influenza D virus, a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is predominantly found in cattle. Although viral pathology and clinical disease in cattle may seem mild, this virus plays an important role as a trigger of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a costly disease worldwide. Therefore, epidemiological studies of influenza D virus are necessary. Here, we performed a molecular epidemiological investigation for influenza D virus in healthy and respiratory diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of cattle were infected with influenza D. Cattle with and without respiratory symptoms had approximately equal amounts of the virus. A whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that influenza D virus isolated in Japan formed an individual cluster distinct from strains found in other countries.

Albert Sabin was one of the main contributors. He isolated several types of enteroviruses and identified them as causative agents of human disease. Enteroviruses were discovered only after new methods of working with viruses were introduced. They are now considered to constitute one of the genera of the picornavirus family. Pico-rna-virus refers to viruses that are small (pico) and have an RNA genome. The genus Enterovirus includes human polioviruses, coxsackie viruses, and ecoviruses, as well as a number of enteroviruses of lower animals (eg, monkeys, cattle, pigs, mice).

1363,Phylogenetic classification and clinical aspects of a novel putative Deltapapillomavirus associated with skin lesions in cattle,"Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are recognized as causative agents of benign and malignant tumors in cattle. Thirteen BPV species have been previously described and classified in 3 different genera. Differences in the nucleotide sequence of the L1 gene are used to identify new viral types through the use of PCR experiments with degenerate primers. In the current study, a method for identifying BPVs based on PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing allowed the identification of a new putative Deltapapilloma virus designated JN/3SP (JQ280500.1). Analysis of the L1 gene showed that this strain was most closely related to BPVs -1, -2, -13 and OaPV1 (71-73% genetic similarity). In this study, we describe the detection of this new putative Deltapapillomavirus type and confirm its phylogenetic position within the genus. Â© FUNPEC-RP.",,"Melo, T. C.;Carvalho, R.

The complete genome of the virus contained 15,198 nucleotides. Based on the length of the genome and the partial sequence of the F gene, the virus was classified as class I genotype 4 NDV. The antigenicity of the virus was compared with that of the NDV strain La Sota via hemagglutination inhibition (HI), virus neutralization (VN) assay and animal experiments. Our results show that JS10 produces higher HI and VN titers than La Sota against both class I and II virulent NDV strains. Animal experiments show that virus transmission from chickens vaccinated with JS10 is significantly reduced compared to those vaccinated with La Sota.

1365,Potential of genotype VII Newcastle disease viruses to cause different infections in chickens and ducks,"Newcastle disease (ND), caused by the ND virus (NDV), is one of the most contagious and economically important diseases of the poultry industry worldwide. Although infections have been reported in a wide range of avian species, the pathogenicity of virulent chicken-derived NDV isolates in ducks remains unclear. In this study, two strains of NDV were isolated and biologically and genetically characterized from an outbreak in chickens and apparently healthy ducks. Pathogenicity assessment indices, including mean time to death (MDT), intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), and cleavage motifs in the fusion (F) protein indicated that both isolates were velogenic. While these isolates were pathogenic, interestingly, they showed different pathogenicity in ducks. Chicken-derived isolate caused high (70%) mortality in 4-week-old ducks, while duck-borne virus caused low (20%) mortality. Surprisingly, both isolates showed comparable disease pathologies in chickens. Whole genome sequence analysis showed that the virus genome contained 15×192 nucleotides and was characteristic of velogenic strains of NDV. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that both isolates clustered in class II and genotype VII. However, there were several mutations in functionally important regions of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins that may be responsible for the differential pathogenicity of these viruses in ducks. In summary, these results show that NDV strains with the same genotype show different pathogenicity in chickens and ducks. Furthermore, virulent NDVs from chicken are more pathogenic to ducks than duck-borne viruses. These findings suggest a role in the evolution of viral pathogenicity of chickens and potential genetic resistance of ducks to poultry viruses.",,"Meng, C.;Rehman, Z.

This study aimed to understand the geographic distribution of tick species and tick-associated viruses in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. Next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-based analyzes were used to evaluate tick viromes from four representative sampling locations in the Greater Khingan Mountains, and molecular methods were used to classify tick species. Five species of ixodid ticks have been identified, including Ixodes persulcatus, Dermacentor nuttalli, Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis concinna. From 1102 ticks, 3,568,561 high-quality reads were obtained with next-generation sequencing. After trimming, 302,540 reads were obtained, of which 6577 (2.16%) reads were annotated to viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viral sequences share a close relationship with the Orthonairovirus, Phlebovirus, deer tick Mononegavirales-like virus and Jingmen tick virus sequences, but the significance of these newly identified tick-borne viruses for human and animal health requires further investigation.

1367,A deep sequencing reveals significant variation between the dominant variants and evolutionary dynamics of avian leukosis viruses in the two infectious ecosystems.,"BACKGROUND: As a typical retrovirus, the evolution of Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) in different infectious ecosystems is uncharacterized, what we do know is that it is a cloud of diverse variants such as half-species with significant genetic diversity. This study is to investigate the selection of infectious ecosystems on dominant variants and the evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J between DF1 cells and specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. High-throughput sequencing platforms provide an approach to more precisely detect quasi-species diversity. RESULTS: An average of approximately 20,000 valid reads from the two variable regions of the gp85 gene and the LTR-U3 region were obtained from each sample in different infectious ecosystems. The top 10 dominant variants of ALV-J from chicken plasmas, DF1 cells and liver tumor were completely different from each other. Also, there was a difference between shannon entropy and global selection pressure values (Ï‰) in different infectious ecosystems. In the plasmas of two chickens, the majority of half-species contained only less than 0.01% of 3-peptide ""LSD"" repeat insertion in DF1 cell culture supernatants. In parallel studies, the LTR-U3 region of ALV-J from chicken plasmas showed more variants with mutations in transcription regulatory elements than those from DF1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our combined data suggest that molecular epidemiology based on ALV-J isolated in cell culture may not represent the true evolution of the virus in field chicken flocks.

1368,Analysis of Half-species of Avain Leukosis Virus J Subgroup Using Sanger and High-throughput Sequencing,"BACKGROUND: The avian leukosis viruses subgroup J (ALV-J) exists as a complex mixture of distinct, but closely related genomes, called quasispecies, which are subject to constant change according to Darwinian Principles of evolution. METHODS: This study aims to compare deep sequencing with conventional Sanger sequencing using the MiSeq platform to study the half-species dynamics of ALV-J. RESULTS: The accuracy and reproducibility of MiSeq sequencing was better determined than Sanger sequencing by running each experiment in duplicate. According to the mutation rate of the single position and the ability to distinguish dominant half-species by two sequencing methods, the traditional Sanger sequencing technique shows high randomness due to the small number of sequencing samples, while deep sequencing can more accurately reflect the composition of the half-species. Meanwhile, half-species search via Sanger sequencing was simulated and analyzed from high-throughput sequencing data with the help of a resampling strategy instead of 1000 times; this resulted in higher antibody titer, higher sequence entropy, more difficult analysis with conventional Sanger sequencing, lower proportions of dominant variants. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, deep sequencing is more appropriate for comprehensively detecting rare variants. The Sanger sequencing simulation we propose here will also assist in standardizing half-species researching under differential selection pressure based on next-generation sequencing data.",,"Meng, F.;Dong, X.;Hu, T.;Liu, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Lv, Y.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.;Cui, Z.",2016.0,06 27,,0
1369,Characterization of subgroup Javian Leukosis virus isolated from Chinese domestic chickens,"Background: Despite remarkable successes in the purification of laying hens and broiler avian leukosis virus (ALV), ALV infection in Chinese domestic chickens was still serious. Methods: To assess the epidemic status of avian leukosis virus in domestic chickens in China, 10 novel strains of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J), designated JS16JH01 to JS16JH10, were isolated and identified by virus isolation and immunofluorescence antibody assays. Chinese local breed farm with sporadic tumor incidence. To better understand its virological properties, the proviral genome of ENV-LTR was sequenced and compared with reference strains. Results: Homology of the gp85 gene between the ten ALV-J strains and NX0101 ranged from 89.7–94.8% at the nuclear acid level. In addition, the gp85 genes were highly diverse, with 92-98% identity to themselves at the nuclear acid level. There were several snp and indel sites in the amino acid sequence of the gp85 genes after comparison with other reference strains of ALV. Interestingly, a novel insertion in the gp85 region was found in two strains, JS16JH01 and JS16JH07, compared with NX0101 and HPRS-103.

HEV infection in pigs usually occurs at 2-3 months of age and approximately 80-100% of pigs on commercial farms in the USA are infected. Swine HEV infections are now recognized in pigs in many other countries of the world. Interspecies transmission has been documented, as swine HEV infects non-human primates and some human HEV strains infect pigs. Recent seroepidemiological studies have shown that swine veterinarians and other swine handlers are at risk for HEV infection compared to normal blood donors. In addition, novel human HEV strains from hepatitis patients in the USA, Japan, and Taiwan are more closely related to swine HEV strains in genetically related countries than other human HEV strains. The ubiquitous nature of the virus in pigs and the proven ability of interspecies infection raise a potential concern for porcine HEV infection in xenotransplantation with porcine organs.

1372,Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of 3'-terminal genomic RNA of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"Genomic RNA of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolate from the USA, VR 2385 (ATCC), was transcribed into cDNA and cloned into phage lambda after preparation with oligo(dT). The cDNA clones representing the 3'-terminal genomic RNA of the virus were isolated and sequenced. The genome is a positive-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with an estimated size of 15 kb. Analysis of the resulting sequence identified three fully open reading frames (ORFs) with the potential to encode polypeptides with predicted M(r)s of 22.2K (ORF 5), 19.1K (ORF 6) and 13.6K (ORF 7). ORF 7, closest to its 3' end, is predicted to encode a highly basic nucleocapsid protein that exhibits 58% amino acid identity to the corresponding protein of Lelystad virus (LV), a European isolate of PRRSV. ORF 6 and 5, preceding ORF 7, are each predicted to encode proteins containing several hydrophobic domains thought to be membrane-associated. The VR 2385 ORF 6 protein is the most conserved structural protein. It has 78% amino acid identity to the equivalent LV protein and shares only 54% of the ORF 5 amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed six 3'-coterminal nested sub-genomic RNA clusters in VR 2385 virus-infected CRL 11171 cells. Our results show that VR 2385, like LV, is a member of the newly proposed arterivirus group. However, the striking difference in genetic diversity and pathogenicity between LV and VR 2385 suggests that the viruses that cause PRRS in the USA and Europe are highly variable and may represent different genotypes.",,"Meng, X.

The aim of this study is to evaluate this classification of viruses and their effects on cell morphology. Healthy, adult guinea pigs were studied. The spiral ganglion was cut serially and examined electron microscopically. All spiral ganglia examined in several populations of guinea pigs of different breeds showed intracytoplasmic viruses in some granular spiral ganglion cells. Based on their localization and morphology, these viruses are classified into the oncorn virus group, which does not agree with the classification of other authors. There seems to be a worldwide latent viral infection in guinea pigs. The accumulation of lysosome-like vacuoles around the virus indicates increased local lysosomal activity of infected ganglion cells. Given the normally normal superstructure of infected cells, an additional effect of these viruses on intracellular metabolism can neither be demonstrated nor denied.",,"Merck, W.;Kistler, G.

From 1998 to 2006, seven strains of velogenic Newcastle disease virus were isolated from poultry and other avian species in central and northern Mexico and subjected to phylogenetic analysis and biological characterization using standard pathogenicity tests and challenge. studies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all velogenic strains belonged to genetic group V and were clearly divided into two lineages as phylogenetic similarities between groups were only 93-94%. The isolates from 1998 to 2001 are closely related to the strain responsible for the 2000-year epidemic that occurred in the La Laguna region (Torreon strain) and are phylogenetically different from viruses isolated between 2004 and 2006 that are genetically related to the Chimalhuacan strain isolated in 1973. . All viruses of both the Chimalhuacan and Torreon groups contained a virulent fusion protein cleavage site represented by the ""GGRRQKRF"" motif, suggesting that evolutionary changes occurred at a different site. The chicken embryo mean time to death value was shorter for Chimalhuacan-like viruses (43.9 hours) compared to the 1998-2001 mean (54.3 hours). The ICPI mean value (1.92) for viruses isolated during 2004-2006 was higher than for viruses isolated before 2001 (1.74). Microscopic evaluation of the bursa Fabricius and thymus of 5w-o broilers challenged with 106 LD50/0.2 ml showed that the Chimalhuacan-like isolate caused more severe lesions in the bursa at 48 hpi and the thymus at 72 and 96 hpi than the Torreon-like isolate. Alongside the MDT, ICPI and microscopic results, our findings suggest that some significant selective pressure on the highly virulent Chimalhuacan strain isolated in the early 1970s may have led to the emergence of a new still velogenic but less virulent strain (Torreon-like) in Europe. mid 1990's.

1377,"The First ""Virus Hunters""","The history of virology is the history of conceptual and technological inventions and breakthroughs. Towards the end of the 19th century, the development of filters made of porcelain or kieselgur that retained bacteria allowed the identification of infectious agents that were smaller than bacteria and could not be produced in the media then known and used to grow bacteria. Even finer-grained filters resulted in the observation that ultra-visible new infectious agents were actually particulate in nature. Infections of plants and animals were the first to be attributed to these little beings. Evidence has been obtained from experimental infection of natural hosts (including humans). Thus, 20 of the first 30 viruses identified are veterinary viruses, that is, infectious agents of poultry and livestock. The discovery in the 1910s that bacteria also carry viruses expanded the viral universe, which continues today. Filterability and ultravisibility remained a hallmark for the identification of viruses until the advent of the electron microscope in the late 1930s, marking another technological breakthrough in virology. Cell culture techniques allowed the virus to spread outside the infected organism. Over the past years, the emergence and development of molecular biology has brought further innovations, resulting in the rapid and accurate determination of the genomic material of various living things, including viruses, at a speed and depth not previously known, using next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analyses. It is therefore not surprising that new viruses are constantly being detected, including specimens of unprecedented size and shape.

1378,Interspecies transmission of influenza virus,"Influenza is an infection of humans and various animal species. It is caused by influenza viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Type A influenza viruses are the most important, as they cause severe epidemics and are responsible for significant pathological problems. Type A influenza viruses are classified into different subtypes based on the nature of their surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The nature of the genome and the mode of replication of influenza viruses account for the high variability of these two proteins, which are responsible for virus immunity. The constant emergence of point mutations in the gene encoding the H protein results in the progressive emergence of new viral strains. This phenomenon, called antigenic drift, requires an annual evaluation of the composition of the human flue vaccine. Genetic reclassification is another mechanism of antigenic variation. When the gene encoding the H protein or both genes encoding the H and N proteins are included in the genetic reclassification, a new viral subtype arises that replaces the previous one. This event, called antigenic shift, occurs occasionally every 10 to 30 years and is responsible for major human pandemics. The role of animals and especially the importance of pigs and poultry in the emergence of these new viruses are discussed.",,"Meulemans, G.",1999.0,,,0

ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and translation of in vitro generated transcripts yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORF 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were grown in rabbits. Antisera immunoprecipitating in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Serum containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORF 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a 15 kDa (N) nucleocapsid protein, an 18 kDa (M) non-glycosylated membrane protein, and a 25 kDa (E) glycosylated membrane protein. The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. Protein E in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans resistant to endo-Î²-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H.

It was first described in Kenya in 1921 and since then many isolates have been collected worldwide. However, molecular dating analyzes have not been performed so far, although several phylogenetic studies have been conducted to understand the relationships between isolates. In this paper, extensive phylogenetic reconstructions have been performed using newly established, publicly available sequences of hundreds of ASFV isolates over the past 70 years. Analyzes focused on the B646L, CP204L and E183L genes from 356, 251 and 123 isolates, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes were obtained using maximum likelihood and Bayesian coupling methods. A new lineage-based nomenclature was proposed to identify 35 different clusters. In addition, dating of ASFV origin was made from molecular datasets. To avoid bias, diversity was neutralized due to positive selection or recombination events. Molecular clock analyzes revealed that currently circulating ASFV strains evolved over 300 years, with a time span from the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the early 18th century.

1384,Rotavirus vaccines: an overview,"Rotavirus vaccine development has focused on oral administration of live attenuated strains of rotavirus. The first 'Jennerian' approach involving bovine (RIT4237, WC3) or rhesus (RRV) rotavirus vaccine candidates showed that these vaccines were safe, well tolerated and immunogenic, but induced highly variable rates of protection against rotavirus diarrhea. The purpose of the rotavirus vaccine is to prevent serious diseases that can lead to dehydration in infants and young children in both developed and developing countries. These studies led to the concept that a multivalent vaccine representing each of the four epidemiologically important VP7 serotypes may be required to induce protection in young infants, the target population for vaccination. Human-animal rotavirus reassortants, whose gene encoding VP7 is derived from the human rotavirus parent, but whose remaining genes are derived from the animal rotavirus parent, were developed as vaccine candidates. The greatest experience with a multivalent vaccine to date has been achieved with the quadrivalent preparation containing human-RRV reassortants of RRV (VP7 serotype 3) and VP7 serotype 1, 2 and 4 specificity.

1386,Nyamanini and midway viruses describe a new taxon of RNA viruses in the order Mononegavirales.,"Here we report the sequencing and classification of two antigenically related viruses, Nyamanini virus (NYMV) and Midway virus (MIDWV), which were first isolated in 1957 and 1966, respectively. Although these viruses have been cultured multiple times from bovine egrets, seabirds, and their ticks, efforts to taxonomically classify them using traditional serological and electron microscopic approaches have been completely unsuccessful. We used a random shotgun sequencing strategy to identify the genomes of NYMV and MIDWV. Contigs of 11,631 and 11,752 nucleotides representing the complete genome of NYMV and the nearly complete genome of MIDWV, respectively, were combined. Each virus genome was estimated to carry six open reading frames (ORFs). BLAST analysis showed that only two of the ORF proteins of each virus, the putative nucleocapsid and polymerase, had detectable sequence similarity to known viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these ORF proteins indicated that the closest relatives of NYNV and MIDWV are negative-stranded RNA viruses of the order Mononegavirales. On the basis of very limited sequence similarities to known viruses, we propose NYMV and MIDWV to define a new genus, Nyavirus, in that order. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

1387,First look at the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer,"Oxford Nanopore's third-generation single molecule sequencing platform promises to reduce reagents and instrumentation costs. After a 2-year hiatus after the initial announcement, the first devices were released as part of the early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, no more than a quarter of the resulting reads are mapped to the reference with an average of less than 10% identity. Most of the array consists of insertion/deletion errors or does not resemble the template. Using lambda phage data as an example, reads average 5 kb although long, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read, can be matched to reference without soft clipping. During a 36-hour run on Minion, it was possible to reorder the 48kb lambda phage reference in 16Ã scope. Currently, significantly larger projects will not be possible using Minion. Without the increases in accuracy that would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, Minion's current usefulness appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory and is of similar complexity and cost to other next-generation sequencing platforms. While Minion requires dramatic reductions in error rates before delivering on its promise, it is an exciting step in a new direction for single molecule sequencing.",,"Mikheyev, A. S.;Tin, M.

1389,Differential interactions between isolates of peanut stunt cucumovirus and satellite RNA,"The interactions of seven pistachio stunt cucumovirus (PSV) isolates and two PSV satellite RNA (sat RNA) variants from North America, Europe and Africa were analyzed. Electrophoretic and immunoblot analyzes of coat protein (CP) and Northern blot hybridization analyzes of viral RNAs indicated that isolates PSV F352, 1339 and 1507 belonged to subgroup I, and isolates PSV W, Su and B belonged to subgroup II. The seventh isolate, robinia mosaic virus (RoMV), clustered with subgroup isolates by CP analysis, but was associated with both subgroups by RNA hybridization analysis. The ability of the two newly identified sat RNA variants to promote accumulation of P4 and P6 sat RNAs was not relevant to PSV isolate classification: neither PSV W nor RoMV were helper viruses for these PSV sat RNAs. Symptom modulation by both saturated RNAs was the same: the presence of sat RNA did not alter symptoms induced by subgroup I isolates, but exacerbated symptoms induced by subgroup II isolates in both tobacco and cowpea. Sat RNAs P4 and P6 contained 393 nucleotides and differed in only three nucleotide substitutions. This resulted in significant differences in infectivity, level of accumulation, and relative encapsulation between both sold RNAs. The accumulation levels and relative encapsulation of saturated RNAs were also affected by the helper virus isolate.",,"MilitÃ£o, V.;Moreno, I.;RodrÃ­guez-Cerezo, E.;GarcÃ­a-Arenal, F.",1998.0,,,0
1390,Newcastle disease: evolution of genotypes and related diagnostic challenges,"Since the discovery of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in 1926, nine class I viruses and ten class II genotypes have been identified, representing a diverse and constantly evolving group of viruses. The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics and the observed year-to-year changes in the genomic sequence of low and high virulence NDV imply that different NDV genotypes have evolved simultaneously in different geographic locations around the world. This wide genomic diversity may be supported by the wide variety of bird species susceptible to NDV infection and the availability of highly mobile wild bird reservoirs. The genomic diversity of NDV increases the likelihood of diagnostic failure, resulting in unidentified infections. Continuous epidemiological surveillance and proactive characterization of circulating strains are required to ensure that immunological and PCR reagents are effective in identifying circulating NDV worldwide. For example, in the United States, the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) matrix gene assay, which is widely used for the identification of NDV, fails to detect low virulence APMV-1 from waterfowl, whereas the RRT-PCR fusion is virulent. Gene assay used to identify isolates often fails to detect certain virulent NDV genotypes. A new matrix-polymerase multiplex assay that detects most of the viruses circulating worldwide has recently been developed, and a modified fusion assay for the identification of virulent pigeon viruses circulating in the USA and Europe. For newly isolated viruses with unknown sequences, recently developed randomization sequencing methods need to be included in the diagnostic arsenal. In addition, the current system for classifying NDV by genotypes or strains is inadequate. Here, we review the molecular epidemiology and recent diagnostic problems of the viral evolution of NDV and explain why a new system based on objective criteria is needed to categorize genotypes.",,"Miller, P.

1391,Common evolutionary origin of hepatitis B virus and retroviruses,"Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) is classified as a double-stranded DNA virus, it has recently been shown to replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Furthermore, the putative viral polymerase was found to share amino acid homology with the reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Using computer-assisted DNA and protein sequence analyses, we analyzed the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine human, two ducks, one woodchuck and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology with corresponding regions of the hepadnavirus genome. Genomes of type C retroviruses and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. Specifically, the highest conserved sequence of the HBV genome located at or near the start site for first-stranded HBV DNA synthesis is over 67 nucleotides homologous to the U5 region, a region comparable in retrovirus long terminal repeats. Within a highly conserved (ie, 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence, a heptanucleotide sequence CCTTGGG is 97% homologous among 27 virus isolates. We also found that the highly conserved HBV core or nucleocapsid protein shares 41% homology over 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, as with the previously reported polymerase homology, HBV is most homologous to murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between the hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses have a common evolutionary origin and result from the deletion process of HBV from a retrovirus or retrovirus-like progenitor.",,"Miller, R.

1395,Conservation of Gene Cassettes Among Various Viruses of Human Intestines,"Viruses are a crucial component of the human microbiome, but large population sizes, high sequence diversity, and high frequencies of novel genes have hindered genomic analysis by high-throughput sequencing. Here, we explore metagenomic assembly approaches to probe genome structure in a 5.6 Gb intestinal viral DNA sequence sample from six individuals. Testing has shown that a new pipeline based on DeBruijn graphics compilation provides longer contigs that can take more reads than the equivalent non-optimized, single-pass approach. To characterize the gene content, the database of viral RefSeq proteins was compared with the combined viral contigs and generated a two-part graph with functional cassettes linking the viral contigs; this revealed a high degree of interconnection between various genomes containing multiple genes of the same functional class. In a second step, open reading frames were grouped according to their co-occurrence in contigs in a database-independent manner, revealing conserved cassettes of co-orientation ORFs. These methods reveal that free-living bacteriophages often have significant similarities at the level of encoded amino acid motifs, gene arrangement, and gene orientation, while differing generally at the nucleotide level. These findings link contemporary metagenomic analysis with classical studies of bacteriophage genomic cassettes.

1396,Phylogenetic evidence for the recent spread of two human enterovirus 71 populations in European countries,"Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the cause of seasonal epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease and less common but serious neurological manifestations. Uncertainty remains regarding the circulation and time of spread of virus populations in various geographic regions. We identified EV-71 sequences at locus 1D (VP1 capsid protein) and 3CD (nonstructural proteins) in 86 strains recovered in Austria, France and Germany and performed an evolutionary genetic study of current virus populations. Phylogenetic analyzes positioned 78 of the 86 sequences within two divisions between subgenogroups C1 and C2. A small set of sequences has been assigned to subgenogroup C4. Analyzes involving existing sequences estimated the rate of substitution in genogroup C as 3.66×10-3 and 4.46×10-3 substitutions per site year-1 for loci 1D and 3CD, respectively, assuming a loose molecular clock model for sequence evolution. . Most of the 'European' strains belonged to branches C1b and C2b that emerged in 1994 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1992.7-1995.8) and 2002 (95% CI, 20011.6-203.8, respectively). Estimates of divergence times for locus 3CD were consistent with those measured for locus 1D. In the 3CD phylogeny, interbreeding between clades representing the EV-71 subgenogroups and clades corresponding to other enterovirus types (especially early coxsackievirus A prototype strains) is largely indicative of ancestral recombination events. Discordant phylogenetic models estimated for locus 1D and 3CD suggest that no single tree is able to model the epidemic history of circulating EV-71 populations. The evolutionary timescale of genogroup C estimated for both loci has been measured in only decades, indicating recent spread. © 2010 SGM.",,"Mirand, A.;Schuffenecker, I.;Henquell, C.;Billaud, G.;Jugie, G.;Falcon, D.;Mahul, A.;Archimbaud, C.;Terletskaia-Ladwig, E.;Diedrich, S.;Huemer, H.

1397,Genetic diversity of bovine diarrhea and mucosal disease virus,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified as a member of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens of ruminants worldwide and causes serious economic losses. Infection results in a wide variety of clinical manifestations, from mild respiratory disease to fetal death to mucosal disease. The virus particles are small and contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb with a large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5'UTR and 3'UTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases, resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well known that BVDV strains show significant genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified into two types: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Quite recently, a new default strain, BVDV-3, has been identified. Viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or non-cytopathic, depending on their activity in cell cultures. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR and Npro region revealed at least 21 different subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2.

Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect BVDV-2 in one of 1561 blood samples randomly collected from 78 flock of sheep in 11 states of India. Antigenic characterization of the isolated pestivirus using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies typified the isolate as BVDV-2. When analyzed at the genetic level in Npro (N-terminal autoprotease) and the entire gene region encoding structural proteins, namely capsid (C) protein and Erns (ribonuclease secreted) envelope proteins, the genomic organization of E1 and E2 was the same for all pestiviruses, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. showed the highest similarity with those of BVDV-2. Compared to BVDV-2 isolate 890, sequence homology was 83.7% for C, 84.6% for Erns and E1, and 81.5% for E2. While Npro/C was only protected from the C-terminus of Npro, the C/Erns cleavage site was found to be fully conserved, the Erns/E1 site was protected only from the C-terminus of Erns, and the E1/E2 site was only preserved from the C-terminus of Npro. E1. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences in regions 5–² untranslated (UTR), Npro, E2, NS3, and NS5B placed the sheep isolate in a distinct clade within BVDV-2 subtype b.

The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management factors. In this study, we used viral metagenomic sequencing to investigate the virome of nasal swab samples obtained from beef cattle and asymptomatic couples with acute BRD in six and four mediums, respectively, in Mexico and the USA, in April-October 2015. Twenty Bovine rhinitis A (52.7%) and B (23.7%) viruses and one virus were detected, with bovine coronavirus (24.7%) being the most frequently identified. The resulting influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly associated with disease (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94), while viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and bovine parainfluenza 3 viruses detected less frequently. Detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E have been identified and a newly proposed strain of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, has been characterized.

The virus was detectable in 17 of 20 field samples from broiler chickens in Haryana, India, and in all four vaccine strains. The nucleotide sequences of four field isolates and one vaccine strain were compared with 10 IBDV strains reported from different parts of the world. Nucleotide substitutions at 795G, 827T, 833C, 857C, 897A, 905T, 908T, 1011A, and 1094G specific to highly virulent (vv) strains were conserved in all four domain isolates. However, the unique nucleotide substitutions in 806A-G, 851C-T, 1010 TC, 1019T-C and 1082T-C indicated that these isolates differed more than previously reported vvIBDVs.

1406,Pestiviruses: a review Review,"Pestiviruses include a group of economically important animal pathogens, namely swine cholera, bovine viral diarrhea and borderline disease viruses. The viruses are serologically closely related and share a common host spectrum, namely pigs and numerous domestic and wild ruminants. Interspecies transfers occur frequently. Despite some common features in their natural hosts, the pathogenesis of pestivirus-borne diseases is complex; Some aspects of the particularly fatal mucosal diseases of cattle are still enigmatic. Pestiviruses are among the smallest enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses with an icosaeder-shaped nucleocapsid. They are currently classified as Togaviridae. However, based on recent advances in the molecular characterization of viruses, their taxonomic true location seems inevitable. Viral RNAs examined so far show a large open reading frame and no subgenomic RNA can be displayed in infected cells. Structural proteins are encoded by genes located at the 5' end of RNA. Most of the genome encodes 2-3 non-structural proteins. Virions consist of a large and a small envelope glycoprotein with molecular weights of 53 and 48 kD, respectively. The core consists of a small protein with a molecular weight of 20 kD. Analysis of viral proteins with monoclonal antibodies provided detailed information on the antigenic composition of both structural and nonstructural proteins.

To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 stool samples from calves with diarrhea from two different provinces of Egypt (Cairo and Sharkia) were screened by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete BKoV genome sequence. Compared with the single recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the studied strain showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions, one nucleotide (nt) insertion and one nt deletion across its entire polyprotein (2463 aa). 2D gene and 4-nt deletions (2 each) in UTRs.

1409,Effect of phylogenetic diversity of velogenic Newcastle disease virus challenge on virus shedding after homologous and heterologous DNA vaccination in chickens.,"Newcastle disease (ND) is a devastating disease for the poultry industry as it causes high economic losses. In this study, a DNA vaccine containing the F and HN surface antigens of the highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), NDV/1/Chicken/2005 (FJ939313) was successfully created. Cell transfection testing showed that the vaccine expressed the F and HN genes in Hep-2 cells. The main objective of this study was to compare the extent of protection induced by DNA vaccination after homologous and heterologous NDV challenge, as determined by the amount of NDV scattering after challenge. NDV-antibody-negative chickens were vaccinated one, two or three times intramuscularly at 7, 14 and 21 days of age and challenged with homologous virus (vaccine-matched velogenic visserotropic Newcastle disease virus (vvNDV) strain, FJ939313) 14 days post-vaccination. , a heterologous virus (mismatched vvNDV strain, AY968809), phylogenetically related to or phylogenetically distinct from group VII, belongs to genogroup VI and shows 84.1% nucleotide similarity to the NDV sequences of the DNA vaccine. Our data show that birds receiving a single dose of DNA vaccine are poorly protected, with only 30-40% of these birds surviving after challenge with high virus shedding titer.

The genome is 15,186 nucleotides (nt) long and consists of 6 genes in the order 3â€²-NPMF-HN-L-5â€². The genome contains 55 nt leader regions at the 3â€² ends and 114 nt trailer regions at the 5â€² ends. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis showed that Egyptian ancestry was closely related to NDV strains isolated in China. In addition, the sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site of the Maize strain was identical to that of the NDV strain recently isolated in Mali.

1411,Application of molecular biological techniques for the detection of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV-318) from a sentry calf in Central Sudan.,"Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), isolate 318 (EHDV-318), an untyped virus from a herd of sentinel calves at the University of Khartoum farm in central Sudan, was characterized using molecular biological techniques. By dot blot hybridization technique, a cDNA probe derived from genome segment 6 of EHDV-2 (Alberta strain) was hybridized with RNA from EHDV-318. Application of the serogroup-specific EHDV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to EHDV-318 RNA resulted in specific amplification of a 387 bp PCR product. The amplification product was visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by chemiluminescent hybridization with a non-radiolabeled internal probe. No amplification products or hybridization signals were detected when serotype-specific EHDV-1 or EHDV-2 PCR-based assays were applied to RNA from EHDV-318. The scientific data presented in this study demonstrated that cDNA probes and serogroup-specific PCR-based testing can be used to classify the virus as a member of the EHDV serogroup and serotypically distinct from EHDV-1 and EHDV-2.",,"Mohammed, M.

1412,Analysis of the phylogeny of the leader proteinase (Lpro) region of type A foot-and-mouth disease virus with emphasis on the evolution of the VP359-deletion lineage emerging from India,"Genotype-inclusive grouping of Indian type A isolates as observed in 1B region-based phylogeny is skewed in the full Lpro region, where the VP359-deletion group lineages of genotype VII clustered away from both VII and VI genotypes, confirming its uniqueness and independent evolution of Lpro and 1B zone. Similar to region 1B, this deletion group is genetically diverging even in region L, which generates more lineages, and the lineage distance in region L is considerably greater than region 1B. The deletion group is limited to India only, as none of the exotic sequences are clustered within this group. Notably, the L protein exhibited comparable variability to the external capsid proteins, as indicated by a high dN/dS ratio (0.105), the number of variable amino acid positions (41%), a low Ts/Tv ratio (3.47), and the N-terminal region revealed by the alignment. The Î²2 plate and C-terminal extension are highly variable. The basic residues at P1, P3, and only leucine at P2 were predicted to provide an optimal autocatalytic cleavage site at the L/P1 junction. All eight regions identified as being under positive selection revealed a substitution of various physicochemical traits, and lineage-specific signatures were observed at two locations; this supports the claim that lineages evolved under differential selection pressure to adapt to diverse ecological environments.

1413,"Genetic variability of the VP6, VP7, VP4 and NSP4 genes of the porcine rotavirus H group detected in Brazil","Rotaviruses (RV) are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Despite the seven groups/types of RV (AG), a new RV group/type H (RVH) has recently been proposed based on VP6 sequence analysis. In this study, we identified the nucleotides VP6, VP7, VP4, and NSP4 and extracted the amino acid sequences of 6 (BR59-BR64) RVH-positive stool samples from piglets with diarrhea in Mato Grosso do Sul, the Midwest region of Brazil. 2012, using the RT-PCR test. Based on the high sequence identities (>99%) of the VP6, VP4, VP7 and NSP4 genes among 5 (BR59-BR63) of the stool samples studied, they are considered to be the same local strain of rotavirus designated RVH/BRA-1. In contrast, once stool sample BR64 showed a relatively high difference (81.6% nt identity and 83.4% aa identity) in the VP7 sequence compared to the other 5 samples, it was termed RVH/BRA-2 strain. Comparative phylogenetic analysis showed that 6 RVH strains did not cluster together with any existing sequences of members of the established RV groups (RVA-RVG), but appeared to be associated with RVB and RVG. These results confirm the existence of RVH in Brazil, demonstrate its genetic diversity, and provide new data to aid in explaining viral evolutionary patterns and biological features of RVH, as well as viral phylogeny and epidemiology.",,"Molinari, B.

1415,Genome of chicken DT40 bursal lymphoma cell line,"The chicken DT40 cell line is a widely used model system for the study of multiple cellular processes due to the effectiveness of homologous gene targeting. The cell line was derived from a bursal lymphoma caused by avian leukosis virus infection. In this study, we characterized the genome of the cell line using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism sequence hybridization. The results show that wild-type DT40 has a relatively normal karyotype except for whole chromosome copy number gains and there is no karyotype variability within the stocks. Compared to the two domestic chicken genomes and the Gallus gallus reference genome, we did not find any unique mutational processes that shaped the DT40 genome, except for a slight increase in insertion and deletion events, particularly deletions in tandem repeats. We mapped coding sequence mutations specific to the DT40 genome; Mutations that inactivate the PIK3R1 and ATRX genes likely contributed to the oncogenic transformation. In addition to a known avian leukosis virus integration in the MYC gene, we identified other integration sites that are likely to de-regulate gene expression. The new findings support the hypothesis that DT40 is a typical transformed cell line with a relatively intact genome; therefore, it is well suited to the role of a model system for DNA repair and related processes. The sequence data generated by this work, including a searchable de novo genome assembly and annotated lists of mutated genes, will support future research using this cell line.",,"MolnÃ¡r, J.;PÃ³ti, A.;Pipek, O.;Krzystanek, M.;Kanu, N.;Swanton, C.;TusnÃ¡dy, G.

1417,Viruses isolated from reptiles: identification of three new members of the Rhabdoviridae family,"The growth of four viruses isolated from lizards in Brazil (Marco, Chaco and Timbo viruses) and Australia (Almpiwar virus) was studied in various continuous cell lines of mammalian, reptilian, amphibian and fish origin. Although replication was found in certain cell lines derived from cold-blooded species, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was absent or minimal and growth was less than or equal to that in mammalian cells. These observations seem to limit the value of poikilothermic cells for the primary isolation of viruses from field-collected cold-blooded vertebrates or arthropods that feed on them. The four reptilian viruses were found to be naturally occurring temperature sensitive agents, with around 30°C being optimal for growth. Electron microscopy studies showed that three of the viruses (Marco, Chaco and Timbo) are new members of the Rhabdoviridae family. Marco virus particles were cone-shaped and resembled bovine ephemeral fever virus and two lyssaviruses (Kotonkan and Obodhaing). Chaco and Timbo viruses were cylindrical viruses similar to other rhabdoviruses with longer particle lengths than the prototype VSV. No serological associations were found in cross complement fixation tests between these viruses, Marco virus and 34 other rhabdoviruses.",,"Monath, T. P.;Cropp, C. B.;Frazier, C. L.",1979.0,,,0

1419,Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous infectious bronchitis virus strains,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each containing 64 nucleotide (nt) leader sequences, derived from the 5'² end of the genome in a discontinuous process. Several putative functional domains such as papain-like proteinase (PLpro), major protease (M pro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for virus replication. We sequenced the 5â€²-terminal sequence, four regions of replicase genes corresponding to the PLpro, Mpro and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. In contrast to the highly conserved Mpro and RdRp domains with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively, all coronavirus 5-termini and PLpro domains were different. Among the IBV strains, the 5â€² untranslated regions containing the leader sequence were highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas the N-terminal coding region and PLpro domains were highly variable, ranging from 84.6% to 100% and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV Mpro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. The phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was the same as the classification of coronaviruses into three antigen-based groups. However, IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses, regardless of serotype, suggesting an exchange of genetic material between vaccine and field isolates or a convergent evolution in a specific replicase genotype. . There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and the pathotype, suggesting that replicase is not the only determinant of IBV pathogenicity. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of rotavirus G and P types was performed using nested RT-PCR. G6 was the most common genotype, constituting 78.5% of the samples, G10 viruses were found in 9.9% of the samples and G8 type viruses were found in 4.7% of the samples. In 3% of samples, viruses were not classified due to concomitant infection with more G-type strains, whereas in 3.9% of samples viruses could not be characterized by any of the G-specific primers used in this study. The most common P types were P[11] and P[5] corresponding to 65.1% and 25%, respectively. In 2.6% of cases, samples reacted with more than one P-specific primer; no P[1] serotypes were identified.

1422,Immunomodulatory effects of heat stress and lipopolysaccharide on bursal transcriptome in two different chicken lines,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to heat stress suppresses poultry immune responses, which can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases and thus intensify the adverse effects of heat on poultry welfare and performance. Identifying genes and pathways affected by high temperatures, particularly heat-induced changes in immune responses, may provide targets for improving disease resistance in chickens. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA sequencing) was used to investigate transcriptome responses in the bursa of Fabricius, a primary immune tissue, after exposure to acute heat stress and/or subcutaneous immune stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a 2×2 factor design. : Thermoneutral + Salty, Heat + Salty, Thermoneutral + LPS and Heat + LPS. All treatments were investigated in two chicken lines: the relatively heat and disease resistant Fayoumi line and a more susceptible broiler line. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis determined that Heat + Salt Water had a limited effect on gene expression (N = 1 or 63 genes) in broiler or Fayoumi bursa. However, Thermoneutral + LPS and Heat + LPS produced many expression changes in Fayoumi bursa (N = 368 and 804 genes). Thermoneutral + LPS was predicted to increase immune-related cell signaling and cell migration, while Heat + LPS would activate death-related functions and decrease expression in WNT signaling pathways. Other inter-process comparisons in the Fayoumi line revealed that heat stress prevented most LPS-induced expression changes. Both treatments were predicted to increase cell migration, although less significant expression changes were observed in broiler bursa after exposure to Thermoneutral + LPS (N = 59 genes) or Heat + LPS (N = 146 genes). Direct comparison between lines (broiler to Fayoumi) confirmed that each line had different response to treatment. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis identified genes and pathways involved in bursal responses to heat stress and LPS, explaining that these effects were greatest with combined therapy. The interaction between heat and LPS was primarily even dependent, with suppressive expression changes in the Fayoumi line. Potential target genes, particularly those related to cell migration and immune signaling, could inform future research on heat stress in poultry and be useful for improving disease resistance.",,"Monson, M.

New genotypes have recently been identified in various mammals, including the HEV genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution. It is common among pigs in developed countries. Objective: This study investigated the genetic diversity of HEV among humans and pigs in Italy. HEV's date of origin and demographic history were also estimated. Material and Methods: A total of 327 HEV pig and human sequences from Italy were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information. Three different data sets were created. The first and second datasets were used to confirm the genotype of the analyzed sequences. The third dataset was used to estimate the mean rate of evolution and to determine time-scale phylogeny and demographic history. Results: The Bayesian maximum clade confidence tree and time of most common ancestor estimates showed that the root of the tree dates back to 1907 (95% HPD: 1811 - 1975). Two major branches were found, divided into two subsections. Skyline plot analysis for the human and pig lines separately showed the presence of a bottleneck only in the horizon plot of the pig lines.

The current study was conducted for the detection and molecular characterization of astroviruses in swine with diarrhea sent to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Intestinal contents from 269 pigs were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 62% were positive for astroviruses. 20% of the positive samples were positive for astrovirus alone, astrovirus with rotavirus was detected in 58% of the samples. The remaining 22% revealed the presence of astrovirus together with Porcine hemagglutinated encephalomyelitis virus, Infectious gastroenteritis virus or Porcine circovirus-2. Sequencing of the capsid gene of 56 randomly selected samples confirmed that they were Porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV-4) with 58-100% nucleotide identity within these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 possible subgroups. The results suggest that PAstV has been found in pig farms in the United States and may be associated with diarrhea alone or in combination with other enteric viruses.

All three L-class gene segments of TARVs and TERVs and their encoded proteins Î»A, Î»B and Î»C were similar in size to those of the CRV reference strain S1133. Conserved motifs such as the C2H2 zinc-binding motif and the conserved polymerase domain were present in Î»A and Î»B, respectively. A conserved motif for the ATP/GTP-binding site and an S-adenosyl-. The l-methionine (SAM) binding pocket for methyltransferase was observed in the Î»C protein of TARVs and TERVs with only one substitution compared to that in CRV. We propose a new genotype classification system for avian reoviruses (ARVs) based on the nt identity cut-off value for each of the L class. According to this new genotype classification, all ARVs were divided into six, seven and eight genotypes in the L1, L2 and L3 genes, respectively. Interestingly, TARVs and TERVs were grouped in the L1-I genotype with three CRVs (two arthritic strains from Taiwan and one enteritic strain from Japan) and a different genotype (L2-I, L3-I) formed. Maximum nucleotide differentiation was observed in the genotypes of the L1 and L2 genes, but less at the amino acid level, indicating that the changes were mostly synonymous type. Non-synonymous changes were more common in the L3 gene compared to the L1 and L2 genes. Point mutations and possible reclassifications were also observed among TARVs, TERVs, and CRVs. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Mor, S. K.;Sharafeldin, T. A.;Porter, R. E.;Goyal, S.

The method, called ""combination of consensus oligonucleotide reverse transcription and multiple displacement amplification"" (CORT-MDA), involves reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by shotgun sequencing after amplification using only 11 degenerate oligonucleotide primers; these primers were designed against consensus regions in open reading frames of 124 NA-type PRRSV strains with reported full-length genomic sequences. Sequencing of 192 shotgun clones generated per virus showed 80% to 94% coverage on the reported PRRSV genomic sequence, such that only 2 or 3 unread regions were resequented after PCR amplification using custom primers. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products confirmed the absolute consistency between sequences determined by the CORT-MDA method and sequences from RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that our method is applicable to various NA-type viruses.",,"Morozumi, T.;Iseki, H.;Toki, D.;Takagi, M.;Tsunemitsu, H.;Uenishi, H.",2014.0,,,0
1434,"Genomic evolution, recombination, and interspecies diversity of fibropapillomatous chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 from Florida and Hawaii green sea turtles.","Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is a herpes virus associated with fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles worldwide. Single locus typing has previously shown differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific strains of this virus, with low variation in each geographic branch. However, the lack of multi-locus genomic sequence data precludes understanding of the rate and mechanisms of ChHV5 evolutionary divergence, as well as how these genomic changes may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. To assess genomic variation in ChHV5 among five Hawaiian and three Florida green sea turtles, we used high-throughput short-read sequencing of long-range PCR products amplified from tumor tissue using primers designed from the only available ChHV5 reference genome from the Hawaiian green sea. tortoise. This strategy recovered sequence data from both geographic regions for approximately 75% of the predicted ChHV5 coding sequences. The mean nucleotide difference between geographic populations was 1.5%; most of the substitutions were constant differences between regions. Protein deviation was generally low (mean 0.08%) and ranged from 0% to 5.3%. Several atypical genes originally identified and annotated in the reference genome were validated in ChHV5 genomes from both geographic locations. Certain recombination events have been identified across geographic regions, and clustering of specific alleles reveals the prevalence of recombination in the evolutionary history of ChHV5. This study significantly increased the amount of sequence data from ChHV5 strains, enabling informed locus selection for future population genetic and natural history studies, suggesting co-infection of individuals by (possibly latent) well-differentiated geographic variants.",,"Morrison, C.

1436,Universal Next-Generation Sequencing Protocol for Creating Non-Infectious Barcoded cDNA Libraries from High Coverage RNA Viruses,"few biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) pathogens are high-result, single-stranded RNA viruses, and their genomes are infectious when introduced into permissive cells. Also, most of these viruses are elite agents (SAs) and their genomes are also considered SAs. Therefore, cDNAs and/or their derivatives should be tested to ensure the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA prior to transfer from the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This greatly limits the capacity to conduct viral genomic research, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we present a sequence-independent method to simultaneously eliminate both viral and genomic RNA infectivity among multiple families of single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA+) viruses while rapidly replicating viral genomic RNA. The process produces barcoded DNA amplicons ranging in length from 300 to 1,000 bp, which cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable for transport at room temperature. Our barcoding approach allows up to 288 barcoded samples to be collected in a single library and run on a variety of NGS platforms without the potential need to reconstruct the viral genome. Our data demonstrate that this approach not only provides full-length genomic sequence information from high-titer virion preparations, but can also recover specific viral sequence from samples with limited starting material in the cellular RNA background and can be used to identify pathogens. In summary from unknown samples, we describe a rapid, universal standard operating procedure that generates high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA. IMPORTANT This report describes a standard operating procedure for selected agents (SAs) and other biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) RNA viruses to rapidly generate non-infectious, barcoded cDNA suitable for next-generation sequencing. SOP) and validates. (NGS). This removes the burden of testing all processed samples derived from high-result pathogens before they are transferred from high-content laboratories to lower-content facilities for sequencing. Our built-in protocol is scalable for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost and effort required for NGS library construction. NGS data from this SOP can provide full genome coverage from viral stocks and also detect virus-specific reads from limited starting material. Our data demonstrate that the procedure is applicable and easily validated by institutional biosafety committees in research laboratories.",,"Moser, L. A.;Ramirez-Carvajal, L.;Puri, V.;Pauszek, S.

1437,RNA2DMut: a web tool for the design and analysis of RNA structure mutations,"With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing, new RNA sequences are being discovered at an astonishing rate. However, function analysis lags behind. In both the cis- and trans-regulatory functions of RNA, the secondary structure (2D base pairing) plays essential regulatory roles. To test RNA function, being able to design and analyze mutations that may affect the construct is essential. This was the motivation for the creation of the RNA2DMut web tool. With RNA2DMut, users can tap into RNA sequences to analyze, limit mutations to certain residues or limit changes in purines/pyrimidines. The sequence is analyzed on each basis to determine the effect of each possible point mutation on the 2D structure. The metrics used in RNA2DMut are based on calculation of the Boltzmann group of structures and do not require a robust 2D RNA structure model to design mutations. This tool can facilitate a wide range of uses involving RNA: for example, in designing and evaluating mutants for biological testing, interrogating RNA-protein interactions, identifying key regions to modify in SELEX experiments, and improving RNA folding and crystallization properties for structural biology. Additional tools are available to help users introduce other mutations (for example, indels and substitutions) and evaluate their effect on RNA structure. Exemplary calculations are shown for five RNAs that require 2D structure for their function: MALAT1 mascRNA, an influenza virus splice regulatory motif, EBER2 viral noncoding RNA, Xist lncRNA repA region, and human Y RNA 5.

Unbiased high-throughput sequencing using the 318 v2 semiconductor chip of these eight samples gave readings of 57–580 K (average after data analysis: 270 K) in a single run. As a result, viral genome sequences were detected in each sample.

1439,Hepatitis E in three immunocompromised children in southeastern France,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an autochthonous disease that occurs in developed countries where links with a viral swine reservoir have been proven. In addition, chronic HEV infection and associated cirrhosis have been described in severely immunocompromised patients. However, only a few studies worldwide have focused on pediatric HEV infections, and only four autochthonous cases have been reported in children in developed countries. Here we describe acute hepatitis E in three immunocompromised children. Case number 1 was a 9-year-old liver transplant recipient who was diagnosed with H1N1 2009 flu infection concurrently with hepatitis E. case no. 2 was a 12-year-old boy presenting early medullary recurrence of type B lymphoblastic leukemia and HEV RNA was detected over a 29-week period. Case number 3 was a 9-year-old boy with a rare primary immunodeficiency due to XIAP deficiency. All HEV infections were autochthonous and included different viruses classified as subtypes f, c and e of genotype 3 identified in autochthonous cases in Europe. These three observations have led to the consideration of HEV as a hepatitis-causing agent in children in developed countries, and to testing for HEV, particularly in severely immunocompromised individuals who may develop chronic hepatitis E.

The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A and C (RVA and RVC), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in the free-living wild boar population in the Czech Republic. Members of the Coronaviridae family (infectious gastroenteritis virus – TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus – PEDV, porcine respiratory coronavirus – PRCV and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus – PHEV) and Picornaviridae,(teschovirus A – PTV, sapelovirus A – PSV and enterovirus G – EV-G ). In our study, fecal samples from 203 wild boars culled in the 2014-2015 (October-January) hunting season were examined by RT-PCR. RVA was detected in 2.5% of the samples tested. Nucleotide analysis of the VP7, VP4 and VP6 genes revealed that the four RVA strains belonged to the genotypes G4P[25I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5 and G5P[13]I5, and phylogenetic analysis showed close association with pig. and human RVAs. The prevalence of RVC in the wild boar population was found to be 12.8%, PTV 20.2%, PSV 8.9%, and EV-G 2.5% of the samples. No PRRSV or coronavirus was detected during our study. Our study provides the first evidence of the prevalence of RVC in wild boars and demonstrates that wild boars may contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses.",,"MoutelÃ­kovÃ¡, R.;DufkovÃ¡, L.;Kamler, J.;Drimaj, J.;Plhal, R.;ProdÄ›lalovÃ¡, J.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.08.003,0
1442,Identifying an emerging disease,"It is not easy to identify an emerging disease, as there are several different types of disease manifestation. For example, there may be a 'true' emergence of a brand new disease, such as the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the 1980s, or a geographical manifestation in a previously unaffected region, such as the emergence of blue tongue in northern Europe. 2006. In addition, disease may occur in species previously thought to be unaffected, for example the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis in wildlife species in France since 2000. There may also be an unexpected increase in the incidence of disease in a known area and a known type, or an increase in our knowledge or awareness of a particular disease. The common point of all these emerging diseases is that human activities often play a role in their emergence. For example, bovine spongiform encephalopathy most likely arose as a result of changes in meat-bone meal production, bluetongue spread to colder climates as a result of uncontrolled animal trade, and as a result of relaxed screening and surveillance for animals. bovine tuberculosis has allowed the disease to re-emerge in areas that can significantly reduce the number of cases. Globalization and population growth will continue to affect the epidemiology of diseases in the coming years, and ecosystems will continue to evolve. In addition, new technologies such as metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing are always identifying new microorganisms. The only constant is change, and diseases will continue to arise and when dealing with these diseases in the future we must consider the causes and the different types of manifestation.",,"Moutou, F.;Pastoret, P.

1443,Root loop recognition by DDX17 facilitates miRNA processing and antiviral defense,"DEAD-box helicases play important roles in RNA metabolism across species, but emerging data suggest they have additional functions in immunity. Through RNAi screening, we identified an evolutionarily conserved and interferon-independent role for DEAD box helix DDX17 in restricting Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus in the bunyavirus family that causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. . Loss of Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies increased RVFV infection. Similarly, depletion of DDX17, but not its related helix DDX5, increased RVFV replication in human cells. Using cross-linking immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds stem loops of host pri-miRNA to facilitate processing, as well as an important stem loop in bunyaviral RNA to restrict infection. Thus, DDX17 has a dual role in the recognition of stem loops: in the nucleus for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and in the cytoplasm for surveillance against structured core elements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Moy, R.

This study established a new phylogenetic analysis and epidemiology comparison based on the 205 bp p72 gene sequences. Based on this partial p72 fragment, an updated list of 44 different genotypes was generated from a total of 516 ASFV sequences compiled from GenBank. The nucleotide diversity was 0.04325 Â± 0.00231. Analysis of spatial genetic diversity divided the ASFV populations of the African continent into four segments (section A: central and upper eastern Africa; segment B: eastern Africa; segment C: eastern and southern Africa; and segment D: southern Africa). These results and the developed protocol can serve as useful molecular tools for the diagnosis of ASFV from degraded DNA or decomposed samples, and also facilitate decision planning to limit their spread by providing a phylogeographic perspective to determine the origin of viral outbreaks.",,"Muangkram, Y.;Sukmak, M.;Wajjwalku, W.",2015.0,,10.4238/2015.May.4.15,0

In this context, we propose a definition of ""molecular surveillance"" and argue that molecular data is a complement rather than a substitute for robust epidemiological study and surveillance design. Special considerations regarding sample collection were also raised, such as the importance of the relationship between the molecular clock rate of genetic markers and the space-time scale of surveillance effectiveness, which can be control or strategy driven.

In this study, the strain of rabies virus (RABV) in Zambia was determined. by phylogenetic analysis of nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) gene sequences. Total RNA was extracted from 87-DFAT brain samples, of which only 35 (40%) were positive on the nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for each gene and 26 were positive for both genes. Positive samples for the N (n= 33) and G (n= 35) genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene showed two phylogenetic clusters belonging to the African 1b lineage found in eastern and southern Africa in Zambia. One cluster consisted of Zambian strains only, while the other was more heterogeneous in RABV origins and included strains from Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene revealed similar RABV strains in different hosts and regions of Zambia. To improve the molecular diagnosis of RABV in Zambia, we designed primers for reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay from the consensus sequence of the N gene. The specificity and reproducibility of the RT-LAMP assay has been validated with real clinical samples. Therefore, the RT-LAMP test presented in this study may prove useful for routine rabies diagnosis in Zambia. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Muleya, W.;Namangala, B.;Mweene, A.;Zulu, L.;Fandamu, P.;Banda, D.;Kimura, T.;Sawa, H.;Ishii, A.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2011.09.010,0

1448,Genomic characterization of feline sarcoid-associated papillomavirus and proposed classification as Bos taurus papillomavirus type 14,"Feline sarcoids are rare mesenchymal neoplasms of domestic and exotic cats. Previous studies have consistently detected short DNA sequences from a papillomavirus (PV) called feline sarcoid-associated papillomavirus (FeSarPV) in these neoplasms. The FeSarPV sequence has never been detected in any non-sarcoid samples from cats, but was amplified from bovine skin, suggesting that feline sarcoids are caused by interspecies infection by a bovine papillomavirus (BPV). The aim of this study was to determine the genome of PV containing the FeSarPV sequence. Using the circular structure of PV DNA, four specially designed ""outward-facing"" primers were used to amplify two DNA fragments of approximately 4,000 bp from a cat sarcoid. The two PCR products were sequenced using next-generation sequencing, and the 7,966 bp complete genome of PV was assembled and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PV is closely related to the 4 species of delta BPVs-1, -2 and -13, but distantly related to any carnivorous PV genera. These results are consistent with feline sarcoids caused by one type of BPV, and we propose a BPV-14 classification for this new PV. Initial analysis suggests that, like other delta BPVs, BPV-14 E5 protein may bind to the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor, causing mesenchymal proliferation. Interestingly, the lack of detection of BPV-14 in any equine sarcoid suggests that BPV-14 has a limited host range to bovids and felines.",,"Munday, J. S.;Thomson, N.;Dunowska, M.;Knight, C.

Six-week-old and clinically healthy animals were vaccinated with the lethal Margarita strain (secondary virus). For the specific detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved to have no cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. Wild boars consistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the lethal CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of detection of Margarita RNA in serum, swab, and tissue samples. In addition, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only primary infecting virus RNA (strain Cat01) could be detected even after isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, data analysis of Margarita qRT-PCR via calculated Î”Ct values supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were significantly protected from superinfection after in vitro vaccination with the Margarita virus strain and this virus could be infected. In parallel, IFN-β values could not be detected in sera from animals in Group B after vaccination with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals failed to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralizing antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-β-producing cells) after vaccination with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis failed to detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the tested samples from Group B. Our results showed that the SIE phenomenon may play a role in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in the control of CSFV by vaccination.

To reduce the economic loss caused by BLV infection, it is important to clarify the characters associated with BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis in cattle. In this study, we focused on viral characters and examined spontaneous mutations and viral characteristics in the virus by whole genome sequences and analyzes of BLV molecular clones from cows with and without EBL. Genomic analysis showed that all 28 strains harbor limited genetic variations, but no deletion mutations, which allowed classification into three groups (A, B, and C) except for one strain. Some nucleotide/amino acid substitutions were group specific. On the other hand, these genetic variations were not associated with the host bovine leukocyte antigen-DRB3 allele, which is known to be associated with BLV pathogenesis. In vitro viral replication activity was high, moderate and low in groups A, B and C, respectively. In addition, the proviral load associated with BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis was found to be high in cows infected with group A strains and low in those infected with group B/C strains.

In this study, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and susceptibility to digestion with mung bean nuclease, the vital genome is circular and negative-stranded and contains 3,852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation showed virus banding at 1.31-1.34 g/ml; filtration studies have shown that TTV has a particle size of 30-50 nm. These results indicate that the virus is similar to Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (eg, birds and pigs); however, sequence similarity searches of existing databases did not reveal identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of a 260 nt region from 151 globally distributed isolates demonstrated the presence of three major TTV genotypes. A few individuals at high risk of infection with parenterally transmitted viruses have been infected with more than one genotype. There was no association between genotype and geographic origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; No biochemical or histological evidence for hepatitis was obtained.

1457,Avian influenza virus wild bird surveillance in the Azov and Black Sea regions of Ukraine (2010-2011),"The Azov and Black Sea basins are part of transcontinental wild bird migration routes from North Asia and Europe to the Mediterranean, Africa and Southwest Asia. These regions constitute transitional, stopping and nesting areas for many different bird species. From September 2010 to September 2011, a wild bird surveillance study was conducted in these areas to identify avian influenza viruses. Biological samples from cloacal and tracheal swabs and faecal samples were collected from wild birds belonging to different ecological groups, including waterfowl and marine and terrestrial birds, at sites of mass bird accumulations in the Sivash Bay and Utlyuksky and Molochniy estuaries. The sampling covered the following wild bird biological cycles: autumn migration, wintering, spring migration, nesting, and post-nesting seasons. A total of 3634 specimens from 66 different bird species were collected. During the autumn migration, 19 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 14 of which were identified as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus subtypes H1Ny, H3N8, H5N2, H7Ny, H8N4, H10N7 and H11N8. Of the overwintering samples, 36 were LPAI virus subtypes H1N1, H1N? 45 hemagglutination viruses, defined as H1N2, H4N?, H6N1, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, H8N2, H9N2, H10N7, H10N4, H11N2, H12N2 and H15N7. Only three viruses were isolated during the spring migration, nesting, and post-nesting seasons (serotypes H6, H13, and H16). HA and NA genes were sequenced from isolated H5 and N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecological links between Azov and Black Sea regions and Europe. LPAI viruses were mostly isolated from mallard ducks, but also from shell ducks, oarsmen, teal and white-fronted geese. The remainder of the 14 isolated hemagglutinating viruses were identified as different avian paramyxovirus serotypes (APMV-1, APMV-4, APMV-6 and APMV-7).

1458,Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Hepatitis E Virus in Retail Pork Products Marketed in Canada,"Infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is very common worldwide. HEV causes acute viral hepatitis with approximately 20 million cases per year. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 cause major aquatic and foodborne outbreaks with a significant mortality rate in developing countries, while genotypes 3 and 4 are more common in developed countries where transmission is mostly zoonotic. HEV is increasingly detected in pigs in North America and Europe, and exposure to pork and pork products is thought to be the primary source of infection. Therefore, we set out to investigate the prevalence of HEV in retail pork products available in Canada by screening meal-sized portions of bacon, raw pork sausage, and raw pork liver. The presence of HEV genomes was determined by RT-PCR and viral RNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR. Overall, HEV was detected in 47% of sampled pork purees and 10.5% of sampled raw pork livers, but not in sampled pork sausages, and sequencing confirmed that all HEV strains belonged to genotype 3. revealed that all isolates belonged to subtype 3a, except for one isolate with subtype 3d. Amino acid variations among isolates were also observed in the ordered capsid region. In conclusion, the prevalence of HEV in mashed potatoes and raw pork liver observed in this study is consistent with the current distribution of HEV in pork products reported in other developed countries.",,"Mykytczuk, O.;Harlow, J.;Bidawid, S.;Corneau, N.;Nasheri, N.",2017.0,,10.1007/s12560-017-9281-9,0
1459,Single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA) combined with next-generation sequencing provides full bovine coronavirus genome coverage and greater sequence depth compared to sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA).,"Coronaviruses are of great importance for both animal and human health. With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for rapid genome characterization has become more important than ever. In addition, deep array and full-length viral genome analysis techniques are needed to understand the impact of half-species of these viruses on biology. In this study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] combined with high-throughput sequencing. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) long genome from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), but there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads mapped to BCoV. Approximately 45% of Ovation reads are mapped to BCoV (sequence depth 169–284 944), while only 0.07% of SISPA reads (0–249 sequence depth) are mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study, we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the datasets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV with respect to Ovation versus SISPA, but fewer sequences were mapped to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced full BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) coverage and high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results suggest that the Ovation method may be the preferred approach for whole genome sequencing if low numbers of viral RNA are expected and high sequence depth is desired.",,"Myrmel, M.;Oma, V.;Khatri, M.;Hansen, H.

1460,Phylogenetic analysis of bovine viral diarrhea viruses using five different genetic regions,"Phylogenetic analysis of five different regions (5-non-coding region (5-NCR), Npro, E2, NS3 and NS5B-3-NCR) of the 48 Japanese and reported bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genomes was performed. Japanese BVDVs were divided into six subgroups and BVDV1 divided into BVDV2. An isolate, So CP/75, isolated in 1975 and previously proposed as subgroup 1e to the 5-NCR sequence, was highly unique and constituted an independent lineage in the tree of any region. Another isolate from an experimental case of mucosal disease, 190CP, was classified as subgroup 1e identified by Becher et al. It is classified as subgroup 1a in the 5–²NCR, Npro and E2 regions, and in the NS5B-3–NCR region. The genomic sequences of the American isolates ILLC and ILLNC obtained from the GenBank database show subgroup 1b in the 5â€²NCR, Npro, E2 and NS5B-3â€²NCR regions, and subgroup 1a in the NS3 region, indicating that recombination between virus strains classified in different subgroups in one animal. think it occurs.

1461,Genomic and serological diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus in Japan,"The genomic characteristics of 62 field isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) collected in Japan between 1974 and 1999 were investigated. The 5-² untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequences of 244 to 247 bases were determined. Serological properties were also characterized by the cross Neutralization test using antisera against the representative strain of the classified genotype. Using phylogenetic tree analysis, BVDV 1 was divided into two main clusters, BVDV-1a (29 isolates) and BVDV-1b (27 isolates). In group 1a, 3 was different from the other viruses and were classified in a branch assigned as 1aâ€². However, 4 isolates (ie CP/75, 190 CP, 190 NCP and KS86-1-NCP) could not be assigned to group 1a or 1b. Compared with published sequence data, KS86-1-NCP, 190 CP and 190 NCP were similar to South African isolates recently proposed as BVDV 1c. The 5–²UTR sequence of So CP/75 was unique among those in BVDV 1, suggesting that the isolate should be classified into a new genotype. Of the 62 isolates collected in 1989 and 1990, only 2 were identified as BVDV 2. The results of the Cross Neutralization test strongly supported these data and revealed a close correlation between the 5-UTR sequence and BVDV antigenicity.",,"Nagai, M.;Ito, T.;Sugita, S.;Genno, A.;Takeuchi, K.;Ozawa, T.;Sakoda, Y.;Nishimori, T.;Takamura, K.;Akashi, H.",2001.0,,10.1007/s007050170139,0
1462,Identification and whole genome analysis of a novel bovine picornavirus in Japan,"Using a metagenomic approach, we identified novel viruses in the stool of cattle with diarrhea collected in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan in 2009, and identified the (almost) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyzes revealed that they have a standard picornavirus genome organization, namely the 5' untranslated region (UTR) - L- P1 (VP4- VP3- VP2- VP1) - P2 (2A-2B-2C) - P3 (3A-3B- 3C -3D) - 3'UTR- poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; bat picornaviruses group 1-3, feline picornavirus and canine picornavirus share amino acid identities of 45.4%-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2) and 49.6-53.3% (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes and detailed genome characterization showed that, together with the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses, they are grouped together as a cluster for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. These viruses have conserved features suggesting a common ancestry (eg, reverse transcription-PCR assays using specific primers designed from the 5'UTR sequence of these viruses showed that 23.0% (20/87) of stool samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, which shows the prevalence of picornavirus in Japanese cattle population in Hokkaido Prefecture, however, further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic potential and etiological role of these viruses in cattle.",,"Nagai, M.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Kaku, Y.;Belsham, G.

1463,Whole genome analysis of bovine astrovirus from fecal samples of cattle in Japan: identifying possible interspecies transmission of bovine astrovirus.,"viral metagenomic approach was used to investigate stool samples from diarrheal and nondiarrheal Japanese calves. Of the different viral pathogens detected, read counts in 15 of 146 stool samples collected from three different regions (Hokkaido, Ishikawa and Kagoshima Prefectures) between 2009 and 2015 yielded nearly all of the astrovirus-related RNA sequences. Due to the lack of genetic information about bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to the Chinese BoAstVs and clustered into a lineage (temporarily designated lineage 1) across all phylogenetic trees. Three of the 15 strains were phylogenetically distinct from lineage 1, showing low sequence identities and instead clustered with an American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively designated lineage 2). Interestingly, two of the 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b regions clustered with lineage 2 in the ORF2 region. Remarkably, one of the 15 strains exhibited low amino acid sequence similarity to other BoAstVs and clustered separately with porcine astrovirus type 5 and ovine astrovirus in the ORF2 region in all trees, suggesting past interspecies transmission.",,"Nagai, M.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Otomaru, K.;Uto, T.;Koizumi, M.;Minami-Fukuda, F.;Takai, H.;Murakami, T.;Masuda, T.;Yamasato, H.;Shiokawa, M.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Sano, K.;Okazaki, S.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Furuya, T.;Shirai, J.;Mizutani, T.",2015.0,,10.1007/s00705-015-2543-7,1
1464,"GiRaF: Robust, computational identification of influenza reclassifications via graph mining","Reclassifications in influenza virus, a process in which strains alter genetic segments, played a role in two of the three 20th century pandemics and the 2009 H1N1 epidemic. While advances in sequencing have led to an explosion in the number of whole genome sequences available, an understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in viral evolution is still lacking. A major factor in this is the lack of automated tools for the safe identification of reclassifications from sequence data due to the difficulties of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. Here we describe a new computational method called GiRaF (Graph mismatch-based Reclassification Finder) that powerfully identifies reclassifications in a fully automatic manner while accounting for uncertainties in inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampled trees for mismatched partition groups using a fast biclique numbering algorithm combined with several statistical tests to identify clusters of taxa with distinct phylogenetic placement. GiRaF accurately finds known reclassifications in human, avian and swine flu populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent 'swine flu' epidemic. GiRaF also identifies several previously unreported reclassifications through whole genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine flu isolates. Â© Author(s) 2010.

1466,Genetic analysis of Indian foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype A and detection of positive selection and recombination in leader protease and capsid-encoding regions.,"Leader protease (Lpro) and capsid encoding sequences (P1) make up approximately 3 kb of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). We examined the phylogenetic relationship of 46 FMDV serotype A isolates of Indian origin collected during 1968-2005, as well as eight vaccine strains using the neighboring tree and Bayesian tree methods. Viruses were categorized under three main groups: Asia, Europe-South America and Europe. The Indian isolates formed a separate genetic group among the Asian isolates. Indian isolates were further divided into different genetic subgroups (<5% divergence). Post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups, while in 2005 several isolates originating from Andhra Pradesh formed a separate group. These isolates were closely related to the isolates of the 1970s. FMDV isolates appear to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution, with ancestral identical sequences found in circulating isolates. The eight vaccine strains included in the study were unrelated and belonged to different genetic groups. Recombination was detected in the Lpro region in one isolate (A IND 20/82) and in the 1D region encoding VP1 in another isolate (A RAJ 21/96).

1467,Novel real-time PCR-based patho- and phylotyping of potentially zoonotic avian influenza a subtype H5 viruses at risk of spreading to Europe in 2017.,"Since November 2016, Europe has been witnessing another wave of invasion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses from the Asian goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with the H5 viruses of section 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses belonging to groups 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were previously detected in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. deaths. There is evidence of their joint circulation in the Middle East. Low pathogenicity (LPAI) subtype H5 viruses are endemic in migratory wild bird populations. They develop into potentially highly pathogenic phenotypes following infestation in poultry holdings. However, to date, only the gs/GD H5 strain has had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis is the cornerstone for the control and elimination of HPAI virus attacks. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent pathotype and sequence-specific discrimination of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus sequences and currently circulating Eurasian LPAI viruses.

1468,Whole genome sequence analysis of newly emerged QX-like infectious bronchitis virus from Sudan reveals distinct recombination points,"Different geno- and serotypes continue to circulate worldwide, while infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection continues to cause economically significant disease in poultry. Two infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) were isolated from chickens with respiratory disease in Sudan. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene revealed a close association with the QX-like genotype, which had not been previously detected in Sudan. Whole genome analysis of the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate by next-generation sequencing revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides containing 13 open reading frames: 5'-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-EM-4b- 4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'. The highest nucleotide sequence identity of 93% for the whole genome was found with the Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, the Italian IBV isolate ITA/90254/2005 and the 4/91 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate clustered together with viruses belonging to the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis provided evidence for different origin patterns of RNA in the Sudan isolate in multiple genes. The dispersion of various recombination sites throughout the genome suggests that the Sudan-QX-like strain emerged as a uniquely recombinant from multiple recombination events of parent viruses from genotypes 4/91, H120 and ITA/90254/2005. The Sudanese QX-like isolate is reasonably genetically distinct from previously reported IBV strains in Africa and elsewhere.",,"Naguib, M. M.;Hoper, D.;Arafa, A. S.;Setta, A.

1470,Dynamic evolution of endogenous retrovirus-derived genes expressed in bovine concepts during the insertion period.,"In mammalian evolution, syncytin-1, which is derived from the envelope (env) gene of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV), helps placenta cell fusion in humans, so some genes required for placental development are known to be retroviralorigin. Although the placenta functions the same in all placental mammals, the env-derived genes responsible for trophoblast cell fusion and maternal immune tolerance differ between species and remain largely unidentified in bovine species. To comprehensively examine env-derived genes involved in bovine placental development, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of bovine concepts during three key implantation periods using a high-throughput sequencer. Sequence reads were mapped into the bovine genome where ERV candidates were annotated using RetroTector® (7,624 and 1,542 for ERV-derived and env-derived genes, respectively). Matched reads showed that approximately 18% (284 genes) of env-derived genes in the genome were expressed during placental formation, and approximately 4% (63 genes) were detected for all days studied. We confirmed three env-derived genes expressed in trophoblast cells by polymerase chain reaction. Of these three, the env-derived gene sequence with the longest open reading frame (termed BERV-P env) was found to show high expression levels in trophoblast cell lines and was similar to that of the syncytin-Car1 genes found in dogs. and cats, despite their different origins. These results suggest that placentation is dependent on several retrovirus-derived genes that may replace endogenous precursors during evolution.

1471,Identification of European-type hepatitis E virus subtype 3e isolates in Japanese wild boars: Molecular follow-up of HEV from pigs to wild boars.,"The nucleotide sequences of hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates infecting wild boars in Mie prefecture, located in central Japan and far from the areas where HEV infection is most common in Japan, were determined and characterized. Of the 144 wild boar serum samples captured in Mie prefecture, 7 were positive for HEV-RNA. The nucleotide sequence of nearly the entire genome was determined for 4 out of 7 positive samples. Phylogenetic tree analyzes showed that of the 7 isolates, 6 samples were subtype 3e and 1 sample was subtype 3a. We identified localization of subtype 3e isolates in Japanese wild boars. Moreover, 5 subtype 3e isolates were closely related and included in the peripheral branch of subtype 3e isolates from European countries in the phylogenetic tree. The construct indicated that the ancestor of the 5 subtype 3e isolates was of European origin. Phylogenetic structure and association analyzes suggested that subtype 3e isolates entered Japan from Europe around 1966 with the importation of large breed pigs. The results also showed that several lineages of subtype 3e spread over a wide area of Japan and 1 of the lineages around 1992. It was domesticated in wild boars in Mie County between 1992 and 2009. The appearance of a boar cluster on the peripheral branch in the phylogenetic lineage may indicate the direction of gene flow of HEV subtype 3e from pigs to wild boars.

1472,Dysfunction of bovine endogenous retrovirus K2 envelope glycoprotein is related to its failed intracellular trafficking.,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of retroviral infection of ancestral germ cells. Mutations introduced into ERVs stop the production of infectious agents, but their effect on the function of retroviral proteins is not fully understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are used in membrane fusion during viral entry, and we recently identified intact coding sequences for bovine endogenous retrovirus K1 (BERV-K1) and BERV-K2 Envs. The amino acid sequences of BERV-K1 Env (also called Fematrin-1) and BERV-K2 Env are similar, and both viruses are classified in the Betaretrovirus genus. Fematrin-1 plays an important role in cell-to-cell fusion in the bovine placenta, while the BERV-K2 envelope gene is marginally expressed in vivo and the recombinant Env protein is defective in membrane fusion due to insufficient surface division (SU). and transmembrane subunits. Here, we performed chimeric analyzes of Fematrin-1 and BERV-K2 Envs and revealed that defective maturation of BERV-K2 Env contributes to failed intracellular trafficking. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis suggested that, unlike Fematrin-1 Env, BERV-K2 Env could not be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network where cellular proteases required for processing retroviral Envs are localized. We also determined that one of the regions responsive to this phenomenon is located in a 65 amino acid region of BERV-K2 SU. This is the first report to identify a role for retroviral Env SU in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and may help illuminate the maturation process of Fematrin-1 and other related Envs. Â© 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Nakaya, Y.;Miyazawa, T.",2014.0,,10.1128/jvi.00288-14,0

Pigs have been reported to act as a reservoir for occasionally emerging zoonotic viruses, and epidemiological studies have shown direct links between consumption of uncooked pork offal and cases of hepatitis in humans caused by genotype 3 of the hepatitis E virus (HEV). The presence of HEV in swine herds has been reported, but its spread in swine production environments is still unknown. To investigate sources of viral contamination in the swine industry, 452 environmental and faecal samples, including samples from livestock transport vehicles, were collected over an 11Â month period from ten farms and an abattoir, which together represent a single production network. Hepatitis E virus RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in 32 samples from both inside and outside farm buildings, from trucks, and mostly from fomites collected in a slaughterhouse, such as a commercial vehicle. Phylogenetic analysis showed a wide variety of HEV genotype 3 strains similar to previously found human and porcine strains.

Although this mechanism has only been observed to occur naturally in these HA subtypes, little is known about the genetic basis for the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that sequential adenine residues and a stem loop structure, which are frequently found in the viral RNA region encoding amino acids around the cleavage site of low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses isolated from waterfowl reservoirs, are important for nucleotide additions to it. RNA region. A reporter assay to detect template-free nucleotide insertions and deep sequencing analysis of viral RNAs revealed that the increased number of adenine residues and the expanded stem-loop structure in the RNA region accelerate the multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions required to form codons for the essential amino. acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were not mainly observed in viral RNA of the other subtypes tested (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Our findings suggest that RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide additions and provides a clue as to why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is limited to certain HA subtypes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza A viruses contain the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA). ) and subtypes according to the antigenicity of neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H1 to -16) of influenza A viruses conserved in waterfowl reservoirs, H5 and H7 viruses frequently become highly pathogenic via uptake of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980s, the genetic basis of nucleotide additions remains unclear. This study demonstrates the potential role of viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and illustrates a key mechanism explaining why acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is limited to certain HA subtypes in nature. Our findings will contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of influenza A viruses and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines with increased stability against H5 and H7 influenza A viruses.",,"Nao, N.;Yamagishi, J.;Miyamoto, H.;Igarashi, M.;Manzoor, R.;Ohnuma, A.;Tsuda, Y.;Furuyama, W.;Shigeno, A.;Kajihara, M.;Kishida, N.;Yoshida, R.;Takada, A.",2017.0,02 14,,0
1476,Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of a novel picornavirus from pig feces in Japan.,"During the investigation of porcine fecal viruses using a metagenomic approach, a novel picornavirus was identified in the feces of a healthy two-month-old pig. Named Porcine picornavirus Japan (PPVJ), this virus had a standardized picornavirus genome organization, including the L protein region. The 5' untranslated region harbored a type II internal ribosomal entry site. This virus was most closely related to lesavirus 1 (amino acid sequence identity: 38.2%Â) at P1, equine rhinitis A virus (25.8%) to P2, and lesavirus 2 (40.9%) to P3. According to the genus boundaries for the Picornaviridae family (40%, 40%, and less than 50% amino acid sequence identity in P1, P2 and P3, respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the Picornaviridae family. In 23.3% of fecal samples (from 58.3% of farms in a large area) from pigs less than four months old, PPVJ was detected by reverse transcription PCR followed by sequencing using specific primers designed from the 3D array. The host range and pathogenic potential of this virus in animals have not yet been determined.",,"Naoi, Y.;Kishimoto, M.;Masuda, T.;Ito, M.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Sano, K.;Yamasato, H.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Furuya, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Okada, T.;Shirai, J.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2016.0,,10.1007/s00705-016-2834-7,1
1477,Six-year surveillance of Newcastle disease virus in wild birds in northeastern Spain (Catalonia).,"Given that Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the biggest threats to the poultry industry, testing for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been carried out since 2010 in cases of wild bird death (passive surveillance) in Catalonia. The aim is to provide an early warning system to prevent infection of poultry. Since 2010, 35 deaths in wild birds have been attributed to NDV infection. During this period, the gradual expansion of NDV to new areas has seen an increase in deaths, although it is unclear whether these were the result of the spread of the virus or improved surveillance. Phylogenetic analyzes show that two distinct sublineages of NDV, 4a and 4b, are circulating in Catalonia. Both sublineages appear to be endemic to the wild bird population and mainly affect Eurasian collared pigeons and their spatial distribution (overlaps with that of this species) and temporal distribution (mostly between September and February). So far, endemicity in wild birds has not led to ND outbreaks in poultry. However, there are still many uncertainties about, for example, whether NDV could expand into new regions of Catalonia (where the poultry density is higher) or the threat that the apparently newer subclade 4a could represent. Therefore, efforts should be made to promote measures to prevent infection of poultry farms (especially in high-risk areas and periods) and to maintain surveillance.",,"Napp, S.;Alba, A.;Rocha, A.

Canadian RVA strains were compared with RVA strains contained in the porcine ProSystems RCE rotavirus vaccine. The comparison revealed multiple amino acid differences in the G and P antigenic epitopes, independent of the G and P genotypes, but particularly in the Canadian G3, P[13] and P[19] genotypes.

1479,Long-term evolution of viruses: A Janus-faced balance,"The popular textbook image of viruses as harmful and selfish genetic parasites vastly underestimates their beneficial contribution to the biosphere. Given the significant dependence of viruses for replication in an intracellular environment, viruses that engage in excessive killing (lysis) can cause extinction of their cellular hosts and are unable to survive. Therefore, the lytic mode of virus propagation must be tempered and balanced by the non-lytic modes of virus delay and symbiosis. Here, we review recent bioinformatics and metagenomic studies to discuss how viral endogenization and domestication may be more common mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangular diagram to explain the three main virus persistence strategies that explain the global extent of virus-cell interactions, including fragmentation, latency, and virus-cell symbiont. This paradigm could help identify new directions in virology research where scientists can artificially gain control over altering lytic and beneficial viral lifestyles.",,"Nasir, A.;Kim, K.

1480,Biological and molecular characterization of Indian chicken anemia virus isolates,"In this study, four chicken anemia virus (CAV) isolates (CAV-A, -B, -E and -P) obtained from different geographical regions of India were characterized. The CAV genome of the 1766 bp nucleotide region containing the complete coding region of the VP2 and VP3 proteins and the partial coding region of the VP1 protein was sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of Indian CAV isolates were aligned and compared with CAV isolates from Europe, Asia, America and Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of Indian CAV isolates was also performed based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. The results showed that the Indian isolates evolved genetically from different parts of the world. The Indian isolate, CAV-A, was found to be closely related to the European Cux-1 strain, CAV-B and -P were found to be closely related to the Bangladesh BD-3 strain, and CAV-E was found to be closely related to the Australian 704 strain. The pathogenicity of four CAV isolates was studied in one-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. One-day-old SPF chicks (n = 50) were divided into five groups of 10 chicks in each group. Group 1 was kept as a control, and groups 2-5 were infected with each CAV isolate separately. Chicks were infected intramuscularly at a dose rate of 1 ml cell culture fluid (104.5 TCID50/0.1 ml) per bird. Clinical signs, mortality and packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight gain were recorded at 5, 10, and 15 days after infection. On day 15, all birds were sacrificed and various organs, namely thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver and bursa, were examined for gross and microscopic changes. The pathogenicity study showed that all CAVs except CAV-B were able to produce clinical disease and immunosuppression in young chicks, whereas the CAV-B isolate did not produce clinical disease, but only induced immunosuppression revealed by microscopic examination of lymphoid organs. The study showed valuable information on the molecular epidemiological status of CAV isolates prevalent in India for the first time.

1481,Comparison of exosomes purified by ultracentrifugation (UC) and Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) reagent from serum of hens vaccinated with Marek's disease virus (MDV) and tumor bearing,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a collective term used to denote microparticles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies produced by various cells and released into interstitial spaces and body fluids. Serum exosomes can serve as invaluable biomarkers containing m/miRNAs, lipids and proteins that are indicative of various conditions. There are currently limited studies on the characterization and mutual consensus of biomarker profiles of serum exosomes purified by different methods. Here, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of two commonly used serum exosome purification procedures, including ultracentrifugation (UC) and Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) reagent, by analyzing the exosome size distribution, concentration, morphology, and miRNA expression profiles. The serum was obtained from chickens infected with Marek's disease virus (MDV) vaccinated against Marek's disease (MD) and thus protected or unvaccinated and carrying tumors caused by MDV. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were performed to evaluate particle size, concentration and morphological integrity, respectively. Our results show that the size distribution of particles purified by both procedures is consistent with that of exosomes (30–150 nm). The TEI reagent produced slightly larger (âˆ¼180 nm) higher yields and additional populations of co-isolated EVs. Based on miRNA expression profiles from a previous high-throughput sequencing experiment of exosome small RNAs, we selected six cellular and four MDV1 miRNAs to confirm their expression in UC and TEI-purified exosomes. miRNA expression profiles exhibited relative correlation between the two procedures, but abundant marked differences were observed in TEI-purified exosomes, which showed higher miRNA expression consistent with higher yield than those purified with UC. TEI-purified exosomes from vaccinated chickens showed greater expression of tumor suppressor miRNA, gga-mir-146b and at least oncomiR, gga-mir-21, compared to those from tumor-bearing chickens. We propose that gga-mir-146 and -21 may serve as serum exosome biomarkers for vaccine-induced protection and MD tumors, respectively.",,"Nath Neerukonda, S.;Egan, N.

First, protein homology analyzes of more than 400 sequences revealed that this virus most likely evolved from recent porcine viruses. Second, phylogenetic analyzes of the 5,214 protein sequences of influenza A(H1N1) viruses (avian, pig, and human) circulating in North America over the past two decades (from 1989 to 2009) show that the novel influenza A(H1N1) virus has a unique evolutionary history. trait (genetic difference).

1483,Genetic and antigenic analysis of type A foot and mouth disease viruses isolated in India in 1987-1996.,"Twenty-three foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A field isolates recovered from different outbreaks in India between 1987-1996 were subjected to antigenic and genetic analysis. Isolates, a vaccine strain (IND 17/77) antiserum and a peptide (A22/ Azerbaijan/65 strain) antiserum. However, the isolates revealed minor antigenic differences in their reactivity with the three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that recognize trypsin-sensitive conformation-independent epitopes of the vaccinia virus strains. Phylogenetic association between isolates was established using a portion of the ID gene (168 nucleotides at the 3-â€²-terminus). An additional seven previously reported Indian field isolates of type A were included in the analysis. The percent similarity between Indian isolates ranged from 82.7% to 99.4% at the nucleotide level and between 83.9% and 100% at the amino acid level. These observations clearly demonstrate the genetic heterogeneity of field isolates. The current vaccine strain IND 17/77 deviated 9.7% at the nucleotide level and 5.6% at the amino acid level from the A22 Iraq 24/64 isolate. The field strains differed from the IND 17/77 vaccine strain by 5.6%-14.6% and 3.7-13.7% in nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. In the phylogenetic tree, the isolates were distributed into 21 genetic groups. The clustering pattern of isolates in the phylogenetic tree did not reveal a specific distribution pattern of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks by geographic location, resulting from unrestricted animal movement and the endemic nature of the disease.",,"Nayak, B.;Pattnaik, B.;Tosh, C.;Sanyal, A.;Hemadri, D.;Patil, S.

1484,Detection of novel porcine bocaviruses in stool samples of asymptomatic pigs in Cameroon,"The development and widespread use of nucleic acid amplification and sequencing methods has led to the recognition of novel virus diversity in various domestic animals, including pigs. In this study, we used strain-specific or broadly reactive PCR assays to describe the occurrence and genetic diversity of selected DNA viruses belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, and Parvoviridae in Cameroonian pigs. Fecal samples were collected in the spring of 2011. No adenoviruses, circoviruses, and anelloviruses were detected, but high prevalence and remarkable genetic diversity were observed in the identified parvoviruses, and particularly bocaviruses. PPV4 was the most common (20%), followed by PBoV3 (18%), PBoV4 (18%), PBoV5 plus 6V/7V (16%), and PBoV1 plus PBoV2 (6%).

1485,Avian Leukosis Virus Activation of an Antisense RNA Upstream of TERT in B-Cell Lymphomas,"UNLABELED: Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces tumors by integrating its proviral DNA into the chicken genome and altering the expression of nearby genes through strong promoter and enhancer elements. Sites of viral integration that contribute to oncogenesis are selected in tumor cells. Deep sequencing analysis of B-cell lymphoma DNA confirmed that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter is a common ALV integration target. Twenty-six unique proviral integration sites were mapped from 46 to 3,552 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the TERT transcription start site, predominantly in the opposite transcriptional orientation to TERT Transcripto-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of normal bursa, revealing a transcribed region upstream. TERT is upside down, suggesting that the TERT promoter is bidirectional. This transcript appears to be an uncharacterized antisense RNA. We have previously shown that TERT expression is upregulated in tumors by integrations in the TERT promoter region. We now report that the viral promoter drives the expression of a chimeric transcript containing viral sequences spliced in exons 4 to 7 of this antisense RNA. Clonal expansion of cells by ALV integrations that overexpress TERT antisense RNA suggests that it may have a role in tumorigenesis. IMPORTANCE: The data show that ALV integrations in the TERT promoter region trigger overexpression of a novel antisense RNA and contribute to the development of lymphomas.",,"Nehyba, J.;Malhotra, S.;Winans, S.;O'Hare, T.

1486,Molecular biology of bovine viral diarrhea virus,"Bovine viral diarrheal viruses (BVDV) are arguably the most important viral pathogen of ruminants worldwide and can cause serious economic losses. The clinical symptoms of the disease caused by BVDV range from subclinical to severe acute hemorrhagic syndrome, and the severity of the disease depends on the strain. These viruses are classified as members of the Pestivirus genus of Flaviviridae. BVDV is considered primarily a cattle pathogen, but can infect most ruminant species. The virus particle consists of a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding the encapsulated genomic RNA. Included in the outer membrane are two virus-encoded glycoproteins containing major antigenic determinants of the virus as well as receptor binding and cell fusion functions. A third glycoprotein is weakly associated with the virion, but also has unique properties that play important roles in suppressing innate immunity. Viral proteins are encoded in a single, large open reading frame. Viral proteins are proteolytically separated from polyprotein by different proteases. Structural proteins are processed by cellular signal peptidases while non-structural proteins are processed by viral serine protease. The virus collects and matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi bodies of the cell. The virus is released via exocytosis, where the viral proteins are not exposed on the cell surface. © 2012.",,"Neill, J. D.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.biologicals.2012.07.002,0
1487,Simultaneous rapid sequencing of multiple RNA virus genomes,"Comparison of archived virus sequences collected over many years to date allows the study of viral evolution and contributes to the design of new vaccines. However, the difficulty, time, and cost of producing full-length sequences from each archived sample separately hindered these studies. Next-generation sequencing technologies have been used for analysis of clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new, uncharacterized viruses from a number of viral families. The use of these sequencing technologies would be advantageous in studying viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing procedure was used to simultaneously and rapidly sequence multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This procedure used primers consisting of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3'-end, which also serve as an identifying barcode allowing differentiation of each viral library after pooling and sequencing. This provided sequence independence by randomly priming both first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a nuclease cocktail to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by synthesis of single-tube randomized double-stranded cDNA. The resulting cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size fractionated and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. Individual virus genomes were easily assembled with both de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This procedure consistently resulted in full-length, if not full-length, genomic sequences and was used to sequence multiple isolates of bovine pestivirus and coronavirus simultaneously.",,"Neill, J.

To examine this relationship, reverse transcriptase PCRs were performed using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the 2C RNA helix-like and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as a template. 2C RNA helicase primers directed the amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer sets amplified products from all but one of these viruses. Phylogenetic comparison of caliciviruses showed that SMSV, VESV and four related viruses are different from feline calicivirus, human calicivirus (small, round-shaped viruses) and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, but closely related and should be classified as hemorrhagic disease viruses.

Based on the need for immunosuppression in xenotransplantation, procedures developed to improve safety in allotransplantation could be applied in future xenotransplantation clinical trials. Standardized approaches can be developed to guide the assessment of common infectious syndromes in xenograft recipients. The opportunity created by screening pigs intended as xenograft donors has equal applicability to allotransplantation – particularly broader screening strategies for allograft donors such as the use of advanced sequencing modalities including wide-range molecular probes, microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing. Considerations in the management of allotransplant and xenotransplant-associated infections are largely the same. Experience in xenotransplantation will continue to inform thinking about donor-derived infections in allotransplantation.

Phylogenetic trees showed that NA genes can be divided into three groups, including (i) swine species, (ii) oldest human species, and (iii) lineages for recent human species. The evolutionary tree for 11 nucleotide and amino acid sequences suggested that the NAs of A/sw/HK/4/76 and A/sw/Kanagawa/2/78 belong to the lineage of recent human viruses. In contrast, the NA genes of the A/sw/HK/3/76 and H1N2 reassortant A/sw/Ehime/1/80 viruses were found to be from a pig lineage. The swine virus NA genes were also characterized by co-circulation of two distinct lineages. Although the rates of synonymous (silent) substitutions for porcine and human viruses were almost the same (from 0.00946 to 0.00884 per year for each region), the rate of non-synonymous (amino acid-changing) substitutions for the porcine virus NA genes was approximately 60%. for this human virus.",,"Nerome, K.;Kanegae, Y.;Yoshioka, Y.;Itamura, S.;Ishida, M.;Gojobori, T.;Oya, A.",1991.0,,,0
1492,"Approved and experimental measures against pestiviral diseases: Bovine viral diarrhea, classic swine fever and borderline disease","Pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), classic swine fever (CSFV) and borderline disease virus are important livestock pathogens in many countries, but current vaccines do not completely prevent the spread of infection. Control of pestiviral diseases is particularly challenging due to the constant viremia and viral shedding of persistently infected (PI) animals, which must be identified and eradicated to prevent disease transmission. Current vaccines are limited by the delay between vaccination and onset of protection, the difficulty of serologically distinguishing between vaccinated and naturally infected animals, and the need for broad vaccine cross-protection against a variety of virus strains. Antiviral therapy can potentially supplement vaccination by providing immediate protection in the event of an outbreak. Numerous compounds with in vitro antiviral activity against BVDV have been identified with a surrogate role for hepatitis C virus. Fewer drugs active against CSFV have been identified, but many compounds active against BVDV will likely inhibit CSFV given their similar genomic sequences. While in vitro research is promising, the paucity of efficacy studies in animals has hindered the commercial development of antiviral drugs effective against pestiviruses. In this article, we summarize the clinical syndromes and modes of transmission of BVD, CSF, and borderline disease, discuss currently approved vaccines, review efforts to develop antiviral therapies for use in epidemic control, and propose promising directions for future research.

1493,Characterization of a rotavirus,"Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of illness in children, calves and piglets and causes serious economic losses in domestic animals. Although some outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been associated with bacterial pathogens, particularly Escherichia coli, no known pathogens have been isolated from a significant proportion of the outbreaks until recently, when viruses with a distinct morphology and antigenic similarity were associated with diarrhea in piglets, calves, and children. . These viruses are the main pathogens, and viruses isolated from humans have also been shown to be infectious to pigs. Initially, these viruses were described as reovirus-like, but later the names rotavirus and duovirus were proposed. They differ morphologically and antigenically from both reoviruses and orbiviruses, and also differ from them in some physicochemical properties. Studies of the structure of rotaviruses have been limited to the nucleic acid of calf virus and the related epizootic diarrhea of infants (EDIM) virus of infant mice. Both viruses have been shown to contain RNA, and it has been suggested that calf virus RNA may be double-stranded. The results of the experiments described here show that calf rotavirus has several of the characteristic features of rheo and bluetongue viruses and should be classified by these. Although calf rotavirus has a smaller sedimentation coefficient and is morphologically different from rheo and bluetongue viruses, the segmented and double-stranded nature of its RNA and the number and molecular weights of RNA and polypeptides suggest that it should be considered as a member. reo and bluetongue virus group.

Using specific PCR, SealAV was identified in the lung tissue of two of five animals involved in 2000 deaths, and in one of 20 harbor seal samples examined postmortem in 2008. Identification of SealAV over several years is persistent in the harbor seal population of this virus. SealAV is the second anellovirus reported in the lungs of pinnipeds, suggesting that anellovirus infections may be common among cetaceans and further research is needed to understand the roles of these viruses in cetacean health and disease.",,"Ng, T.

1496,A metagenomic and case-control study to identify viruses associated with bovine respiratory disease,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem that causes significant economic losses for both dairy and beef cattle. To identify BRD-associated viruses, we used a metagenomic approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with BRD symptoms. After deep sequencing, de novo splicing and translated protein sequence similarity searches, a large number of known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Multiple genotypes of bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus and bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, detection rates of the eight most read viruses were compared for nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD with 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals were infected with more than one respiratory virus versus 8% of controls. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (P<0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P = 0.005) and the recently disclosed bovine influenza D virus (P = 0.006), of which 62% either alone or detected in combination. animals with BRD. A metagenomic and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls could provide a rapid tool to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory testing and ultimately effective intervention strategies.",,"Ng, T.

1497,Discovery of a novel single-stranded DNA virus from a sea turtle fibropapilloma using viral metagenomics.,"Viral metagenomics, consisting of viral particle purification and shotgun sequencing, is a powerful technique for discovering disease-associated viruses with no definite etiology, viruses that share limited homology with known viruses, or viruses that cannot be cultured. Here, we used viral metagenomics to study viruses associated with sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating neoplastic disease that affects sea turtles worldwide. A new single-stranded DNA virus, sea turtle tornovirus 1 (STTV1), has been discovered by directly purging the viral community from Florida green sea turtle fibropapilloma and shotgun sequencing. The single-stranded, circular genome of Sâ€²â€²â€²V1 was approximately 1,800 nucleotides long. Sâ€²â€²â€²V1 has only weak amino acid level identities (25%) against chicken anemia virus in short regions of its genome; thus STTV1 may represent the first member of a new virus family. A total of 35 healthy turtles and 27 turtles with FP were tested for STTV1 using PCR, and only 2 turtles severely affected by FP were positive. Because STTV1 is present in the blood and in all major organs, affected turtles were systemically infected with Sâ€²â€²V1. Sâ€²â€²lâ€²V1 exists as a semispecies with several genome variants identified in the fibropapilloma of each positive turtle, suggesting the rapid evolution of this virus. STTV1 variants were identical over the majority of their genomes but contained a hypervariable region with wide divergence. This work demonstrates the potential of viral metagenomics to discover new viruses directly from animal tissue, which can improve our understanding of viral evolution and diversity.

1499,New anellovirus discovered from death of captive California sea lions,"viral metagenomic study was conducted to investigate potential viral pathogens associated with a death event of three arrested California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). This study identified a novel California sea lion anellovirus (ZcAV) with 35% amino acid identity to feline anelloviruses in the ORF1 region. The double-stranded replicative form of ZcAV was detected in lung tissue, suggesting that ZcAV replicates in sea lion lungs. Specific PCR revealed the presence of ZcAV in the lung tissue of all three sea lions involved in the demise, but not in three other sea lions from the same zoo. In addition, low frequency (11%) ZcAV was detected in the lungs of wild sea lions. The higher prevalence of ZcAV and the presence of the double-stranded replicative form in the lungs of sea lions from the death event suggest that ZcAV is associated with the death of these animals.",,"Ng, T.

1500,"Development and evaluation of non-ribosomal random PCR and next-generation sequencing-based assay for detection and sequencing of hand, foot, and mouth disease pathogens.","BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has become a major public health problem in the Asia-Pacific region and is commonly associated with enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6), CV-A10 and CV-A16. Generating pathogen whole genome sequences is essential to understanding their evolutionary biology. Frequent exchanges between EV serotypes and the limited number of available whole-genome sequences hinder the development of overlapping PCRs for whole-genome sequencing. We have developed and evaluated a non-ribosomal random PCR (rPCR) and next-generation sequencing-based assay for sequence-independent whole-genome amplification and sequencing of HFMD pathogens. A total of 16 EV-A71/CV-A6/CV-A10/CV-A16 PCR positive rectal/throat swab (Cp values: 20.9-33.3) were used for test evaluation. RESULTS: Our test clearly outperformed conventional rPCR in terms of total EV-A71 reads and EV-A71 read percentage: 2.6% (1275/50,000 reads) vs. 0.1% (31/50,000) and 6% (3008/50,000 for two samples with Cp values of 30 and 26, respectively) and 0.9% (433/50,000). In addition, the assay can generate genome sequences with coverage percentages of 94-100% of the 4 different enterovirus serotypes in 73% of the tested samples, representing the first complete genome sequences of CV-A6/10/16 from Vietnam. Assign correct serotyping results in 100% of 24 samples. The consensus of two replicates of the same sample in all but three was 100% identical, indicating that our test was highly reproducible.

1502,Identification and genomic characterization of a novel porcine parvovirus (PPV6) in China,"Background: Parvoviruses are divided into two subfamilies based on host range: Parvovirinae, which infects vertebrates, and Densovirinae, which mainly infects insects and other arthropods. In recent years, a number of new parvoviruses belonging to the Parvovirinae subfamily have been identified from various animal species and humans, including human parvovirus 4 (PARV4), porcine hocovirus, ovine partetravirus, porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), and porcine parvovirus 5. PPV5). Methods: Using sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA), a novel parvovirus was identified within the Parvovirinae subfamily that differed from any known parvovirus, and five full-length genome sequences were identified and analyzed. Conclusions: A new porcine parvovirus, tentatively designated PPV6, was originally identified from aborted porcine fetuses in China. Retrospective studies revealed a higher prevalence of PPV6 in aborted pig fetuses and piglets (50% and 75%, respectively) than in dressage pigs and sows (15.6% and 3.8%, respectively). Also, the prevalence of PPV6 in the finishing pig was similar in affected and unaffected farms (ie 13.6% vs 21.7% versus 16.7%). This finding indicates that animal age strongly influences the level of PPV6 viremia, possibly due to increased innate immune resistance. Whole genome sequencing and multiple alignments showed that nearly full-length genome sequences were approximately 6,100 nucleotides long and shared 20.5%–42.6% DNA sequence identity with other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PPV6 differed significantly from other known parvoviruses and was most closely related to PPV4. Conclusion: Our findings and review of published parvovirus sequences suggested that a novel porcine parvovirus is currently circulating in China and could be classified within the novel Copiparvovirus genus within the Parvovirinae subfamily. However, clinical manifestations of PPV6 are still unknown, as the prevalence of PPV6 was similar between healthy pigs and sick pigs in a retrospective epidemiological study. Identification of PPV6 within the Parvovirinae subfamily provides further insight into the viral and genetic diversity of parvoviruses.",,"Ni, J.;Qiao, C.;Han, X.;Han, T.;Kang, W.;Zi, Z.;Cao, Z.;Zhai, X.;Cai, X.",2014.0,,10.1186/s12985-014-0203-2,0

The genome (7.2kb) contains three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding non-structural (ORF1) and structural proteins (ORF2 & ORF3). HEV infection has been associated with developing countries as the major cause of epidemic acute hepatitis transmitted by the fecal-oral route. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis have been reported in Western countries without a history of travel to endemic areas. Phylogenetic analysis of diverse geographic HEV identified four major genotypes: genotype I, which collected Asian (I1) and African (I2) isolates, genotype II found in Mexico and Nigeria, genotype III discovered among US humans and US pigs, and genotype IV in Taiwan. . Additional genotypes have been identified in non-HEV endemic regions (Greece, Italy, Argentina). HEV isolation in pets supports the environmental reservoir of HEV.

SVDV is the causative agent of a highly contagious (though rarely fatal) vesicular disease in pigs. We report a rapid method suitable for sequencing the complete protein-coding sequences of SVDV isolates in which RNA is relatively intact. The approach combines a single PCR amplification reaction using only a single set of PCR primers to amplify the nearly complete SVDV genome with deep sequencing using a small fraction of the capacity of the Roche GS FLX sequencing platform. Sequences were initially validated via one of two criteria; either a match between a de novo assembly and a reference match, or a match between all five different reference matches against a fixed set of initial reference genomes with significant genetic distances within the same virus species. All reference mappings used an iterative method to avoid bias. Further validation was provided by phylogenetic analysis against published SVDV genomes and additional Enterovirus B sequences. This approach gives high confidence in the resulting consensus sequences, while providing sufficiently high and evenly distributed sequence coverage to allow future studies of intra-host variation.

1508,"Whole genome sequences of Japanese porcine type C rotaviruses reveal a high diversity of genotypes of individual genes and contribute to a comprehensive, generally accepted classification system.","Porcine rotavirus C (RVC) is distributed worldwide and is thought to be a pathogenic agent of diarrhea in piglets. Although the VP7, VP4 and VP6 gene sequences of Japanese porcine RVCs are currently available, complete genome sequence data of Japanese RVC are not available. Moreover, only one to three sequences are available for the porcine RVC VP1-VP3 and NSP1-NSP3 genes. Therefore, we identified nearly full-length full-genome sequences of nine Japanese pig RVCs from seven piglets with diarrhea and two healthy pigs and compared them with published RVC sequences from a database. The VP7 genes of two Japanese RVCs from healthy pigs were quite different from other known RVC strains and were tentatively classified as G12 and G13 based on the 86% nucleotide identity cut-off value. Binary sequence identity calculations and phylogenetic analyzes revealed that candidate novel genotypes of porcine Japanese RVC were identified in genes encoding NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3, respectively. Furthermore, VP3 of Japanese porcine RVCs was shown to be closely related to human RVCs, suggesting a gene reclassification event and past interspecies transmission between porcine and human RVCs.

1509,Different RNA splicing mechanisms contribute to various infective outcomes of classical swine fever viruses of different virulence: Information from deep sequencing data in porcine umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"The molecular mechanisms underlying RNA splicing regulation in response to viral infection are poorly understood. Classic swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by the classic swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain digital gene expression (DGE) profiling in pig umbilical vessel endothelial cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV using both Shimen and C strains. The number of clean tags from the control libraries and both CSFV-infected libraries was 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493, respectively. In comparison between the control, CSFV-C and CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158 and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis shows that most of these DEGs are involved in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signaling pathway, etc. showed enrichment in terms of here the processes differ between different virulence CSFV strains. To further elucidate the important mechanisms involved in differential infection by CSFV Shimen and Cstrains, we identified four possible profiles to evaluate only genes significantly expressed by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and Cstrains disrupted the ""RNA splicing"" of SUVEC, resulting in differential ""gene expression"" in SUVEC. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as an important response regulator for CSFV Shimen, contributing to the effect on SUVEC function. This computational study suggests that differentially virulence CSFV may induce changes in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to alter cell metabolism, resulting in acute bleeding and pathological damage or infectious tolerance.",,"Ning, P.;Zhou, Y.;Liang, W.;Zhang, Y.",2016.0,,10.7717/peerj.2113,0

To explore the extent of genomic variability of TTMDV genomes, full-length sequences were determined for 15 TTMDV isolates from viremic individuals in Japan. The 15 TTMDV isolates consisted of 3175-3230 bases and shared 67.0-90.3% identity with each other and only 68.4-73.0% identity with the 3 TTMDV isolates reported on the whole genome. TTMDV had a genomic organization similar to TTV and TTMV with four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) with characteristic sequence motifs and stem and loop structures with high GC content. The total of 18 TTMDV genomes differed from each other by up to 60.7% in the amino acid sequence of ORF1 (658-677 amino acids), but were phylogenetically divided into the same cluster distantly related to TTVs and TTMVs.

Use for biological characterization and strain comparisons,"We isolated nine hybridomas expressing monoclonal antibodies directed against the HN glycoprotein of strain D26 of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and divided them into three groups according to their biological reactivity. Group I antibodies from the six clones had high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization titers and exhibited neuraminidase inhibition (NI) activity with both bovine fetuin and N-acetyl neuraminlactose substrates, although maximal inhibition levels were higher with the former substrate. . Group II antibodies from the two clones also had high HI activity, but showed a strongly substrate-dependent NI with a lack of effective inhibition against fetuin and total inhibition against neuraminlactose. These antibodies had neutralizing capacity, but the titers were much lower than those of group I antibodies. One clone (group III) secreted antibodies with both substrates that displayed HI and NI but had no detectable neutralizing activity. The frequency of isolation of antigenic variants and competitive binding experiments showed that group I and group II antibodies could recognize different non-overlapping regions, whereas antibodies inserted into each of the two groups belonged to the same overlapping regions of interest. The group III region seemed to be close to or overlapping the group I determinant, but differed from the group II region. We compared seven heterologous strains with HI and neutralization tests, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using isolated monoclonal antibodies.

This genus also includes the HoBi-like virus tentatively classified as BVDV type 3. BVDV-1 is widely distributed in Italy despite the widespread use of BVDV-1-based vaccines, while Pestivirus like BVDV-2 and HoBi have been detected occasionally. . Monitoring the occurrence of sporadic or atypical pestiviruses is a useful approach to assess the need for additional vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control programs. Results: In this study, we developed a multi-well antibody ELISA based on the recombinant E2 protein of three bovine pestiviruses. We evaluated the applicability of the test for surveillance purposes using pooled milk samples, each prepared from up to 35 lactating cows and collected from 176 dairy herds. As expected, most of the pooled samples reacted to a greater extent against the BVDV-1 E2 antigen. However, all three milk pools on a single farm responded to the BVDV-2 antigen. Further analyzes using spot tests, antigen detection and sequence analysis of the 5'-UTR region confirmed the presence of five permanently infected calves carrying a BVDV-2a strain. Conclusions: This study highlights for the first time that sporadic circulation of BVDV-2 can be predicted by immunoenzymatic methods in the absence of specific vaccination.",,"Nogarol, C.;Decaro, N.;Bertolotti, L.;Colitti, B.;Iotti, B.;Petrini, S.;Lucente, M.

1521,Differential expression of swine microRNAs in pigs infected with African swine fever virus: a proof-of-concept study.,"Background: African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating re-emerging viral disease that is currently threatening the swine industry worldwide. MicroRNAs are a class of 17-25 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that have been shown to have critical functions in a wide variety of biological processes such as cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, immune regulation and viral diseases. Infections by cleavage or translational repression of mRNAs. However, there is no information on miRNA expression in an ASFV infection. Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, we analyzed miRNAs expressed in the spleen and submandibular lymph node of experimentally infected pigs with a virulent (E75) or its derived attenuated (E75CV1) ASFV strain, as well as at different times postoperatively. - infection with the virulent strain through high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries. Results: The spleen presented a different expression pattern than lymph nodes in an ASFV infection. 12 of the most abundant miRNAs were differentially expressed in both tissues at two different times in animals infected with the virulent strain. Of these, miR-451, miR-145-5p, miR-181a and miR-122 showed upregulation late after infection, while miR-92a, miR-23a, miR-92b-3p, miR-126-5p, miR-126- 3p, miR-30d, miR-23b and miR-92c showed downregulation. The attenuated strain presented miR-126-5p, miR-92c, miR-92a, miR-30e-5p and miR-500a-5p upregulation, while miR-125b, miR-451 and miR-125a were downregulated. All these miRNAs have been shown to be associated with various viral genes as well as cellular genes involved in pathways related to the immune response, virus-host interactions.

1522,Identification of microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing in PCV2 subclinically infected pigs.,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the main etiological infectious agent of PCV2-systemic disease and has been associated with other swine diseases, all collectively known as porcine circovirus diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of non-coding small RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. miRNAs play an increasing role in many biological processes. The study of miRNA-mediated host-pathogen interactions has emerged in the last decade because of the important role miRNAs play in antiviral defense. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA expression pattern in PCV2 in subclinically infected and uninfected pigs. For this purpose, an experimental PCV2 infection was performed and small RNA libraries were constructed from tonsil and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) of infected and uninfected pigs. High-throughput sequencing identified differences in miRNA expression between infected and non-infected in the MLN, while a highly conserved pattern was observed in the tonsil. In the MLN, miRNA 126-3p, miRNA 126-5p, let-7d-3p, mir-129a, and mir-let-7b-3p are up-regulated, while mir-193a-5p, mir-574-5p, and mir-34a are down-regulated. . The prediction of functional analysis indicated that these miRNAs may be involved in immune system-related pathways and processes related to the pathogenesis of PCV2, but functional analyzes are needed to support these predictions. This is the first study on miRNA gene expression in PCV2-infected pigs using a high-throughput sequencing approach in which several host miRNAs are differentially expressed in response to PCV2 infection.",,"NÃºÃ±ez-HernÃ¡ndez, F.;PÃ©rez, L.

1523,African swine fever virus does not express viral microRNAs in experimentally infected pigs,"Background: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiologic agent of African swine fever (ASF), a devastating re-expanding and highly fatal hemorrhagic viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of non-coding small RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. The discovery of virus-specific miRNAs has increased in both number and importance over the past few years. We recently identified differential expression of several porcine miRNAs during in vivo infection with attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here we extend these studies attempting to identify the presence of viral miRNAs encoded by ASFV in an in vivo infection in pigs. Results: Sixteen small RNA libraries were analyzed from spleen and submandibular lymph nodes obtained from eight pigs infected with seven virulent E75 ASFV strains or its attenuated counterpart E75CV1 or pigs that survived E75CV1 infection and challenged with BA71 (heterologous challenge) and infected as negative controls. one who is not. Samples were taken at different times after infection. Libraries were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Some viral miRNA candidates were identified that did not initially correspond to porcine miRNAs. Further structural analysis was performed to confirm whether they met the conformational requirements to be considered a viral miRNA. Results: Analysis of sixteen small RNA libraries prepared from two different tissues from pigs experimentally infected with E75, E75CV1 or E75CV1 plus BA71 revealed the presence of six potential miRNA sequences, but none of them met the requirements to be considered viral miRNAs. .

1526,"Metagenomic identification and sequence analysis of a virus related to Teschovirus A in pig feces in Japan, 2014-2016","Porcine Teschoviruses (PTVs) are associated with various diseases of pigs and wild boars, including polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders, and are also detected in the feces of healthy pigs. The genus Teschovirus contains a single strain of Teschovirus A, which currently includes 13 serotypes. In this study, we identified novel PTVs distantly related to Teschovirus A found in stool samples of pigs with or without diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid (aa) sequences of the complete coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses did not cluster with any PTV strains or other strains within the picornavirus supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not belong to Teschovirus A or any genus. It is from the Picornaviridae family. These new PTVs share a type IV internal ribosomal entry site and show conserved characteristic motifs in the coding region, but still 62.2%-79.0%, 86.6%-92.8%, 77.1%-81.0%, and 84.3% -86.7% exhibits. aa identities to PTV strains in regions P1, 2C, 3C and 3D, respectively.

1530,Molecular evolution of human enteroviruses: serotype correlation with VP1 sequence and application to picornavirus classification,"Sixty-six human enterovirus serotypes have been identified by serum neutralization, but the molecular determinants of the serotypes are unknown. Since the picornavirus VP1 protein contains a set of neutralization domains, we hypothesized that the VP1 sequence should correspond to neutralization (serotype) and thus phylogenetic origin. To test this hypothesis and analyze phylogenetic relationships among human enteroviruses, we determined the complete VP1 sequences of prototype strains of 47 human enterovirus serotypes and 10 antigenic variants. Our sequences include a database of complete VP1 sequences for all 66 human enterovirus serotypes, along with those available from GenBank, as well as additional strains of seven serotypes. Phylogenetic trees constructed from complete VP1 sequences produced the same four major clusters as published trees based on partial VP2 sequences; Unlike VP2 trees, but in VP1 trees, strains of the same serotype were always monophyletic. In pairwise comparisons of whole VP1 sequences, enteroviruses of the same serotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous serotypes, and the margins of intraserotypic divergence appeared to be approximately 25% nucleotide sequence difference or 12% amino acid sequence difference. Pairwise comparisons suggested that coxsackie A11 and A15 viruses should be classified as strains of the same serotype as coxsackie A13 and A18 viruses. Dual identity scores also distinguished between enteroviruses from different clusters and enteroviruses from picornaviruses of different genera. The data suggest that VP1 sequence comparisons may be valuable in enterovirus typing and picornavirus taxonomy as an aid to genus assignment of unclassified picornaviruses.",,"Oberste, M.

1531,Genomic evidence that simian virus 2 and six other simian picornaviruses represent a new genus in Picornaviridae,"Analysis of the VP1 capsid protein coding region of Simian virus (SV) 2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, and SV49 shows that they are clearly different from members of the Enterovirus genus and other extant picornaviruses. To further characterize this group of viruses and clarify their classification within the Picornaviridae, we determined the complete genomic sequence of SV2 (8126 nucleotides). The genome was typical for Picornaviridae members encoding a single open reading frame. The putative polyprotein contained typical picornavirus protease cleavage sites that yield mature proteins homologous to each of the known picornavirus proteins. SV2 contained an amino-terminal extension of the reading frame, similar to the leader protein of members of the genera Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, and Teschovirus, but lacked significant amino acid homology with any of these known leader proteins. . The 2A protein is also poorly aligned with the 2A proteins of other picornaviruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of the SV2 structural and nonstructural proteins were related to those of enteroviruses and human rhinoviruses but were phylogenetically different. The main distinguishing features of SV2 were the presence of a type 2 internal ribosome entry site in the 5-NTR, a putative leader protein encoded upstream of structural proteins, and an unusually large 2A protein. On the basis of molecular analysis, we propose that SV2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, SV49 and porcine enterovirus 8 be classified as members of a new genus in Picornaviridae and designated as SV2 (strain 2383). kind of stretch.

Symptoms, including characteristics of passion fruit woody disease (PWD), were observed in 32% of the plants in the production areas. Electron microscopic observations of infected tissues, ca. 780nm. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent experiments demonstrated serological association with Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) and Passion fruit ringspot virus (PFRSV). In host range studies, only species in the families Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae were susceptible, and neither Vigna unguiculata nor Phaseolus vulgaris were infected. The coat protein (CP) gene sequences of the eight isolates exhibited potyvirus-specific features and were highly similar (88% to 100% identity). However, the sequences had sequence identity limited to the CP genes of two of the three potyviruses reported to cause PWD: East Asian Passiflora virus and Passion fruit woodland virus (PWV). Amino acid sequences inferred for CP of isolates from Uganda range from Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) (72 to 79%, evolutionary divergence values 0.17 and 0.19) and CABMV (73 to 76%, with divergence values between 73% and 76%). 76) had the highest identity. 0.21 and 0.25).

Upon genetic analysis, the CP BVDV isolate of Outbreak #1 clustered closely to BVDV Oregon (Genotype 1). BVDV isolates from generalized dermatitis outbreaks (Outbreaks #4 and #5) were located close to BVDV Osloss within Genotype 1. Identification of BVDV by immunohistochemistry in exudative dermatitis indicates epithelial cell tropism of the virus. Phylogenetic characterization of BVDV from Outbreaks #2 and #3, positioning them as BVDV-2. The 5â€²UTR sequence of these viruses showed 88% and 90% homology to BVDV-890 (Genotype 2) and 77% and 75% homology to BVDV-SD1 (Genotype 1), respectively. The association of BVDV-2 with severe disease indicates the presence of highly virulent strains. Data from natural outbreaks in which BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were isolated revealed overlap of pathology and clearly did not allow for discrimination between genotypes based on gross or microscopic lesions. Therefore, further virology and molecular studies are needed for definitive diagnosis.

1537,African Swine Fever Virus Georgia 2007 Deletion of Virulence-Associated Gene 9GL (B119L) Causes Virus Attenuation in Pigs When Administered at Low Doses and Provides Effective Protection Against Homologous Challenge,"UNLABELED: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiologic agent of an often fatal disease of domestic pigs. The absence of vaccines against ASFV has hampered disease control strategies. A highly virulent virus, ASFV Georgia 2007 (ASFV-G), has caused an epidemic that has spread rapidly to Eastern European countries since its introduction in the Republic of Georgia. No vaccine is currently available or developed to control ASFV-G. In the past, genetically modified ASFVs harboring deletion of virulence-related genes have been proven to be attenuated in pigs and induce protective immunity against challenge with homologous parental viruses. Deletion of the 9GL gene (open reading frame [ORF] B119L) in the highly virulent ASFV Malawi-Lil-20/1 produced an attenuated phenotype even when administered to pigs at 10%(6) 50% hemadsorption doses (HAD50). Here we report the construct of a genetically modified ASFV-G strain (ASFV-G-DELTA9GLv) harboring the 9GL (B119L) gene deletion. Like Malawi-Lil-20/1-DELTA9GL, ASFV-G-DELTA9GL showed limited replication in primary porcine macrophages. However, intramuscular vaccination of pigs with 10(4) HAD50 ASFV-G-DELTA9GL produced a lethal phenotype, unlike Malawi-Lil-20/1-DELTA9GL, that caused a fatal disease in pigs, such as parent ASFV-G. Interestingly, lower doses (10(2) to 10(3) HAD50 of ASFV-G-DELTA9GL did not induce a virulent phenotype when challenged for disease in pigs and guarded pigs. A 10(2) HAD50 dose of ASFV-G-DELTA9GLv provided partial protection when pigs were challenged at 21 or 28 days (dpi) after infection. A 10(3) ASFV-G-DELTA9GL HAD50 provided partial and full protection at 21 and 28 dpi, respectively. The information provided here adds to our final report on first attempts at experimental vaccines against ASFV-G. IMPORTANCE: The main problem with controlling ASF is the lack of vaccines. Studies of ASFV virulence lead to the production of genetically modified attenuated viruses that protect in pigs but only against homologous virus threats. Here, in an attempt to produce a vaccine against the virulent ASFV-G, a highly virulent virus isolate that was detected in the Caucasus region in 2007 and is now spreading in the Caucasus region and Eastern Europe, we generated a recombinant ASFV lacking the virulence-associated gene 9GL. Deletion of 9GL did not completely reduce ASFV-G, unlike other ASFV isolates. However, once given at low doses, recombinant ASFV-G-DELTA9GL provides protection against parental ASFV-G in pigs. Protection against ASFV-G was highly effective at 28 days post-vaccination, whereas at 21 days post-vaccination the animals survived the fatal challenge but showed signs of ASF. Here we report the design and development of an experimental vaccine that protects against virulent ASFV-G.",,"O'Donnell, V.;Holinka, L. G.;Krug, P. W.;Gladue, D.

Three of 45 Korean domestic cattle aged 20-24 months were affected. Parapoxviruses were detected and identified by electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To determine the genetic characteristics of Korean strains, the sequence of the major envelope protein (B2L) was determined and compared with published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that parapoxvirus strains were closely related not only with isolates from Japan, but also with isolates from Germany, Sudan, and the United States.

1543,Foot and mouth disease in Asian black bears (Ursus thibetanus),"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, debilitating, and globally important viral disease that typically affects equidae-hoofed hosts. Diagnosis of FMD in bears in Vietnam is described. The present study describes a confirmed case of FMD in a bear species and clinical signs consistent with FMD in a Malayan sun bear. Thirteen Asian black bears (Ursus thibetanus) and 1 Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) were apparently affected. In August 2011, an adult bear became lethargic and developed foot vesicles. For 15 days, 14 out of 17 bears had similar symptoms; There were no remaining 3 common bears and 57 resident bears. All affected bears developed vesicles on all soles of their feet, and most were lethargic for 24-48 hours. Nasal and oral lesions were recorded in 6 and 3 cases, respectively. Within 1 month everything seemed normal. Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, classified as serotype O, and isolated by virus isolation techniques. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 3 bear isolates clustered in a different branch from other FMDV type O isolates. The outbreak most likely occurred due to indirect contact with livestock and was facilitated by the high density of captive bears. It showed that Asian black bears are capable of contracting FMDV and developing clinical disease, and the virus spreads easily among bears in close contact.",,"Officer, K.;Lan, N.

1544,Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS) particularly abundant in the marine environment,"MutS proteins are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and have important roles in DNA mismatch repair or recombination. In the virus world, the amoeba-infected Mimivirus, as well as the recently sequenced Cafeteria roenbergensis virus, are known to encode a MutS related to homologues found in octochorae and epsilon-proteobacteria. To investigate the presence of MutS proteins in other viral genomes, we performed a genomic search of four giant viruses ('giruses') (Pyramimonas orientalis virus (PoV), Phaeocystis bag etii virus (PpV), Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV) and Heterocapsa circularisquama). Our analysis of single-celled seaweed-infecting DNA virus (HcDNAV) revealed the presence of a close homologue of Mimivirus MutS in all analyzed gyri. These viral homologues have a specific domain structure, including a C-terminal HNH-endonuclease domain that defines the novel MutS7 subfamily. We confirmed the presence of conserved mismatch recognition residues in all members of the MutS7 subfamily, suggesting their role in DNA mismatch repair rather than DNA recombination. PoV and PpV were found to contain an additional type of MutS, which we propose to call MutS8. MutS8 proteins in PoV and PpV were found to be closely related to homologues from Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus, an obligate intracellular amoeba symbiont of Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that MutS7 and MutS8 are abundant in marine microbial metagenomes, and the vast majority of these environmental sequences likely originate from the gyrus. The gyri therefore appear to represent an important source of underexplored diversity of the MutS family in the microbial world.

1545,Remarkable sequence similarity between dinoflagellate-infected marine gyrus and the terrestrial pathogen African swine fever virus,"Heterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus (HcDNAV; previously named HcV) is a giant virus (gyrus) with a âˆ¼356-kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. HcDNAV lytically infects the bivalve-killing marine dinoflagellate H. circularisquama and represents the only DNA virus currently isolated from dinoflagellates, one of the most abundant protists in marine ecosystems. Its morphological features, genome type, and host range have previously suggested that HcDNAV may be a member of the Phycodnaviridae family of Nucleo-Sytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs), but no supporting sequence data are available. NCLDVs include two families currently found in aquatic environments (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae), one mostly infecting terrestrial animals (Poxviridae), the other isolated from fish, amphibians and insects (Iridoviridae) and the last (Asfarviridae) African only represented by the animal pathogen . swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs. In this study, we determined the full sequence of the B-type DNA polymerase (PolB) gene of HcDNAV. Viral PolB was transcribed at least 6 hours after inoculation (hpi), revealing its crucial function for viral replication. Most unexpectedly, the PolB sequence of HcDNAV was found to be closely related to the PolB sequence of ASFV. In addition, the amino acid sequence of HcDNAV PolB showed a rare amino acid substitution within a highly conserved motif-containing motif: YSDTDS was found in HcDNAV PolB instead of YGDTDS in most dsDNA viruses. Together with the previous observation of ASFV-like sequences in the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic datasets, our results further strengthen the idea that terrestrial ASFV has evolutionary origin in marine environments.

1546,Complete genome and phylogenetic position of bovine papillomavirus type 7,"Six bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types and 16 possible BPV types have been previously reported. Here, the whole genome sequence of BAPV6, a novel putative type of BPV isolated from cattle in Japan, was determined using multi-primed rolling circle amplification. The genome consisted of 7412 bp (46 mol G+C content) encoding five early (E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7) and two late (L1 and L2) genes but not the E5 gene. The E6 protein contained a non-consensus CxxC(x)33CxxC and a consensus CxxC(x)29CxxC zinc-binding domain, and the E7 protein lacked the LxCxE motif. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) was most closely related (57-58%) to the L1 ORF of the member(s) of the Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus and Pipapillomavirus genera. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full L1 ORF suggests that BAPV6 should be classified as BPV-7 within a new genus in the Papillomaviridae family. © 2007 SGM.",,"Ogawa, T.;Tomita, Y.;Okada, M.;Shirasawa, H.",2007.0,,10.1099/vir.0.82794-0,0

1549,Isolation of maedi/visna virus from a sheep in Japan,"Maedi/visna (MV) is a sheep lentiviral disease caused by the maedi/visna virus (MVV). Although MV is common in many countries, it has not been reported in Japan. In 2011, however, three sheep in northern Japan were reported to be seropositive to the MVV antigen, indicating a persistent MVV infection. In this study, we isolated MVV from a sheep and performed genomic classification of the virus to confirm MVV infection. Co-culture of fetal goat lung cells and leukocytes from a seropositive sheep resulted in the formation of syncytial cells and amplification of a long terminal repeat MVV sequence by polymerase chain reaction. The isolate was confirmed to be MVV rather than goat arthritis-encephalitis virus based on phylogenetic analysis of the gag gene sequence. Although the sheep were asymptomatic, non-purulent meningitis and demyelination were found in the spinal cord. These were considered as early lesions associated with pathogenic MVV infection. Therefore, this study demonstrated that MVV is distributed in Japan.

1550,Evidence of an antigenic shift among Palyam serogroup orbiviruses,"Japanese isolates of Palyam serogroup viruses isolated from 1985 to 2001 were searched for genome sequence of segments 2 and 7 and analyzed phylogenetically in comparison with Australian and African isolates of the same serogroup. The nucleotide sequences of segment 7 were highly conserved in Japanese isolates (95.1 to 100%) and between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates (96.0 to 100%), while identities between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates and Australian and African isolates were highly conserved ( 84.2 to 100%) 92.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 7 revealed three clusters by geographic origin. As a result of nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 2 encoding a serotype-specific antigen, Japanese isolates were divided into two groups according to genome length and nucleotide identity. Of the nine Japanese isolates, four were categorized in the same group as the prototype strain K-47 of Chuzan virus, and the remaining isolates were categorized in the same group as D'Aguilar virus and Nyabira virus. Segment 2-based phylogenetic analysis revealed two clusters, the cluster containing the Chuzan virus and the cluster containing the D'Aguilar and Nyabira viruses. We performed a cross-neutralization test to examine the antigenic relationship between viruses classified in different clusters. KSB-29/E/01, isolated in Japan in 2001, was neutralized with antiserum not only for the B8112 strain of D'Aguilar virus, but also for Chuzan virus. These results indicated that the genetically and antigenically unique features of KSB-29/E/01 were attributed to the genetic reclassification of segment 2 between Chuzan virus and D'Aguilar virus.",,"Ohashi, S.;Matsumori, Y.;Yanase, T.;Yamakawa, M.;Kato, T.;Tsuda, T.",2004.0,Oct,,0
1551,Sequence analysis of an Asian canine tooth virus (canine parvovirus type 1),"Minute Canines Virus (MVC), also known as Canine parvovirus (CPV) type 1, is an autonomous parvovirus that infects domestic dogs worldwide and is responsible for clinical problems of newborns and pregnant bitches. It has been previously described that MVC is antigenic and genetically different from the later emerging CPV type 2. However, much of MVC is still unclear as only a limited number of MVC isolates are available for study. MVC infections of Japanese and Korean dogs have been epidemiologically investigated in the previous study and several MVC isolates could be grown in vitro. In this study, an almost full-length nucleotide sequence of the genome of a Korean MVC strain HM-6 was obtained and analyzed in comparison with that of the recently characterized American MVC strain GA3. The genome structure of the HM-6 strain was similar to the GA3 strain, with 96.4% identity in the nucleotide sequence. The deduced amino acid sequences of NS1, NP-1 and VP1/2 each showed 96.5%, 92.5% and 97.5% homology between HM-6 and GA3 strains. Compared with other parvovirus strains, strain HM-6 was most closely related to bovine parvovirus (BPV) as described for strain GA3. These results suggest that MVC may be classified together with BPV in a new clade, possibly in the Parvovirinae subfamily.

1553,Genetic characterization and classification of human and animal sapoviruses,"Sapoviruses (SaVs) are enteric caliciviruses that have been detected in many mammalian species, including humans, pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions, chimpanzees, and rats. They show a high level of diversity. A SaV genome usually encodes seven nonstructural proteins (NSs), including the RNA polymerase protein NS7 and two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2). We classified human and animal SaVs into 15 genogroups (G) based on available VP1 sequences, including three newly characterized genomes from this study. We sequenced the full-length genomes of one novel genogroup V (GV), one GVII, and one GVIII porcine SaV using long-range RT-PCR including newly designed forward primers located in conserved motifs of putative NS3, as well as 5"" RACE methods. We also identified the 5""² and 3"" ends of lion GV SaV and canine GXIII SaV.

1554,Bovine rotavirus G and P types and sequence analysis of the VP7 gene of two G8 bovine rotaviruses from JPN,"total of 1481 stool samples were collected from calves under 1 month old with diarrhea from 29 dairy and fattening farms in 11 provinces in Japan during the 1987-2000 period. These calves and their mothers have not been vaccinated against rotavirus. One hundred and forty-two bovine rotaviruses were isolated in MA-104 cell cultures and detected by latex agglutination test. 18 G6P[1] (11.2%), 53 G6P[5] (37.3%), 15 G6P[11] (10.6%), 12 G10P[5] (8.5%), 42 G10P [11] (29.6%) and 1 G8P[11] (0.7%) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A serotype G8 virus could not be typed for the P genotype, suggesting a new strain of bovine origin. The least common G8 serotype viruses were isolated from farm samples from Niigata and Tokushima prefectures. The VP7 gene sequences of the two isolates showed a high degree of homology with the previously reported G8 viruses, with 93.3-98.8% identity of deduced amino acids. A phylogenetic analysis of the two G8 viruses and the VP7 gene of the 13 previously reported G8 viruses by the neighbor splicing method showed that the two newly isolated G8 rotaviruses had a common origin and were assigned to a new distinct cluster.

RVAs were detected by reverse transcription (RT) semisted PCR in 10 of 44 sugar gliders. These viruses were classified as G27P[3] and G27P[36] genotypes, and G27 and P[36] were the new genotypes assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. To characterize the sugar glider RVA in detail, a strain, RVA/SugarGlider-tc/JPN/SG385/2012/G27P[36] (SG385-tc), was isolated. All genes belonging to the strain were classified as new genotypes (G27-P[36]-I19-R10-C10-M9-A20-N11-T13-E17-H12). The enterotoxin domain in NSP4, which is important for induction of diarrhea, was conserved between SG385-tc and previously reported mammalian strains, suggesting the potential of the sugar glider RVA to cause diarrhea in mammalian species. In fact, seven of nine suckling mice orally inoculated with 3.9 x 10(4) ffu of the SG385-tc strain had diarrhea, and the 50% diarrhea-inducing dose (DD50) of SG385-tc strain in suckling mice was 1.2 x 10(4) ffu. shows that glider RVA is infective and possibly pathogenic for other mammalian species.",,"Okadera, K.;Abe, M.;Ito, N.;Mitake, H.;Okada, K.;Nakagawa, K.;Une, Y.;Tsunemitsu, H.;Sugiyama, M.",2016.0,May,,0

Of the 4,550 samples collected, 226 influenza A virus isolates were obtained from domestic ducks, musk duck and chickens. Of these, 25 and 22 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) were isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in live bird markets and slaughter areas in northern and southern Vietnam, respectively.

1558,Genetic variability and evolution of the hepatitis E virus,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the only member of the Hepevirus genus in the Hepeviridae family. HEV is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route, and waterborne outbreaks are characteristic of hepatitis E in many developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America where sanitation conditions are poor. Accumulating evidence indicates that HEV-associated hepatitis also occurs locally among individuals in industrialized countries, that there are animal reservoirs of HEV such as domestic pigs and wild boars, and that hepatitis E is a zoonosis. Based on the wide genomic variability among HEV isolates, HEV sequences have been classified into four genotypes: genotype 1 consists of epidemic strains in developing countries in Asia and Africa; genotype 2 has been identified in Mexico and several African countries; genotype 3 HEV is widely distributed in many countries of the world except African countries and has been isolated from sporadic acute cases of hepatitis E and/or domestic pigs; and genotype 4 includes strains isolated from humans and/or domestic pigs in Asian countries only.

HEV is transmitted mainly by the fecal-oral route, and waterborne outbreaks are characteristic of hepatitis E. Recently, there is a growing consensus that HEV-associated hepatitis also occurs among individuals in industrialized countries without a history of travel to endemic areas.

Methods: Seventeen patients with sporadic acute hepatitis E treated from 2004 to 2012 were studied. A total of 243 packages of raw pork liver from regional grocery stores were tested for the presence of HEV RNA. Partial genomic sequences of human and porcine HEV isolates were determined and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Results: HEV isolates and 15 genotype 3 isolates obtained from 17 patients separated as genotype 3 (n=15) and genotype 4 (n=2) were further divided into 3e (n=11) and 3b (n=4). Pig liver samples from 12 (4.9%) of 243 packages had detectable HEV RNA. All 12 porcine HEV isolates were grouped as genotype 3 (3a or 3b). Although no 3e strains were isolated from the porcine liver samples, the two 3b porcine strains were 99.5-100% identical to the two HEV strains from hepatitis patients in 412-nt partial sequences. Conclusion: 3e HEV was common in hepatitis E patients. HEV RNA was detected in approximately 5% of pig liver sold as food. The availability of identical HEV strains between hepatitis patients and pig liver suggested that pigs play an important role as reservoirs for HEV in humans in Mie.

1561,Application of antisense molecules to poultry production,"Antisense molecules, which are single-stranded nucleic acids complementary to a specific mRNA, target and bind to the mRNA, blocking and inhibiting translation of the mRNA encoding a specific protein. Recently, phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and protein nucleic acids have been used to avoid antisense molecules from nucleases, which were originally developed as nuclease resistant alternatives to phosphodiester oligomers. The delivery system for insensitive molecules is basically equivalent to the DNA delivery system. Traditionally, DNA delivery systems have been classified as viral vector-mediated systems and non-viral vector-mediated systems. As the importance of the current methodology can be attributed to the limitation of viral vector-mediated delivery, non-viral vector-mediated systems, particularly synthetic DNA delivery systems, have become increasingly desirable. The possibility of administering antisense protein nucleic acids against leptin MRNA to stimulate the appetite of poultry is discussed. Antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide against insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 mRNA successfully suppressed hepatic gene expression in chicken. Protein synthesis of chicken embryo myoblasts was decreased by administration of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide against myostatin mRNA, suggesting reduction in protein degradation by antisense administration.",,"Okumura, J.;Kita, K.",2001.0,Dec,,0
1562,Distribution of gene segments of the pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 virus strain in pig populations,"Swine flu viruses (SIVs) are important not only for swine farming but also for public health. In fact, pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses [A(H1N1)pdm09] are derived from SIVs. Thus, timely characterization of locally circulating SIVs is essential to understanding the global status of SIVs. To genetically characterize circulating SIVs in Japanese pig populations, we isolated 24 SIVs in three subtypes (17 H1N1, four H1N2 and three H3N2 strains) from 14 pig farms in Japan from 2013 to 2016. Genetic analyzes included genes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase 17 H1N1 (NA), and an H1N2, A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2), HA gene of SIVs, belonging to the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage. More importantly, all six remaining gene segments of 24 SIVs (i.e., PB1, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS), independent of HA and NA subtype, were also classified as belonging to A(H1N1)pdm09. strain. These results indicate that gene segments of the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage are widely distributed in SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations. The closest relative isolated in Japan in 2003 is that of A/swine/Miyagi/5/2003 (H1N2). These results demonstrate the sustained circulation of classical H1N2-derived SIVs with remarkable diversity in NA genes in Japanese pig populations.

1563,Molecular characterization of canine cobuvirus in wild carnivores and domestic dogs in Africa,"Knowledge of Kobuvirus (Family Picornaviridae) infection in carnivores is limited and has not been described in African domestic or wild carnivores. To fill this gap in knowledge, we used RT-PCR to screen fresh faeces from several African carnivores. We detected cobuvirus RNA in samples from the domestic dog, golden jackal, side-striped jackal, and spotted hyena. We obtained a complete Kobuvirus genome sequence from each of these strains using next-generation sequencing. Our phylogenetic analyzes revealed canine cobuvirus (CaKV) infection in all four species and placed CaKVs from Africa together and separately from CaKVs from elsewhere.

1564,Characterization of infectious laryngotracheitis virus isolates from the USA by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism of multiple genome regions,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute viral respiratory disease primarily seen in chickens. The economic losses attributable to ILT affect many poultry producing regions in the United States (US) and around the world. Despite efforts to control the disease through vaccination, prolonged ILT outbreaks remain a threat to the poultry industry. Previous epidemiological and molecular evidence has shown that outbreaks in the US are caused by vaccine-related strains. In this study, polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of four genome regions was used to characterize 25 isolates from commercial poultry and backyard flocks from the USA. Combinations of PCR-RFLP models classified ILT virus isolates into nine groups. Backyard swarm isolates were classified into three separate groups. The ILT virus US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reference strain and the tissue culture origin (TCO) vaccine strain were divided into two separate groups. Twenty-two isolates from commercial poultry were divided into four groups: one group of six isolates showed the same patterns as chicken embryo-derived (CEO) vaccines; a second group of nine isolates differed from CEO vaccines in only one model; a third group of two isolates differed from the TCO vaccine in only one model; A fourth group of five isolates differed from the CEO and TCO vaccines in six and nine models, respectively. The results from this study clearly showed that most of the commercial poultry isolates (17 out of 22 isolates) were closely related to the vaccine strains. However, different isolates from vaccine strains were also detected in commercial poultry. © 2007 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Oldoni, I.;GarcÃ­a, M.",2007.0,,10.1080/03079450701216654,0
1565,Epidemiological research in single-species herds from Poland reveals expanded genetic and antigenic diversity of small ruminant lentiviruses.,"Small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections are common in Poland and the circulation of subtypes A1, A12, A13, B1 and B2 has been identified. The current study aimed to extend the previous study based on the analysis of larger numbers of animals than single-species herds. Animals were selected for genetic analysis based on serological reactivity to a number of recombinant antigens derived from Gag and Env viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of B2 and A12 subtypes in both goats and sheep, and A1 and B1 subtypes in goats only. In addition, two new subtypes, A16 and A17, were found in goats. Co-infection with strains of different subtypes in groups A and B was detected in 1 sheep and 4 goats from four herds. Although the reactivity of serum samples to recombinant antigens confirmed the immunological relationship between Gag epitopes of different subtypes and the cross-reactive nature of Gag antibodies, eleven serum samples did not react with antigens representing all subtypes currently detected in Poland. limitations of serological diagnosis. These data demonstrated the complex nature of SRLV subtypes circulating in sheep and goats in Poland and the need to improve SRLV-related diagnostic capacity.",,"Olech, M.;Valas, S.;KuÅºmak, J.",2018.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0193892,0
1566,Porcine B-cells recognize conserved epitopes between structural proteins of American and European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,"By selecting phage display libraries with immune serum from experimentally infected pigs, porcine B-cell epitopes in the open reading frame (ORF) and 2, 3, 5 and 6 proteins of European type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were identified. The sequences of all epitopes were well conserved in European-type PRRSV and even between European-type and American-type PRRSV. Accordingly, sera from pigs infected with American-type PRRSV cross-reacted with European-type epitopes. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time the presence of highly conserved epitopes in the matrix protein and envelope glycoproteins of PRRSV. The ORF5 and 6 epitopes are localized to protein fragments that are predicted to be hidden in PRRSV virions. In contrast, the ORF2 and 3 epitopes were localized to putative protein ectodomains. Because of the interesting localization, the sequence surrounding the ORF2 and 3 epitopes was subjected to closer examination. ORF2 and the heptad motif VSRRIYQ, which is found in single copy in 3 proteins, were identified; this arrangement is fully conserved in all existing European type PRRSV sequences. Modeling of the VSRRIYQ repeat motif and secondary structure closely related to one of the ORF2 epitopes indicated that this segment of the ORF2 protein can form an amphipathic helix. Surprisingly, a mutation associated with virulence/attenuation of an American vaccine strain of PRRSV was also localized in this ORF2 protein segment and affected the hydrophobic facet of the predicted amphipathic helix. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings identify a functional domain in the PRRSV ORF2 protein.",,"Oleksiewicz, M. B.;BÃ¸tner, A.;Normann, P.",2002.0,,,0
1567,Determination of the complete open reading frame sequence and the 5–²NTR of the Paderborn isolate of classic swine fever virus,"The classic swine fever (CSF) epidemic in the Netherlands in 1997-1998 lasted 14 months, during which 429 infected and 1300 at-risk herds were culled, with an estimated economic cost of US$2 billion. Despite the overwhelming scale of epizootics, the CSFV strain causing the epidemic remains largely unidentified. Dutch epizootic is epidemiologically linked to a small CSF outbreak that occurred in Paderborn, Germany, in 1997. E2 and partial sequencing of 5–²NTR showed that the Paderborn isolate index and several Dutch isolates taken during the 1997-1998 epizootic were almost identical, confirming that the Paderborn isolate triggered the Dutch epidemic and also showed that this single isolate was stable. throughout the entire Dutch epidemic (reviewed above [C. Terpstra, AJ de Smit, Veterinary Microbiol. 77 (2000) 3-15]). We determined the nucleotide sequence of 5â€²NTR (by 5â€²RACE) and the fully open reading frame of the Paderborn isolate (GenBank AY072924). Our sequence was identical to the previously published partial sequences of 5–²NTR and E2 for the sequence Paderborn 1997 and Dutch 1997 (Venhorst) isolates, confirming the identity of the virus we sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full open reading frame showed that Paderborn was genetically very different from common European laboratory reference strains. Neutralization studies have shown that Paderborn is very different antigenically from common laboratory strains such as Alfort 187. Paderborn is the only novel European CSFV field isolate for which a complete sequence is available, and given the genetic and antigenic uniqueness of Paderborns, the Paderborn sequence may be practical.

Difficulties in establishing subtypes have been reported using the most common classification system. In addition, the relevance of subtype classification to epidemiology can be questioned. In this study, we performed phylogenetic analyzes based on the complete capsid gene and complete HEV genomic sequences to evaluate the current classification of HEV at the genotype and subtype levels. The results of our analyzes change the existing taxonomy of genotype 3 and improve the established system for typing HEV.

1570,"Virological and serological surveillance for human, swine, and avian influenza virus infections among pigs in the north-central United States","Influenza virus infection in pigs is both an animal health problem and a public health problem. Therefore, surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses in pigs is important to the veterinary community and should be part of human pandemic preparedness planning. Studies in 1976/1977 and 1988/1989 showed that pigs in the USA were commonly infected with classical swine H1N1 viruses, whereas human H3 and avian influenza virus infections were very rare. In contrast, human H3 and avian H1 viruses have been frequently isolated from pigs in Europe and Asia over the past two decades. From September 1997 to August 1998, we isolated 26 influenza viruses at cutoff point from pigs in the northern central United States. All 26 isolates were H1N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analyzes of hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes from 11 representative viruses indicated that they were classical porcine H1 viruses. However, monoclonal antibody analyzes revealed antigenic heterogeneity among the HA proteins of 26 viruses. Serologically, 27.7% of the 2,375 pigs tested had hemagglutination inhibitory antibodies to the classic swine H1 influenza virus. Of particular importance, however, is that seropositivity rates against avian H1 (7.6%) and human H3 (8.0%) viruses were significantly higher than in previous studies.",,"Olsen, C.

Genetic analyzes showed that this duck virus has the same human/classic pig/bird. Reassortant genotype as H1N2 viruses isolated from pigs and turkeys in the USA since 1999. Phylogenetic analyzes of each gene segment further confirmed that Dk/NC virus was closely related to pet H1N2 isolates. In particular, Dk/NC is most closely related to a porcine H1N2 virus also isolated from North Carolina. These two viruses and an additional phylogenetically defined subset of porcine H1N2 viruses share a common mutation in the Sb antigenic region on the hemagglutinin protein.

The pathogenesis of PPMV-1 infections in poultry is largely unclear. PPMV-1 is known to require a series of crossings in chickens before adapting to biliary poultry. Material and Methods: Changes in the PPMV-1 genome were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing after serial passages in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. In addition, histopathological lesions caused by PPMV-1 in experimentally vaccinated pigeons, chickens and turkeys were evaluated. Results: Following six PPMV-1 passages in chickens, 10 unnamed substitutions were found, including one (in the NP protein) that dominates the genetic pool of viral half-species. The histopathological changes induced by the post-passage PPMV-1 strain were more pronounced than those by the previously passaged PPMV-1 strain, with lesions most intensely seen in pigeons, followed by chickens and turkeys. Conclusion: PPMV-1 is highly adapted to pigeons and transmission from chickens results in the acquisition of new amino acids in the polymerase complex that can alter the pathogenic potential of the virus.",,"Olszewska-Tomczyk, M.;Dolka, I.;ÅšwiÈ©toÅ„, E.;Åšmietanka, K.",2018.0,,10.2478/jvetres-2018-0059,0

1578,Ensuring the safety of vaccine cell substrates by substantially parallel sequencing of the transcriptome,"The massively parallel, deep sequencing of the transcriptome combined with algorithmic analysis to identify random agents (MP-SeqTM) is an important aid in ensuring the safety of cells used in vaccine production. Such cells may harbor novel viruses of unknown sequence or latent viruses that are only expressed after stress has been applied to the cells. MP-Seq is an unbiased and comprehensive method for identifying such viruses and other incidental agents without prior knowledge of the nature of these agents. Here, we demonstrate its utility as part of an integrated approach to identify and characterize potential contaminants in widely used virus and vaccine production cell lines. Through this analysis, along with more traditional approaches, we excluded the presence of porcine circoviruses in the ATCC Vero cell bank (CCL-81), but found that a SRV-related full-length betaretrovirus could be expressed in these cells, a factor that may be important in the production of some vaccines. Similarly, insect cells have proven valuable for the production of virus-like particles and subunit vaccines, but they can harbor a range of latent viruses. We show that, following MP-Seq of the Trichoplusia ni (High Five cell line) transcriptome, we can detect a contaminating, latent nodavirus and identify an expressed errantivirus genome.

T.cruzi gearbox. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis line to examine mixed-species DNA extracted from T. dimidiata bellies. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method at spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design ranging from individual villages in Guatemala to large biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished by bioinformatic tools and used to assess the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and dominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, population genetic makeup, gut microbial diversity, and blood meal of T. dimidiata. Date. An average of 3.25 million reads were obtained per sample, assigned to approximately 1% parasites, 20% vectors, 11% bacteria, and 4% putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we identified nine infected vectors harboring two different DTUs: TcI and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector samples were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyzes and all samples had a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs, sufficient to detect geographic genetic makeup at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community in infected T. dimidiata abdomens with significantly higher bacterial species richness than uninfected ones. The Unifrac analysis suggests a common infection-associated bacterial community co-occurring with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified five T. dimidiata abdominal vertebrate blood meals, including chicken, dog, duck, and human; however, additional detection methods will be required to confidently identify sources of blood meal from most samples.

We constructed phylogenetic trees using the nucleotide sequences of 18 strains. The resulting trees show that all 12 strains of hepatitis B virus can be divided into four subgroups incompatible with conventional subtypes. We estimated the synonymous (silent) substitution rate for hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10-5 per site per year. Applying this ratio to the phylogenetic tree, we estimated that the duck hepatitis B virus diverged from a common ancestor at the earliest about 30,000 years ago, the woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus split about 10,000 years ago, and the hepatitis B virus itself split. This suggests that the hepadnavirus family evolved independently of host-species diversity, as these divergence times of viruses are much more recent than that of the host species.",,"Orito, E.;Mizokami, M.;Ina, Y.;Moriyama, E.

Each reaction was carried out using either two forward primers and one reverse primer, or one forward primer and one reverse primer. Both primer combinations had comparable amplification efficiencies for all NA subtypes (1-9). A total of 115 virus strains, including both field isolates and reference strains, were successfully amplified using these degenerate primer sets. Of the amplified sequences, 108 strains (93.9%) resulted in nearly full-length NA cDNAs after two reads with one forward primer and one reverse primer. Of the remaining sequences, five strains (4.3%) gave reads by BLAST with sufficient information for subtype classification, although they were of insufficient quality for assembly. While one strain (0.9%) gave different subtypes from both sequence reads, it was not possible to combine and subtype the other (0.9%). This successful demonstration of these degenerate primers for amplification and sequencing of all avian NA subtypes suggests that these primers can be used in avian influenza surveillance program as well as in studies of antiviral resistance, virus ecology or viral phylogeny.",,"Orozovic, G.;Latorre-Margalef, N.;Wahlgren, J.;Muradrasoli, S.;Olsen, B.",2010.0,Dec,,0
1582,In vitro surrogate models to aid the development of antivirals to control foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks,"Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly pathogenic member of the genus Aphthovirus (family Picornaviridae) and is only manipulated in high-restriction facilities, thus complicating antiviral research and discovery of antiviral strategies against the virus. Bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) and equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), which are most phylogenetically related to FMDV, have been investigated as surrogates of FMDV in antiviral studies. Although an effective cell culture system for BRBV has not been reported so far, we show that infection of primary bovine kidney cells results in extensive but rather weak reproducible induction of cytopathic effects (CPE). Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells supported viral replication in the absence of CPE. Antiviral tests have been developed for ERAV in Vero A cells using a viral RNA-reduction assay and CPE-reduction assay; the latter has a Z' factor of 0.83. ±. 0.07. The BRBV and ERAV models were then used to evaluate the anti-aftovirus activity of the two broad-spectrum antiviral agents 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) and ribavirin, as well as the enterovirus-specific inhibitor enviroxime. The effects of the three compounds were comparable in CPE-reduction (ERAV) and viral RNA-reduction assays (BRBV and ERAV). Similar to 2CMC, compound A, a recently discovered non-nucleoside pan-serotype FMDV inhibitor, inhibited the replication of both BRBV and ERAV, while enviroxime lacked activity. The BRBV and ERAV surrogate models reported here can be manipulated in BSL-2 laboratories, facilitating studies to unravel the mechanism of action of new FMDV inhibitors. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Osiceanu, A.

HPAI H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in 2007 and since then 546 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The disease has apparently become endemic in Bangladesh. Spatial-temporal information was analyzed on 177 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks that occurred in Bangladesh between February 2010 and April 2011, and 37 outbreaks in which H5N1 viruses isolated from these outbreaks were phylogenetically identified as clades. Three branches were identified, 2.2 (21 cases), 2.3.4 (2 cases), and 2.3.2.1 (14 cases). Clade 2.2 was identified over the time period and was widely distributed in a southeast-northwest direction. Item 2.3.2.1 arose later and was generally limited to central Bangladesh in a north-south direction. Based on directional testing, section 2.2 viruses spread from southeast to northwest, while section 2.3.2.1 spread from west to east. The diffusion size of section 2.3.2.1 was greater than that of section 2.2 (angular concentration 0.2765 vs. 0.1860). In both cases, the first outbreak(s) were identified as early outliers, but additionally, early outbreaks of item 2.2 (one each) were also detected in central Bangladesh and northwestern Bangladesh, which were significantly apart. Avian influenza H5N1 in Bangladesh is characterized by reported long-distance translocation events. This poses a challenge to disease control efforts. There is a need for greater enforcement of biosecurity and stronger control of movements between affected farms and sensitive farms, and better surveillance and reporting. Although the movement of poultry and equipment seems to be the more likely explanation for the identified patterns, the relative contribution of the trade and market chain to wild poultry in disease spread needs further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Osmani, M.

1585,Epidemiology and molecular characterization of chicken anemia virus from commercial and domestic chickens in Taiwan.,"Chicken infectious anemia (CIA) is a disease with a very economic impact in the poultry industry. Infected chickens are characterized by aplastic anemia and excessive immunosuppression, followed by increased susceptibility to secondary infectious pathogens and inadequate immune responses to vaccination. Commercially available CIA vaccines are routinely used by breeders in Taiwan to protect their offspring with antibodies of maternal origin. However, CIA cases still occur in the field and little is known about the genetic characteristics of Taiwanese chicken anemia viruses (CAVs). In this study, CAV DNA was detected in 72 of 137 herds collected between 2010-2015. The coding regions of 51 CAVs were sequenced among the PCR positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene revealed that although most Taiwanese CAVs belonged to genotypes II and III, some isolates clustered into a new genotype (genotype IV). Furthermore, a Taiwanese isolate in this novel genotype IV appeared to be derived from a recombination event between genotype II and III viruses. The five Taiwanese CAV isolates were highly similar to the 26P4 or Del-Ros vaccine strains. Taken together, these results suggest that CAV sequences in Taiwan are variable and genotypic recombination has occurred between viruses of different genotypes. Furthermore, vaccine-like strains can induce clinical signs of CIA in chickens. Our findings may be useful for understanding the evolution of CAVs and developing a better control strategy for the CIA.",,"Ou, S. C.;Lin, H. L.;Liu, P. C.;Huang, H. J.;Lee, M. S.;Lien, Y.

The Izumi plain is a wintering place for migratory birds in Japan. Genetic analyzes of H5N6 HPAIV isolates revealed previously unreported phylogenetic variations in the PB2, PB1, PA and NS gene segments, allowing us to propose two new genotypes for contemporary H5N6 HPAIVs. In addition, analysis of four gene segments identified close phylogenetic relationships between our three LPAIV isolates and our contemporary H5N6 HPAIV isolates.

1588,Genetic and epidemiological information on the emergence of peste des petits ruminant virus (PPRV) in Asia and Africa,"Small ruminants are an important source of livelihood for millions of households in many parts of the world. The spread of the highly contagious peste des petits ruminant (PPR) disease, caused by PPRV, an RNA virus, to Asia and Africa remains a major concern. This study investigated the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of PPRV through analyzes of the virus' partial N-gene and F-gene sequences. All four previously identified PPRV lineages (I-IV) diverged from their common ancestor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the four lineages, PPRV-IV showed significant region-wide genetic variation; however, haplotype sharing between geographic regions, together with the presence of multiple genetic clusters within a country, indicates the likelihood of frequent movement of diseased individuals across the region. The gradual decline in the number of effective infections points to a limited genetic variation attributable to effective vaccination that has been in place since the 1990s. However, movement of infected animals across the region likely contributes to the spread of PPRV-IV. No evidence of positive selection was identified from this study.",,"Padhi, A.;Ma, L.",2014.0,,10.1038/srep07040,0

To gain insight into the dynamics of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) and the ratio between the two (Ï‰ = dN/.dS), we analyzed data of the complete nucleotide coding sequence encoding the glycoproteins of the M segment. two negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to the same serogroup, Akabane virus (AKV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). AKV is relatively older and has circulated in ruminant populations since the 1970s, while SBV was first reported in 2011. Many times higher than AKV. Given the different evolutionary stages of the two viruses, most of the mildly deleterious mutations were likely cleared or kept at low frequency in the AKV genome, whereas positive selection, along with the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations, may contribute to such an inflated mutation rate. SBV. Evolutionary distance (d) correlates nonlinearly and negatively with Ï‰ but positively with dN and dS. Collectively, the different patterns in Ï‰, dN, dS, and d between AKV and SBV identified in this study provide empirical evidence for a time-dependent selection pressure.",,"Padhi, A.;Ma, L.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.019,0

Aujeszky disease (AD) was first confirmed serologically in 2001 in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS); however, there was no viral confirmation. The aim of this study was to search for antibodies against -SuHV-1 in the sera of wild pigs in the studied areas, to detect SuHV-1 by PCR and to classify the viral genome. Of the 218 animals sampled, 186 were analyzed by ELISA and 88 (47.3%) reactive samples were obtained. In the serum neutralization test (SN), 57/179 (31.8%) samples showed antibodies to AD virus (SuHV-1). By nested PCR, 104 DNA samples were extracted for analysis and confirmed by amplification of a glycoprotein B (gB) fragment in five samples. SuHV-1 was detected in 12 samples using primers for glycoprotein E (gE) and the viral genome was classified as Type I by ul44 partial sequencing. Amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in fetuses of seropositive pigs indicates that vertical transmission contributes to the maintenance of SuHV-1 in a free-living wild pig population. The origin of AD in wild pig populations of the Pantanal is unknown, but determination of viral latency, vertical transmission of antigen and genome typing by amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in fetuses of seropositive pigs, and genome typing are illuminating the epidemiology of this disease in the wetlands of MS, Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Paes, R.

1592,Cardiac and skeletal muscle inflammation of farmed salmon is associated with a new reovirus infection.,"Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) farming has been associated with epidemics of infectious diseases that threaten not only local production, but also wild fish that come close to marine poultry and fish that escape from them. Cardiac and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an often fatal disease of farm-raised Atlantic salmon. First recognized on a farm in Norway in 1999, HSMI later caused outbreaks on other farms in Norway and the United Kingdom[2]. Although studies of pathology and disease transmission showed an infectious basis, efforts to identify an agent were unsuccessful. Here we provide evidence that HSMI is associated with piscine reovirus (PRV) infection. PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high-throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well as sequence alignment and motif analysis. The formal meaning of PRV in HSMI would require isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's assumptions, or prevention or modification of disease through the use of specific drugs or vaccines. However, as our data suggest that a causal relationship is plausible, measures must be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens native salmon production, but also because of its potential to infect wild salmon populations.

Commonly referred to as ""poor man's meat"", cowpea is one of the most important subsistence legumes grown in West Africa due to the high protein content of its seeds. However, African cowpea production can be severely restricted by viral diseases that reduce yields. Although the virus infecting twelve cowpea beans has been reported from Africa, only three of these have been reported from Burkina Faso so far. Here, we use virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA)-based metagenomic method to screen for the presence of cowpea viruses from plants collected from three agro-climatic regions of Burkina Faso. Besides the three cowpea-infecting virus strains previously reported from Burkina Faso (Copea aphid-borne mosaic virus [Family Potyviridae]), Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus - A strain of Bean common mosaic virus - [Family Potyviridae] and Cowpea spotted virus [Family Tombusviridae]) five additional viruses were identified: Southern cowpea mosaic virus (Sobemovirus genus), two previously uncharacterized polerovirus-like species (Family Luteoviridae), a previously uncharacterized tombusvirus-like species (Family Tombusviridae), and a previously uncharacterized mycotymovirus-like species (family Timoviridae). Overall, potyviruses were the most common cowpea viruses (detected in 65.5% of samples) and the South Sudan region of Burkina Faso was found to harbor the highest viral diversity and viral prevalence.

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although its etiological role in PDNS has not been fully determined. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in pigs that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical manifestations. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 107 genome copies/ml) and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of porcine tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples localized in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 out of 48 positive for PCV3 by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and 60% of a subset tested positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. Analysis by qPCR of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3 positive cases (12.5%), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples found 46 (55%) of 83 samples tested. positive.

Reports suggested variable host response in goats and sheep, and this host response was not investigated against expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, miRNAs were sequenced and proteomic data were generated to determine the role of differentially expressed miRNA (DEmiRNA) in PPR virus (PPRV)-infected lung and spleen tissues of sheep and goats. 67 and 37 DEmiRNAs were identified in the lungs of goats and sheep, respectively. Similarly, 50 and 56 DEmiRNAs were identified in the spleen in goats and sheep, respectively. A total of 20 and 11 miRNAs were found to be co-differentiated in PPRV-infected spleen and lung, respectively, in both species. Six DEmiRNAs-miR-21-3p, miR-1246, miR-27a-5p, miR-760-3p, miR-320a and miR-363 were selected based on their roles in viral infections, apoptosis and fold change. Target prediction analysis of these six DEmiRNAs selected from the generated proteome data revealed greater numbers of genes involved in the lungs and spleens of goats than in sheep. In gene ontology analysis of host target genes, these DEmiRNAs were found to regulate several immune response signaling pathways. Your roads viz. T cell receptor signaling, Rap1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling mediated by DEmiRNAs were more disturbed in goats than in sheep. The data suggest that PPRV-induced miR-21-3p, miR-320a and miR-363 may act cooperatively to enhance viral pathogenesis in sheep lung and spleen by downregulating several immune response genes.

1601,Genomic diversity and adaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium from analysis of six genomes of different phage types.,"Background: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (or simply Typhimurium) is the most common serovar in both human infections and livestock in Australia and many other countries. Typhimurium is a wide host range serovar, but has also evolved into host-adapted variants (ie isolated from a particular host such as pigeons). Six Typhimurium strains from different phage types (identified by their susceptibility patterns to degradation by a number of bacteriophages) were analyzed using Illumina high-throughput genome sequencing. Results: Variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average of 611 SNPs per strain, from 391 to 922 SNPs. There were seven insertions/deletions (indel) involving complete or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to IS200 insertion, and 15 pseudogenes due to premature termination. Four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be related to virulence. Nine prophage or prophage residues were detected in six strains. Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2, and sopE2 and sspH2 phage residues were present in all six genomes, while Fels-1, Fels-2, ST64B, ST104 and CP4-57 were variably present. Four strains carried the 90 kb plasmid pSLT containing several known virulence genes. However, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. In addition, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to the Typhi strain CT18 plasmid pHCM2. Conclusion: Genome data indicate that variations between strains are mainly due to accumulation of SNPs, some of which result in gene inactivation. No unique genetic elements common between host-adapted phage species were found. This work has improved our understanding of the evolution and adaptation of Typhimurium at the genomic level.

The same proteins of Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had 25%, 66% and 33% aa identity with the corresponding proteins of murine astrovirus (JX544743) as the closest strain. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 represents the first member of a new mamastrovirus species. The data suggest that both mammals and birds may have been exposed to mamastroviruses and avastroviruses, which provide opportunities for interspecies infection and viral adaptation with cross-class astroviruses, particularly in carnivorous animals.

1606,Enteric viruses detected by molecular methods in commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the United States between 2005 and 2006.,"Intestine samples collected from 43 commercial broiler and 33 commercial turkey flocks from all regions of the United States in 2005 and 2006 were examined for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence of group 1 and 2 adenovirus by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to further characterize viruses and to evaluate species association and geographic patterns. Astroviruses were detected in samples from 86% of chicken flocks and 100% of turkey flocks. Both chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis virus (ANV) were identified in chicken samples, and generally both viruses were detected in the same flock. Turkey astrovirus type-2 and turkey astrovirus type-1 were found in 100% and 15.4% of turkey flocks, respectively. In addition, 12.5% of turkey flocks were positive for ANV. Rotaviruses were present in 46.5% of chicken flocks tested and 69.7% of turkey flocks tested. Based on the rotavirus NSP4 gene sequence, chicken and turkey rotaviruses are classified in a species-specific manner. Rotaviruses originating from Turkey are also diversified according to geographical location. Reoviruses were detected in 62.8% and 45.5% of chicken and turkey flocks, respectively. Based on the reovirus S4 gene segment, chicken and turkey viruses were classified separately and differed from all previously reported avian reoviruses. Coronavirus was detected in the intestinal contents of chickens, but not in turkeys. Adenoviruses were not detected in any chicken or turkey flock. Of a total of 76 chicken and turkey flocks tested, only three were negative for all viruses targeted by this study. Most of the swarms were positive for two or more viruses and overall there was no clear pattern of the geographic distribution of the virus. This study provides updated enteric virus prevalence data for the United States using molecular methods and reinforces the prevalence of enteric viruses in poultry in the United States, although the clinical significance of many of these viruses remains unclear.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M.

1607,Periodic monitoring of commercial turkeys for enteric viruses indicates the continued presence of astrovirus and rotavirus on farms.,"longitudinal study was conducted using molecular detection methods to detect enteric viruses in gut contents collected from turkeys at eight commercial operations and one research facility. Intestinal contents were collected from turkeys prior to placement, with each flock resampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age. Samples were screened for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) by a reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and for group 1 and 2 adenovirus by PCR. Rotavirus was the only virus detected prior to insertion (7 out of 16 samples examined). All commercial flocks were positive for rotavirus and astrovirus at 2 to 6 weeks of age, and most were intermittently positive up to 12 weeks of age when the birds were handled. Of 96 samples collected from farm birds, 89.5% were positive for astrovirus and 67.7% for rotavirus. All flocks were negative for TCoV, reovirus and group 1 adenovirus at all time points and positive for group 2 adenovirus (hemorrhagic enteritis virus) at week 6. All monitored flocks were considered healthy or normal by field personnel. Turkeys placed in research facilities that had been empty and thoroughly cleaned for months had higher body weights and lower feed conversion rates at 5 weeks of age than turkeys placed on commercial farms. Intestinal samples from these turkeys at 1, 2, and 3 weeks of age were free of enteric virus. This report shows that astroviruses and rotaviruses can be present in a turkey flock throughout the life of the flock. Comparison of birds infected with a group of turkeys negative for enteric viruses with the methods used herein suggests that astrovirus and/or rotavirus may affect production. The exact impact on herd performance needs to be further determined.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M. J.;Spackman, E.;Day, J. M.;Rives, D.",2007.0,,10.1637/0005-2086(2007)51[674:Pmoctf]2.0.Co;2,0
1608,Molecular characterization and typing of chicken and turkey astroviruses circulating in the United States: Implications for diagnosis,"Avian astroviruses were detected by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction in intestinal contents collected from commercial chickens and turkeys in the United States from 2003 to 2005. Astroviruses were detected in birds from both healthy and underperforming flocks with or without enteric disease. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with sequence data obtained from polymerase (ORF-1b) genes of 41 turkey astroviruses and 23 chicken astroviruses. All currently available avian astrovirus sequence data and selected mammalian astrovirus sequence data were included in the analysis. Four groups of avian astroviruses were observed by phylogenetic analysis: turkey astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1)-like viruses, turkey astrovirus type 2 (TAstV-2)-like viruses, both detected in turkeys; avian nephritis virus (ANV)-like viruses detected in both chickens and turkeys; and a new group of chicken-borne astroviruses (CAstV). Amino acid identity between these four groups ranged from 50.1% to 73.8% for all avian isolates, with a maximum of 49.4% compared with mammalian astroviruses. There were multiple phylogenetic subgroups based on 9% nucleotide sequence differences within the TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV groups. Phylogenetic analysis showed no clear variation by geographic region or date of isolation. Also, no association was observed between the detection of a particular astrovirus and the presence of enteric disease or poor performance. Based on these data, a revision of the current taxonomic classification for avian astroviruses within the genus Avastrovirus is warranted.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M. J.;Spackman, E.;Woolcock, P.

1609,Two oncogenes in avian carcinoma virus MH2: myc and mht,"The 5.2-kilobase (kb) RNA genome of avian carcinoma MH2 has 5' - delta gag (0.2 kb)-mht (1.2 kb)-myc (1.4 kb)-c(0.4 kb)-poly (A) genetic structure. (0.2kb)-3'. delta gag is a partial retroviral core protein, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. The following results were obtained from the complete nucleotide sequences of the mht and myc genes in MH2. (i) delta gag-mht constitutes a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides that ends with a stop codon near the 3' end of the mht gene. The 3' 969 nucleotides of mht up to the stop codon are 80% sequence related to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (MSV 3611) (94% homologous at the amino acid level removed). (ii) The myc coding region in MH2 is preceded by 181 nucleotides derived from the intron just upstream of the second exon of the chicken cellular proto-myc gene, followed by an RNA splice acceptor region shared with the proto-myc gene, followed by an RNA splice acceptor shared with proto-myc site is in line beyond that to the 3'-termination codon and 40 non-coding nucleotides with the sequences of avian retrovirus MC29 and chicken proto-myc myc. Thus myc forms a second MH2-specific gene together with a 5' retroviral exon. It was concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the delta gag-mht gene, which is closely related to the delta gag-raf transforming gene of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is closely related to the MC29 transforming gene. It can also be concluded that cellular proto-onc genes that become viral onc genes in sequence transduction are a small group, as 5 out of 19 known onc sequences are shared by different taxonomic virus groups of mht/raf. homology is the closest so far.",,"Papas, T.

However, the virus strain has not been characterized in detail. Therefore, we aimed to identify the molecular properties of BRS115 using randomly prepared reverse transcription-PCR of genomic RNA followed by large parallel sequencing using semiconductor sequencing technology. More than 64,000 trimmed reads mapped to reference sequences from GenBank. The strain is classified as Rotavirus strain A and genotyped G7-P[35]-I4-R4-C4-M4-A16-N4-T4-E11-H4 according to the guidelines of the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.

In the last 10 years, influenza vaccine coverage has declined both in the general population (from 15.7% in 2004-2005 to 11.7% in 2013-2014) and in the vaccine-targeted population of 65-year-olds. (from 65.3% in 2004-2005 to 48.6% in 2013-2014) and well below the planned minimum threshold (75%). The highest rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) were recorded during the 2004-2005 and 2009-2010 epidemics (highest incidences: 12.04– and 13.28–, respectively). Both seasons were characterized by the introduction of new viral strains: A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) (an entrained hemagglutinin variant) and A/California/7/2009(H1N1) pandemic virus (a swine quadruple reassortant), . As the antigenic compatibility between the vaccine and the circulating strains was good in both seasons, a significant portion of the cases could have been prevented by the vaccine. A different situation was observed in the 2011-2012 season, in which ILI morbidity rates in individuals aged 65 years were 1.5-6 times higher than those recorded during the other outbreaks studied. Higher morbidity resulted from circulation in the 2011-2012 season of a variant similar to A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) that presented a reduced genetic match to the A(H3N2) strain included in the 2011-2012 vaccine composition.

Methods: Total RNA isolated from the allantoic fluid of SPF embryo passaged with infected chicken sample was sequenced by whole-genome shotgun sequencing using the ion-torrent PGM platform. The sequence was analyzed for the presence of coding and non-coding features, similarity to reported isolates, and epitope analysis of the capsid structural protein. Results: The consensus length of the 7513Â bp genome sequence of the Indian isolate of chicken astrovirus was obtained after combining 14,121 high-quality reads. The genome consists of three open reading frames (ORFs), including 13Â bp 5â€²-UTR, ORF1a encoding serine protease, ORF1b encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encoding capsid protein, and 298Â bp 3â€²-UTR. ) was formed.

Including Avian pneumovirus (APV), Avian influenza virus (AIV), Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Avibacterium paragallinarum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) various pathogens and Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are involved in the avian respiratory disease complex [1], [2] (Bradbury, 1984; Roussan et al., 2008). Therefore, the respiratory disease complex is the most serious disease affecting poultry and causes heavy economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide [3] (Murthy et al., 2008). In recent years, metagenomics has been a powerful analysis tool for the detection of pathogens directly from clinical samples without any prior knowledge of the organism in a particular sample [4], [5] (Schuster, 2008; Pereira et al., 2010).

Although both viruses can cause febrile rhinopneumonia, EHV-1 is the main cause of miscarriage, paresis, and neonatal foal death. The central lesion of these three conditions is necrotizing vasculitis and thrombosis, resulting from lytic infection of the endothelial cells lining the blood capillaries. Initiation of infection in these lesions will likely be by reactivated EHV-1 from latently infected leukocytes. However, the host factors responsible for reactivation are poorly understood. While the development of vaccines against these important equine viruses, which includes classical and modern approaches, has continued for over fifty years, progress has been slow compared to other veterinaryly important alpha herpes viruses affecting cattle and pigs. However, recent data on a live temperature-sensitive EHV-1 vaccine are promising. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Patel, J. R.;Heldens, J.",2005.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2004.04.018,0

1624,"Options for foot-and-mouth disease control: knowledge, skills and policy","Foot and mouth disease can be controlled with zoo sanitation and vaccination, but this is difficult due to the presence of multiple serotypes of the causative virus, multiple host species including wildlife, and extreme contagiousness. Although intolerable to modern high production livestock systems, the disease is not usually fatal and is often not a priority for control in many developing countries that remain reservoirs for viral spread. Phylogenetic analysis of viruses circulating worldwide reveals seven major reservoirs, each requiring a specific regional control strategy. Countries that have eradicated the disease but require regional cooperation as well as obtaining and maintaining this status using existing tools provide significant commercial benefits to countries that require a great deal of time, money and effort. Therefore, a progressive approach is needed that can provide temporary benefits along the way to eventual eradication. Research is needed to understand and predict viral persistence and emergence patterns and to improve vaccine selection. Better diagnostic methods, and especially better vaccines, can significantly improve control in both free and affected parts of the world. In particular, vaccines with improved thermostability and a longer duration of immunity will facilitate control and make them less dependent on advanced veterinary infrastructures.

An isolate from the neighboring country Nepal was also included in the study. The virus/domain strains showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity among themselves, with variation in nucleotide sequence ranging from 1.2% to 19.4%. Indian strains were far from exotic type O strains of O1BFS, O1K and O1Campos (13.3-20.6%). Type O strains analyzed were classified into three genotypes according to the level of difference observed in nucleotide sequence. Type O vaccinia virus (R2/75) was >7% different (7.3-15.2%) from field strains, which revealed significant (>5%) genetic heterogeneity between the two. Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct lineages, i.e. (i) lineage 1 represented by exotic strains, (ii) lineage 2 represented by 25 domain species clustered into seven subgroups/sublines (2a-2g), and (iii) ) lineage 3. represented by a unique field isolate that shares branching/origin with the graft strain 3. Lineage 2, consisting of 25 of the 26 type O field strains analyzed, was placed almost equidistantly from lineages 1 and 3 in the phylogenetic tree. The vaccine strain was closer to the viruses in strain 2. The viruses/sequences in subgroup 2f appeared restricted to the southern states, although the sequences did not have a specific distribution pattern in different geographic regions of India. Comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced at immunodominant regions 133-160 and 200-208 of the 1D gene product (VP1) showed that the two viruses in lineage 3 have unique amino acid residues at positions 138 (D), 139 (G). , 144(I) and 158(A) compared to the remaining strains, including exotic ones. Comparison of amino acid residues at critical positions 144, 148, 149, 151, 153, 154 and 208 revealed similarity between the analyzed type O strains. Virus strains showed variation (V/L/I) at position 144. One field strain showed variation from Q149â†'E and the other from P208â†'L. Thus, the study revealed that the populations of O-type FMD viruses circulating in India that cause disease outbreaks are genetically very heterogeneous but associated with the immunodominant region of the VP1 polypeptide, with multiple genetically distinct virus populations in almost every region of the country. this is possible due to the unlimited movement of animals in the country.

1627,Characterization of full-length genomic sequences of vesicular stomatitis Cocal and Alagoas viruses,"In Brazil and Argentina, vesicular stomatitis (VS) is caused by different viral strains serologically related to the classic vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana (VSIV), namely VS Indiana-2 (VSIV-2) and VS Indiana-3 (VSIV-3). Here, we describe the full-length genomic sequences and organization of prototype strains of VSIV-2 Cocal virus (COCV) and VSIV-3 Alagoas virus (VSAV). These viruses showed genomic organizations similar to VSIV domain isolates, except that nonstructural C'/C proteins, which are markedly conserved throughout vesiculoviruses, are absent in VSAV. Phylogenetic analyzes consistently group COCV, VSAV, and VSIV in a different monophyletic group than VSNJV, supporting the classification of these viruses within the Indiana serogroup.",,"Pauszek, S.

1628,Genetic and antigenic relationships of vesicular stomatitis viruses from South America,"Vesicular stomatitis (VS) viruses have been classified into two serotypes: New Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV). Here, we describe field isolates that produced vesicular stomatitis in Brazil and Argentina over a 35-year period. Cluster analysis based on serological relatedness or the nucleotide sequences of two separate genes (phosphoprotein or glycoprotein) as inferred from virus neutralization and complement fixation experiments grouped domain isolates into two distinct monophyletic groups within the Indiana serogroup. One group contained seven viruses from Brazil and Argentina that were serologically classified as Indiana-2 and Cocal virus (COCV). The other group contained three viruses from Brazil serologically classified as Indiana-3 and the prototype of this group, Alagoas virus (VSAV). Interestingly, two vesiculoviruses, one isolated from insects but not animal disease, from Brazil (Maraba virus; MARAV) and the other from Colombia (CoAr 171638), are grouped into two distinct genetic lineages within the Indiana serotype. Our data provide support for the classification of viruses that cause clinical VS in livestock in Brazil and Argentina into two distinct groups: Indiana-2 (VSIV-2) and Indiana-3 (VSIV-3). For these viruses, we recommend using naming that includes the serotype, year and location of occurrence, and the affected host. This nomenclature is consistent with what is currently used in the scientific literature to describe VSNJV or VSIV field isolates. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).",,"Pauszek, S.

1629,Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for enterically transmitted acute hepatitis in humans with two different epidemiological patterns. Large waterborne outbreaks have been observed in endemic areas, affecting thousands of people, while sporadic cases have been described in non-endemic areas. Although contaminated water is well documented as a source of infection in endemic areas, routes of transmission are much less known in non-endemic areas. HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae with at least four major known genotypes (1-4) of mammalian HEV and one avian HEV. HEV is unique among hepatitis viruses known to have an animal reservoir. Unlike humans, HEV-infected swine and other mammalian species generally remain asymptomatic, while chickens infected with avian HEV can develop a disease known as the Hepatitis-Splenomegaly syndrome. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are found only in humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 are found in both humans and other mammals. Several lines of evidence suggest that animal-to-human transmission has occurred in some cases involving HEV genotypes 3 and 4. Also, people who have direct contact with animals have a higher risk of HEV infection. Interspecies infections with HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been demonstrated experimentally. However, not all sources of human infections have been identified so far, and in many cases the source of HEV infection in humans is unknown. Â© INRA, EDP Sciences, 2010.",,"Pavio, N.;Meng, X.

1632,Limited evidence of hemispherical movement of avian influenza viruses among contemporary North American shorebird isolates,"Migratory routes of gulls, sea terns and shorebirds (Charadriiformes) are known to cross hemispheric borders and intersect with epidemic areas of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Previous assessments of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) among species of this taxonomic order have found some evidence for trans-hemispheric movement of virus genes. To specifically elucidate the role of shorebird species in the trans-hemispheric movement of influenza viruses, to evaluate the temporal variation of Eurasian lineages previously observed among North American shorebirds, and to evaluate the necessity of continuous sampling for HPAI from these birds in North America, we did the following: isolated between 2000 and 2008. Phylogenetic analysis of >700 contemporary sequences. Evidence for trans-hemispheric reclassification among North American shorebird LPAI gene segments was lower than in previous assessments (0.88%) and occurred only among eastern North American isolates. Also, half of the reclassification events occurred in only two isolates. The unique phylogenetic placement of these specimens suggests secondary infection and/or involvement of other migratory species such as gulls. Eurasian lineages observed in North American shorebirds before 2000 were not detected among contemporary specimens, suggesting temporal variation of LPAI lineages.",,"Pearce, J. M.;Ramey, A.

1633,Viral recombination blurs taxonomic lines: Study of single-stranded DNA viruses in a wastewater treatment plant.,"Understanding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities, particularly of economic concerns, is of paramount importance for maintaining healthy and productive microbial communities in agricultural fields and large industrial cultures, including bioprocessors. Wastewater treatment plants are large bioprocessors that take water from multiple sources and become reservoirs for the collection of many viral families that infect a wide range of hosts. To examine this complex virus collection, full-length genomes of circular ssDNA viruses were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant using a combination of sucrose-gradient size selection and rolling circle amplification and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Single-stranded DNA viruses are among the least understood groups of microbial pathogens due to genomic biases and culturing difficulties, particularly when compared to the larger, more frequently studied dsDNA viruses. However, the group includes several well-studied notable examples, including agricultural pathogens (Circoviridae and Geminiviridae) infecting both livestock and crops, and model organisms for genetic and evolutionary studies (Microviridae). Examination of the collected viral DNA provided evidence for 83 unique genotypic groupings that were genetically dissimilar to known viral types and exhibited wide variation within the community. Also, although these genomes express similarities with known viral families such as Circoviridae, Geminiviridae, and Microviridae, many of them are different enough to represent new taxonomic groups. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the protocol for separating bacteria and large viruses from sought-after ssDNA viruses and the ability to use this protocol to obtain an in-depth analysis of the diversity in this group.",,"Pearson, V.

1634,First finding of genetic and antigenic diversity in 1b-BVDV isolates from Argentina,"Infection with Bovine Viral Diarrhea Viruses (BVDV) in cattle results in a wide variety of clinical manifestations, from mild respiratory illness to fetal death and mucosal disease, depending on the virulence of the virus and the immune and reproductive status of the host. In this study, 30 Argentine BVDV isolates were characterized by phylogenetic analysis. Isolates were genotyped based on the comparison of the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and the E2 gene. In both phylogenetic trees, 76% of viruses were assigned to BVDV 1b, while BVDV 1a, 2a and 2b were also found. Eight of the BVDV 1b isolates were further characterized by cross-neutralization tests using guinea pig antisera and sera from cattle vaccinated with two different commercial vaccines.

A serological procedure for subtyping the NA glycoprotein is critical for the identification and classification of avian influenza (AI) viruses. The macro procedure was first described in 1961 by D. Aminoff et al. [2] and later Van Deusen et al. [4]. The micro-NI procedure reduces the amount of reagents required, allows antigenic classification of many isolates simultaneously, and eliminates spectrophotometric interpretation of results. While macro-NI has been shown to be more sensitive than micro-NI, the micro-NI assay is well suited for testing sera for the presence of NA antibodies and has proven to be a practical and rapid method for virus classification. This section will provide an overview of the USDA approved micro-NI procedure for the identification of subtype-specific NA and antibodies in AIV.",,"Pedersen, J. C.",2008.0,,,0

1639,Mutation dynamics for the origin of the novel avian influenza a (H7N9) and its capacity for human-to-human transmission.,"In February 2013, a new bird flu virus, H7N9 (A/H7N9/2013-China), broke out in eastern China and caused human death. Discovering its origin and the point at which it will become communicable between humans is a global priority. Here, we present an interdisciplinary method to trace the origin of the H7N9 virus in China and construct an evolutionary dynamic model for human-to-human transmission through mutations. After comparing influenza viruses from China since 1983, we constructed an A/H7N9/2013-Chinese virus evolutionary phylogenetic tree and found that human samples of virus infection were avian origin and clustered in an independent line. Comparing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of A/H7N9/2013-Chinese viruses with all human-to-human, avian and swine flu viruses in China over the past 30 years, A/H7N9/ 2013-Chinese viruses, Hu Nan Province 2010 Baer's By genetic rediversification from Pochard H7N1 virus (HA gene, EPI: 370846, similarity with H7N9 95.5%) and from Nanchang city 2000 duck flu viruses (NA gene, EPI: 387555, similarity with H7N9 97%). HA and NA gene sequence comparison showed that the A/H7N9/2013-Chinese virus is not similar to influenza viruses that can be transmitted from person to person. We used the Markov model to simulate the evolutionary dynamics required for human-to-human transmission mutations of the H7N9 virus.

1641,Maedi-visna virus infection in sheep: a review,"Maedi-visna virus (MVV) is classified as a lentivirus of the retroviridae family. The genome of MVV contains three genes: gag, which encodes group-specific antigens; pol encoding reverse transcriptase, integrase, RNAse H, protease and dUTPase, and env, the gene encoding the surface glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and entry of the virus into the host cell. Additionally, similar to other lentiviruses, it contains genome regulatory proteins, namely genes for vif, rev, and tat. The coding regions of the genome are surrounded by long terminal repeats (LTRs), which play a crucial role in the replication of the viral genome and provide binding sites for cellular transcription factors. The organs targeted by MVV are, in decreasing order of importance, the lungs, mammary glands, joints, and brain. In these organs, the virus replicates in mature macrophages and induces slowly progressive inflammatory lesions containing B and T lymphocytes. The clinical manifestations of MVV infection, namely dyspnea, weight loss, mastitis and arthritis, are associated with the location of these lesions. Infection with MVV induces the formation of antibodies that can be detected by agar gel immunodiffusion, ELISA, and serum neutralization assay. As neither antiviral therapy nor vaccine is available, diagnostic tests are the backbone of most plans to prevent the spread of MVV. However, as current serological tests still lack sensitivity and specificity, molecular biological methods are being developed that allow detection of the virus in peripheral blood, milk and tissue samples. Future research will have to focus on both the development of new diagnostic tests and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MVV infection.",,"PÃ©pin, M.;Vitu, C.;Russo, P.;Mornex, J.

Extensive surveillance of wild birds was carried out in Argentina between 2006 and 2007. Using RRT-PCR, 12 AI positive detections were made from cloaca swabs. One of these positive samples yielded an AI virus isolated from a wild kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) caught off the South Atlantic coastline of Argentina. Further characterization by nucleotide sequence reveals that it belongs to the H13N9 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of 8 viral genes shows that 6 internal genes are associated with isolates from Chile and Bolivia.

According to WHO estimates, approximately two billion people, representing one-third of the world's population, live in areas endemic for HEV and are therefore at risk of infection. In developed countries, circulation of the virus in both human and animal (pig, wild boar, deer) sewage has been confirmed; however, the incidence rate is low compared to developing countries, where outbreaks of acute hepatitis transmitted by the fecal-oral route occur more frequently during flood season or after natural disasters with inadequate sanitary conditions. HEV genotypes. While genotypes 1 and 2 have been isolated in all human outbreaks in developing countries, genotypes 3 and 4 have been isolated not only in humans but also in animals in both developing and industrialized countries. These data support genotypes 3 and 4 of a zoonotic nature. Diagnosis of this disease is based on the detection of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in blood serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent methods. However, the method that best confirms the diagnosis is RT-PCR, which detects HEV RNA in blood serum and also provides the genotype. The clinical course is usually acute hepatitis, which in some cases may require hospitalization and may develop into chronic hepatitis in transplant patients or HIV-infected persons. In addition, the virus poses a significant risk for pregnant women. Hepatitis E can present with a wide variety of symptoms, from a subclinical case to chronic liver disease with extrahepatic manifestations. Therefore, diagnosis is difficult if a differential diagnosis is not included.

NiV and HeV infections cause respiratory and encephalitic diseases with high mortality rates in humans. Henipaviruses (HNV) are the only Paramyxoviruses to be classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens due to their extreme pathogenicity, potential for bioterrorism, and the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics. HNV uses the highly conserved proteins ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 as viral entry receptors. This likely explains their unusually broad species tropism, and also provides opportunities to examine how receptor utilization, cellular tropism, and end-organ pathology are related to the pathobiology of HNV infections. Clinical and pathological manifestations of NiV and HeV virus infections Wong et al. and Geisbert et al. In this respect. Here, we will review the biology of HNV receptors and how receptor utilization relates to HNV cell tropism in vitro and in vivo. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Pernet, O.;Wang, Y.

1650,Biological and phylogenetic characterization of the virulent Newcastle disease virus circulating in Mexico,"In 2002-2003, outbreaks of velogenic Newcastle Disease Virus closely related to Mexican isolates were confirmed in the United States (USA) in southern California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. In this report, virulent NDVs isolated in Mexico between 1998 and 2006 were subjected to biological characterization and phylogenetic analysis using standard pathogenicity tests. Chicken embryo mean time to death (MDT) test results ranged from 39.7 to 61.5 hours, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 1.59 to 1.94, compared with a possible maximum value of 2.0. These isolates showed a dibasic amino acid motif in the fusion protein cleavage site sequence required for host systemic replication. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Mexican virulent NDVs belong to class II, genotype V viruses and can be clearly divided into two groups as follows: isolates from 1998 to 2001 and isolated phylogenetically distinct viruses with close epidemiological relationship to the most recent US NDV outbreaks. . From 2004 to 2006, it showed higher virulence. Evaluating the evolution of viruses from Mexico and other neighboring countries will aid US surveillance efforts for early detection of highly virulent NDV.",,"Perozo, F.;Merino, R.;Afonso, C.

1651,Antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response in mice is suppressed by infection with pathogenic lyssaviruses,"The response of cells (RTC) was examined in BALB/c mice intramuscularly infected with various lyssaviruses. After infection by this peripheral route, two types of viruses can be classified according to their effects: 1) pathogenic viruses, including fixed rabies Pasteur virus (serotype 1) and wild viruses of serotype 1 (from a rabid fox in France and a vampire bat in Brazil). infected cow) or serotype 5 (European bat lyssavirus 1); and 2) non-pathogenic viruses, including Mokola virus (serogenotype 3). RTC was tested in vitro by assaying the cytokine production capacity of splenic T cells from infected BALB/c mice after antigenic (purified lyssavirus antigens) or polyclonal stimulation (concanavalin A). Assay for cytokine production, biological activity of interteukin-2 and transcription to complementary DNA and amplification by polymerase for interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interferon-Î³ (IL2, IL4 and IFNÎ³) messenger RNAs (mRNA) followed up. chain reaction. The first production of biologically active IL2 and cytokine mRNA was observed in mice infected with pathogenic or non-pathogenic lyssaviruses. Mice with only symptoms (infected with pathogenic viruses) lost the capacity to produce cytokines in vitro after antigen-specific stimulation. No such loss was observed after polyclonal stimulation. In mice peripherally infected with non-pathogenic viruses, no loss was observed after stimulation with lyssavirus antigens. Thus, infection with pathogenic lysaviruses via the peripheral route causes a loss of T-cell response in BALB/c mice after antigen activation, but not after polyclonal activation.",,"Perrin, P.;Tino De Franco, M.;Jallet, C.;Fouque, F.;Morgeaux, S.;Tordo, N.;Colle, J.

1652,Conserved presence of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the Long Terminal Repeat Promoter of Lentiviruses,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures of nucleic acids that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; Stabilization with G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/turning on LTR G4s. Here, we extended our search for the presence of LTR G4s to include all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5'-LTR U3 region are fully conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a lentivirus that infects cattle. All other non-primate lentiviruses showed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the probability of folding into G4s was highly conserved between strains. While the LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, they were increasingly differentiated in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation was found between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFÎºB binding sites. All LTR G4s were folded: their complexity was evaluated by the polymerase inhibition test. Our data support the role of the lentiviruses 5'-LTR G4 region as the control center of viral transcription; this can include folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple retrieval of both sequence and structure based factors.",,"Perrone, R.;Lavezzo, E.;PalÃ¹, G.;Richter, S.

1653,Comparison and comparison of genes and biological pathways responsive to Marek's disease virus infection using allele-specific expression and differential expression in broilers and laying hens.,"Background: Marek's disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpes virus. Increasing MD genetic resistance is desirable to increase existing vaccines and other MD control measures. High-throughput sequencing was used to profile spleen transcriptomes from individual F1 strains infected with MDV at 4 days of age from both self-bred broilers (meat-type) and self-bred layer (egg-type) chicken lines that differ in MD genetic resistance. The information obtained was used to identify SNPs, genes and biological pathways that exhibit allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection in each chicken type. In addition, we compared and compared the results of pathway analyzes (ASE and differential expression (DE)) between chicken species to inform about the biological response to MDV infection. Results: With 7 individuals per line and the high power treatment group, we identified 6,132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4,768 genes and 4,528 SNPs in 3,718 genes in broilers and eggs, respectively, that exhibited ASE in response to MDV infection. In addition, 548 and 434 genes were found to show DE following MDV infection in broilers and layer hens, respectively. When the datasets were compared, only 72 SNPs and 850 genes for ASE and 20 genes for DE were common between the two bird species. Although the chicken strains used in this study were genetically different, at the pathway level, both the TLR receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were enriched, and a high proportion of ASE genes were displayed, especially at the start of both of the above-mentioned regulatory pathways. Conclusions: RNA sequencing with sufficient biological replicates is a powerful approach to identify highly reliable SNPs, genes and pathways associated with the transcriptional response to MDV infection. In addition, SNPs that exhibit ASE in response to MDV infection provide a strong basis for determining the extent to which variation in expression affects the incidence of MD, and also provides genetic markers for genomic selection. However, given the little overlap between the ASE SNP sets (broilers vs. layers), it is likely that separate screens for each population should be included. Finally, comparison of the gene lists obtained between these two different chicken strains indicates that TLR and JAK/STAT signaling are conserved in response to MDV infection and can be altered by selecting for ASE exhibiting genes located at the start of each pathway.

1655,Natural reservoirs for homologues of the hepatitis C virus,"The hepatitis C virus is considered an important public health problem, infecting 2-3% of the human population. Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most common indication for liver transplant and a vaccine is not available. The hepatitis C virus exhibits a narrow host-type tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence of a reservoir of animal viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus that may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and have resulted in the current pandemic. Indeed, due to this limited host range, a robust immune-sufficient small animal model is still lacking, hindering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control, and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies have discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domestic animals (dogs and horses) living in close contact with humans. The genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses that infect different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and will improve our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using traceable animal models. In this review article, we begin with an introduction to the genetic diversity of the hepatitis C virus and then focus on newly discovered viruses closely related to the hepatitis C virus. Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen. © 2014 SSCC. All rights reserved.",,"Pfaender, S.;Brown, R. J.

Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord detected non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionitis, characteristic of the neurotropic viral agent, in both sheep. Metagenomic analysis of different tissue samples from both animals identified a novel Ovine Astrovirus (OvAstV). The presence of the viral genome in the central nervous system was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Although cases were presented nine months apart, the identified OvAstV shared nearly identical sequences that differed only at three nucleotide positions throughout the entire genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close association of OvAstV with neurotropic bovine astroviruses and an enteric OvAstV.

Methods: Histology was used to identify microscopic lesions in multiple tissues. Metagenomics was used to detect viral sequences in tissue homogenates. In situ hybridization was used to detect viral RNA expression in heart tissue. Results: In all three cases, we characterized the genome of a novel circovirus, which we named PCV3, with a replicase and capsid proteins, with proteins that were 55% and 35% identical to, or even further away from, the genetically closest proteins from a bat feces-associated circovirus. porcine circovirus 1 and 2.

1662,Fecal Viral Flora of Wild Rodents,"The frequent interactions of rodents with humans make them a common source of zoonotic infections. To obtain an initial unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of wild rodents, we sequenced partially purified, randomly amplified viral RNA and DNA in the feces of 105 wild rodents (mouse, rat, and rat) collected in California and Virginia. We identified decreasing frequency sequences related to the mammalian virus families Circoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Seventeen small circular DNA genomes containing one or two replicase genes distantly related to Circoviridae, representing several potentially novel viral families, were characterized. Two new candidate genera, as well as a close genetic relative of the human pathogen Aichi virus, have been characterized in the Picornaviridae family. Fragments of the first mouse sapelovirus and picobirnaviruses were identified and the first murine astrovirus genome characterized. A mouse papillomavirus genome and fragments of a novel adenovirus and adenovirus-associated virus were also sequenced. The next largest fraction of rodent fecal virus was related to insect viruses of the families Densoviridae, Iridoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Dicistroviriade, Bromoviridae and Virgaviridae, followed by plant virus-related sequences in Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Secoviridae, Partitiviridae, Tymoviridae. Families Alphaflexiviridae and Tombusviridae, largely reflecting the insect and plant rodent diet. Thus, phylogenetic analyzes of complete and partial viral genomes revealed many previously unreported viral species, genera, and families.

Recently, complete genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have been identified worldwide, but none were from Europe. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the whole genome sequences of five ILTV strains. Sequences were also compared to reveal the similarity of strains over time and to distinguish between wild-type and vaccine strains. The genomes of three ILTV-receiving isolates from the 1980, 2007 and 2011 epidemics in Italy were sequenced using 454 Life Sciences technology and two commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines. Comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed between the five genomes. Overall, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes were identified. The similarity between field strains and between field and vaccine strains varied between 99.96% and 99.99%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between them. This study generated data on genomic variation among Italian ILTV strains, revealing that although genetic variability of the genome is well conserved over time and between wild-type and vaccine strains, some mutations may help differentiate between them and play a role in ILTV virulence. /weakening.

1670,Evidence of predicted feline origin of sporadic G6P[9] rotaviruses in humans,"Type A rotaviruses are highly diverse and place a significant burden on human and animal health. Interspecies transmission between farm animals, pets, and humans is common, but the spread of animal-like rotaviruses within the human population is limited. During continuous monitoring of rotavirus strains in Germany, an unusual strain of G6P[9] rotavirus was detected in the stool of a child. The complete rotavirus coding sequences revealed a unique constellation of genotypes G6-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E2-H3. The virus was phylogenetically related to the feline G3P[9] strains and other human G6P[9] rotaviruses, possibly of zoonotic origin. Analysis of the primary binding sites of G6-specific genotyping revealed further evidence of a G6P[9] cat reservoir. In addition, significant shortcomings of traditional semi-nested PCR genotyping approaches have emerged in contemporary G6P[9] detection. Rotavirus strain GER29-14 most likely resulted from a direct or recent interspecies transmission from a cat to a human. Further studies can evaluate the nucleic acid sequences and genotype constellations of feline rotavirus to confirm the probable feline origin of sporadic human G6P[9] strains.",,"Pietsch, C.;Liebert, U.

Phylogenetic and genetic analyzes included these viruses in combination with all known fullgenome sequences of avian viruses isolated before 1981. 3 months ago, polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA were the closest known genetic relatives, with six genome segments of the common lineage encoding nucleoprotein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA) and nonstructural (NS) proteins. Lineages of these genome segments included reassortment with the HA gene, all originating from the H5N2 serotype, with other North American turkey viruses rooted in North American wild waterfowl. The phylogenies showed adaptation from North American wild birds to turkeys with the possible participation of domestic waterfowl. The turkey isolate A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9) was the second poultry isolate most closely related to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9) and has five common lineage genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, and neuraminidase). A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus was more lethal to chicken embryos and mice than A/turkey/Wisconsin/68 (H5N9), giving a greater incidence to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966. showed biological similarity (H5N9). Thus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was identified as the closest known ancestral relative of HPAI A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9) and it is a useful reference virus for characterizing early genetics. will serve. and biological features associated with the emergence of pathogenic strains of avian influenza. © 2012 SGM.",,"Ping, J.;Selman, M.;Tyler, S.;Forbes, N.;Keleta, L.;Brown, E.

1672,Evaluation of a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction format for DNA copy number measurement.,"Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology recently commercialized to enable precise quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute amounts by counting nucleic acid molecules encapsulated in discrete, volume-defined, water-in-oil droplet sections. This new ddPCR format offers a simple workflow that can generate highly stable segmentation of DNA molecules. In this study, we evaluated the key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% to 99.6% saturation in the assay of 20,000 droplets corresponding to greater than 4 sizes of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of the simplex and duplex assays targeting two different loci using the ddPCR platform in the lambda DNA genome agreed, within their expanded uncertainty, with the values obtained using a lower-density microfluidic chamber-based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty of less than 5% was obtained for the copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for the quantification of specific DNA target sequences using real-time and digital cdPCR technologies currently commercially available.

1673,Development of generic Taqman PCR and RT-PCR assays for the detection of DNA and mRNA of Î²-actin-encoding sequences in a wide variety of animal species,"As a member of the European Virus Archive (EVA) consortium, our laboratory develops and maintains an extensive virus collection. This collection implies the use of a panel of cell lines originating from various animal species. To facilitate the use of such a large panel of cell lines, broad-spectrum real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests have been developed to allow detection. and quantification of DNA and mRNA of Î²-actin, one of the most widely used eukaryotic housekeeping genes. Using two degenerate primers and a unique probe, these two tests were shown to detect nucleic acids from a panel of vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines widely used in animal virology. This panel included human, monkey, rodent, dog, pig, fish, batrakian, mosquito and tick cell lines. In addition, two experiments successfully amplified the Î²-actin-encoding sequences of the midges. Sensitivity evaluation performed on synthetic DNA and RNA sequences showed that the two assays were very sensitive and suitable for accurate quantification. The two tests together form a convenient multi-purpose method. For example, they can be used to estimate the amount of contaminating cellular genetic material prior to sequence-independent amplification of viral genomes obtained prior to high-throughput sequencing, to evaluate the efficacy of DNase and/or RNase treatments performed on the cellular extract, and to control nucleic control.

1674,Transmission of a pestivirus infection in the Pyrenean chamois population,"Outbreaks of a previously unrecorded disease have recently affected Pyrenean ibex (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) populations throughout the mountain range. It was assumed that the cause of this emerging disease was a pestivirus, which can cross the species barrier and be transmitted to or from wildlife. Using an epidemiological study conducted in Orlu, France from 1995 to 2004, we identified the virus and analyzed its transmission. Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences and virus neutralization tests indicated that the virus belonged to the newly identified borderline disease virus-4 group. Increasing seroprevalence with age has shown that infection can occur at any age, resulting in lifelong immunity. Overall, 70.3% of 323 samples were positive for anti-p80 antibodies and 10.2% of 167 samples showed viremia as demonstrated by positive ELISA antigen testing or RT-PCR. Therefore, while infection has been prevalent in this population since 1995, no mass deaths or clinical signs have been observed. The incidence and seroprevalence varied seasonally and according to the number of individuals younger than 2 years in the population, so viral transmission was dependent on the age structure of the host population. We suggest that the virus is now endemic in this population and possibly harmful to reproduction and offspring. More research is needed to estimate the impact of pestivirus on host population dynamics and the risk of cross-contamination to livestock.

1675,Influenza A Virus Detected in Pigs in Southern Germany after the H1N1 Pandemic in 2009,"Infections with influenza A viruses (IAV) are quite common in swine populations, and stable coexistence of at least three lineages was well documented until 2009 in European pigs. However, the situation is changing since the human pandemic pdmH1N1 virus emerged in 2009 (re)introduced into individual pig herds worldwide. These variations in relevant IAV pools within pig populations are of great interest and the zoonotic potential of emerging putative viruses needs to be evaluated. Since recent data on IAV in pigs from southern Germany are relatively sparse, the aim of this study was to identify the major IAV subtypes actually present in this region. To this end, 1417 nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with respiratory disease from 2010 to 2013 were screened for IAV genomes. Overall, IAV genomes at 130 holdings were detected by real-time RT-PCR targeting the matrix protein gene. For further analysis, several PCR protocols were quickly subtyped between the H1, pdmH1, H3, N1 and N2 sequences. Taken together, the co-circulation of three stable European lineages of IAV was confirmed for Bavaria. H1N1 sequences were identified in 59, whereas H1N2 genomes were identified in only 14 and H3N2 was identified in 9 of the analyzed enterprises. However, pdmH1 was detected in combination with N1 in 2010, 2012 and 2013, confirming the presence of pdmH1N2 reassortant viruses, albeit with a low prevalence. Interestingly, individual cases of coinfection with multiple subtypes were diagnosed. Partial genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. Clearly unlike the human population, classically circulating IAV was not replaced by pdmH1N1 in Bavarian pigs. However, some interesting viruses have been detected. Further monitoring of these viruses in the Bavarian pig population will be of great importance for monitoring future developments.",,"Pippig, J.;Ritzmann, M.;BÃ¼ttner, M.;Neubauer-Juric, A.",2016.0,,10.1111/zph.12264,0

1677,High turnover results in long-term persistence of influenza in managed swine herds,"Pigs have long been hypothesized to play a central role in the emergence of new strains of human influenza A virus (IAV) by serving as mixing vessels for mammalian and avian variants. However, the fundamental issue of viral persistence in pig populations at different scales is poorly understood. We address this gap using epidemiological models calibrated against seroprevalence data from Dutch finishing pigs to estimate 'critical herd size' (CHS) for IAV persistence. Next, we examine viral phylogenetic evidence for persistence by comparing human and porcine IAV. Models suggest a CHS of about 3000 pigs, above which persistence of influenza is likely, ie orders of magnitude lower than persistence thresholds for IAV and other acute viruses in humans. At national and regional scales, we found much stronger empirical signatures of long-term persistence of IAV in pigs compared to human populations. These striking levels of persistence in small populations are driven by the high recruitment rate of susceptible piglets and have important implications for the management of pigs and the overall genetic diversity patterns of IAV.",,"Pitzer, V.

The aim of the study was to determine the BVDV infection status in a dairy herd vaccinated against BVD. Prior to the start of vaccination in 2008, there was no prior identification or elimination of the possible source of infection (continuously infected animals). The vaccine itself was expected to enable eradication of viral scatterers in the long run. Material and Methods: Although there were no clinical problems indicating the possible presence of BVDV, serological screening for antibodies to BVDV was performed by determining the presence of viral genome by antibody titers, BVDV antigen, and phylogenetic analysis of positive samples in the flock. infection. Results: 19 individuals permanently infected with BVDV were detected among calves and heifers, but not in adult cattle. All virus scatterers were antibody negative and the genotype of the virus isolated was BVDV-lb, indicating a single source of infection. The vaccine used in the herd consisted of the BVDV-Ia strain. In each of the stables tested, antibody titers against BVDV-1b were higher (median values) than against BVDV-1a. Conclusion: Despite a long-term vaccination schedule and relatively high sequence homology (83.6%) of vaccine and field strains of BVDV, it was not possible to avoid transplacental infections of fetuses and the birth of permanently infected calves from vaccinated heifers. clinical disease was performed.",,"Polak, M.

1680,Risk factors and molecular characterization of acute sporadic symptomatic hepatitis E virus infection in Thailand.,"Objective: To report the clinical outcomes and viral genotypes of acute symptomatic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Thailand. Methods: Forty patients with acute symptomatic HEV infection between 2009 and 2013 were recruited. Clinical, demographic and laboratory data were collected. Diagnosis was made by detection of anti-HEV IgM and/or HEV RNA in serum or stool. HEV genotypes were classified by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The high-risk group (17 cases) of immunocompromised, hepatic cirrhosis and very elderly (>80 years) patients had higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels at admission compared to the low-risk group. Two fatal cases from acute hepatitis E in the high-risk group. Initial clinical presentation did not show statistically significant differences. In six cases (6/40), the virus was detectable in serum or stool by RT-PCR and sequencing. Upon molecular characterization, the viruses were classified as HEV genotype 3f and were in the same cluster as Thai pig HEV. Conclusions: Our data have demonstrated that acute HEV infection has a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes. Higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels were observed in high-risk patients. All isolated viruses were identified as HEV genotype 3f, presumably of porcine origin.

Data on HEV infection in the Romanian wild boar population are limited to serological studies. Therefore, our main aim was to determine the prevalence of HEV in the wild boar population and to characterize the HEV strains circulating in Romania. Using the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay, we analyzed the presence of RNA HEV in 45 liver samples and five spleen samples collected from 50 wild boars. The specimens were collected during the 2013-2015 hunting seasons. Nine of the 50 samples tested positive for HEV RNA, with an overall prevalence of 18%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates clustered in different HEV-3 monophyletic groups depending on the sampling county. This is the first study to indicate the presence of HEV in the wild boar population from Romania based on molecular analysis.

1683,The basis of arbovirus classification,"The group of biologically defined arboviruses includes more than 300 individual viruses, divided into about 40 serological groups on the basis of antigenic cross-reactivity. More than three-quarters of all arboviruses can be placed in one of the five main taxonomic types based on the virion's fundamental characteristics: alphavirus, flavivirus, orbivirus, rhabdovirus, bunyavirus. There are 20 alphaviruses representing serological Group A and 57 flaviviruses in serological Group B; These two genera belong to the Togaviridae family. 40 orbiviruses in the Reoviridae family contain 8 serological groups, and 8 rhabdoviruses in the Rhabdoviridae family contain 3 more groups. About 160 bunyaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, can be divided into 20 serological groups, 10 of which show intragroup cross-reactions in the supergroup Bunyamwera. An arbovirus contains DNA, ie African swine fever virus; it is classified as an Iridovirus or icosahedral cytoplasmic deoxyvirus. Nodamura virus, classified as a picornavirus, should be reclassified based on evidence that it has a fragmented genome. A number of arboviruses remain taxonomically unclassified. It is of interest that there are no representatives of arboviruses in several main genera, such as adenoviruses and myxoviruses.",,"Porterfield, J. S.",1975.0,,,0
1684,Systemic virus distribution and host responses in the brain and intestines of chickens infected with low pathogenic or highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.,"Background: Avian influenza virus (AIV) is classified into two pathotypes, low pathogenic (LP) and highly pathogenic (HP), based on virulence in chickens. The differences in pathogenicity between HPAIV and LPAIV may ultimately be related to the specific characteristics of the strains, tissue. tropism and host responses. Methods: To examine differences in disease development between HPAIV and LPAIV, we examined the initial appearance and ultimate load of viral RNA in multiple organs, as well as host responses in the brain and intestines of chickens infected with two closely related strains of H7N1 HPAIV or LPAIV. Results: Both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV spread systemically in chickens after a combined intranasal/intratracheal vaccination. In the brain, large differences in viral RNA load and host gene expression were found between H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV-infected chickens. Chicken embryo brain cell culture studies revealed that both HPAIV and LPAIV can infect seeded embryonic brain cells, but LPAIV replication is limited by the absence of essential proteases. Furthermore, the TUNEL test showed apoptosis only in the brain of HPAIV-infected chickens. In the gut where endoproteases that degrade LPAIV HA are present, we found minimal differences in the amount of viral RNA and a large overlap in transcriptional responses between HPAIV and LPAIV-infected chickens. Interestingly, the brain and ileum were clearly different in cellular pathways regulated by an AI infection. Conclusions: Although both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV RNA have been detected in a wide variety of tissues beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, our observations suggest that differences in pathogenicity and mortality between HPAIV and LPAIV may be due to differences in virus replication and resulting host responses. vital organs such as the brain.",,"Post, J.;Burt, D.

1685,Classical swine fever virus isolates from Cuba generate a new subgenotype 1.4,"The identification and classification of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) based on nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has become an important tool for studying epidemiology and controlling CSF disease. According to phylogenetic analyzes of short sequences from the 5' untranslated region (150nt) and E2 (190nt), most CSFV isolates from South and Central America are classified into subgenotypes 1.1 and 1.3, while CSFV isolates from Cuba are sub-genotype 1.2. Here we show that identification and comparison of full-length E2 sequences as well as sequences encoding Npro, C, Erns, E1 and E2 (3361nt) do not support the separation of Cuban CSFV isolates into subgenotype 1.2. In fact, our analysis revealed that the Cuban isolates differed from other CSFV subgenotype 1 isolates so far known, forming a new distinct subgenotype proposed to be designated subgenotype 1.4. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Postel, A.;Schmeiser, S.;Perera, C.

1687,Cowpea mosaic virus: effects on host cell processes,"SUMMARY Taxonomy: Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a type member of Comoviridae and shows a strong similarity to animal picornaviruses both in gene organization and amino acid sequence of replication proteins. Few systematic studies have been done to compare virus isolates from different parts of the world. Physical properties: Purified virus preparations contain three centrifugal components; empty protein shells without RNA (T) and two nucleoprotein components (M and B) containing 24% and 34% RNA, respectively. The icosahedral particles have a diameter of 28 nm, consist of 60 copies of a double protein and are heat stable. Hosts: CPMV causes one of the most commonly reported cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) viral diseases, in which it produces widely circumscribed chlorotic spots on inoculated primary leaves. Trifoliate leaves develop a bright yellow or light green mosaic of increasing severity on young leaves. The host range is very limited and few hosts are known apart from Leguminosae. The virus is transmitted by various insects that bite the mouthparts. It has been reported in Africa, the Philippines, and Iran. Apparently not in North and South America.

1688,Development of epitope-blocking ELISA for universal detection of antibodies against human H5N1 influenza viruses,"Background: Human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have generally been confirmed by molecular amplification or culture-based methods. Serological surveillance has potential unrealized advantages as rapid and specific serological tests to detect H5N1 infection are not widely available. Methodology/Key Findings: Here we describe an epitope-blocking ELISA to detect specific antibodies against H5N1 viruses in human or animal sera. The test is based on a novel monoclonal antibody (5F8) that binds to an epitope containing amino acid residues 274-281 (CNTKCQTP) in the HA1 region of H5 hemagglutinin. Database search analysis of publicly available sequences revealed that this epitope is conserved in 100% of 163 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans. The sensitivity and specificity of the epitope-blocking ELISA for H5N1 was evaluated using chicken antisera for multiple virus strains and other influenza subtypes, as well as serum samples from individuals naturally infected with H5N1 or seasonal influenza viruses. The epitope-blocking ELISA results were compared with the results of the hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays. Antibodies to H5N1 were readily detected in animals immunized by epitope-blocking ELISA or in convalescent human sera, while samples with antibodies to other influenza subtypes gave negative results. The test showed higher sensitivity and specificity compared to HI and microneutralization. Results/Significance: Epitope-blocking ELISA based on a unique 5F8 mAb provided detection of highly sensitive and 100% specific antibodies to H5N1 influenza viruses in human serum.",,"Prabakaran, M.;Ho, H.

1689,Novel hepatitis B virus of cranes with an unexpectedly wide host range,"All hepadnaviruses known so far have a very limited host range, limited to their natural hosts and a few closely related species. This is thought to be mainly due to sequence variation in the large envelope protein and species-specific differences in host components required for virus propagation. Here we report infection of cranes with a novel hepadnavirus, designated CHBV, which has an unexpectedly wide host range and is only distantly evolutionarily related to avihepadnaviruses of related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA, as well as sequencing of cloned viral genomes, shows that CHBV, although different from Ross's goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV), is most closely related and somewhat less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). revealed that. . Phylogenetically, cranes are far from geese and ducks and are most closely related to herons and storks. The naturally occurring hepadnaviruses in the last two species are quite different in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not infect ducks or do so only marginally. In contrast, recombinant CHBV generated from crane sera CHBV and LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as DHBV. This is the first report of a fairly wide host range of an avihepadnavirus. Our data imply the use of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors, unusual host and virus adaptation mechanisms, or differential evolution of host genomes and cellular components essential for virus propagation by DHBV and CHBV.",,"Prassolov, A.;Hohenberg, H.;Kalinina, T.;Schneider, C.;Cova, L.;Krone, O.;FrÃ¶lich, K.;Will, H.;Sirma, H.",2003.0,,10.1128/jvi.77.3.1964-1976.2003,0

Examination of the 5 agents with serum neutralization made it possible to quantify the respective association and dominance characters. When the serological definitions of strains, types and subtypes recommended for FMD viruses are applied to these characters, it is seen that 4 of the agents can be classified within the same antigenic subtype, and the 5th is very close to the other 4. classified as a different subtype in the limit.

1692,Host Response to Probiotics Determined by Nutritional Status of Newborn Mice Infected with Rotavirus,"Objectives: Beneficial microbes and probiotics are promising agents for the prevention and treatment of enteric and diarrheal diseases in children; however, little is known about its mechanisms of action in vivo. We used the neonatal mouse rotavirus diarrhea model to gain insight into how probiotics ameliorate acute gastroenteritis. Methods: Rotavirus-infected mice were treated with 1 of 2 strains of human Lactobacillus reuteri. We assessed gut microbiome composition by 16S metagenomic sequencing, enterocyte migration and proliferation with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and antibody and cytokine concentrations by multiplex analyzes of gut explant cultures. Results: Probiotics reduced diarrhea duration, improved gut histopathology, and increased gut microbiome richness and phylogenetic diversity. The extent of diarrhea reduction by probiotics was strain-specific and influenced by nutritional status. L reuteri DSM 17938 reduced the duration of diarrhea in underweight, normal weight, and overweight pups by 0.1 and 2 days, respectively. The magnitude of the reduction in diarrhea duration is associated with increased enterocyte proliferation and migration. The ATCC PTA 6475 strain reduced the duration of diarrhea by 1 day in all mice without increasing enterocyte proliferation. Both probiotic strains decreased the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein-I alpha and interleukin-I beta, in all animals and increased rotavirus-specific antibodies in all animals except low-weight animals. Body weight also affected the host response to rotavirus in terms of diarrhea duration, enterocyte turnover, and antibody production. Conclusions: These data suggest that probiotic increase in enterocyte proliferation, villus repopulation and virus-specific antibodies can contribute to diarrhea resolution and nutritional status influences host response to both beneficial microbes and pathogens.",,"Preidis, G.

Pigs are one of the main reservoirs of this infection. Sixty pigs aged 4-5 months in a herd in Japan had detectable anti-HEV IgG antibodies, and five (8.3%) of these had ongoing genotype 3 HEV infection. Five HEV strains from viremic pigs shared 98.8%-100% nucleotide identity, and one representative strain (swHE1606845), whose whole genomic sequence was determined in this study, differed 14.1%-19.6% from the reported HEV strains. 14.7%-19.1% of subtypes 3a-3k and other genotype 3 HEV strains whose subtypes have not yet been assigned. swHE1606845 showed a higher nucleotide p-spacing value of â‰¥0.143 with genotype 3 HEV strains of 3a–3k subtypes and â‰¥0.143 with other genotype 3 strains of unassigned subtypes. A SimPlot analysis revealed a lack of recombination events. These results indicate that swHE1606845 is a candidate member of a novel genotype 3 subtype.

The virus is closely related to bovine and ovine adenoviruses while not closely related to other avian adenoviruses. The disease caused by the EDS-76 virus is one of the major problems in the poultry industry that causes great economic losses. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test is accepted as a rapid, reliable and economical diagnostic test for this disease. Nobuto (1967) and Brugh and Beard (1980) reported that blood can be absorbed and dried on filter paper strips without impairing antibody activity. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of whole blood dried on filter paper strips for the quantitative analysis of HI antibodies against the EDS-76 virus.",,"Priya, P.

1696,Analysis of the S1 gene of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) reveals changes in IBV genetic groups circulating in southern Thailand.,"New variants of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produce a range of symptoms and cause global economic losses to the poultry industry. We investigated the S1 glycoprotein of the last 24 IBV isolates from chickens and showed that two dominant genetic groups were circulating in Southern Thailand between 2008 and 2013. Seven IBV variants isolated from 2008 to 2009 clustered in Thailand THA001 group I, while 15 IBV variants isolated from 2009 to 2013 were classified in QX-like group II. In addition, a single isolate from a broiler was categorized as Massachusetts type, and one isolate from one layer belonged to virus type 4/91. Interestingly, both IBV groups I and II were isolated from domestic chickens (62.5%) and caused a range of symptoms. Our results show that QX-like viruses predominated after 2009 and replaced THA001-type viruses. Additionally, domestic chickens may contribute to the epidemiology of IB.",,"Promkuntod, N.;Thongmee, S.;Yoidam, S.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.05.002,0
1697,Wild bird migration along the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: A transmission route for highly pathogenic H5N1.,"Background: Qinghai Lake in central China is at the center of the debate over whether wild birds play a role in the circulation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic in Qinghai Lake killed more than 6,000 migratory birds, including more than 3,000 stick-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 then spread to Europe and Africa and reappeared in wild birds several times along the Central Asian passageway in the following years. Methodology/Key Findings: To better understand the possible involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we examined the movements of stick-headed geese tagged with GPS satellite transmitters in Qinghai Lake regarding virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migration route between Qinghai Lake and Tibet's Lhasa Valley, where 93% of 29 marked geese overwintered. Between 2003 and 2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the majority of which were within the geese's migration route. The spatial and temporal alignment between geese movements and three potential sources of H5N1 virus (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak sites) indicated that there are ample opportunities for virus spread in wintering areas and infection of migratory geese. Their potential as H5N1 vector has been supported by the rapid migratory movements of some geese and the genetic inbreeding of the H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study to compare the phylogenetics of the virus with the spatial ecology of the host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence will be strengthened by additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.",,"Prosser, D.

Two types of lesions were observed in post mortem examination among 1047 birds from two farms in different locations with 5.5% and 34% mortality; tumors in vital organs-liver, spleen, kidney, lung and ovaries, and generalized small nodular tumor in the abdominal cavity. Molecular characterization based on detection of the ICP4 gene demonstrated the presence of Marek's disease virus (MDV) from tissues and cell culture-adapted isolates in Madin Darby Canine Kidney cell lines. Histopathological examination revealed multinucleated immature lymphoid cell infiltration in the organs. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates based on the meq gene showed that the isolates belonged to the cluster I genotype of MDV.

1701,Ecology and age structure of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreak in wild mute swans,"The first epizootic case of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 influenza in wild birds in the UK occurred in 2008 in a population of mute swans that has been the subject of ornithological study for decades. Here we use an innovative combination of ornithological, phylogenetic and immunological approaches to investigate the ecology and age structure of HP H5N1 in nature. We screened samples from swans and waterfowl using PCR and sequenced HP H5N1-positive samples. The origin of the outbreak was investigated by linking bird count data with molecular clock analysis of sampled virus sequences. We used bell recordings to reconstruct the age structure of epidemic deaths and estimated the age distribution of prior exposure to avian influenza. The epidemic mortality rate was low and all HP H5N1-positive mute swans in the affected population were <3 years old. Only the youngest age classes included a significant number of individuals with no detectable antibody response to the viral nucleoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the epidemic strain circulated locally ~1 month before detection and reached the time when the migration rate of migratory waterfowl was at its highest. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that HP H5N1 epizootics in wild swans exhibit limited mortality due to immune protection from previous exposure. Our study population can be a valuable resource for investigating the natural ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza.",,"Pybus, O. G.;Perrins, C. M.;Choudhury, B.;Manvell, R.

1702,Molecular characterization of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza a virus isolated from raccoon dogs in China.,"Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus can infect a variety of animals and poses a persistent threat to animal and human health. While many genotypes of the H5N1 virus can be found in chicken, few are associated with infection of mammals. Characterization of genotypes of viral strains in animal populations is important for understanding the distribution of different viral strains in various hosts. It also facilitates the monitoring and detection of the possible emergence of highly pathogenic strains of certain genotypes from unknown hosts or hosts that have not previously been reported to carry these genotypes. Methodology/Basic Findings: Two H5N1 isolates were obtained from lung samples of two raccoon dogs who died of respiratory disease in China. Pathogenicity experiments have shown that the isolates are highly pathogenic to chicken. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, their genomic sequences were determined and analyzed. The genetic contents of these isolates are almost identical and may come from the same progenitor virus. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that the isolates are genetically closely related to the genotype V H5N1 virus, first isolated in China in 2003, and differ from the dominant virus genotypes (eg, genotype Z) of recent years. The isolates also contain a multibasic amino acid motif at HA cleavage sites and have an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein, similar to previously identified avian viruses. Consequences/Significance: This is the first report that genotype V H5N1 virus has been found to be associated with a mammalian host. Our results strongly suggest that genotype V H5N1 virus has the ability to cross species barriers to infect mammals. These findings further highlight the risk posed by the avian influenza H5N1 virus to mammals and humans who may be infected by specific genotypes not known to infect these hosts.

In addition, phylogenetic analysis confirmed that each of the eight genes of the isolates are closely related to classical porcine H1N1 viruses, particularly those isolated in China. The HA1 proteins of the three isolates were identical to that of A/Swine/Guangdong/1/01, a virus isolated in China in 2001, although three nucleotide differences were observed.

1704,MicroRNA expression profile of goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to Peste des petits ruminant virus infection,"Peste des petits ruminant virus (PPRV) belongs to the Morbillivirus genus, which causes an acute and highly contagious disease in goats and sheep. Virus infection can trigger change in the cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which plays important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we used deep sequencing technology to determine the cellular miRNA expression profile in goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) infected with Nigeria 75/1 vaccinia virus, a widely used vaccine strain for mass vaccination programs against Peste des petits ruminants. Expression analysis showed that PPRV infection was able to elicit 316 significantly differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, including 103 known and 213 novel miRNA candidates, in infected PBMC at 24 h post infection (hpi) compared to a mock control. Target prediction and functional analysis of this DEmiRNA revealed significant enrichment for a variety of signaling pathways, including TLR signaling pathways, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, viral carcinogenesis, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways.

1705,Identification of genes critical for resistance to infection by West Nile virus using RNA-Seq analysis,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a new infection that raises biodefense concern, and there are no treatments or vaccines available. Here, we used a high-throughput method based on a novel gene expression analysis (RNA-Seq) to give a global picture of differential gene expression by primary human macrophages of 10 healthy donors infected with WNV in vitro. From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1,514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel gene changes, such as gene isoforms, were detected, and while most genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Knockdown of genes not previously known to be associated with WNV resistance defined their critical role in controlling viral infection. Our work distinguishes both common gene pathways and novel cellular responses.

Structure-based sequence alignment of the glycoproteins of these two SPMVs showed that they were essentially similar in structure and function to parainfluenzaviruses. The Texas-81 strain was closely related to the BPIV3 Shipping Fever (SF) strain at the nucleotide and amino acid level, while the ISU-92 strain was more closely related to the BPIV3 910N strain. The envelope glycoproteins of ISU-92 had only ~92 and ~96% identity with strain BPIV3-SF at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. High sequence identities for BPIV3 indicated interspecies infection in pigs.

To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 piglets affected by PRDC were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and de novo splicing, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified by metagenomics in two pooled samples, but most viruses are composed of small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque tenosus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC.

Primers and probes are designed to amplify the NS and M genes of influenza A viruses, the HA gene of H1, H3, H5, H7, H9 subtypes, and the NA gene of N1 and N2 subtypes. Universal super primers were introduced to generate a multiplex RT-PCR (GM RT-PCR). This included three steps of RT-PCR amplification, and then the RT-PCR products were further tested by the LiquiChip probe, which was combined to yield an influenza virus (IV) rapid high-throughput subtyping test called GMPLex.

High-throughput sequencing followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and bioinformatics analyzes was performed to advance the understanding of the regulatory networks associated with differentially expressed non-coding RNAs and mRNAs that facilitate ALV-J infection. We examined the expression of mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and miRNAs in the spleens of ALV-J-infected 20-week-old chickens and uninfected chickens. We found that 1723 mRNAs, 7,883 lncRNAs and 13 miRNAs in the spleen were differentially expressed between uninfected and infected groups (P < 0.05). Transcript analysis showed that compared with mRNA, chicken lncRNAs share relatively less exon numbers and shorter transcripts. Through competing endogenous RNA and co-expression network analyses, we identified several tumor-associated or immune-related genes and lncRNAs. BCL11B showed the greatest change across transcripts, whose expression levels were significantly reduced in both ALV-J-infected spleen and tumor tissues. These results suggest that BCL11B may be mechanically involved in tumorigenesis in chicken and neoplastic diseases, be associated with immune response, and potentially be a novel biomarker for ALV-J infection.

1714,Evolutionary genomics of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses (pH1N 1v),"Background: In April 2009, a new strain of human H1N1 influenza A viruses emerged, causing a worldwide pandemic emergency. This study attempts to estimate the temporal reclassification history of 2009 H1N1 viruses through phylogenetic analysis based on a total of 394 H1N1virus sequences isolated from pigs, humans and birds. Results: Phylogenetic trees of eight gene segments showed that viruses sampled from human constituted a well-supported segment, whereas pig and avian lineages were intermixed. A new divergence porcine subset was characterized, containing gene segments of 2009 H1N1 viruses closely related to porcine viruses collected in six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) from the USA and South Korea between 2004-2007 and 2004-2005. to swine viruses isolated from Thailand in NA and M. Substitution rates varied widely among the eight segments, and the mean substitution rate was generally higher in 2009 H1N1 than in porcine and human viruses (F 2.23= 5.972, P < 0.01). Similarly, higher rates of dN/dS substitution were detected in 2009 H1N1 than in porcine and human viruses except for the M2 gene (F2, 25= 3.779, P < 0.05). The 2009 H1N1 viruses were estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.5 years old, while their most closely related swine viruses had a common ancestor 9.3 to 17.37 years ago. Conclusion: Our results implied that at least four reclassifications or transmissions probably occurred prior to 2009 H1N1 viruses. The first reclassification appeared in 1976, and bird-like Eurasian swine viruses appeared. The second transmission occurred in Asia and North America between 1988 and 1992 and mostly affected six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS). The third reassortment occurred between 1998-2000 between North American pig and avian viruses containing the PB2 and PA segments. Recent reclassifications have occurred between avian-to-swine reassortant, Eurasian and classical swine viruses between 2004 and 2005. South Korea, Thailand and the USA were identified as the most likely places for reclassifications.

1715,The complex microbiota of raw milk,"Here we review what is known about microorganisms found in raw milk, including cow, sheep, goat and human milk. Milk can support a rich microbiota due to its high nutrient content. These microorganisms enter the milk from a variety of sources, and once in the milk, they can be used to facilitate milk fermentations (e.g. Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and fungal populations), cause spoilage (e.g. and other spore-forming or thermoduric microorganisms), health-promoting (e.g. lactobacillus) and bifidobacteria) or cause disease (for example, Listeria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and mycotoxin-producing fungi). There is also concern that the presence of antibiotic residues in milk leads to the development of resistance, especially among pathogenic bacteria. Here, we comprehensively review these issues as we compare both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches that can be taken to investigate the microbial composition of milk.

1716,Direct high-throughput in Cell-ELISA to measure infectivity of cytopathic and non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus strains applied to the evaluation of antiviral activity,"Screening of antiviral compounds against multiple site strains requires low-cost, high-throughput methods applicable to any virus strain. Colorimetric cell viability assays are used for this purpose as long as the viruses are cytopathic (CP) in cell culture. However, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strains circulating in the field are mostly non-cytopathic (NCP). An In Cell-ELISA has been developed that aims to measure viral infectivity by detecting a conserved protein (nonstructural protein 3, ""NS3"") produced during viral replication. ELISA is performed directly on the 96-well culture plate without harvesting the cells. The NS3 In Cell-ELISA was tested for its ability to assess the BVDV-specific antiviral activity of recombinant bovine type I and III IFNs. Results correlate with those measured by qRT-PCR and virus titration. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was also effective in predicting the IC50 of two compounds with different antiviral activity. Estimation of 50% inhibition dose of each IFN using six BVDV strains from different biotypes and genotypes showed that CP strains were more sensitive to both IFNs than NCP, while type 2 NCP viruses were more sensitive to IFN-I. Using a detector antibody against a conserved nonstructural protein, the In Cell-ELISA format is potentially applicable to accurately measure the infectivity of any viral strain.",,"Quintana, M.

1717,Genome Dynamics and Molecular Infection Epidemiology of Multidrug-Resistant Helicobacter pullorum Isolates from Broiler and Free Range Chickens in India.,"Some life-threatening, foodborne and zoonotic infections are transmitted through poultry. Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry has resulted in an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here, we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis requiring phenotypic and whole genome sequencing-based characterization of 11 H. pullorum isolates from broiler and free-range chickens sampled from retail wet markets in Hyderabad, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that all isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotic classes such as fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The isolates were also found to be broad-spectrum producers of Î²-lactamases and even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five or six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding a resistance-nodulation-splitting efflux pump(s). Phylogenetic analysis combined with pan-genome analysis revealed a remarkable genetic diversity among isolates from free-range chickens; in contrast, a high degree of genetic similarity was observed among broiler isolates. Comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available H. pullorum genomes, including our isolates (n = 16), together with the genomes of 17 other Helicobacter species, revealed a high number of (8,560) H. pullorum-specific protein-coding genes. an average of 535 such genes per isolate. In silico virulence screening identified 182 important virulence genes and also revealed higher strain-specific gene content in isolates from free-range chickens (mean, 34) compared to broiler chicken isolates. A significant prevalence of prophage (range 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in free-range and broiler isolates. Taken together, these observations provide important fundamental data for functional molecular epidemiology of infection by revealing the evolution of non-pyloric Helicobacter species such as H. pullorum in chickens and their possible zoonotic transmission to humans. IMPORTANCE: The poultry industry is expanding globally with an ever-growing consumer base for chicken meat. Given this, food-associated transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents an important healthcare challenge. Our study includes a critical fundamental approach to the genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of H. pullorum, a poultry pathogen with zoonotic potential. We believe our work will facilitate the development of surveillance systems that ensure food safety for humans and guide public health policies regarding the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries such as India. As part of this study, we sequenced 11 novel H. pullorum genomes. These genomes will add much value to the ongoing comparative genomic studies of helicobacteria.",,"Qumar, S.;Majid, M.;Kumar, N.;Tiwari, S.

This and other primers failed to detect papillomavirus in bovine mammary wart samples despite repeated attempts. DNase-SISPA, a metagenomic method for identifying viruses, can identify bovine papilloma virus type 10 in bovine mammary warts. Sequence comparison between consensus primers and bovine papilloma virus type 10 sequences revealed many differences between consensus primers and BPV-10 sequences.

1719,A review of psittacine beak and feather disease and its impact on Australia's endangered species,"BACKGROUND: Since it was first described in the early 1980s, psittasine beak and feather disease (PBFD) has been recognized as the predominant viral pathogen of psittasine birds in Australia. Our aim was to evaluate and review the impact of PBFD and its position as a significant threatening process to Australian psittacine bird species. We review the origin/evolutionary pathways and potential threat of PBFD to endangered psittasine bird populations and captive breeding flocks. CONCLUSIONS: The latest beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) phylogenetic analyzes indicate that all endangered Australian psittacine avian species are susceptible to and equally likely to be infected with BFDV genotypes from a range of host psittacine species. Disease management in captive breeding programs relied on testing and culling, which proved costly. The risk of PBFD should be very carefully evaluated by management teams considering the establishment of captive breeding herds for endangered species. Alternative disease prevention tools, including vaccination, which are increasingly used in wildlife health, should be more seriously considered to manage and prevent PBFD in captive herds of critically endangered species.",,"Raidal, S.

1720,Functional characterization of a novel holin-like antibacterial protein-encoding gene tmp1 from the goat skin surface metagenome.,"We identified a holin-like gene from the goat skin surface metagenome. The ORF encoded for 34 amino acids shared sequence similarity with putative holin-like toxin genes. To analyze the antibacterial activity of the tmp1 encoded protein, this ORF was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expressed gene product Tmp1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria. A single transmembrane domain (TMD) was identified within Tmp1, and analysis of the N-terminal region and deletion of TMD showed that TMD was responsible for antibacterial activity. TMD-dependent antibacterial activity was confirmed using a synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of TMD. Besides the antibacterial activity, Tmp1 also complemented the function of holin in the lysis-defective bacteriophage lambda. To broaden the spectrum of antibacterial activity, a mutant tmp1 library was constructed by random mutagenesis. Four mutants with amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of Tmp1 exhibited increased antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and were not hemolytic. An enhanced activity of these mutant proteins is attributed to their increased hydrophobicity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"Rajesh, T.;Anthony, T.;Saranya, S.;Pushpam, P.

1721,Sequence analysis of infectious bursal disease virus isolates from India: Phylogenetic relationships.,"The prevalence of infectious bursal disease (IBD) among chickens in different regions of Tamil Nadu, India was studied by collecting bursal samples from suspected flocks and performing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplification of a particular product. 474 bp from the variable region of the VP2 gene. A positive reaction was seen in 40 of the 53 bursal specimens examined by RT-PCR. The amplified products were subjected to nucleotide sequencing and the resulting sequences were compared with IBD virus (IBDV) vaccine strain Georgia, classical lethal strain 52/70, and Japanese multi-lethal OCIM strain. Nucleotide homology data showed that all Tamil Nadu isolates showed between 91% and 99.6% homology among themselves. Four isolates were grouped with this strain as compared to the highly virulent Japanese OCIM strain. Most of the isolates clustered with the very virulent OCIM strain as evident from the phylogenetic analysis performed using the MEGA program. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of IBDV isolates with Georgia vaccine strain, classical virulent strain 52/70, and very virulent OCIM strain also revealed the presence of conserved serine-rich heptapeptide sequence in most isolates. The results of this study show that most of the IBDV isolates are very virulent; this is evident from the high mortality rates reported in a few poultry flocks despite regular vaccination.",,"Ramadass, P.;Thiagarajan, V.;Parthiban, M.;Senthil Kumar, T.

Based on the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of viral DNA, BoHV1 can be divided into three subtypes such as BoHV1.1, 1.2a and 1.2b. This method is time consuming and labor intensive as it requires pure viral DNA. In the current study, UL0.5 gene-based PCR sequencing was used for subtyping BoHV1. Four of the five isolates had BoHV1-like signatures and one isolate had BoHV1.2-like signatures. Moreover, these viruses are clustered under phylogenetically related subtypes. These results suggest that UL 0.5 gene-based PCR sequencing can be used as an alternative method of subtyping BoHV1.",,"Ramakrishnan, M. A.;Pundkar, C.

1723,Molecular Signature of High Yield (Growth) Influenza A Virus Reassortants Prepared as Candidate Vaccine Seeds,"Background: Human influenza virus isolates generally grow poorly in embryonated chicken eggs. Thus, gene reclassification of influenza A wild-type (wt) viruses is performed with the highly egg-adapted donor virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) to provide high-yield reassortant (HYR) viral 'seeds' for the vaccine. producing. HYR should contain the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of wt virus and one to six 'internal' genes from PR8. Most studies of influenza wt and HYRs have focused on the HA gene. The main objective of this study was to identify the molecular signature in all eight gene segments of the influenza A HYR candidate vaccine seeds associated with egg high growth. 1976 H1N1-SOIV; 2, 2009 H1N1pdm; 2 H2N2 and 12 H3N2) and PR8 were sequenced using a high-throughput sequencing pipeline with large dye terminator chemistry. Results: Silent and coding mutations were found in all internal genes derived from PR8. Except for the M gene. The PR8-derived M gene was invariant in all 23 HYRs, underlining the critical role of PR8 M in the high-yielding phenotype. Except for the PB1 gene in X-157, none of the wt virus-derived internal genes had silent change(s). The highest number of recurrent silent and coding mutations was found in NS. Regarding surface antigens, the majority of HYRs had coding mutations in HA; only 2 HYRs had coding mutations in NA. Significance: In the era of application of reverse genetics to alter influenza A virus genomes, mutations identified in HYR gene segments associated with high growth in egg could be of great practical benefit to modify PR8 and/or wt virus gene sequences for enhanced growth of vaccine 'seed' viruses.

1724,Genetic diversity and mutation of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (Newcastle disease virus) in wild birds and evidence of transcontinental spread,"Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), or Newcastle disease virus, is the causative agent of Newcastle disease, one of the most economically important diseases for poultry production worldwide, and is a cause of periodic epizootics in wild birds in North America. In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of APMV-1 isolated from migratory birds sampled in Alaska, Japan and Russia and evaluated evidence of transcontinental virus spread using phylogenetic methods. In addition, we estimated viral virulence using the deduced amino acid residues for the fusion protein cleavage site and estimated mutation rates for the fusion gene of class I and class II migratory bird isolates. All 73 isolates sequenced as part of this study were most closely related to virus genotypes previously reported for wild birds; however, five class II genotype I isolates formed a monophyletic lineage that exhibited previously unreported genetic diversity and met the criteria for a new subgenotype designation. Phylogenetic analysis of wild bird isolates provided evidence for transcontinental virus spread, particularly viral strains of APMV-1 class II genotype I subgenotypes Ib and Ic. This result supports migratory bird movement as a possible mechanism for APMV-1 redistribution. None of the predicted inferred amino acid motifs for the fusion protein cleavage site of APMV-1 strains isolated from migratory birds in Alaska, Japan, and Russia were consistent with those of previously identified virulent viruses. These data therefore provide no support for these strains contributing to the emergence of avian pathogens. Estimated mutation rates for fusion genes of class I and class II wild bird isolates were faster than those previously reported for non-virulent APMV-1 strains. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the diversity, spread, and evolution of APMV-1 in wild birds.",,"Ramey, A. M.;Reeves, A. B.;Ogawa, H.;Ip, H. S.;Imai, K.;Bui, V.

This coronavirus is widely distributed among laboratories and has been passaged in both pigs and cell culture. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (approximately 28 kb) was performed in 6 different laboratories using different protocols. Not surprisingly, the different whole genome sequences each differed from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511), but were >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest rate of variability, including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more strikingly affected in three different variants of this virus, either by loss of an initiation codon or by gain of an early termination codon.

1734,Metagenomic profiling of ticks: Identification of novel rickettsial genomes and detection of tick-borne canine parvovirus.,"BACKGROUND: All over the world, ticks act as vectors of human and animal pathogens. Ticks often rely on bacterial endosymbiosis, sharing close and complex evolutionary links with tick-borne pathogens. Because the prevalence, diversity, and virulence potential of tick-borne agents are not fully understood, there is an urgent need for microbial surveillance of ticks as potential disease vectors. METHODOLOGY/KEY FINDINGS: We developed a two-step protocol involving 16S-amplicon screening of hard tick samples collected from dogs, sheep and camels in Palestine followed by shotgun metagenomics on individual ticks to detect and characterize tick-borne pathogens and endosymbiosis. Two ticks isolated from sheep yielded abundant reads from the genus Rickettsia, which were assembled into draft genomes. One of the resulting genomes was highly similar to Rickettsia massiliae strain MTU5. Analysis of signature genes showed that the other represented the first genome sequence of the potential pathogen Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae. Ticks from a dog and a sheep provided draft genome sequences of Coxiella strains. A sheep tick yielded sequences from the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis, while Hyalomma ticks from camels yielded sequences from Francisella-like endosymbionts. We have sequenced the genome of a canine parvovirus from the metagenome of a dog tick from Jericho. IMPORTANT: Here we show how a cost-effective two-step protocol can be used to detect and characterize tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. We demonstrate the open-ended nature of metagenomics in recovering genome sequences from an unexpected pathogen (canine parvovirus) and a previously unsequenced pathogen (Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae). Furthermore, by providing evidence that ticks can carry canine parvovirus, we raise the possibility that ticks may contribute to the spread of this troublesome virus.",,"Ravi, A.;Ereqat, S.;Al-Jawabreh, A.;Abdeen, Z.;Abu Shamma, O.;Hall, H.;Pallen, M.

1735,Network extraction from multimodal data: A review of approaches to infectious disease transmission.,"Network inference problems are often found in multiple biomedical subfields such as genomics, metagenomics, neuroscience, and epidemiology. Networks are useful for representing a wide variety of complex interactions, from those between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities to those found in human or animal populations. Recent technological advances have resulted in an increasing amount of healthcare data in multiple modalities, increasing the dominance of network inference problems. Multi-domain data can now be used to improve the robustness and reliability of networks recovered from single-mode data. Especially for infectious diseases, there is a body of knowledge that focuses on combining multiple linked information. Combining or analyzing disparate modalities has shown greater insight into disease transmission than could be obtained from any single modality alone. This has been helpful in understanding the incidence and transmission, especially in the early stages of potentially pandemic infections. New linked pieces of information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other covariates, including high-throughput sequence data, clinical visits, social networking information, medication prescriptions, and clinical symptoms (reported as free-text data), also spur further exploration of these. methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods with a particular focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on methods based on analytical Bayesian inference, because it allows simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters, for example, not only the disease transmission network, but also the parameters of epidemic dynamics. Our review examines its assumptions, key inference parameters and limitations, and ultimately provides insights into improving future network inference methods in multiple applications.",,"Ray, B.;Ghedin, E.;Chunara, R.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.jbi.2016.09.004,0

Hydrothermal vent systems are oases of biological activity in the deep oceans where biodiversity and its impact on the global ocean biogeochemical cycle are still in their infancy. To gain a biological perspective on viral communities found in hydrothermal vent systems, we developed a method based on deep sequencing of pulsed field gel electrophoretic bands representing significant viral fractions found in and surrounding seawater in a hydrothermal cloud derived from the Loki's Castle vent area. Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. The reduction in virus assembly complexity afforded by this new approach allowed an almost complete reconstitution of a lambda-like phage genome from the virus fraction of the feather. Phylogenetic examination of different gene regions in this lambdoid phage genome revealed diversity at loci encoding superinfection exclusion and integrase-like proteins. This highlights the importance of fine-tuning lyosgenic conversion as a viral survival strategy and provides insight into the nature of host-virus and virus-virus interactions within hydrothermal plumes. By reducing the complexity of the viral community through targeted sequencing of prominent dsDNA viral fractions, this method selectively mimicked virus dominance approaching that hitherto achieved only by culturing, enabling bioinformatic analysis to find a lambdoid viral ""needle"" within the larger viral community. barn"". Such targeted analyzes have great potential to accelerate the extraction of biological information from diverse and poorly understood environmental viral communities.

1737,Pig sapelovirus among diarrheal piglets in India,"Porcine sapelovirus (PSV) A belongs to the Sapelovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. PSV infections in pigs have been reported from European countries, the United States, Japan, China, Korea, and Brazil. The virus has been isolated/detected in the feces of healthy pigs as well as those affected by diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, encephalitis, skin lesions and fertility disorders. This study was planned to investigate whether PSV is prevalent among pigs in India and to characterize PSV encountered in the study population. The study revealed that five (7.14%) of 70 stool samples were positive for PSV using RT-PCR. Three viruses were successfully isolated from fecal samples using the IB-RS-2 cell line. Complete genome sequencing and analysis of an Indian PSV isolate revealed the highest homology (88%) with strain V13 from the UK. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete polyprotein nucleotide sequences of 14 strains of PSV classified the viruses into four distinct clades. This initial report from India adds to our knowledge of the genetic diversity of PSV detected so far among pigs in different countries.

1739,Comparison between Transcriptome Sequencing and 16S Metagenomics for Detection of Bacterial Pathogens in Wildlife,"Background Rodents are the main reservoirs of pathogens responsible for numerous zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock. Assessing their microbial diversity at both the individual and population level is crucial for monitoring endemic infections and revealing patterns of microbial association in reservoirs. Recently, NGS approaches have been used to characterize microbial communities of different ecosystems. However, their relative effectiveness has not been evaluated. Here, we compared two NGS approaches, RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S-metagenomics, assessing their ability to search for neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations. Methodology/Basic Findings We first extracted nucleic acids from the spleen of 190 voles collected in France. RNA extracts were pooled, randomly retro-transcribed, followed by RNA-Seq using HiSeq. Concatenated bacterial sequences were assigned to the closest taxa registered in GenBank. DNA extracts were analyzed with a 16S-metagenomy approach using two sequencers: 454 GS-FLX and MiSeq. The V4 region of the gene encoding 16S rRNA was amplified for each sample using barcoded universal primers. Amplicons were multiplexed and processed on different sequencers. The resulting datasets were demultiplexed and each read was processed through a pipeline to be taxonomically classified using the Ribosomal Database Project. In total, 45 genera of pathogenic bacteria were detected. Bacteria identified by RNA-Seq were comparable to those detected by the 16S-metagenomics approach processed with MiSeq (16S-MiSeq). In contrast, 21 of these pathogens went undetected when the 16S-metagenomics approach was processed via 454-pyrosequencing (16S-454). In addition, 16S-metagenomics approaches revealed high levels of coinfection in bank voles. Conclusions/Importance We conclude that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in detecting bacteria. Although only the 16S-MiSeq method enables the identification of bacteria in each reservoir, the subsequent derivation of bacterial prevalence in host populations and establishment of intra-reservoir models of bacterial interactions. Finally, the number of bacterial reads obtained with 16S-MiSeq can be a good proxy for bacterial prevalence.",,"Razzauti, M.;Galan, M.;Bernard, M.;Maman, S.;Klopp, C.;Charbonnel, N.;Vayssier-Taussat, M.;Eloit, M.;Cosson, J.

1740,Information on resistome and stress response genes in Bubalus bubalis rumen through metagenomic analysis,"The buffalo rumen microbiota inhabits a diverse diet and represents a large reservoir of mobileom, resistome, and stress responses. However, knowledge of metagenomic responses to such conditions is still rudimentary. We analyzed metagenomes of buffalo rumen in liquid and solid phase of rumen biomaterial from river buffalo adapted at varying rates from concentrate to green or dry roughage, using high-throughput sequencing to know the genesis of antibiotic resistance genes, genetic exchange between bacteria. population and environmental reservoirs. A total of 3914.94 MB of data were generated from all three treatment groups. Data were analyzed with the Metagenome rapid annotation system tools. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes was dominant in all treatments followed by Firmicutes. Genes encoding functional responses to stress (oxidative stress and heat shock proteins) and resistome genes (resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, phages, transposable elements and pathogenicity islands) were similarly common in the liquid and solid fraction of rumen metagenomes. Fluoroquinolone resistance, MDR efflux pumps, and Methicillin resistance genes were widely distributed in 11, 9, and 14 bacterial classes, respectively. Bacteria responsible for phage replication and prophages and phage packaging and rlt-like streptococcal phage genes have mostly been assigned to the phyla Bacteroides, Firmicutes and proteaobacteria. Also, more reads matching sigma B genes were detected in the buffalo rumen. This study highlights the existence of various adaptation mechanisms to different diet, antibiotics and other stresses in buffalo rumen, reflecting the proportional representation of major bacterial groups.",,"Reddy, B.;Singh, K.

1741,Molecular characterization of Indian rabies virus isolates by partial sequencing of nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes.,"Rabies is endemic and is an important zoonosis in India. Few reports exist on the molecular epidemiology of the Indian rabies virus. To know the dynamics of rabies virus in this study, a total of 41 rabies positive brain samples from 11 states from dogs, cats, pets, wildlife and humans were subjected to RT-PCR amplification of the N gene between nucleotides N521-N1262 (742 bp) and nucleotide P239- The P gene between P750 (512 bp). The N gene can be amplified from 30 samples, while the P gene can be amplified from 41 samples using specific primer sets. Phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene showed that all Indian virus isolates are genetically closely related to a single cluster under arctic/arctic-like viruses. However, two different clusters of P gene-based phylogeny i.e. Rabies virus isolates of Punjab and Rabies virus isolates of the rest of India (outside Punjab) were performed.

1742,Genetic Characterization of Belgian Nephropathogenic Infectious Bronchitis Virus (NIBV) Reference Strain B1648,"Virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) strain B1648 was first isolated in 1984 in Flanders, Belgium. Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants still circulate in Europe and North Africa. Here, the full-length genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other IBV strains and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in strain B1648 (51UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-31UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in the literature, were present in B1648 and most other IBV complete genomes. Based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein clustered with non-Massachusetts-like type strains B1648 NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA/90254/2005, QX-like CK /SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 was clustered with strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and was also named genotype B1648. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%), and the least with reference Beaudette and Massachusetts (89%, 7) was associated. . Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyzes indicated that strain B1648 may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. In addition, nephropathogenicity markers may be located on 1a, spike, M and helper proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b).

1744,Monitoring the antigenic evolution of the foot-and-mouth disease virus,"Measuring and predicting the antigenic properties of a virus is the holy grail for infectious disease research due to the emergence of new strains, the severity of epidemics, and its central importance in vaccine selection. However, these traits are defined by the complex interplay of viral and host factors, so phylogenetic measures of viral similarity are often weakly correlated with antigenic relationships. Here, we generate antigenic phylogenies that follow the phenotypic evolution of two serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus by combining host serology and viral sequence data to identify regions critical for their antigenic evolution. For the SAT1 serotype, we validate our antigenic phylogeny against monoclonal antibody escape mutants that match all predicted antigenic sites. For the O serotype, we validate against known sites whenever possible and otherwise directly evaluate the effect of substitutions at predicted sites on the antigenic phenotype using reverse genetics and serology. We also highlight a critical and poorly understood issue for vaccine selection by revealing qualitative differences between tests that are often used interchangeably to determine antigenic matching between field viruses and vaccine strains. Our approach provides a means to identify naturally occurring antigenic substitutions, allowing us to monitor the genetic diversity of the virus and its associated antigenic evolution. Despite the crucial role that vaccines play in promoting human and animal health, vaccinology remains a distinctly empirical science. This work advances the field by providing guidance for tuning vaccine strains through site-directed mutagenesis through this high-resolution tracking of the antigenic evolution of the virus amid rare major shifts in phenotype.",,"Reeve, R.;Borley, D.

1746,Beak and feather disease viruses circulating in Cape parrots (Poicepahlus robustus) in South Africa,"Captive and wild psittacines are vulnerable to the highly contagious psittacin beak and feather disease. The causative agent, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), was recently detected in the largest remaining population of the endemic Cape parrot (Poicepahlus robustus) endemic to South Africa. Full-length genomes were isolated and sequenced from 26 blood samples collected from wild and captive Cape parrots to identify possible origins of infection. All sequences had characteristic BFDV sequence motifs and were similar in length to those described in the literature. However, the BFDV coat protein (CP) sequences from this study did not contain a predefined bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within residues 39-56; this indicates that an alternative NLS is involved in sending the CP to the nucleus. Sequences from the wild population shared a high degree of similarity regardless of year or location, suggesting that the disease outbreak occurred close to the time the samples were collected. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes showed that captive Cape parrot sequences clustered with those isolated from captive-bred budgerigars in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Exposure to captive-bred Cape parrots from a breeding facility in KwaZulu-Natal has been suggested as a possible source for virus infection. Phylogenetic analysis of BFDV isolates from wild and captive Cape parrots showed two distinct events of infection in different populations, highlighting the potential risk of introducing new strains of the virus into the wild population. This study represents the first systematic investigation of BFDV virus diversity in the southernmost population of Cape parrots.",,"Regnard, G. L.;Boyes, R. S.;Martin, R. O.;Hitzeroth, I.

1747,Detection of non-notifiable H4N6 avian influenza virus in poultry in Great Britain,"12-month pilot project for notifiable avian disease (NAD) exclusion testing in chicken and turkey flocks in Great Britain (United Kingdom), in partnership with industry, offered opportunities for differential diagnosis and diagnosis in flocks where NAD is not suspected. Undetected or undiagnosed infections. In May 2014, clinical samples from a broiler breeder plant that had been experiencing health and production problems for about a week tested positive by avian influenza (AI) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR). A non-notifiable H4N6 low pathogenicity (LP) AIV was detected by isolation of embryo-specific pathogen-free (SPF) virus, following prompt escalation to a formal, regulatory investigation to rule out the presence of the notifiable AI virus (AIV; H5 or H7 subtypes). ) poultry eggs, neuraminidase inhibition test, cleavage site sequencing, and AIV subtype H4-specific serology. Building movement restrictions have been lifted and no other disease control measures have been implemented under UK (UK) legislation. Phylogenetic analysis of the virus's hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes revealed the closest relationships to viruses in Swedish mallard ducks in 2007 and 2009. In June 2014, clinical suspicion of NAD was reported in a flock of free-range chickens elsewhere in England. increased daily mortality and decreased egg production over a five-day period. An H4N6 LPAIV with an intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.50 was isolated. This virus was genetically quite similar to the virus detected in May 2014, but not identical. Whole viral genome analyzes showed characteristics of a strain not recently transferred from wild birds, implying that spread within the poultry sector has occurred. A stem deletion in the neuraminidase gene sequence indicated the adaptation of the virus to poultry. Also, there was unexpected evidence of systemic spread of the virus at autopsy.

1749,"Faustovirus, a new giant virus strain related to the asfarvirus that infects amoebae","Giant viruses are protist-associated viruses belonging to the proposed order Megavirales; almost entirely isolated from Acanthamoeba spp. Their isolation in humans suggests that they are part of the human virome. Using a high-throughput strategy to isolate novel giant viruses from their original protozoan hosts, we obtained eight isolates of the novel giant viral strain from Vermamoeba vermiformis, the most common free-living protist found in human environments. This new strain was proposed as the faustovirus strain. The prototype member, faustovirus E12, forms icosahedral virions of 200 nm - devoid of fibrils and enclosing a 466 kbp genome encoding 451 predicted proteins. Of these, 164 are found in the virion. Phylogenetic analysis of core viral genes showed that faustovirus is distantly related to the mammalian pathogen African swine fever virus, but encodes â‰ˆ 3 times more mosaic gene complements. About two-thirds of these genes do not show significant similarity to any known protein-coding genes. These findings suggest that expanding the panel of protists to discover new giant viruses is an efficient strategy. IMPORTANT Using Vermamoeba, a protist living in humans and their environment, we isolated eight strains of a new giant virus we call faustovirus. The genomes of these strains were sequenced and their sequences showed that faustoviruses are related but distinct from the vertebrate pathogen African swine fever virus (ASFV) belonging to the Asfarviridae family. Furthermore, the faustovirus gene repertoire is 3 times larger than that of ASFV and includes about two-thirds ORFan (open reading frames [ORFs] with detectable homology to other ORFs in the database).",,"Reteno, D.

1750,Hepatitis C virus/classic swine fever virus chimeric 5–²NTR analysis: Sequences in the hepatitis C virus IRES are required for viral RNA replication,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is classified in the genus Hepacivirus of the family Flaviviridae, whose members have a positive polarity single-stranded RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein. Within this family, HCV is closely related to viruses of the genus Pestivirus, which includes the classic swine fever virus (CSFV). Translation of hepaci- and pestiviral polyprotein is initiated by internal entry of ribosomes supported by 5–²NTR. The secondary and tertiary RNA structures of HCV and pestivirus 5–²NTRs are well conserved, despite their significantly different sequences. Similar to other positive-stranded RNA viruses, the 5–2NTR of HCV is likely to contain cis-acting determinants for replication as well as for translation. Because these signals can overlap, work on both signals can be complicated. In this study, this issue was addressed by generating chimeric HCV/CSFV 5–²NTRs. A two-step analysis of these 5–2NTRs was carried out: (a) in a translation analysis that provided the opportunity to examine translation independently of possible effects on transcription; and (b) in a replication analysis studying chimeric 5–²NTRs showing only IRES-dependent translation. An overlap was observed between the HCV RNA elements involved in these processes. Exchange of domain II had a minor effect on the translation efficiency of chimeric 5–²NTRs, whereas subgenomic replicons were abolished with these chimeric 5–2NTRs. Alteration of domain III subdomains severely reduced replication efficiency, while replication was preserved.",,"Reusken, C. B. E.;Dalebout, T. J.;Eerligh, P.;Bredenbeek, P. J.;Spaan, W. J.

However, it has recently been shown that human infection can occur in developed countries without any travel history, and the pig can act as a reservoir. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the hepatitis E virus by molecular methods and to determine the viral genetic relationship with known HEV strains in a patient with acute non-AC hepatitis infection who did not have a recent travel history in Hungary. MATERIALS: Laboratory diagnosis of hepatitis E virus infection was made in patient sera by HEV IgM and IgG ELISA, IgM and IgG immunoblot, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using primers for the partial viral capsid region. RESULTS: A patient with acute hepatitis of unknown origin was treated at Szeged Hospital in June 2004. The acute patient's serum was positive with HEV IgM and IgG was confirmed by immunoblot. The viral genome was successfully amplified in serum by RT-PCR. By sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the virus designated Hungary-1 showed 95% nucleotide identity to genotype 3 hepatitis E viruses and 90% nucleic acid identity to the human strain due to the highest identity to the porcine HEV strain (Sp354-1-02). (Greece2). CONCLUSION: Hepatitis E virus infection is present in Hungary without traveling to known endemic areas. HEV, first identified in Hungary, representing a new human genetic lineage, supports the possibility of endemic infections caused by genotype 3 strains in developed countries, and the pig may serve as a human HEV reservoir.",,"Reuter, G.;Fodor, D.;Katai, A.;Szucs, G.",2005.0,2020-11-01 00:00:00,,0

The etiologic agent, Borna disease virus (BDV), a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus classified in the novel virus family Bornaviridae within the order Mononegavirales, can induce the severe clinical manifestations of a viral encephalitis typically with striking behavioral disturbances. After an incubation period of several weeks to several months, BDV infection causes locomotor and sensory dysfunctions, followed by paralysis and death. Natural infections appear subclinical in most cases. BD has received worldwide attention when it has been reported that serum and/or cerebrospinal fluids from neuro-psychiatric patients may contain antibodies specific to BDV. Since infected animals produce BDV-specific antibodies only after virus replication, the broad spectrum of BDV-susceptible strains has been hypothesized to include humans. However, reports describing the presence of other BDV markers, namely BDV-RNA or BDV-antigen, in peripheral blood leukocytes or brain tissue of neuro-psychiatric patients are highly controversial, and therefore the role of BDV in human neuro-psychiatric disorders is questionable.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests based on the 5' untranslated region and the genomic region encoding the p125 polypeptide are designed to distinguish between BVDV I and BVDV II. Using these tests, 76 of 140 BVDV isolates were identified as BVDV II. Antigenic and pathological differences were recorded between BVDV I and BVDV II viruses. Among the BVDV I were viruses commonly used in vaccine production, diagnostic testing, and research. BVDV II has been predominantly isolated from fetal bovine serum, from permanently infected cavities born in dams vaccinated against BVDV, and from cattle that died from an acute form of BVDV called the hemorrhagic syndrome.",,"Ridpath, J.

1766,Change in predominance of Bovine viral diarrhea virus subgenotypes among samples sent to a diagnostic laboratory over a 20-year timeframe,"Although the causative agent of bovine viral diarrhea was initially categorized as 1 species, phylogenetic analyzes revealed that these viruses belonged to 2 distinct species: Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) and BVDV-2, with 2-11 subgenotypes within each species. The distribution of species and subgenotypes has been shown to vary by geographic region. It is unknown whether the distribution changes over time. Studies conducted between 1994 and 2008 reported 3 subgenotypes circulating among cattle in the United States: BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a. The mean percent prevalence of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a strains reported in studies prior to 2001 was 21%, 43%, and 36%, respectively. Studies on viruses isolated after 2001 reported that the percentages of BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a strains decreased, with BVDV-1b strains accounting for 75-100% of the samples. Comparing these surveys is confusing due to differences in geographic location, collection methods, and the type of sample used in the survey. The aim of this study was to determine whether the prevalence of BVDV subgenotypes changes over time in samples collected from the same geographical region and the same laboratory. BVDV strains isolated in 1988, 1998 and 2008 at Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Amarillo, Texas were genotyped and the prevalence of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b and BVDV-2a strains was determined. Typing was performed on 148 samples based on phylogenetic analysis. The strongest trend detected among these samples was a marked reduction in the number of BVDV-1a strains over time.",,"Ridpath, J.

1767,Isolation and characterization of a novel cervid adenovirus from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a captive herd,"novel adenovirus, CeAdV1, was isolated from buffy coat and nasal swab samples from two captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The isolation was an accidental finding during the screening of animals for use in a research study on an unrelated pathogen. During the screening process, virus isolation was made in both nasal swab and buffy coat samples, and a cytopathic effect was observed. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles with the shape and morphology of an adenovirus. Next-generation sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis classified this virus into the Mastadenovirus genus. Its sequence was genetically distinct from all other recognized species in this genus with only 76% sequence identity to its closest genetic match, bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3). The virus was able to spread in bovine-derived cells, but grew to a higher titer in cypress-derived cells. Vaccination of white-tailed deer with the isolated virus resulted in fever, depletion of thymus tissue, and mild respiratory illness. Comparative serology using convalescent serum revealed significant antigenic differences between the novel cervid adenovirus and BAdV3. Retrospective serological research of a captive deer herd has shown that this virus has been circulating in the herd for at least 14 years without clinical reports of disease. A study of serum collected from free-range mule deer living in Nevada revealed high serum titers against this new adenovirus.",,"Ridpath, J. F.;Neill, J. D.;Palmer, M. V.;Bauermann, F.

1768,Deep sequencing of strains isolated from different hosts and stability of the parainfluenza virus 5 genome upon passage in cell culture.,"UNLABELED: Strain diversity of a rubulavirus, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), was investigated by comparing 11 newly identified and 6 previously published genome sequences. These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 from monkeys, 2 from pigs, and 6 from dogs. Regardless of host, year of isolation or geographical origin, species diversity is very low; 7.8% of total nucleotides are variable and the mean pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. The variation was unevenly distributed throughout the PIV5 genome, but there was no convincing evidence of selection for antibody-mediated avoidance in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. The finding that some strains of dogs and pigs, but not non-primate strains, are mutated in the SH gene and do not produce SH raises the possibility that dogs (or pigs) may not be natural hosts of PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of a strain (W3) in Vero cells under conditions of competition with highly defective interfering genomes. A similar observation was made for a W3 mutant strain (PIV5VDELTAC) lacking V gene function, where the dominant changes were related to pseudoversion in this gene. Mutations detected during pseudoversion in PIV5VDELTAC, as well as those characterizing the SH gene in dog and pig strains, predominantly contained UC transitions. This indicates an important role for biased hypermutation through an adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR)-like activity. IMPORTANT: Here we report sequence variations of 16 different isolates of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) that have been isolated over 40 years from a range of species including humans, monkeys, dogs and pigs. Surprisingly, species diversity was extremely low regardless of host, year of isolation or geographic origin. The variation was unevenly distributed throughout the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of immunity or host selection was found. This overall genome stability of PIV5 was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome remained remarkably stable even during the selection of virus mutants. Some of the dog isolates had lost their ability to encode one of the viral proteins called SH; this suggests that although PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be natural hosts for PIV5.",,"Rima, B.

Except for the H17N10 subtype, which was recently identified in bats, all identified subtypes have been described in wild waterfowl. These birds are considered the natural reservoir of influenzaAviruses, from which some subtypes can infect other bird and mammalian species, including humans. Interspecies transfers appear to occur regularly and can sometimes lead to the adaptation and stable establishment of a new viral lineage in a given species. This review recalls the genetic diversity of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses and focuses on lesser-known influenza A viruses identified in horses, dogs, and more recently bats.

1772,Initial Report of Apple mosaic virus in Alaska,"Apple mosaic virus (ApMV; Bromoviridae family, genus Ilarvirus) is one of the oldest and most economically important viruses of apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.) (1,3). Yield losses can range from negligible to 50% depending on the cultivar affected. Although apMV is found worldwide and occurs naturally in more than 65 plant species (1), it has not been reported to occur in Alaska. In July 2011, distinctly bright yellow mosaic leaves were observed on 'Valentine' apple and rhizome 'Ranetka' from an apple orchard in Wasilla, AK. Leaves were harvested and analyzed with total RNA extracted by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and buffer modifications to the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using ApMV-specific primers (2). Briefly, 50 mg of leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and 450 µl SE buffer (0.14 M NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8 mM). Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O [pH 7.4, 0.05% v/v Tween-20, 2% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 , 0.2% w/v ovalbumin, 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin and 0.05% w/v sodium azide) were added, and after vigorous vortexing, 80 µl of the mixture was added to 400 µl RLT buffer. kit and then processed as specified by the manufacturer (4). Direct sequencing of the predicted ~260-bp PCR product resulted in 97% to 98% nucleotide identity to ApMV accessions in GenBank when analyzed by BLAST. To determine the distribution and incidence of infection in the Wasilla orchard, all 118 apple trees (99 cultivars) were sampled and according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, IN). Apple 'Geneva Early' and the same 'Valentine' tree and rootstock tested positive for ApMV by ELISA and RT-PCR. Strong diagnostic ApMV symptoms were not evident in the infected 'Geneva Early', which is typical for most commercially grown apples. No leaves were found for virus indexing in the 'Ranetka' rootstock of 'Geneva Early' infected with ApMV. An additional 21 asymptomatic apple trees from an orchard in AK Talkeetna tested negative for ApMV by ELISA. Limited natural spread of ApMV to other plants may be via pollen and seed transmission. The most common mode of transmission is from rootstocks and vaccines infected with ApMV. It is important to obtain new propagation plant material from certified virus-tested nurseries and to avoid inoculating plant material containing ApMV. As far as I know, this is the first report of ApMV in Alaska. References: (1) RW Fulton. 83. CMI/AAB Definitions of Plant Viruses. 1972. (2) W. Menzel et al. J. Virol.",,"Robertson, N.

These different studies gave unique names to the identified groups, and no studies have yet integrated all available sequences. Therefore, we hypothesized that most of the different groups identified earlier actually correspond to a limited set of genotypes that are unevenly distributed around the world. To examine this hypothesis, we sequenced env genes from 28 BLV domain types and compared these sequences with 46 env sequences representing all currently identified genetic groupings. Using phylogenetic analyses, we rescued six clades or genotypes, which we named genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. An env sequence did not cluster with any of the others and was quite different compared to the six genotypes described here. Thus, an extra genotype, which we call 7, may exist. Similarity comparisons were in good agreement with phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, our analyzes confirmed the existence of geographic clusters. © 2009 SGM.",,"Rodriguez, S. M.;Golemba, M.

Lymph node samples were obtained from 4 PMWS-affected pigs and 2 healthy animals and processed by transmission electron microscopy. Significant ultrastructural changes were noted only in pigs affected by PMWS, particularly in histiocytes and rarely in other cell types. Histiocytes showed severe swelling and proliferation of mitochondria and proliferation and enlargement of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Infected histiocytes contained multiple intracytoplasmic inclusion (ICI) bodies with VLPs; some histiocytes also had intranuclear inclusions (INIs). Small inclusions were surrounded by a double membrane with a granular appearance or containing paracrystalline arrays; icosahedral VLPs were 8-17 nm in diameter. Large ICIs were or were not confined to the double membrane and often contained VLPs forming paracrystalline arrays. ICIs were often found near and also inside mitochondria with severe swelling. INIs were not membrane-bound and contained virions 10-13 nm in diameter. Lymphocyte depletion was a striking lymph node finding from pigs affected by PMWS. Inclusion bodies containing VLPs referenced in this study should be classified as viral factories, suggesting that viral replication is a frequent event in macrophages, possibly in which mitochondria may play a role.",,"Rodriguez-CariÃ±o, C.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2009.0,,,0

The circulation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 has consistently caused significant economic losses to the Egyptian poultry industry and is a threat to public health. In this report, a strain of HPAI H5N1 (A/chicken/Egypt/Fadllah-7/2014) was identified from a vaccinated flock showing clinical signs of infection. Genetic characterization of the isolate showed a high level of nucleotide identity (95%-98%) with variant and classical groups of H5N1. Furthermore, multiple nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed several distinct and characteristic substitutions in the surface glycoprotein that may be biologically relevant to the pathobiology of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the reported isolate is closely related to subdivision 2.2.1.1 of H5N1 AIVs, although there have been no reports of this subclade since 2011 from cases reported by AI in Egyptian avian species. In conclusion, our results highlight the re-emergence of a new H5N1 AIV variant subdivision 2.2.1.1 that may evade vaccine-induced immunity.

1781,Do the hemagglutinin genes of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses form unique phylogenetic lineages?,"Avian influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes cause periodic outbreaks of severe disease in poultry. The question we wish to address in this study is whether these highly pathogenic strains form unique lineages or whether they and related nonpathogenic viruses are derived from common ancestors in the wild bird reservoir. Therefore, we compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of 15 H5 and 26 H7 influenza A viruses isolated from various host species in Eurasia, Africa, Australia and North America over 91 years. The HA genes of the H5 and H7 viruses that cause severe disease in domestic birds do not form unique lineages but share common ancestors with the nonpathogenic H5 and H7 viruses. These findings predict that highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses will continue to emerge from wild bird reservoirs. Another important question is whether H7 influenza viruses found in mammalian species are derived from avian strains. We included eight equine influenza viruses and one seal isolate in the phylogenetic analysis of the H7 HA genes. We can show that the HA genes of both equine and seal viruses share ancestry with the avian H7 HA genes. This indicates that H7 viruses currently circulating with an avian HA gene may have the potential to adapt to mammalian species and cause an influenza epidemic in the new host.",,"Rohm, C.;Horimoto, T.;Kawaoka, Y.;Suss, J.;Webster, R.

The predominant viral genotypes infecting higher life forms associated with the farm were, for example, disease-causing pathogens in cattle and humans, such as members of the Herpesviridae. The techniques and analyzes described here provide a novel approach to monitoring viral populations in the aquatic environment, with the potential to be integrated into the development of risk analysis tools to monitor the spread of viral agents of animal, plant and human diseases.

1783,"Studies on genetic relationships between bovine, goat, cypress and rangiferin alphaherpes viruses and on molecular methods developed for virus detection and identification","Five ruminant alpha herpes viruses, bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine herpes virus 5 (BHV-5), caprine herpes virus 1 (CapHV-1), servine herpes virus 1 and glycoprotein B (gB) from rangiferin and D (gD) genes herpesvirus 1 were partially sequenced. Nucleotide sequence alignments revealed a highly conserved gB gene with homologies ranging from 87.2% to 99.6% and a more variable gD gene with homologies ranging from 71.3% to 98.9%. Phylogenetic analysis of the gB and gD nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that BHV-5 was the virus most closely related to the BHV-1 subtype 1 and BHV-1 subtype 2 cluster, and CapHV-1 was the most distantly related virus. . Phylogenetic data showed that all viruses studied were closely related to suid herpes virus 1. Based on the sequence data for the gB gene, a nested PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of PCR products for simultaneous detection and identification of the viruses under study. Nested primers from highly conserved sequence extensions were selected to amplify a 294 bp region in all five viruses, and subsequent REA of PCR products allowed specific identification.

1784,Revising the taxonomy of the Circoviridae family: establishment of the genus Cyclovirus and deletion of the genus Gyrovirus.,"The Circoviridae family includes viruses with covalently closed, circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, including the smallest known autonomously replicating, capsid-coding animal pathogens. Members of this family are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs, and have historically been classified in one of two genera: Circovirus, which includes avian and swine pathogens, and Gyrovirus, which contains a single species (Chicken anemia virus). However, over the past six years, viral metagenomic approaches as well as degenerate PCR detection in non-traditional hosts and environmental samples have illuminated a wider host range for members of the Circoviridae family, including fish, diverse mammals, and invertebrates. . In particular, these methods have revealed a distinct group of viruses that are closely related to members of the Circovirus genus and include a new genus, Cyclovirus. The discovery of new viruses and a reassessment of the genomic features that characterize members of the Circoviridae led to a review of the classification criteria used for this family of animal viruses. Here, we provide details on an updated Circoviridae taxonomy approved by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses in 2016, which makes up the genus Cyclovirus and reassigns the genus Gyrovirus to the family Anelloviridae, a separate lineage of animal viruses that also contains circular ssDNA genomes. In addition, we provide a novel species restriction threshold with 80% genome-wide binary identity based on pairwise identity distribution analysis for members of the Circoviridae family and list guidelines for distinguishing between members of this family and other eukaryotic viruses with circular, ssDNA. genomes.",,"Rosario, K.;Breitbart, M.;Harrach, B.;SegalÃ©s, J.;Delwart, E.;Biagini, P.;Varsani, A.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3247-y,0
1785,RNA viral metagenome of whiteflies leads to discovery and characterization of a whitefly-transmitted Carlavirus in North America,"Whiteflies from the Bemisia tabaci species complex are capable of transmitting a large number of plant viruses and are some of the most harmful pests in agriculture. Although whiteflies are known to transmit both DNA and RNA viruses, most of the diversity has been noted for the former, especially for the Begomovirus genus. This study investigated the overall diversity of DNA and RNA viruses in whiteflies collected from a single site in Florida to assess whether additional previously undetected viral types were present in the B. tabaci vector. Metagenomic analysis of viral DNA extracted from whiteflies resulted in detection of only begomoviruses. In contrast, whiteflies contained similar sequences to RNA viruses from different groups, with a diversity extending beyond the viruses currently described. Metagenomic analysis of whiteflies also led to the first report of a whitefly-infected RNA virus similar to Cowpea mild mottle virus (CpMMV Florida) (genus Carlavirus) in North America. Further investigation resulted in detection of CpMMV Florida in native and cultivated plants growing near the original field site of whitefly collection and determination of experimental host range. Analysis of complete CpMMV Florida genomes from whiteflies and plants indicates that current classification criteria for carlaviruses need to be re-evaluated. Overall, metagenomic analysis supports that the DNA plant viruses carried by B. tabaci are dominated by begomoviruses, whereas significantly less is known about the RNA viruses contained in this pest vector.

This study identified 10 novel genomes similar to ssDNA circoinuses through data mining of publicly available viral metagenomes. Metagenomic libraries included samples from reclaimed water and three different marine environments (Chesapeake Bay, British Columbia coastal waters and Sargasso Sea). All genomes have similarities with the replication (Rep) protein of circoviruses; however, only half have genomic features compatible with known circoviruses. Some of the genomes exhibit a mix of genomic features associated with different ssDNA virus families (i.e., circoviruses, geminiviruses, and parvoviruses). The unique genome architectures and phylogenetic analysis of the Rep protein indicate that these viruses belong to novel genera and/or families. Investigating the complex community of ssDNA viruses in the environment could lead to the discovery of different species and help elucidate evolutionary links between ssDNA viruses.",,"Rosario, K.;Duffy, S.;Breitbart, M.",2009.0,Oct,,0
1787,Virus discovery in all three major lineages of terrestrial arthropods highlights diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses associated with invertebrates,"Viruses encoding a replication-associated protein (Rep) within the covalently closed, single-stranded (ss)DNA genome are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms, including economically valuable agricultural crops and livestock. Although Circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group from which our knowledge is rapidly expanding, biased sampling of vertebrates and land plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here, we screened terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and reported the identification of 44 viral genomes and replicons associated with specimens representing the three main terrestrial arthropod lineages, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects), and Myriapoda (centipedes). We identified virus genomes from three established CRESS DNA viral families (Circoviridae, Genomoviridae and Smacoviridae); however, more than half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are only distantly related to the currently classified CRESS DNA viral sequences. Although members of viral and satellite families (Geminiviridae, Nanoviridae, Alphasatellitidae) known to infect plants were not identified in this study, CRESS DNA viruses and replicons that infect this plant are transmitted by hemipterans. Thus, members of six of the seven established CRESS DNA viral families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous viral sequences reported from a wide variety of organisms to date, revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA viral diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results highlight the wide and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel findings from RNA viral discovery efforts in undersampled taxa.",,"Rosario, K.;Mettel, K.

1788,Unknown Challenges: Clinical Application of Microbial Metagenomics,"The availability of rapid, high-throughput, and low-cost whole-genome sequencing holds great promise in public health microbiology, with applications ranging from epidemic detection and monitoring of transmission events to understanding the role microbial communities play in health and disease. Within clinical metagenomics, the identification of microorganisms from a complex and host-enriched background remains a central computational challenge. As a proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mix of 25 human pathogens, and an unknown complex biological model using over-the-counter technology. The datasets were then analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline developed around recent rapid classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 viruses against the background of host contamination and bacterial contamination from multiple sources. An alternative non-targeted identification method was highly associated with these classifications, and when applied to the complex biological model, more than 1,600 species were identified, including several species captured at more than 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of metagenomics application in the clinical in vitro setting and that this can be achieved using existing infrastructure for non-dedicated sequencing centers.",,"Rose, G.;Wooldridge, D.

The primary aim of this study was to determine associations between different PRRSV RFLP strains and clinical manifestations of the disease in swine herds in southern Ontario. in those herds. Herds included in the study submitted samples to the Animal Health Laboratory at the University of Guelph between September 2004 and August 2007. Each farmer was surveyed to identify clinical disease in the herd and the RFLP model of a PRRSV isolate was derived from one animal. diagnostic sample. The most common isolates were RFLP type 1-4 (25.1%), 252 (14.7%), 134 (12%), and 1-2 (7.7%). The distribution of RFLP species in this study was found to differ from a previous study in Ontario. The RFLP types most associated with clinical disease during the breeding phase of production are 1-4, 1-2, and 134.

1790,Deep sequencing reveals abundant non-canonical retroviral microRNAs in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma,"Viral tumor models have contributed significantly to our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms. However, how transforming delta-retroviruses induce malignancy is poorly understood, particularly since viral mRNA/protein is tightly silenced in tumors. Here, we provide in vivo evidence of production of viral microRNAs transcribed by non-canonical RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in leukemic B cells, using deep sequencing of large windows of small RNA sizes in the bovine leukemia virus sheep leukemia/lymphoma model. Complete absence of Pol II 5â€²-LTR-driven transcriptional activity. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs processed from a cluster of five independent self-sufficient transcriptional units located in a proviral region indispensable for in vivo infectivity represent ~40% of all microRNAs in both experimental and native malignancy. They are subject to strong purifying selection and are associated with Argonautes, consistent with a critical function in silencing important cellular and/or viral targets. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are strongly expressed in preleukemic and malignant cells where constitutive and regulatory gene expression is suppressed, suggesting an important role in tumor initiation and progression. Understanding how Pol III-dependent microRNAs disrupt cellular and viral pathways will contribute to deciphering the complex perturbations underlying malignant transformation.",,"Rosewick, N.;Momont, M.;Durkin, K.;Takeda, H.;Caiment, F.;Cleuter, Y.;Vernin, C.;Mortreux, F.;Wattel, E.;Burny, A.;Georges, M.;Van Den Broeke, A.",2013.0,,10.1073/pnas.1213842110,0
1791,Metagenomics of rumen bacteriophage from thirteen lactation dairy cattle.,"Background: Bovine rumen is home to a diverse and complex community of Eukarya, Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses (including bacteriophages). The rumen viral population (rumen virome) has received little attention compared to the rumen microbial population (rumen microbiome). We used highly parallel sequencing of virus-like particles to investigate the diversity of rumen virus in thirteen lactating Australian Holstein dairy cattle all housed, of which 12 were sampled on the same day. Results: Fourteen putative viral sequence fragments over 30 Kbp in length were combined and annotated. Most of the putative genes in the fused contigs showed no homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount of work still required to fully elucidate the functions encoded in viral genomes. Despite the cattle being the same age, lactating, and fed the same diets, the abundance of adjacent sequences varied greatly between animals. Additionally, twelve cohabiting animals shared a set of dominant viral contigs. We compared the functional properties of our bovine viromes with those of other viromes and rumen microbiomes. At the functional level, we found strong similarities between all viral samples, which were quite different from the rumen microbiome samples. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a large amount of animal variation in the bovine rumen virome and that cohabiting animals may have more similar viromes than non-cohabiting animals. We report the deepest sequence of rumen virus to date. This study highlights the enormous amount of innovation and diversity available in the rumen virome.",,"Ross, E. M.;Petrovski, S.;Moate, P.

1792,Identification and whole genome sequencing of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using random access amplification and next-generation sequencing technologies,"BACKGROUND: During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) in Belgium, two hemagglutinating agents were isolated from cloacal swab pools of wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) captured in a single sampling site at two different sampling sites. we did. times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and specific real-time RT-PCR tests. METHODS: Random access amplification in combination with next-generation sequencing was used for sequence-independent identification of viruses to improve virological identification of APMV2-10 in the absence of validated molecular tests for APMV2-10 as performed by HI subtyping tests. their genomes. RESULTS: Three different APMVs were identified. From a pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) was determined, as well as a partial sequence for an APMV4. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to APMV4 isolated from the first sample. Although cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow for formal identification, the HI subtype revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify APMV4 co-infected in the APMV6-infected pool. CONCLUSIONS: These data also add to the knowledge of genetic diversity within APMV4 and 6 serotypes and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing. Using only a moderate and economical sequencing effort, characterization and whole-genome sequencing of APMVs, including identification of viruses in mixed infections, can be achieved.",,"Rosseel, T.;Lambrecht, B.;Vandenbussche, F.;van den Berg, T.;Van Borm, S.",2011.0,2006-10-01 00:00:00,,0

Serum and whole blood samples were collected several days later in the presumed hyperviraemic state of an animal showing these clinical signs. Bioinformatic analysis of data from the DNA virus identification workflow (a total of 32 757 sequences with an average read length of 335 bases) showed the presence of parvovirus-like sequences in the blood sample initially tested. Extensive follow-up using specific real-time RT-PCR assays targeting detected sequence fragments confirmed the presence of these sequences in the original sample as well as in an additional animal sample, but negative extraction showed a contamination with the same genetic signature as controls. Further investigation using an alternative extraction method identified contamination of the originally used Qiagen extraction columns with parvovirus-like nucleic acids or virus particles. While we did not find any relevant viruses that might be associated with the disease, these observations clearly demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate control strategy and follow-up diagnostic tests in any viral metagenomic study. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"Rosseel, T.;Pardon, B.;De Clercq, K.;Ozhelvaci, O.;Van Borm, S.",2014.0,,10.1111/tbed.12251,0
1794,DNase SISPA-next-generation sequencing confirms Schmallenberg virus in Belgian field samples and identifies genetic variation in Europe,"In 2011, a new Orthobunyavirus was detected in cattle and sheep in Germany and the Netherlands. This virus was named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Subsequently, the presence of the virus was confirmed using real-time RT-PCR in cases of congenital malformations in cattle and small ruminants in several European countries, including Belgium. In the absence of specific sequencing protocols for this novel virus, we confirmed its presence in RT-qPCR positive field samples using DNase SISPA-next-generation sequencing (NGS), a virus discovery method based on random amplification and next-generation sequencing. An in vitro transcribed RNA was used to generate a standard curve that allowed quantification of viral RNA in field samples. Two field samples of aborted lambs containing 7.66 and 7.64 log(10) RNA copies per micro L total RNA allowed unambiguous identification of SBV. One sample gave 192 SBV readings covering approximately 81% of the L segment, 56% of the M segment and 13% of the S segment. The other example resulted in 8 reads distributed over the L and M segments. Three weakly positive field samples (one from aborted calf, two from aborted lambs) containing virus amounts equivalent to 4.27-4.89 log(10) RNA copies per micro L did not allow identification using DNase SISPA-NGS. This partial sequence information was compared with the whole genome sequence of SBV isolated from cattle in Germany and several sequence differences were identified. The applied viral discovery method allowed confirmation of SBV in RT-qPCR positive brain samples. However, the inability to confirm SBV in weakly PCR-positive samples demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriately targeted and fresh field samples in any virus discovery method. Partial sequences from field samples showed few differences when compared with sequences from cattle in Germany, indicating sequence variation within the epidemic.",,"Rosseel, T.;Scheuch, M.;Hoper, D.;De Regge, N.;Caij, A.

1795,Markers of ongoing or previous hepatitis E virus infection are common in wild ungulates as well as in humans in Sweden.,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human pathogen with zoonotic spread that infects both domestic and wild animals. About 17% of the Swedish population is immune to HEV, although a few cases are reported each year, indicating that most infections are subclinical. However, clinical hepatitis E may also be overlooked. The source of infection for the detected cases is mostly unknown. To determine whether HEV is spreading from wild game animals, the prevalence of past and/or ongoing infection markers was investigated in serum and fecal samples collected from 260 hunted Swedish wild ungulates. HEV markers were found in 43 (17%) of the animals. The most frequently infected animal was deer (Alces alces) with 19 (28%) of 69 animals showing signs of HEV, followed by wild boar (Sus scrofa) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) with 21 (15%) of 139 animals. . Red deer (Cervus elaphus) with 2 out of 30 animals, 1 out of 15 animals and fallow deer (Dama dama) with 0 out of 7 animals. Partial open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of viral genomes from animals was sequenced and compared with those from 14 endemic human cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three humans were infected with HEV strains similar to those derived from wild boar.

All 20 NDVs were categorized as velogenic (n = 17) and lentogenic (n = 3) viruses, respectively, according to the mean time to death (MDT) of chicken embryos. Velogenic viruses carry the motif 112R-RQKR/F117 (n = 14) or 112G-RQGR/L117 (n = 3) at the F0 cleavage site, while all lentogenic viruses 112G-RQGR/L117 (n = 3) in the same site.

At least five amino acid substitutions or four reassisted amino acids may be sufficient for mammalian-to-mammalian transmission via respiratory droplets. From the surveillance data, we found that two of these substitutions are common in A/H5N1 viruses, and therefore some viruses may require only three additional substitutions for transmission between mammals via respiratory droplets. We used a mathematical model of intra-host virus evolution to examine factors that may increase and decrease the likelihood of residual substitutions occurring after the virus has infected a mammalian host. These factors, combined with the presence of some of these substitutions in circulating strains, make a wild-evolving virus a potentially serious threat.

1801,"H1N1 influenza viruses, which vary widely in the stability of hemagglutinin, are efficiently transmitted from pig to pig and ferret","pandemic-capable influenza virus requires a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein that is not immunologically visible to most humans and can support replication and transmission in humans. HA stabilization has been associated with the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic potential in humans and H5N1 airborne transmissibility in the ferret model. Pig served as an intermediate host for zoonotic influenza viruses, but the evolutionary pressure exerted by this host on HA stability was unknown. For more than 70 contemporary porcine H1 and H3 isolates, we measured HA activation pH between pH 5.1 to 5.9 for H1 viruses and pH 5.3 to 5.8 for H3 viruses. Therefore, contemporary porcine isolates vary widely in HA stability, with values favored by both avian (pH >5.5) and human and ferret (pH <=5.5) species. Using the early 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus backbone, we generated three viruses that differed only by an HA residue that altered HA stability: WT (pH 5.5), HA1-Y17H (pH 6.0), and HA2-R106K (pH 5.3). All three multiplied in pigs and were transmitted from pig to pig and from pig to ferret. WT and R106 viruses retained the HA genotype and phenotype after transmission. Y17H (pH 6.0) has acquired HA mutations that stabilize the HA protein to pH 5.8 after transfer to pigs and to 5.5 after transfer to ferrets. Overall, we found that pigs for contact transmission support a wide range of HA activation pH, and many recent porcine H1N1 and H3N2 isolates have stabilized (human-like) HA proteins. This poses an increasing pandemic risk and highlights the importance of continued surveillance and control efforts for swine viruses.",,"Russier, M.;Yang, G.;Marinova-Petkova, A.;Vogel, P.;Kaplan, B.

1803,Identification and classification of bovine leukemia virus isolates in Russia and Ukraine based on pol viral gene polymorphism.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a specific pathogen commonly seen in cattle. Analysis of pol viral gene polymorphism was used to characterize the polymorphism of BLV isolates in livestock farms in Russia and Ukraine. Fragments of the pol gene corresponding to reverse transcriptase and integrase 494 and 233 bp, respectively, were used for analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several variants of BLV clustered in Russia and Ukraine with high bootstrapping support. A new classification of BLV variants is proposed. Comparison of phylograms based on polymorphism of nucleotide sequences of integrase and reverse transcriptase domains showed no topological conflicts. Therefore, no recombination was found among the BLV variants. Â© 2012 Ülker Publishing, Ltd.",,"Ruzina, M. N.;Andrianov, B. V.;Shaikhaev, G. O.;Sulimova, G. E.",2012.0,,10.1134/s1022795412060117,0
1804,Serological differentiation of foot-and-mouth disease virus strains depending on selection of appropriate vaccine viruses.,"For the purposes of selection of appropriate vaccine strains or advice regarding vaccine use, serological differentiations attempt to predict whether a particular vaccine/antigen is likely to induce antibody that will be protective against the dominant field strains. The purpose of such distinctions is not the same as virus classification. Therefore, it is recommended that the most appropriate measure of this association (r) be given by: r = serum activity against heterologous (Area) strain/ activity of serum against homologous (Vaccine) strain. Comparison of the complement fixation test with virus neutralization test systems – namely metabolic inhibition (color), plaque reduction, a two-dimensional microneutralization cytopathic endpoint (microneutralization) and neutralization kinetics showed that the two test systems did not always yield the same. Results. Experience has also shown that there is a good correlation between serum neutralizing titer and protection in cattle in both homologous and heterologous systems. It is possible to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between vaccine antigen dose and serum neutralizing titer. Therefore, it is recommended that the preferred test for strain comparison for vaccine use should be based on the virus neutralization system. When comparing two virus types, they should be assumed to be the same until they are shown to be possibly different. Therefore, for each test system, it is necessary to know the intrinsic test error so that the smallest difference between two statistically significant test values can be recognized. An analysis of the distinctive power of the various test systems used in our laboratory is presented. Experience has shown that methods of processing and storing vaccine viruses can cause significant changes in the biophysical properties of the virus, eg virulence, plaque morphology, behavior in the sucrose density gradient, even antigenic shift and immunogenicity. Therefore, it is recommended to prepare reference antisera as much as possible from strains currently in use in vaccine production to compare strains to decide on the use of vaccines.",,"Rweyemamu, M.

It contains two sets of oligonucleotide probes that allow viruses to be classified by hemagglutinin (H1-H13, H15, H16) and neuraminidase (N1-N9) subtypes. Additional probe sets are used to detect H1N1 swine flu viruses. The selection of probes was done in two steps. First, amino acid sequences specific to each subtype were determined, and then the most specific and representative oligonucleotide probes were selected. Overall, 19 to 24 probes were used to identify each subtype of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Genotyping involved the preparation of fluorescently labeled PCR amplicons of influenza virus cDNA and their hybridization to microarrays of specific oligonucleotide probes. Of the 40 samples tested, 36 clearly identified the HA and NA subtypes of the Influenza A virus.",,"Ryabinin, V. A.;Kostina, E. V.;Maksakova, G. A.;Neverov, A. A.;Chumakov, K. M.;Sinyakov, A.

1807,"Rabies of the wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) canid biotype in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa, 2014-2015: Diagnosis, possible origins, and implications for control.","In South Africa, both domestic and wild carnivorous species are commonly diagnosed with rabies virus (RABV) infection. While most confirmed cases of rabies in wild carnivorous species have been reported from the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the remainder are from other wild carnivores, including the endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in 2014 and 2015 at the Madikwe Game Reserve in the North West province of South Africa using direct fluorescent antibody testing and immunohistochemistry from two wild dogs and a spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). No new wild dog has been introduced into the Madikwe Game Reserve for many years, and the wild dogs were vaccinated against rabies about 11 years ago, about 11 years ago. The first euthanized wild dog was the last surviving dog of a 6-pack, and the second was the last of a larger 18-pack; the rest died with no carcasses found or the carcasses too rotten for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses showed them to be canid RABVs. Originating from 22 wild carnivorous species, 7 dogs and one goat, mostly from the North West region, RABVs were genetically characterized by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. Nucleotide sequence analyzes of these viruses and two previously characterized RABVs confirmed that epidemic viruses were also canid rabies, which phylogenetically clustered with virus isolates originating from black-backed coyotes rescued from the North West state between 2012 and 2015 and domestic dogs from the neighboring community. fields. Sources of deaths and possible reservoir host(s) for the virus can only be estimated from data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviors, kills, park management and changing environmental ecology closely monitored in Madikwe. for several years. The most likely sources of rabies were from boundary fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, domestic dogs or cats, and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The risk of associated zoonotic infections and the threat to important and endangered predators can be reduced primarily through regional rabies control in domestic dogs and cats, as well as through preventive vaccination of park workers and pets at risk. Emphasizes the importance of continued prophylactic rabies protection through regular vaccination of endangered wildlife carnivores and the presentation of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animal that exhibits uncharacteristic behavior or is found dead.",,"Sabeta, C.

1808,Characterization of a novel VII subgenotype of Newcastle disease virus circulating in Iran,"Newcastle disease is an economically important and highly contagious disease affecting wild and domestic bird species. Despite extensive vaccination efforts in the poultry industry, outbreaks of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) still occur, causing significant economic losses. Rural chickens can serve as a potential reservoir of NDV for commercial poultry due to poor biosecurity and inadequate vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationship and molecular characterization of eight NDVs isolated from backyard poultry in Iran between 2011 and 2013. The complete coding sequence of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of eight NDVs was determined and compared with other published NDVs. Based on the inter-population distances and phylogenetic topology between the current NDV categories, the Iranian isolates formed a new subgenotype VII that differed from the previous groups specified in genotype VII. Moreover, both the F and HN genes of Iranian isolates shared high nucleotide sequence similarity with viruses isolated in China. All viruses analyzed contained a polybasic cleavage site motif (111G/RRRQKRâ†“F117) indicating that all isolates can be categorized as a virulent pathotype. No mutations were observed in the neutralizing epitopes of the F protein. Analysis of amino acids associated with neutralizing antigenic sites within the HN protein revealed that all isolates exhibited a unique amino acid (Q) at position 347. These results highlight the need to strengthen biosecurity measures and implement a mandatory vaccination program in village herds. local poultry. Also, continuous monitoring of NDVs in different avian species could help learn more about the evolution of this virus and prevent future panzootics.",,"Sabouri, F.;Vasfi Marandi, M.;Bashashati, M.",2018.0,,10.1080/03079457.2017.1376735,0
1809,Simultaneous identification of DNA and RNA viruses in pig feces using process-controlled deep sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Animal feces contain a community of many different microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses. Only scarce information is available on the diversity of viruses found in pig feces. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig feces. Genomes of purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously PCR amplified and deep sequenced, followed by bioinformatics analyses. The effectiveness of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure. RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled fecal sample of five pigs. 69,613 string reads were generated from this sample. All of the added bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% of reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. It originated mainly from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences were identical to plant viruses. The most abundant swine viruses detected were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus, and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences identical to the circular ssDNA virus associated with chimpanzee feces were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively termed pig feces-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a novel porcine virus. CONCLUSION: The established protocol enables simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA viruses in pig feces, including identification of hitherto unknown viruses. It can be applied in studies investigating the etiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases. Applied process control functions as quality control, ensures method comparability and can be used for further method optimization.",,"Sachsenroder, J.;Twardziok, S.;Hammerl, J.

1810,"The overall composition of pig fecal virus is age dependent, but not dependent on feeding with a probiotic bacteria.","Background: The porcine fecal viroma containing the ensemble of viruses found in pig feces is complex and consists of swine viruses, bacteriophages, transiently passaged plant viruses, and other small virus species. Little is known about the factors affecting its overall composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacteria Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on porcine fecal viroma composition was analyzed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets with or without probiotic bacteria. Results: DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared from 8 pooled stool samples from the feeding trial and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing, resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. On average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities against known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55-77%) in samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8-10%) in samples of pigs. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in sows. The dominant mammalian viruses differed significantly between 12-day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54-day-old piglets (boca-, dependent- and pig feces-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]), and pigs (PigSCV, circovirus and circovirus). -like"" viruses CB-A and RW-A). Additionally, the Shannon index, reflecting the diversity of sequences found in a sample, was generally higher for pigs compared to piglets. No consistent difference in virome composition could be detected between the viromes of the probiotic bacteria-treated group and the control group. Conclusion: The analysis shows that the porcine fecal virus has a high variability and its overall composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with probiotic bacteria E. faecium could not be demonstrated by the applied metagenomic method. Â© 2014 Sachsenröder et al.",,"SachsenrÃ¶der, J.;Twardziok, S.

1813,No viral association was found in a series of cases of differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia by human papillomavirus and pan-viral microarray testing,"Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN) is the precursor lesion of Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma (VSCC) and is more common than differentiated type (dVIN) VSCC. In contrast to the usual type VIN (uVIN) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a germline mutation in the p53 gene is thought to be associated with 90% of dVIN cases. To date, no infectious agents associated with dVIN have been identified, and studies investigating this possibility have been hampered by the difficulty in accurately diagnosing dVIN from small biopsies. Here, we used immunostaining to examine 14 uVIN high-grade VIN and 14 dVIN cases for p16<sup>ink4a</sup>, a biomarker for HPV infection, and select 10 dVIN cases to broadly screen all known viruses. pan-viral microarray platform (ViroChip). All uVIN tissue samples, including 8 warts and 6 basaloid cases, showed positivity with the p16<sup>ink4a</sup> immunostain. The staining pattern was full thickness for all but two cases where positive staining was localized in the lower 1/3 of the epidermis. In contrast, immunostaining for p16<sup>ink4a</sup> was negative in all dVIN cases. ViroChip analysis of 10 pure dVIN samples confirmed the absence of human papillomavirus subtypes or any other virus, except for a single sample showing a weak microarray signature against a porcine herpes virus. Subsequent PCR testing of the sample was negative for the herpes virus, and in-depth metagenomic next-generation sequencing revealed only sequences that corresponded to non-pathogenic viral flora and bacterial contamination. In this study, we showed that there was no virus association in 10 dVIN cases. Alternative pathways for carcinogenesis, such as p53 mutation, should be considered to explore potential treatment options in dVIN.",,"Saglam, O.;Samayoa, E.;Somasekar, S.;Naccache, S.;Iwasaki, A.;Chiu, C.

1814,Antigenic subtyping of porcine circovirus type 2 using monoclonal antibodies and competition analysis of its epitopes,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) strains have been classified into two main genotypes (PCV2a and PCV2b) and 8 genetic clusters: PCV2b-1A to PCV2b-1C and PCV2a-2A to PCV2a-2E. To date, no studies have been conducted to antigenically subtype PCV2 strains comprising eight PCV2 clusters. This study aimed to subtyping PCV2 antigenically and to perform competition analysis of epitopes using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Fourteen PCV2 strains, representing eight clusters, were tested with 20 mAbs in immunoperoxidase monolayer experiments (fifteen of these were produced against PCV2a strain Stoon-1010 and 5 against PCV2b strain 1147). Four mAbs responded to 14 PCV2 strains and one mAb reacted with all strains except one PCV2a-2C strain. One mAb reacted with all PCV2a strains except one PCV2a-2C strain and one mAb reacted with all PCV2b strains except one PCV2b-1C strain. Nine mAbs reacted with strains PCV2b-1A/1B, PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. The three mAbs only reacted with strains PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. A mAb specifically reacted with strains of PCV2b-1A/1B. This indicates that distinct antigenic differences exist between different PCV2 genetic clusters and that these clusters can be distinguished using a panel of universal and cluster-specific mAbs. Six mAbs were selected for cross-competition analysis by a competitive ELISA using the PCV2 strain Stoon-1010. Six overlapping epitopes were identified on the PCV2 capsid protein. Universal mAbs recognized larger epitopes than cluster-specific mAbs.

DI particles are recognized for their role in inhibiting viral replication and their effects on the production of infectious virions. To date, influenza virus DI particles have been reported primarily as a cell culture phenomenon and in experimentally infected embryonated chicken eggs. It has also been isolated from respiratory tract infection of chickens. Using a sequencing approach, we characterize several subgenomic viral RNAs from human nasopharyngeal samples infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The distribution of these in vivo-derived DI-like RNAs was similar to the distribution of DIs in vitro, with the majority of defective RNAs produced from PB2 (segment 1) of the polymerase complex, followed by PB1 and PA. The lengths of the in vivo-derived DI-like segments are also similar to those of known in vitro DIs, and the in vivo-derived DI-like segments share internal deletions of the same segments. The presence of identical DI-like RNAs in patients bound by direct contact is consistent with transfer between them.

1817,Characterization of a human H9N2 influenza virus isolated in Hong Kong.,"Two H9N2 viruses were first isolated from humans in 1999 in Hong Kong. The isolation of influenza viruses with a new subtype of hemagglutinin (HA) has drawn the attention of health authorities worldwide in terms of pandemic preparedness. Sequence analysis of HA genes reveals that HA of A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) is most closely related to A/quail/HK/G1/97 (H9N2) containing internal genes similar to those of Hong. Kong/97 (H5N1) viruses. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyzes showed diversity among H9 HA. A/Hong Kong/1073/99 was shown to cause respiratory infection in Syrian hamsters, suggesting that the virus can reproduce efficiently in mammalian hosts. We have developed a complete virion test vaccine with formalin-inactivated egg-raised HK1073. Intraperitoneal administration of the vaccine to hamsters twice provided complete protection against infection by MDCK cell-grown homologous virus. The receptor specificity of HK1073 appeared to differ from that of other avian influenza viruses of the H9 subtype, which preferentially recognize α-2.3-linked sialic acid. Hemagglutination of HK1073 with guinea pig erythrocytes was inhibited by polymers containing both α-2.3 and α-2.6 linked sialic acid. These data suggested that HK1073 acquired a wider host range, including humans. Combined with the data available so far, this study suggested that the isolation of H9 influenza viruses from humans should be precautionary against the emergence of a new human flu.

1821,Isolation and characterization of a novel Rhabdovirus from a wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Japan,"novel rhabdovirus was isolated from the serum of a healthy Japanese wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax), and viral nucleic acid sequences (RDV) were identified using the rapid detection system for next-generation sequencing and electron microscopy. The virus was tentatively named wild boar rhabdovirus 1 (WBRV1). Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence showed that WBRV1 is closely related to Tupaia rhabdovirus (TRV) isolated from cultured cells of tree mouse hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. TRV has not been assigned to any Rhabdoviridae genus to date. Analysis of the L gene showed that WBRV1 belongs to the genus Vesiculovirus. These observations indicate that both TRV and WBRV1 belong to a new genus Rhabdoviridae. Next-generation genome sequencing of WBRV1 revealed 5 open reading frames with 1329, 765, 627, 1629 and 6336 base lengths. The WBRV1 gene sequences are similar to those of other rhabdoviruses. Epizootiological analysis of a wild boar population in Wakayama prefecture in Japan showed that 6.5% were positive for the WBRV1 gene and 52% for WBRV1-neutralizing antibodies. Also, such viral neutralizing antibodies were found in domestic pigs from another state. WBRV1 was inoculated intranasally and intraperitoneally into SCID and BALB/c mice, and viral RNA was detected in SCID mice, suggesting that WBRV1 might replicate in immunocompromised mice.

Most swine isolates were divided into two main subgroups, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) subgroup 1 (CSFV-1 represented by Brecia strain) and subgroup 2 (CSFV-2 represented by Alfort strain). However, the Japanese strains Kanagawa/74, Okinawa/86, Okinawa/86-2 and Thai CBR/93 were the most prominent variants and were assigned to another different subgroup, CSFV-3 (represented by strain p97). Most ruminant isolates were classified as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genotype-I (BVDV-I) and subdivided into two subgroups, BVDV-Ia (represented by NADL strain) and Ib (represented by Osloss strain). Two bovine isolates (MS-1 and SY-89) from one ovine cell line and a contaminant strain (V/FLL) were classified as BVDV genotype-II (BVDV-II) based on genetic characteristics.

1824,"Viral RNA Load in Patients with Tick-Bound Encephalitis, Slovenia","We determined the levels of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus (TBEV) RNA in serum samples from 80 patients during the initial stage of TBE in Slovenia. For most samples, levels ranged from 3-6 log(10) copies of RNA/mL. Levels were higher in female patients than in male patients, but we found no association between viral load and various laboratory and clinical parameters, including TBE severity. However, a weak humoral immune response was associated with a more severe disease course, suggesting that insufficient clearance of the virus resulted in more serious illness.

1825,Alternative growth promoters Modulate the broiler gut microbiome and increase body weight gain,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are often used to increase weight gain in poultry production. However, there is growing concern about the impact of AGP in the emergence of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic bacterial pathogens in the microbial community of the poultry gut. In this study, we adopted mass spectrophotometric, phylogenetic and shotgun-metagenomic approaches to evaluate bioactive phenolic extracts (BPE) from blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pulp as AGP alternatives in broilers. We performed two trials with 100 Cobb-500 broiler chickens (in each trial) in four equal groups, supplemented with no water, supplemented with AGP (tylosin, neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, erythromycin, and oxytetracycline), or supplemented with 0.1 g. Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L of BPE or 1.0 g GAE/L (within the last 72 hours before euthanasia) for 6 weeks. Compared to the control group (water only), chickens supplemented with AGP and 0.1 g GAE/L BPE gained 9.5% and 5.8% more body weight, respectively. The microbiomes of chickens treated with both AGP and BPE had higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios. AGP supplementation appears to be associated with relatively higher bacteriophage abundance and unique cecal resistomas compared with BPE supplementation or control. Functional characterization of the cecal microbiomes has revealed significant animal-to-animal variation in the relative abundance of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. These findings provided a basis on which plant-based performance-enhancing mechanisms can be investigated in the regulation of animal growth. In addition, the data will help design alternative strategies to improve animal growth performance and therefore production.",,"Salaheen, S.;Kim, S. W.;Haley, B. J.;Van Kessel, J. A.

1826,Biological and molecular identification of seed-borne viruses in cowpea germplasm of geographically diverse sub-Saharan origin.,"total of 983 cowpea inputs from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Cowpea Warehouse were analyzed for seed-borne viruses. Most of the entries originated from 11 countries representing different agro-climatic zones in sub-Saharan Africa and included native species, native cultivars and breeding lines. Following initial growth tests, 69 cowpea entries, mostly with symptoms of virus infection, were selected for further evaluation using a combination of host range, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing analyses. Analyzes revealed that samples from 46 (67%) accessions harbored one or more known seed-borne cowpea viruses. These include Botswana (13 entries), Ghana (6), Nigeria (6), Mali (1), Kenya (5), Cameroon (7), Niger (4), Cote d'lvoire (1), Benin (1) , India (1) and China (1). Viruses were identified by cloning and sequencing of RT-PCR products amplified using virus strain- and family-specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers, as well as RT-PCR analysis of total RNAs extracted from samples suspected to be virus-infected using virus-type-specific primers. Viruses identified include Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV). Phylogenetic analysis of the inferred coat protein (CP) amino acid sequences of selected CMV isolates from five agriculturally diverse locations confirmed their linkage as novel members of the CMV subgroup IB.

1828,A Complete Array of Chicken BG Haplotypes Demonstrates Dynamic Expansion and Contraction of Two Gene Lines with Special Expression Patterns,"Many genes important in immunity exist as multigene families. Butyrophilin genes are members of the B7 family that play various roles in co-regulation and perhaps antigen presentation. In humans, a fixed number of butyrophilin genes are found in and around the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and show striking association with certain autoimmune diseases. In chickens, BG genes encode homologues with slightly different site organization. Only a few BG genes have been characterized, one involved in actin-myosin interaction at the intestinal brush border and the other involved in resistance to viral diseases. We characterize all BG genes in B12 chickens, we find a multigene family organized as tandem repeats in the BG region outside the MHC, a single gene in the MHC (BF-BL region) and another single gene on a different chromosome. There is a precise cell and tissue expression for each gene, but in general there are two types, those expressed by hemopoietic cells and those expressed in tissues (probably non-hemopoietic cells), two different types of promoters and associated with a 5² untranslated region. (5â€²UTR). However, the multigene family in the BG region contains many hybrid genes, suggesting recombination and/or deletion as major evolutionary forces. We confirmed the dynamic expansion and contraction within the BG region by identifying BG genes by comparing them to other haplotypes via fiber fluorescent in situ hybridization as well as BG genes in the chicken whole genome shotgun array. Therefore, BG genes in chickens evolve much faster than their mammalian homologues, for reasons that are not yet understood. Â© 2014 Salomonsen et al.",,"Salomonsen, J.;Chattaway, J. A.;Chan, A. C.

1829,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic study of velogenic Newcastle disease virus isolates in Iran.,"Pathogenicity and genetic characterizations of six Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates obtained from poultry farms in six different regions of Iran were performed using conventional and molecular techniques. According to their pathogenicity indices (MDT, ICPI, and IVPI), these isolates were all found to be velogenic (highly virulent) strains. A sequence analysis of full-length mRNA encoding the fusion glycoprotein precursor (F0) of the fusion proteins F1 and F2 of NDV in these six isolates revealed the presence of point mutations in the form of nucleic acid substitutions at positions 82(Câ†'T). , 83(Tâ†'C), 736(Aâ†'G), and 1.633(Gâ†'A). However, nucleic acid residues at positions 330-347 of the lead F0 gene, corresponding to the cleavage site of the F0 protein, were found to remain conserved among the six NDV isolates. A phylogenetic comparison between six Iranian isolates and NDVs whose F0 gene sequences were previously stored in the GenBank Database showed that all newly characterized Iranian NDV isolates belonged to genotype VII.

1830,Phylogenetic analysis of tuberous skin disease viruses in northwest Iran,"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a devastating viral disease in cattle that has recently spread from Africa to Middle Eastern countries. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationships between tuberous skin disease viruses (LSDV) isolated from different regions of Iran and the origin and spread of these viruses. In this study, a total of 234 blood samples from clinically affected animals from four provinces in northwest Iran were screened for LSDV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the 80 positive samples for LSDV detected by PCR, the partial P32 gene (759Â bp) of 12 isolates was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. LSD viruses were grouped into three subsets with an overall nucleotide identity of 97.1-100%. LSDVs isolated from Gilan showed the lowest nucleotide identity with other LSDVs. The four LSDV isolates, including KO-1, EA-1, EA-3 and WA-3, showed 100% similarity to each other as well as to the Neethling strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the identified LSDVs were closely related and had high sequence homology with other LSDV isolates from Africa. It was concluded that the LSD epidemic probably occurred in northwest Iran by LSDVs entering the country from Iraq, and the P32 nucleotide sequence information obtained in this study is a valuable resource for understanding the genetic makeup and molecular epidemiology of local LSDV isolates that can be used.

1831,A Blood Signature of Four Biomarkers Distinguishes Viral Infection-Related Systemic Inflammation Against Other Etiologies,"The innate immune system of humans and other mammals responds to pathogen-associated molecular models (PAMPs) that are conserved in broad classes of infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses. We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered, indicating a host systemic response to viral infection. Previous work has identified host transcriptional signatures to individual viruses, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all types of viral infections has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our design, we discovered and validated four gene expression signatures in whole blood that are indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infections. The genes of the signature are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase-Like (OASL) and Adhesion G Protein-Matched Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of the 13 validation datasets covering human, macaque, chimpanzee, porcine, mouse, rat, and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides a statistically significant (p-<-0.05) distinction between viral and non-viral conditions. The signature may have clinical use to differentiate host systemic inflammation (SI) from viral and bacterial or non-infectious causes.",,"Sampson, D. L.;Fox, B. A.;Yager, T.

1832,Complete genome sequence of Avian Paramyxovirus (APMV) serotype 5 complements analysis of nine APMV serotypes and reveals the longest APMV genome,"Background: Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) consist of nine known serotypes. The genomes of representatives of all APMV serotypes except APMV type 5 have recently been fully sequenced. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the APMV-5 prototype strain budgerigar/Kunitachi/74. Methodology/Key Findings: APMV-5 Kunitachi virus is unusual in that it does not contain a virion hemagglutinin and does not reproduce in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. However, the virus grew in the amniotic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs and twelve different established cell lines and two primary cell cultures. The genome is 17,262 nucleotides (nt) long, the longest among members of the genus Avulavirus, and encodes six genes that are intergenic and do not overlap in the 3-²N-P/V/WMF-HN-L-5-² order. Regions of 4-57 nt. Genome length follows the 'rule of six' and contains a 55 nt leader sequence at the 3-end and a 552-nt fragment sequence at the 5-end. The phosphoprotein (P) gene contains a conserved RNA editing region and is predicted to encode the P, V, and W proteins. The cleavage site of the F protein (GKRKKR â†“ F) conforms to the cleavage site motif of the ubiquitous cellular protease furin. Consistent with this, exogenous protease was not required for virus replication in vitro. However, in one-day-old chicks, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of APMV-5 strain Kunitachi was found to be zero, indicating that the virus is lethal to chickens despite the presence of a polybasic F cleavage site. Results/Significance: Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the APVM-5 genome and proteins against other APMV serotypes showed that APMV-5 was more closely related to APMV-6 than to other APMVs. Furthermore, these comparisons provided evidence of wide genome-wide variation supporting the classification of APMVs into nine distinct serotypes. The structure of the F cleavage site does not appear to be a reliable indicator for virulence among APMV serotypes 2-9. Availability of sequence information for all known APMV serotypes will facilitate studies in epidemiology and vaccination.",,"Samuel, A. S.;Paldurai, A.;Kumar, S.;Collins, P. L.;Samal, S.

1833,Climate change impacts global potential distribution of bluetongue virus,"The geographic distribution of arboviruses has received considerable attention after several dramatic worldwide emergence events. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is classified among ""A"" category diseases that must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and is transmitted among ruminant animals by biting the mid-ends of the genus Culicoides. Here, we developed a comprehensive event dataset to map the current distribution, predict the ecological niche, and explore the potential future distribution of BTV globally using ecological niche modeling and based on various future climate scenarios from general circulation models (GCMs) for the four representatives. concentration pathways (RCPs). The broad ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV in today's conditions reflected the current distribution of the disease around the world in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. All model predictions were significantly better than random expectations. As a further assessment of model robustness, we compared our model estimates with 331 independent records from the most recent outbreaks from the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Prevention System Information System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES-i); all have been successfully expected by the BTV model. Finally, we tested ecological niche similarity between possible vectors and BTV and were unable to reject the niche similarity hypotheses. Under future climatic conditions, the potential distribution of BTV was predicted to expand, particularly in Central Africa, the United States, and western Russia.",,"Samy, A. M.;Peterson, A.

1835,Analyzing pig serum for titers of functional antibodies to influenza a neuraminidase proteins using enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA).,"Neuraminidase (NA) is an envelope glycoprotein of influenza viruses, including swine influenza A viruses. NA has sialidase activity, which is functionally important at many points in viral replication and balances the sialic acid receptor binding activity of the other major envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA). The NA proteins of influenza A viruses have been classified into nine serological subtypes and undergo antigenic drift variation similar to that of HA. Antibodies to NA are analyzed much less frequently than antibodies to HA. The traditional assay for NA inhibition (NI) antibody titration, established decades ago, is widely considered cumbersome and inefficient for routine use. In recent years, several new formats have been developed that still measure inhibition of NA enzymatic function, but are more efficient and produce less chemical waste. Described here is enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) performed in 96-well plates and analyzed in a spectrophotometric plate reader. An important factor in the adoption of the ELLA technique for animal studies, such as pig, is the selection of the NA antigen, which can be a purified protein or a whole virus containing an antigenically unrelated HA protein. This NI assay, together with the hemagglutination inhibitory (HI) antibody assay, provides a practical way to more fully characterize viral isolates and to quantify antibodies induced by infection or vaccination.",,"Sandbulte, M.

1837,Detection and characterization of atypical capripox viruses among small ruminant animals in India,"Recent advances in molecular biology have shed light on the interspecies transmission of SPPV and GTPV. This study was planned to characterize capripox viruses circulating in field conditions among sheep and goats using the RPO30 gene-based viral strain (SPPV/GTPV) distinguishing RPO30 and GPCR genes from clinical samples and PCR. Capripox virus infection was found to be positive in 27 sheep and 18 goat shells from 58 shells (35 sheep and 23 goats) scanned. Except for one sheep and one goat shell, all positive samples gave amplicon size relative to host origin, ie SPPV in sheep and GTPV in goats. In the two exceptions above, goat skin and sheep skin gave the amplicon size of SPPV and GTPV, respectively. Furthermore, sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes of the complete ORFs of the RPO30 and GPCR genes from six sheep and three goats' coats revealed that, except for the two examples above, all had host-specific signatures and clustered according to their host origin. In the case of cross-species infecting the samples, sheep scabies had GTPV-like signatures and goat's bark had SPPV-like signatures.

1839,"Genetic characterization of small ruminant lentiviruses circulating in naturally infected sheep and goats in Ontario, Canada.","Maedi-visna virus (MVV) and goat arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) are related members of a group of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) that infect sheep and goats. SRLVs are endemic in many countries, including Canada. However, little is known about the genetic characteristics of Canadian SRLVs, particularly in the province of Ontario. Given the importance of surveillance and eradication programs for the control of SRLVs, it is imperative that diagnostic tests used to identify infected animals are sensitive to local strains of SRLVs. The aim of this study was to characterize SRLV strains circulating in Ontario and to evaluate the variability of the immunodominant regions of the Gag protein. In this study, a nearly complete plug array of 164 SRLVs from 130 naturally infected sheep and 32 naturally infected goats from Ontario was sequenced. The animals belonged to remote mono and mixed breed (sheep and goat) farms. Sheep lentiviruses from the same farm tended to cluster more closely than goat lentiviruses from the same farm. Sequence analysis revealed a higher degree of heterogeneity between goat lentivirus sequences, with an average between-farm DNA distance of 10% and only 5% in the ovine lentivirus group. Interestingly, amplification of SRLV from ELISA-positive sheep was successful in 81% of cases, whereas amplification of SRLV proviral DNA was possible in only 55% of ELISA-positive goat samples; This suggests that a significant proportion of goat lentiviruses circulating in Ontario have heterogeneity in the primary binding sites used in this study. Sequences of sheep and goat SRLVs from Ontario were combined with other known SRLVs into phylogenetic trees and found to belong to sequence groups A2 and B1, respectively, as described by Shah et al. (2004a). A new goat lentivirus was identified with a double genetic difference of 15.6-25.4% relative to other group B subtypes. Therefore, we propose identifying a new subtype, B4, within the caprine lentivirus-like cluster. Finally, we showed evidence of recombination among ovine lentiviruses. These results highlight the wide genetic diversity of SRLV strains circulating in the province of Ontario and demonstrate that the gag region is suitable for phylogenetic studies and can be applied to monitor SRLV eradication programs. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Santry, L.

1840,Genomic characterization of two novel pathogenic avipox viruses isolated from Pacific rough waters (Ardenna spp.),"BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years, many seabird populations have been gradually declining, and the factors driving this continued deterioration are not always well understood. Avipoxvirus infections have been found in a wide variety of avian species worldwide, but little is known about the disease ecology of avian pox viruses in seabirds. Here we present two novel avipoxviruses from pacific shearwaters (Ardenna spp), one from the Flesh-footed Shearwater (A. carneipes) (SWPV-1) and the other from the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (A. pacificus) (SWPV-2). . RESULTS: Epidermal pox lesions, liver and blood samples were examined from A. carneipes and A. pacificus breeding colonies in eastern Australia. After histopathological confirmation of the disease, PCR scanning was performed for avipoxvirus, circovirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus and fungal agents. Two samples PCR positive for poxvirus were further evaluated by next-generation sequencing, which yielded complete Shearwaterpox virus (SWPV) genomes from A. pacificus and A. carneipes, both with the highest degree of similarity to Canarypox virus (98% vs. 67%). . , respectively). The novel SWPV-1 complete genome of A. carneipes lacks 43 genes compared to CNPV and contains 4 predicted genes not found in any other smallpox virus, while the SWPV-2 complete genome is assumed to be missing 18 genes compared to CNPV and 15 genes more severely fragmented, possibly rendering them non-functional. CONCLUSION: These are the first complete genome sequences of avipoxvirus to infect seabirds. In comparison of SWPV-1 and -2 with existing avipoxvirus sequences, our results show that the SWPV complete genome from A. carneipes (SWPV-1) described here is not closely related to any other avipoxvirus genome isolated from avian or other natural host. . species and should probably be considered a separate species.",,"Sarker, S.;Das, S.;Lavers, J.

What evolutionary processes determine the severity and ability of influenza A viruses to be transmitted between humans? We performed phylogenetic classifications of influenza A viruses sampled between 1918 and 2009 using a measure called the entropic chaos degree developed through the study of chaos in information dynamics. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal protein (PB2, PB1, PA, NS, M1, M2, NS1 and NS2) showed that the human-adapted and inter-human transmitted Influenza A viruses were clearly differentiated from the porcine line and the avian lineage. Moreover, the HA, NA, and internal proteins of the influenza strain that caused a pandemic or a severe epidemic with high mortality were phylogenetically different from the previous pandemic and severe epidemic strains. We conclude that the internal protein has a significant effect on the ability to infect among humans.

1845,Antiviral activities of xanthates,"Strategies in the development of antivirals are preferably directed towards the development of agents that will interact with virus-encoded enzymes, such as polymerases and reverse transcriptase. Xanthates, which are antiviral/antitumor with a different mode of action, interact selectively with cell proteins that regulate cell growth through protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation pathways. Such regulatory processes seem indispensable for the growth of a variety of taxonomically unrelated viruses. Xanthate structures at the R1 position are substituted with aliphatic cyclic and non-cyclic residues and alkali metal at the R2 position. The antiviral effect of such substitutions was evaluated in plaque reduction experiments using the herpes virus as a rapid reliable test system. The cytotoxicity criteria were based on the ability of logarithmically growing cell cultures to undergo active mitotic divisions. The R1 position must be filled with a lipophilic substituent, which should be constitutively limited to mono-, bi-, and tricyclic residues. The specific antiviral activity of the xanthate compound D609, expressed by its IC50, compares well with that of other herpes inhibitors, for example phosphonoformic acid (10 µM) or phosphonoacetic acid (20 µM). Unlike herpes virus, which encodes its own DNA polymerase, DNA tumor virus 'SV40' depends on cellular DNA polymerase for DNA replication. Xanthate had a selective antiviral effect in the absence of cytotoxicity of bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) transformed cells. Inhibition of viral gene functions by xanthate in the absence of detrimental effects on indispensable cellular functions indicates the high selectivity of the antiviral effect. Due to the abundance of Coxsackie B4 virus, there was a direct correlation between the amount of viral proteins synthesized despite the presence of D609. In the case of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), xanthate did not restrict the synthesis of primary transcripts that serve as messengers as they have positive strand polarity. The antiviral effect of xanthate occurs only under acidic pH, otherwise the antiviral/antitumor effects are reduced. A careful calibration of the D609/monocarbonic acid concentration was required prior to antiviral treatment, as HIV-1 only proliferates in viable lymphoma cells that exhibit the characteristics of transformed cells. Such treatment inhibits the spread of infectious HIV from cultures of chronic virus-producing lymphoma. This is the only compound that prevents the spread of HIV infections from carrier cultures. D609 acts antagonistically to the action of the tumor promoting compound TPA (12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). The effects of D609 are not directed against the pkc itself. Phospholipase C seems to be the main target. Diacylglycerol, the product of phospholipase C activity, is deficient in D609-treated cells. D609 interacts with the growth signal transduction sequence in a very specific mechanism. As xanthate blocks the pkC activity responsible for proper phosphorylation of these parameters, the transacting mechanisms may lack biological activity. Bolus injections of D609 in combination with monocarboxylic acid exert therapeutic effects on tumor xenotransplants in athymic mice when D609/undecanoic or dodecanoic acid is administered. This compound can be administered intravenously at very high concentrations.",,"Sauer, G.;Amtmann, E.;Mellert, W.",1989.0,,,0
1846,A member of a new genus Picornaviridae sheds in pig feces,"During a study of the fecal microbiomes of two healthy piglets using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified a viral genome containing an open reading frame encoding a predicted 2133 amino acid polyprotein. This novel viral genome exhibited the typical organization of picornaviruses with three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) followed by seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro and 3Dpol). Given its special relationship to Parechovirus, we propose to designate it as ""Swine pasivirus 1"" (SPaV1) as the type species and ""Pasivirus"" for the Parecho sister clade virus. Fecal samples collected in an industrial farm from healthy pigs and piglets aged 4 to 28 weeks from the same herd (25 and 75, respectively) were analyzed for the presence of SPAV1 by targeting one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. A 3D region of 151 bp. SPAV1 was not detected in faeces samples from 51/75 healthy piglets (68% of animals) and in none of the 25 faecal samples from healthy pigs, suggesting that SPAV1 circulates through enteric infection of healthy piglets.

By NGS, whole genome sequence was obtained from two blood samples (BTV-X ITL2015 strains 34200 and 33531). Overall, Segment 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 had the highest identity (75.3%-78.2%) with the recently isolated BTV-27s from Corsica and the most recently discovered BTV XJ1407 (75.9% nt / 78.2%) from China. 75.5 nt/77.4-78.1% aa). aa) is less associated with BTV-25 from Switzerland (73.0 nt/75.0% aa) and BTV-26 from Kuwait (62.0 nt/60.5% aa).

1850,Pandemic 1957 H2 influenza A virus origin and persistence of its possible progenitors in the avian reservoir,"H2N2 influenza A viruses caused the 1957 Asian pandemic and disappeared from the human population 10 years later. To assess the potential for similar outbreaks in the future, we determined the antigenicity of H2 hemagglutinins (HAs) from representative human and avian H2 viruses and then analyzed their nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine their evolutionary properties in different hosts. The results of longitudinal virus surveillance studies were also examined to estimate the prevalence of avian H2 isolates among samples collected from wild ducks and domestic poultry. Reactivity patterns obtained with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies showed antigenic shift in HA of human H2 influenza viruses starting in 1962. Amino acid changes clustered in two regions of HA1 corresponding to antigenic regions A and D of H3 HA. In contrast, the antigenic profiles of the majority of avian H2 HAs were remarkably preserved until 1991, resembling the prototype Japan 57 (H2N2) strain. Amino acid changes were distributed throughout HA1, indicating that antibodies do not play a significant role in the selection of avian H2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two geographic region-specific lineages of avian H2 HAs: North America and Eurasia. Evidence supporting the interregional transmission of gull H2 viruses is presented. Human H2 HAs circulating in 1957-1968 form a distinct phylogenetic lineage most closely related to Eurasian avian H2 HAs. Before the emergence of H2N2 viruses in domestic poultry, the prevalence of H2 influenza viruses among wild ducks in North America increased in 1988. As the prevalence of avian H2N2 influenza viruses increased in turkey farms and live bird markets in New York City and elsewhere, more of these viruses came into direct contact with susceptible humans. We conclude that antigenically conserved analogues of the 1957 human Asian pandemic strain continue to circulate in the bird reservoir and become closer to susceptible human populations.",,"Schafer, J.

The polypeptide migrated abnormally upon electrophoresis in two sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) systems: slower than bovine serum albumin in a continuous phosphate-buffered system and faster than bovine serum albumin in a discontinuous system. Estimated molecular weights in the two systems were approximately 71,000 and 64,000, respectively. There was no clear evidence for a minor virion polypeptide. Treatment of purified San Miguel sea lion virions with dimethyl suberimidate, a crosslinking reagent, preserves virion integrity during extended storage at 4°C.

As blood concentrations of infectious virus were consistently reduced after vaccination, no signs of disease were seen and no evidence of viral growth in tissues. HI antibodies in early plasmas were specific to VE virus and did not significantly cross-react with the other two North American alpha viruses, eastern and western encephalitis viruses. VE virus strains can be distinguished by virus dilution, short brood HI, but not by plasma dilution neutralization tests using early rooster antibodies. The distinctions made by the HI test were similar to those described by some strains and the spiny rat antisera used by Young and Johnson to construct subtype classifications of VE virus, but different from other strains.

Although the role of porcine NoVs in disease in pigs is unclear, they are genetically and antigenically closely related to human NoVs. Human NoV-like strains have been detected in pigs, raising public health concerns about potential interspecies transmission. Pig SaVs are highly diverse and occur in swine populations. Recently, at least three new pig SaV genogroups have been proposed. In this study, we tested 413 pooled fecal samples collected from apparently healthy finisher pigs in North Carolina pig farms in 2009. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR paired hybridization experiments were performed to detect known porcine NoVs. The overall prevalence of swine NoVs identified was 18.9% based on this method. Samples were then tested by RT-PCR targeting the 5= end of the capsid region for genogroup II (GII) NoVs, a group containing human NoVs, followed by sequence analysis. All identified NoVs belonged to typical porcine NoV genotypes and no human NoV-like strains were detected in samples from these pigs. Porcine NoV-negative samples (n = 335) were then screened using universal calicivirus primers and 17 SaV strains were confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial RNA-bound RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, they clustered with GIII, GVII and GVIII and currently unclassified SaVs. Based on analysis of complete capsid sequences, 7 representative strains clustered with GVII, GVIII and GIX? SAVs.

These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate tetraparvovirus 3 (PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (includes PPV4 and PPV5). bocaparvovirus 2 (includes porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 (porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1 and 4-2). The most recently identified porcine parvovirus, PPV6, was first identified in aborted pig fetuses in late 2014 in China. The prevalence of PPV6 in China was found to be similar in finishing-age pigs from farms with and without evidence of pig reproductive failure. Methods: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive samples. Results: Almost complete seven genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 2 positive serum samples sent to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Additional testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined that PPV6 was present in 13.2% of the sera tested. In addition, PPV6 was present in samples from all geographic locations sampled covering nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum indicates that the PPV6 infection has spread and is not localized to a particular tissue type. Alignment of nearly full-length genomes, NS1 and capsid genes determined that one in five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6–99.5% identity with North American strains) was the closest relative North American strains. Conclusions: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North America and show that the virus is present in multiple geographic locations in the United States and Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic animals is relatively low. Furthermore, all PPV6 genomes found in North America are closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in healthy pigs from Tianjin province, China, in 2014.",,"Schirtzinger, E. E.;Suddith, A.

1860,Detection of a Novel Bovine Astrovirus in a Cow with Encephalitis,"Encephalitis can be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. In most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified as the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous disorders and died within 6 days of the onset of clinical symptoms. Histopathology revealed acute encephalitis predominantly in the brainstem and trigeminal ganglion ganglionitis with massive neuronal necrosis in both the brain and the ganglion. However, a panel of relevant bacterial and viral infections of cattle can be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain sample from a cow was analyzed using a metagenomic approach with next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) assay line can be identified using RIEMS and the finding confirmed by a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome length of bovine astrovirus (BoAstV) belonging to the Astroviridae family in the Mamastrovirus genus is 6478 bp. Sequence identities of 71% of a sheep astrovirus from the USA and Switzerland and between 69% and 69% of two recently identified bovine astroviruses were detected. The latter was also linked to cases of encephalitis in cattle.

1862,Insect iridescent virus type 6 encodes a polypeptide related to the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II.,"Cytoplasmic DNA viruses encode a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) required for transcription of viral genes. The amino acid sequences of the known major subunits of ddRPs contain highly conserved regions. Oligonucleotide primers from two conserved domains [RQP(T/S)LH and NADFDGDE] were used in PCR experiments to detect the corresponding gene of the insect iridescent virus type 6 genome, also known as Chilo iridescent virus (CIV). . A specific DNA product of about 150 bp could be amplified and used as a hybridization probe against the CIV gene library to identify the gene of interest. The gene encoding DdRP was identified in the EcoRI fragments M (7099 bp) and L (7400 bp) of CIV DNA between map units 0.310 and 0.347 (7990 bp). The DNA nucleotide sequence (3153 bp) of the gene encoding the largest subunit of DdRP (RPO1) was determined. Northern blot hybridization revealed the presence of a 3.4 kb RNA transcript hybridizing to the CIV DdRP gene in CIV-infected cells. This predicted viral protein consists of 1051 amino acid residues (120K) and showed significantly higher similarity to the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II than homologous proteins of vaccinia virus and African swine fever virus. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the putative RPO1 of CIV may have evolved from RNA polymerase II after the splitting of three types of eukaryotic RNA polymerases. The putative RP01 of CIV lacked the C-terminal domain conserved in eukaryotic, eubacterial, and other viral RNA polymerases and was similar in this respect to RNA polymerases of Archaea. It is hypothesized that the equivalent of the C-terminal domain may be found in another subunit of the CIV DdRP encoded by an unidentified viral gene.",,"Schnitzler, P.;Sonntag, K.

1863,Molecular evolution of influenza viruses,"There are two different mechanisms by which influenza viruses can evolve: (1) Because the RNA genome of influenza viruses is segmented, new strains can be suddenly produced by reclassification, creating new pandemic strains, for example, during antigenic shift. (2) New viruses evolve relatively slowly through gradual mutation and selection, for example, during antigenic or genetic drift. Influenza A viruses have been found in several vertebrate species where they form immiscible reservoirs. Human influenza A viruses do not spread in birds and vice versa, the species barrier to pigs is relatively low, so pigs can act as 'mixing vessels' for the creation of new pandemic reassortants. double infection of pigs by human and avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic studies revealed that about 100 years ago, an avian influenza A virus crossed the species barrier, possibly forming new stable human and classical swine lineages first into pigs and then into humans. In 1979, again, an avian virus emerged in the Northern European pig population, creating another stable pig lineage. From 1979 to 1985, Northern European swine isolates were extremely genetically unstable. A hypothesis has been put forward stating that a mutator mutation is necessary to enable the influenza virus to cross the species barrier by providing sufficient variants that it can select the most suitable ones for the new host. As long as the mutator mutation is still present, such a virus should be able to cross the species barrier a second time, as it did about 100 years ago. While the latest swine isolates from northern Germany are genetically stable again, we still need to be vigilant to see if a Northern European swine virus emerges in the human population in the near future.",,"Scholtissek, C.",1995.0,,10.1007/bf01728660,0

A phylogenetic analysis of the NP gene revealed that all mammalian influenza viruses - directly or indirectly - descended from an avian ancestor. The steady incorporation of an avian influenza A virus into a mammalian species appears to be a relatively rare event, the most recent occurring in 1979 when such an avian virus was introduced to pigs in Northern Europe, giving rise to a new lineage. At least two simultaneous events are required for such a new and stable entry: (1) the new species must be infected, and (2) a mutation in the polymerase complex will result in a large number of different different types, some of which can rapidly adapt to the new host (or any unusual environment). variant. Since such mutations may only be advantageous during times of stress, variants with less error-prone polymerases may reappear after adaptation. Examples of such fluctuations in mutation and evolution rates are discussed in this short review.",,"Scholtissek, C.;Ludwig, S.;Fitch, W. M.",1993.0,,,0

Special attention has been given to adenoviruses because of their ability to transform host cells, their possible applications in vector technology, and their phylogeny. Primary structure of the Tupaia adenovirus (TAV) genome infecting Tupaia spp. (tree mouse) was determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically assumed to be the basis of the phylogenetic tree of mammals and are often used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavioral research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp in length and has a G+C content of 49.96% and has 166-bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of these are estimated to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and sequence and positional conservation. Thirty viral OPFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, arranged into separate early and late genome regions as known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant depletion of CG dinucleotides at the genome ends, suggesting methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa2, and 100,000 molecular weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV forms a distinct branch within the evolutionary lineage of TAV. took it out.

Since most (re)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to learn about viral pathogens found in wildlife reservoirs from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, free-range wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be difficult and the availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomic platforms allows for a more comprehensive inventory of viruses found in the wild. We report a metagenomic viral investigation of a herd of West Arctic barren land reindeer (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 free-range reindeer was investigated by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied extensive iterative sequencing results to identify the taxonomic units of each metagenome.

1867,Holstein Friesian Lethal Haplotype 5 (HH5) Results of Complete Deletion of TBF1M and Cholesterol Deficiency (CDH) from an ERV-(LTR) Insertion in the Coding Region of APOB,"BACKGROUND: With the availability of large SNP data for several economically important cattle breeds, haplotype tests have been performed to identify unknown recessive disorders. A number of pseudo-lethal haplotypes have been revealed in Holstein Friesian cattle, and causative mutations in candidate genes have been identified for at least seven of them. However, several lethal haplotypes still remain unclear. Here we report the molecular genetic causes of lethal haplotype 5 (HH5) and cholesterol deficiency (CDH). A targeted enrichment for known genomic regions was followed by large parallel sequencing to interrogate causative mutations in a case/control approach. METHODS: Targeted enrichment for known genomic regions, followed by large parallel sequencing, was used in a case/control approach. PCRs causing mutations were developed and compared to routine imposition in 2,100 (HH5) and 3,100 (CDH) cattle. RESULTS: HH5 results from a 138 kbp deletion ranging from 93,233 kb to 93,371 kb on chromosome 9 (BTA9) harboring dimethyl-adenosine transferase 1 (TFB1M) only. The deletion breakpoints are surrounded by the bovine long interspersed nuclear elements Bov-B (upstream) and L1ME3 (downstream), suggesting a homologous recombination/deletion event. TFB1M di-methylates adenine residues in the hairpin loop at the 3'-end of mitochondrial 12S rRNA, essential for the synthesis and function of the small ribosomal subunit of mitochondria. Homozygous TFB1M-/- mice were reported to exhibit embryonal lethality with developmental defects. 2.8% allelic frequency was determined for the German HF population. CDH results from a 1.3 kbp insertion of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV2-1-LTR_BT) into exon 5 of the APOB gene at BTA11:77,959kb. The insertion is flanked by 6bp copies of the target site as described for insertions mediated by retroviral integrases. An early stop codon is produced in the open reading frame of the APOB, resulting in the protein being truncated to a length of only <140 amino acids. These premature discontinuations have been shown to result in inadequate excretion of chylomicrons from intestinal cells, resulting in cholesterol malabsorption. The allelic frequency of this mutation in the German HF population was 6.7%, which is significantly higher than what has been reported so far. Compared to PCR assays that directly remove genetic variants, the routine calculation used so far has shown a diagnostic sensitivity as low as 91% (HH5) and 88% (CDH) for both, with a high specificity (>=99.7). CONCLUSION: With the availability of direct genetic testing, it will now be possible to more effectively reduce carrier frequency and ultimately eliminate disturbances in HF populations. In addition, the presence of repetitive genomic elements (RE) in both diseases underlines the evolutionary importance of RE.",,"Schutz, E.;Wehrhahn, C.;Wanjek, M.;Bortfeld, R.;Wemheuer, W.

1868,animal noroviruses,"Among the enteric caliciviruses, noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus, one of the four recognized genera in the family Caliciviridae. These single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses are highly variable, both genetically and antigenically. Several animal enteric caliciviruses have been described that are morphologically indistinguishable and genetically closely related to human noroviruses. The first bovine enteric noroviruses were identified in Great Britain and are known as Newbury Agent 2. At least three genetic clusters of porcine noroviruses converge into genogroup II noroviruses. Human noroviruses are the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages. In the US, they are associated with approximately 30-50% of all foodborne outbreaks. So far, noroviruses have not been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis in immunocompetent animals. Although human norovirus can grow in a complex 3D culture system, neither bovine nor porcine noroviruses can reproduce in cell culture. However, the recently discovered murine noroviruses can replicate in cell culture and are therefore used as model viruses to study human noroviruses. This review focuses on virus classification, virion structure, pathogenesis, epidemiology, immune response and diagnosis of animal noroviruses in comparison with human noroviruses. Classification of animal enteric caliciviruses within the genus Norovirus raises the question of whether transmission to humans from an animal reservoir can occur. Answering this question is important in determining the risk of interspecies infection, which affects the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses and thus complicates the control of human norovirus infections.",,"Scipioni, A.;Mauroy, A.;VinjÃ©, J.;Thiry, E.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.11.012,0
1869,Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analysis of fusion protein and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein genes among Newcastle disease virus isolates. Phylogenetic relationships among Paramyxovirinae based on their binding glycoprotein sequences,"Highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates are List A pathogens for commercial poultry and reports on their isolation between member states should be made to the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). The virus is classified as a member of the order Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Two interacting surface glycoproteins, fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins play important roles in NDV binding and fusion of cells during infection. Antibodies to F or HN proteins are capable of virus neutralization; however, no full-length sequences are available for these genes from recently obtained virulent isolates. Therefore, nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the F and HN protein genes were obtained from 16 NDV isolates representing highly virulent viruses from worldwide sources for comparison with older virulent isolates and vaccine strains. The F protein amino acid sequence was relatively conserved among isolates, conserving potential glycosylation sites and C residues for disulfide bonds. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the cleavage site among the more virulent isolates, whereas low virulence viruses did not. However, a Eurasian collared pigeon virus had a K114Q substitution at the F cleavage site, which is unique among NDV isolates. The HN protein among NDV isolates preserved predicted catalytic and active site residues required for neuraminidase activity and hemagglutination. The length of HN for the Eurasian collared pigeon isolate and a previously reported heat-resistant virulent isolate was longer than for the other more recent lethal isolates. Phylogenetically, NDV isolates were divided into four groups, with newer virulent isolates forming a diverse branch, while all avian paramyxoviruses formed their own branch unlike other members of Paramyxoviridae. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Seal, B.

1870,Biological properties of Newcastle disease virus vaccines and characterization of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein gene by sequence analysis,"Six commercially available monovalent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) live vaccines were examined for their biological and genomic stability compared to their indicated parent viruses. Thermostability of hemagglutinin at 56°C for 5 minutes was consistently observed among the majority of vaccine viruses. One exception was a recently developed NDV vaccine isolated from turkeys with a thermostability of 15 minutes. Neuraminidase activity, as measured by the elution rate of agglutinated red blood cells, varied between vaccine viruses and correlated with that of the parent isolate. Virulence, as measured by the intracerebral pathogenicity index, was between 0 and 0.39 among NDV vaccine-type viruses and was within the range of avirulent lentogens. The sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site from all NDV vaccine isolates studied was consistent with that for lentogens. The entire hemagglutinin-neurominidase gene sequence was 98% similar among all NDV vaccine viruses studied, and the phylogenetic classification of commercial vaccine strains correlated with their respective parent viruses. In conclusion, the commercially produced NDV vaccines reported here appear to be relatively stable when mass-produced in avian embryonic eggs.",,"Seal, B. S.;King, D. J.;Bennett, J.

1871,Bird response to Newcastle disease virus,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is classified as a member of the Mononegavirales superfamily in the Paramyxoviridae family. This virus family is divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. In 1993, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy rearranged the order of the genus Paramyxovirus and placed NDV within the genus Rubulavirus among Paramyxovirinae. The enveloped virus has a 15,186 kb negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome encoding an RNA-oriented RNA polymerase in the 5' to 3' direction, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein, fusion protein, matrix protein, phosphoprotein, and nucleoprotein. The virus has a wide host range and most birds have been reported to be infected with NDV. The isolates are characterized by virulence in chickens and are divided into three main pathotypes depending on the severity of the disease. Lentogenic isolates are low virulence, while medium virulence viruses are called mesogenic. Highly virulent viruses that cause high mortality in birds are termed neurotropic or viscerotropic velogenic. Velogenic NDV are List A pathogens that must be reported to the International Office of Epizootics, and outbreaks result in strict trade embargoes. The primary molecular determinant for NDV pathogenicity is the fusion protein cleavage site amino acid sequence. Vaccination for NDV is primarily done by mass administration of live virus vaccines among commercial poultry. Although protection is measured by the presence of antibodies to NDV, vaccinated B-cell depleted chickens are resistant to the disease. Consequently, immune protection includes responses that are not currently fully defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Seal, B. S.;King, D. J.;Sellers, H.

1872,Fusion protein predicted amino acid sequence of first US avian pneumovirus isolate and lack of heterogeneity among other US isolates,"Avian pneumovirus (APV) was first isolated from turkeys in the mid-western United States following the emergence of turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) in 1996. Subsequently, several APV isolates were obtained from the north-central USA. The matrix (M) and fusion (F) protein genes of these isolates were analyzed for sequence heterogeneity and compared with European APV subtypes A and B. Among the US isolates, the M gene shared more than 98% nucleotide sequence identity and only one nonsynonymous change occurred. a single US isolate. Although the F gene among US APV isolates shares 98% nucleotide sequence identity, nine conserved substitutions were detected in the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the F protein of the US APV isolate had 72% sequence identity to the F protein of APV subtype A and 71% sequence identity to the F protein of APV subtype B. This compares to 83% sequence identity between the APV subtype. A and B predicted the amino acid sequences of protein F. The US isolates were phylogenetically distinguishable from their European counterparts based on the F gene nucleotide or predicted amino acid sequences. The absence of sequence heterogeneity among US APV subtypes indicates that these viruses have maintained a relatively stable population since the first TRT outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of protein F among APV isolates supports the classification of US isolates as a new APV subtype C. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BV",,"Seal, B. S.;Sellers, H.

1873,Genomic sequences of low virulence avian paramyxovirus-1 (Newcastle disease virus) isolates from live bird markets in North America are not relevant to commonly used commercial vaccine strains,"Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1), also called Newcastle disease virus (NDV), low virulence variants have been isolated from chickens, ducks and other unidentified species found in live bird markets of the northeastern United States. These isolates were characterized as APMV-1 by the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using NDV-specific polyclonal antisera. However, the isolates did not react with a monoclonal antibody with specificity for a wide variety of APMV-1 isolates. Although only highly virulent isolates require reporting to international regulatory agencies, the ability to accurately identify APMV-1 types is important for control and regulatory purposes. The protein gel patterns of the purified isolates were similar to previously reported APMV-1 and anti-NDV polyclonal sera recognized viral proteins. For the three isolates, oligonucleotide primers specific for the nucleoprotein, fusion protein and polymerase genes of NDV were used to synthesize cDNA using viral RNA as template. About 12 kb of the genome was then sequenced for three isolates containing the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion (F) protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein genes and a 5 portion of the polymerase gene. The isolates had an F protein cleavage site sequence of ERQER/LVG, indicating low virulence viruses that were phylogenetically separated with other unique NDV isolates designated as lineage 6 genotype. In addition, a four amino acid adduct was detected in the predicted phosphoprotein, consistent with the ""rule of six"" among paramyxoviruses. These APMV-1 genotypes have not been previously reported in North America and further confirm the heterogeneous genetic makeup of these commercially important pathogens found worldwide.

1874,Evolutionary History and Phylogeography of Rabies Viruses Associated with Outbreaks in Trinidad,"Bat rabies is a disease of emerging public health importance in the United States. The Caribbean island of Trinidad experiences periodic outbreaks in its animal population. We performed molecular characterization of Trinidad rabies virus (RABV) and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate which outbreaks were a result of in situ evolution versus import of the virus from the nearby South American mainland. Trinidadian RABV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with sequences related to Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat). They fell into two largely temporally defined lineages, called Trinidad I and II. The Trinidad I lineage, which includes the 1997–2000 sequences (all but two from the northeast of the island), was most closely related to RABV from Ecuador (2005, 2007), French Guiana (1990) and Venezuela (1993, 1994). ). Trinidad II consisted of sequences from the southwestern part of the island divided into two groups: Trinidad IIa, each containing one sequence from 2000 and 2007, and Trinidad IIb, containing all 2010 sequences. The Trinidad II TV series were most closely related to the Brazilian (1999, 2004) and Uruguay (2007, 2008) TV series. Phylogeographic analyzes support three separate RABV entries from the mainland from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages originated. Estimated dates for entries and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution in Trinidad after each entry. These data also show the joint circulation of Trinidadian lineages I and IIa during the year 2000. In light of these findings and the possible vampire bat origin of Trinidad RABV, further studies should be conducted to explore the relationship between RABV spatio-temporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology. especially any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.",,"Seetahal, J.

Colonization of wild game pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in Scotland,"Campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial foodborne diarrheal disease worldwide. Chicken meat is considered the main source of human infection; however, C.Â jejuni and C.Â coli have also been reported in a number of livestock and wildlife species, including pheasants. Wild pheasant meat reaches the consumer's table due to hunting, but there is a lack of information regarding the risk of Campylobacter infection in humans. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in wild game pheasants in Scotland, to identify the main sequence types (STs) available and to evaluate their public health impact. A total of 287 cecum specimens were collected from five Scottish sites during the 2013/2014 hunting season. Campylobacter was detected and enumerated using standard culture methods. PCR and High Throughput Multiple Locus Sequence Typing (HiMLST) were used for species identification and sequence typing. In total, 36.6% (nâ€¯=â€¯105; 95% CI: 14-59.2) of the 287 cecum samples were Campylobacter positive. Using PCR, 62.6% (nâ€¯=â€¯99) of the samples were identified as C.Â coli and 37.4% as C.Â jejuni. HiMLST (nâ€¯=â€¯80) identified 19 different STs. ST-828 (nâ€¯=â€¯19) was the most common, followed by ST-827 (nâ€¯=â€¯12) and ST19 (nâ€¯=â€¯7). Of the 19 isolated STs, sixteen are present in humans and eight are C. coli STs, which account for 6.96% of human infections, but the overall public health risk from pheasant meat is still considered low.",,"Seguino, A.;Chintoan-Uta, C.;Smith, S.

Both SPPV and ORFV have caused clinically significant infections among sheep. Affected sheep showed skin lesions around the mouth or all over the body. A reliable diagnosis should therefore confirm the etiology of the infection and subsequently reduce the spread of diseases in the affected areas. Clinical samples were investigated by virus isolation, PCR and real-time PCR tests. In addition, PCR products of SPPV and ORFV isolates were sequenced and aligned to reference isolates for phylogenetic analyses. Laboratory diagnostics showed that real-time PCR testing is more accurate and sensitive than traditional PCR and virus isolation. In the phylogenetic analysis of the A29L gene, no genetic differences were observed between the SPPV field strains and the strains showed 100% homology with two SPPV isolates from Kazakhstan and one isolate from Turkey.

1877,Molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated from broiler and layer chicken farms in Egypt in 2012.,"One of the biggest problems with avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the frequent emergence of new variants. In this study, 205 tracheal swabs and organs were collected from broiler and layer farms from 19 provinces across Egypt during January-August 2012. Chickens showed respiratory signs and death. Of the samples examined, 130 (approximately 64%) were positive for IBV by real-time RT-PCR. 13 IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryos was performed after three blind consecutive passages after studies, and the hypervariable region of spike protein1 (SP1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to examine genetic variation among isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the resulting sequences of 13 isolates, compared with other strains of IBV from the Middle East and worldwide, revealed that 11 out of 13 isolates had close associations with the Israeli variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology. increased to 89.9% and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates had close association with CR/88121 and 4/91 viruses with 95% and 96% identity, respectively. This study demonstrates the existence of two variant IBV groups circulating in Egypt in 2012. Group I was similar but distinguishable from the Israeli variant IS/885 and group II was related to vaccine strains 4/91 and CR/88121.

1883,Genetic diversity of the Newcastle disease virus in Pakistan: A nationwide perspective.,"Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the deadliest diseases for poultry worldwide. The disease is endemic in Pakistan and recurrent outbreaks are regularly reported in wild captive, rural and commercial poultry flocks. While efforts have been made to characterize the causative agent in parts of the country, the genetic nature of the strains circulating throughout Pakistan is currently lacking. Tools and methods. To determine the genetics of NDV, 452 blood samples were collected from 113 herds from all provinces of Pakistan and showed a high mortality rate (30-80%). The samples represented domesticated poultry (broiler, layer, and rural) as well as wild captive birds (pigeons, turkeys, pheasants, and peacocks). Samples were screened by real-time PCR for both matrix and fusion genes (1792 bp), positive samples were subjected to amplification of the whole fusion gene followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site showed the presence of the motif (112RK/RQRRâ†“F117) typical for velogenic strains of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the fusion gene showed that all isolates belong to line 5 of NDV, except for the isolates collected from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region. A higher resolution of the phylogenetic analysis of lineage 5 showed the distribution of Pakistani NDV strains to 5b. However, isolates from KPK belonged to line 4c; first report of such a lineage from this province. Conclusions: Taken together, the data showed the prevalence of multiple NDV lineages in different bird populations, including wild captive birds. Such understanding is crucial to support the nature of circulating NDV strains, their potential for interspecies transmission, and disease diagnosis and control strategies.

Infections with both autonomous and helper virus-dependent parvoviruses are common in both human and animal populations, and many animals are home to a number of different parvoviral species. Despite the epidemiological importance of parvoviruses, the existence and role of genome recombination within or between parvoviral species is not well defined. Here we show that natural recombination may be common in these viruses. The different genome regions of both porcine parvoviruses and Aleutian mink disease viruses have conflicting phylogenetic histories, providing evidence for recombination in each of these two species. Furthermore, rodent parvoviruses show complex evolutionary histories for discrete genomic regions, suggesting recombination at the interspecies level. © 2007 SGM.",,"Shackelton, L.

Forty-five isolates that formed five sequence clusters could not be classified by the current classification. Binary DNA distance analysis showed different categories of associations, which required a new classification system. We suggest four main sequence groups AD with 25-37% variation. Groups A and B are further divided into subtypes that differ by 15-27%. Group D and four of the seven group A subtypes, A3, A4, A5 and A7, are formed by new Swiss isolates. Molecular epidemiology revealed that Swiss B1 strains did not differ much from French, Brazilian or US strains, suggesting that the virus was spread through the international pet trade. Furthermore, infection of goats by A3 or A4 subspecies was significantly associated with documented contact with sheep that also harbored these subspecies, thus suggesting that sheep-to-goat transmission occurs regularly.

The same viral agents are also detected in healthy flocks and their role in health and disease is questioned. To better understand eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles that do not involve the use of density gradients to generate viral metagenome data. In this study, the sequence results of three tissue processing methods were evaluated and a data analysis pipeline was established for RNA viruses from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, a view of the RNA viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5 week old turkey is presented, using best method and increasing sequencing depth. Viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together make up 76.3% of the total viruses identified. The species-level rarity curve also implied that the majority of species diversity was included in increasing sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other viral families were in very low abundance.",,"Shah, J.

1887,Enhancement of Intestinal RNA Virus Community of Healthy Broiler Chickens,"Various RNA viruses such as astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus and parvovirus have been detected in both healthy and diseased commercial poultry flocks. The aim of this study was to characterize (a) the development of the RNA viral community in the small intestine of healthy broilers from hatch to 6 weeks of age (market age) and (b) the contribution of the breeder source to the bird. the age of development of the community structure. Intestinal tissue samples were collected from breeders and their descendants, processed for viral RNA extraction and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq sequencing technology, resulting in a 100 bp PE read. The results from this study showed that the breeder source affects the RNA viral community only at brood, but then the environment, i.e. bird age, has a more significant effect. The most abundant RNA viral family detected at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of age is Astroviridae, whose abundance decreases with age and Picornaviridae abundance increases with age.",,"Shah, J. D.;Desai, P.

1888,Analysis of Host Parasite Incompatibility in Papilloma Virus Evolution Using Significance Sampling,"Papillomaviruses (PVs) are a family of viruses that infect several mammalian and non-mammalian species that cause cervical cancer in humans. The evolutionary history of PVs is not well understood as they are associated with a wide variety of host species. Mismatches between phylogenetic trees of various viral genes, as well as between these genes and host phylogenies, suggest violations of historical viral recombination as well as strict virus-host co-speciation. However, the extent of recombination events between PVs is unclear and there is little evidence to support the theory of PV propagation via end-host transfers. Using Bayesian phylogenetic methods, we investigated the incompatibility between PV genes and hence the possibility of recombination. We found substantial evidence for phylogenetic incompatibility among the six PV genes E1, E2, E6, E7, L1 and L2, suggesting significant recombination. Analysis of E1 and L1 phylogenies suggests ancestral recombination events. We also describe a new method to study alternative host-parasite association mechanisms by applying importance sampling to Bayesian divergence time estimation. This new approach is not limited to the knowledge of a fixed viral tree topology or viral divergence times, multiple parasite taxa per host can be included and distinguish between pre-detachment of virus before host speciation and host transfer of virus following speciation. Using this method, we find that the pre-separation of PV lineages associated with the ancestral mammalian host gave rise to at least 6 PV lineages prior to the speciation of this host. These PV lineages then followed previous paths of divergence and co-speciation to eventually become associated with existing host species. Only one prime instance of a host transfer is supported; Transfer of the ancestral L1 gene between a Primate and a Hystricognathi host is based on divergence times between upsilon human type 41 and hedgehog PVs.",,"Shah, S.

1889,Fecal virus of pigs on a high-density farm,"Pigs are an important source of protein worldwide, but they are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections that can infect humans. Modern farming conditions can also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. Here, we describe the metagenomic-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheal piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting high levels of asymptomatic infections. Pigs with diarrhea shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were associated with the RNA virus families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae, while 1% were associated with the small DNA virus families Circoviridae and Parvoviridae. The identified porcine RNA viruses consisted of cobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and tescoviruses, in descending order of sequence reads. Almost complete genomes of many new strains of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses have been produced and analyzed phylogenetically. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins and two quite different members of the Picornavirales order were also characterized. Based on the closest sequence similarities, the possible origin of these viral genomes from protozoans and nematodes infecting pigs is discussed. In summary, an unbiased study of viruses in the feces of heavily farmed animals has revealed frequent coinfections with a wide variety of viruses that provide favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral studies in animals can easily document the circulation of known and novel viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and the prospective assessment of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential.

It causes hand, foot, and mouth disease in infants and children and in a small percentage of cases progresses to central nervous system infection ranging from aseptic meningitis to fatal encephalitis. Sporadic cases of EV71 infection occur worldwide, but large outbreaks have recently occurred in Southeast Asia and China.

1891,A naturally occurring recombinant enterovirus expresses a torovirus deubiquitinase,"Enteroviruses (EVs) are involved in a wide variety of diseases in humans and animals. In this study, a novel enterovirus (enterovirus strain G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic specimen from a neonatal swine diarrhea case and identified using metagenomic and whole genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypical EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Remarkably, a 582 nucleotide insertion was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome flanked by 3Cpro cleavage sites at the 5= and 3= ends. This insert encodes a protease predicted with 54 to 68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and a catalytic site characteristic of minimal PLP catalytic sites. This structure is similar to that of the core catalytic domains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15]-removal) enzymes in the host cell. substrates. Importantly, this novel enterovirus-derived recombinant ToV-PLP protein also showed potent deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and the ability to suppress IFN-Î² expression. Using reverse genetics, we generated a ToV-PLP knockout recombinant virus. Compared to wild-type virus, ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immunity genes in infected cells. These results demonstrate that ToV-PLP functions as an innate immune antagonist; enterovirus G can therefore gain fitness from a recombination event through the acquisition of ToV-PLP.",,"Shang, P.;Misra, S.;Hause, B.;Fang, Y.",2017.0,,10.1128/jvi.00450-17,0
1892,Molecular epidemiological investigation of swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Northwest China from 2007 to 2010.,"Pig reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine disease affecting pigs worldwide. Northwest China has a sparse population of pigs and there is currently no comprehensive information available on PRRSV infection. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological features and genetic diversity of PRRSV from this region. Isolated tissue or serum samples were collected at 322 sites twice over 2 years from 15 herds from aborted pig fetuses or pigs with respiratory disease. PRRSV infection was determined and virus strains were classified by GP5 sequencing. We found that 35.9% of animals were PRRSV-positive and the mean prevalence was 46.5% and 29.3% in 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. To further investigate the genetic diversity of PRRSV samples collected from 2007 to 2010, 32 strains were isolated for GP5 sequencing and analysis and phylogenetic trees were constructed based on their GP5 amino acid sequences. All PRRSVs were of the North American genotype and belonged to the highly pathogenic HP-PRRSV subgenotype. The isolates from Xinjiang province formed a tightly clustered branch and were closely related to an evolutionary intermediate subgroup isolate. Virus sequences from 2007 to 2008 were compared with those from the same swarm from 2009 to 2010. After 2009, new mutations were found in isolates and focused on nucleotides in the GP5 antibody trap epitope. From 2007 to 2010, PRRSV strains in Northwest China were similar to those from other parts of China, with some regional characteristics.

1893,Occurrence of bird flu H9N2 in Bangladesh,"Avian influenza subtype H9N2 is endemic to many avian species in Asia and the Middle East and has contributed to the generation of potential pandemic threats, H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8. H9N2 viruses that spread to Bangladesh acquired multiple gene segments, possibly from highly pathogenic (HP) H7N3 viruses found in Pakistan and currently circulating together with HP H5N1. However, the origin and geographical origin of these H9N2 viruses are not clear. We characterized the complete genetic sequences of 37 Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses isolated in 2011-2013 and investigated their intersubtype and intersubtype genetic diversity by tracing their occurrence in relation to other H9N2 viruses isolated from neighboring countries. H9N2 viruses in Bangladesh are homogeneous with several mammalian host-specific markers and a novel H9N2 subsequence in which the hemagglutinin (HA) gene is derived from an Iranian H9N2 lineage (Middle East-B Iran), neuraminidase (NA) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2). genes H9N2 (Mideast-C Dubai) from Dubai and non-structural protein (NS), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (MP), polymerase acidic (PA) and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) genes HP H7N3 from Pakistan. Different H9N2 genotypes have been identified in Bangladesh, modified by other reassortants in 2006 and 2009. Phylogenetic and molecular analyzes indicate that the current genotype is descended from the prototypical H9N2 lineage (G1) that circulated in poultry in China and arrived in Bangladesh via the Middle East poultry trade in the late 1990s, and this genotype was later reclassified to H7N3. and H9N2 strains originate from Pakistan and spread to India. Therefore, continued surveillance of Bangladeshi HP H5N1, H7N3 and H9N2 is warranted to determine further evolution and adaptation to humans.",,"Shanmuganatham, K.;Feeroz, M.

1894,"Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the fusion (F) epitope for Egyptian pestes des petit ruminant virus (PPRV) predicts unique criteria, designated as Egypt 2009","Peste des petit ruminant virus was previously isolated and serologically identified from suspected outbreaks of PPR among sheep and goats in 2006 in Qalyubia Province, Egypt. In this study, six of these PPRV isolates were confirmed using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The primer set for the fusion protein (F) epitope, followed by cDNA, was sent to the Animal Health Institute of England, Pirbright, UK, for analysis by matching the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic analysis characteristics of this F protein gene with other reference world recorded isolates. The gene sequencing the 322 nucleotide cDNA fragment of the fusion protein gene was obtained. The isolates showed a unique phylogenetic analysis not previously identified internationally and identified as Egypt 2009. Moreover; using sequences obtained from this gene encoding protein; Egyptian PPRVs were grouped as the fleet genetic ally of lineage IV.

1895,Molecular Epidemiology and Complete Genome Characterization of H1N1pdm Virus from India,"Background: Influenza A virus is one of the world's largest uncontrolled pathogens and causes seasonal epidemics as well as global pandemics. This is evidenced by the continuation of the 2009 swine-borne pandemic H1N1 Influenza A virus, which emerged recently, triggering the first true pandemic in the last 40 years. Over its evolution, the virus has acquired many mutations, and multiple unidentified molecular determinants are likely responsible for the 2009 H1N1 virus's ability to cause increased disease severity in humans. The availability of limited data on the whole genome hinders continued monitoring of such events. Outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality have been reported from all over the country. Methods/Results: Given the large number of clinical infection cases, whole genome-based sequence characterization of Indian H1N1pdm virus and phylogenetic analysis relative to circulating global viruses were performed to reveal the phylodynamic pattern of H1N1pdm virus in India between 2009 and 2011. Clade VII was observed as a major circulating clade in the phylogenetic analysis. Selection pressure analysis revealed 18 positively selected regions in the major surface proteins of the H1N1pdm virus. Conclusions: This study made it clear that chapter VII was defined as chapter that has been in circulation recently in India as well as globally. Several well-defined markers specific to VII have been subjected to positive selection during virus evolution. Continuous monitoring of the H1N1pdm virus is guaranteed to monitor virus development and further transmission. This study will serve as a baseline for future surveillance, as well as for the development of appropriate therapeutics. Â© 2013 Sharma et al.",,"Sharma, S.;Joshi, G.;Dash, P.

1898,Comparative metagenomics of microbial traits in ocean viral communities,"Viral genomes often contain genes recently obtained from microbes. In some cases (for example, psbA), the proteins encoded by these genes have been shown to be important for viral replication. In this study, we characterize previously undetected microbial metabolic capabilities hidden in the genomes of uncultured marine viral communities, using a unique search strategy on Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomes combined with marine virome and microbiome pyrosequencing-based datasets. A total of 34 microbial gene families were detected in 452 viral GOS scaffolds. Most of the accessory metabolic genes found in these scaffolds have never been reported in phages. The host genes detected in viruses are mainly split between genes encoding different energy metabolism pathways such as electron transport and newly identified photosystem genes or related translational and post-translational mechanisms. Our findings suggest previously undetected ways in which marine phages adapt and improve fitness to their hosts, rather than previously known transcription level control.

1899,High prevalence and diversity of bovine astroviruses in faeces of healthy and diarrheal calves in South West Scotland,"Astroviruses (AstV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses and are one of the leading causes of infant diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in calves; therefore, we investigated whether the presence of AstV is associated with calf diarrhea. We identified several AstV strains from fecal samples of both healthy and diarrheal calves and healthy adult cattle in South West Scotland. AstV was common in calves (present in 74% (85/115) of samples) but not common in adult cattle (15% (3/20) of samples). No association was found between the presence of AstV and calf diarrhea or the presence of a particular AstV strain and calf diarrhea. AstV was strongly associated with the presence of rotavirus Group A (RVA), and a protective effect of age was evident for both AstV and RVA. Co-infections with multiple AstV strains were detected in several calves, and serial infection with different viruses was also seen by longitudinal sampling of individuals. In summary, our study found genotypically diverse AstV in faeces of calves from South West Scotland. However, no association was detected between AstV and calf diarrhea, suggesting that the virus did not play a primary role in the etiology of calf diarrhea in the study group. (C) 2015 Authors.

1900,Rapidly fermentable substance modulates interactions between rumen commensals and toll-like receptors in enhancing immune tolerance of goat rumen,"It remains unclear whether carbohydrate non-dietary fiber (NFC), a rapidly fermentable substance, affects rumen immune homeostasis through modulation of interactions of rumen microbiota and epithelial fee-like receptors (TLRs). A combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCRs was applied to study the synergistic responses of ruminal microbiota and epithelial TLRs to dietary NFC switch in the goat model. The results showed that the 31% NFC diet resulted in radical increases in the richness and diversity of the rumen microbiota. The phylum Verrucomicrobia expanded most significantly, while the opportunistic pathogens, namely Rikenella, Anaeroplasm and Olsenella, decreased significantly. In the rumen epithelium, significantly increased expressions of TLR1, 6, 10 were associated with significantly decreased expressions of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Constrained correlation analysis showed that increased commensal bacterial abundance in Verrucomicrobia subdivision 5 contributed to the regulation of TLR10 expression. Finally, significantly increased concentrations of rumen short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were observed in goats fed the 31% NFC diet, coupled with significantly upregulated expressions of epithelial genes involved in SCFA absorption. Thus, NFC-induced expansion of the rumen microbiota promoted epithelial tolerance by increasing TLR10 signaling intensity. The newly established balance benefited the transport of ruminal energy substances into the blood.",,"Shen, H.;Lu, Z.;Chen, Z.;Wu, Y.;Shen, Z.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01812,0

1903,Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of H9N2 influenza viruses from chickens in Southern China from 2012 to 2013.,"As part of our ongoing influenza surveillance program in southern China, 19 field strains of H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from flocks of dead or diseased chickens in southern China's Guangdong province between 2012 and 2013. these strains were sequenced and analyzed, and phylogenetic analysis showed that 12 of the 19 isolates belonged to the h9.4.2.5 line and the other seven to h9.4.2.6. Specifically, we found that all viruses isolated in 2013 belonged to the h9.4.2. The h9.4.2.5 viruses contained a PSRSSRâ†“GLF motif at the HA cleavage site, while the h9.4.2.6 viruses contained a PARSSRâ†“GLF at the same position. Most of the isolates in the h9.4.2.5 line lost one potential glycosylation site at residues 200-202 and had an additional one at residues 295-297 in HA1. Notably, 19 isolates had an amino acid substitution (Q226L) at the receptor binding site, indicating that the viruses have potential affinity to bind to the human-like receptor. This study demonstrates the importance of continuous surveillance of new H9N2 strains to better prepare for the next outbreak or pandemic outbreak of H9N2 AIV infections in chicken flocks.",,"Shen, H.

1904,Genomic and evolutionary characterization of a novel influenza-C-like virus from pigs.,"We recently described the isolation of a novel influenza virus from pigs in the United States exhibiting respiratory disease distantly related to human influenza C virus. Based on genetic, biochemical and morphological analysis, the virus was tentatively classified as C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). To better understand the genetics and evolution of this new pathogen, we performed a comprehensive analysis of its sequence and phylogeny. The results showed that C/OK and human influenza C viruses share a conserved set of predicted functional domains in the mechanism of viral RNA genome replication and viral entry, but vary in important functional regions. Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis showed that homologous genes of C/OK and human influenza C viruses diverged from each other, presumably several hundred to several thousand years ago. Taken together, the findings described in this study support and extend our previous observations that C/OK is a genetically and evolutionarily distinct influenza virus in the Orthomyxoviridae family. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Vienna.",,"Sheng, Z.;Ran, Z.;Wang, D.;Hoppe, A.

Although several complete PHEV nucleotide sequences have been reported so far, they are not annotated. This study aimed to elucidate the genome characterization, phylogenesis and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The full length of the PHEV/2008 strain genome was 30,684Â bp and the G+C content was 37.27%. The genome contains at least 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by the 5'² and 3'² untranslated regions (UTR) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which have 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, respectively, were predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequence revealed that strain PHEV/2008 is genetically distinct from other known PHEV types, representing a novel genotype (GI-1).

1907,Molecular epidemiology of PRRSV: A phylogenetic perspective,"Since its initial discovery two decades ago, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been the subject of intense research due to its huge impact on the swine industry worldwide. Thanks to phylogenetic analysis, much has been learned about the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the virus. In this review, we focused on the evolutionary and epidemiological aspects of PRRSV from a phylogenetic perspective. We first described the diversity and transmission dynamics of Type 1 and 2 PRRSV, respectively. Next, we focused on the earlier evolutionary history of PRRSV: the onset time of all extant PRRSVs and an origin hypothesis were discussed. Finally, we summarize the results of previous recombination studies to evaluate the potential impact of recombination on virus epidemiology. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Shi, M.;Lam, T. T. Y.;Hon, C.

1908,Origin and molecular characterization of the human-infecting H6N1 influenza virus in Taiwan.,"In June 2013, the first human H6N1 influenza virus infection was confirmed in Taiwan. However, the origin and molecular characterization of this virus, A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1), has not been well studied so far. In this report, we performed phylogenetic and combined analyzes of this virus and compared its molecular profile/traits with other closely related species. Molecular characterization of H6N1 revealed that it is a typical avian influenza virus of low pathogenicity, which may not replicate and spread well in the upper respiratory tract of mammals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus clustered in A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013 (H6N1) and seven genes excluding PB1. For the PB1 gene, A/Taiwan/2/2013 clustered with a different H6N1 strain from A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013. While a previous study showed that the PB2, PA and M genes of A/Taiwan/2/2013 may have been derived from H5N2 viruses, combined analyzes revealed that these H5N2 viruses were derived from more recent strains than the ancestors of A. /Taiwan/2/2013. Therefore, we propose that A/Taiwan/2/2013 is a reasortant from different H6N1 strains circulating in chickens in Taiwan. Moreover, compared to avian isolates, a single P186L (H3 numbering) substitution in the H6 of the human isolate hemagglutinin can increase mammalian receptor binding and thus the pathogenicity of this strain in humans.

These H7N9 virus isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those prevailing in China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 HPAIV isolate was slightly different from that of the H7N9 LPAIV and older H7 strains. Contaminated with AIVs that are repeatedly brought into Japan, these meat products pose increased poultry and public health risks. Continuous border disease control based on the detection and culling of infected poultry and meat products is therefore essential for preventing the introduction and spread of AIVs.",,"Shibata, A.;Okamatsu, M.;Sumiyoshi, R.;Matsuno, K.;Wang, Z.

However, in many cases, most of the sequences detected originate from the host genome and bacterial flora in the gut. Here, we evaluated the applicability of S1 nuclease in deep sequencing to improve the efficiency of detecting double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses from samples. Treatment of total RNA with S1 nuclease resulted in 1.5-28.4 and 10.1-208.9-fold increases in sequence reads of group A rotavirus in fecal and viral culture samples, respectively. Also, increasing the extent of mapping to reference sequences allowed adequate genotyping using analytical software. These results demonstrate that the library construct using S1 nuclease is useful for deep sequencing in the detection of dsRNA viruses.",,"Shimada, S.;Nagai, M.;Moriyama, H.;Fukuhara, T.;Koyama, S.;Omatsu, T.;Furuya, T.;Shirai, J.;Mizutani, T.",2015.0,,10.1292/jvms.14-0607,0

The sequences of the 890 nt nucleoprotein (N) gene of these isolates were analyzed and compared with those of other previously characterized Brazilian isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three genetic RV lineages co-existing in this region. Each lineage was found to be associated with specific host species and circulate independently of each other. The first lineage was found in foxes (Dusicyon sp.) and can be distinguished from native carnivorous isolates from São Paulo, Goias, and Minas Gerais in southern and central Brazil. The second lineage was associated with insectivorous bats (Molossus spp.) and differed from vampire bat-associated RV isolates. The third lineage was found in livestock and clustered with vampire bat-associated RV isolates from Sao Paulo, Tocantins, Goias, and Matto Grosso. These results suggest that the RV of these genetic lineages circulate together in the state of Paraiba and that livestock in this region are infected with vampire bat-associated RV, suggesting that the vampire bat is the main reservoir of livestock rabies in this region.",,"Shoji, Y.;Kobayashi, Y.;Sato, G.;Gomes, A.

1912,Evidence for interspecies transmission and reclassification of influenza A viruses in pigs in southern China.,"This century's outbreaks of Asia/57, Hong Kong/68, and Russia/77 originated or re-emerged in China. Interspecies transmission and genetic reclassification of influenza viruses have been at the origin of these pandemic influenza viruses. Pigs are suspected to be the 'mixing bowl' where rediversification takes place. To explore this possibility, 104 swine flu viruses randomly collected from Southern China from 1976 to 1982, including 32 H3N2 isolates and 72 H1N1 isolates, were examined using dot blot hybridization, partial sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Viruses originally derived from humans had 29 of 32 H3N2 isolate traits; the other 3 isolates were reassortants containing genes from porcine and human influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of the polymerase B1 (PB1) genes showed that interspecies transmission from humans to pigs occurred multiple times in pigs from Southern China. All 72 H1N1 isolates were of porcine origin, characteristic of the classic porcine H1N1 influenza virus. Analysis of 624 genes of swine flu viruses from southern China failed to detect any evidence for bird flu virus genes. This contrasts with those currently found in Europe, where the majority of swine flu virus isolates are of avian origin.",,"Shu, L. L.;Lin, Y. P.;Wright, S. M.;Shortridge, K. F.;Webster, R.

1913,"Genetic heterogeneity of swine hepatitis e virus isolates from Yunnan province, China in 2011-2012.","Background: Hepatitis E is an important public health disease mainly in developing countries. Although molecular and sero-epidemiological studies of HEV have been conducted in many provinces in China, epidemiological data from Yunnan Province are limited and genotypes have not been fully characterized. In this study, the prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) detected in pigs in Yunnan province of China were evaluated. Results: Of the 187 porcine fecal samples collected in 2011, a total of 13 were HEV positive; Likewise, 7 out of 69 samples collected in 2012 gave positive results. These findings showed that the overall prevalence was 7.8% (20/256). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis results showed that there were nine strains in the samples obtained in 2011 and that 87.1% to 99.4% nucleotide sequence identity was shared between these strains; and 77.0% to 81.9%, 52.2% to 53.6%, 77.0% to 88.2%, and 77.9% to 96.8% nucleotide sequence identities represent genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. shared with the strains.

1914,Molecular detection and characterization of West Nile virus associated with multifocal retinitis in patients from South India,"Background: In late 2009/early 2010, around 2000 people were affected by a mysterious viral outbreak in the southern region of Tamil Nadu; this has particularly affected those living in coastal areas. Blood samples from affected patients were sent for clinical analysis to determine the true cause of the disease, but reports were inconclusive. Methods: This study describes clinical observations and laboratory investigations involving molecular methods performed on 170 of 2000 clinically suspected cases. These were patients presenting with ocular complications to Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were used to detect West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Further investigation of the genetic diversity of WNV involved in ocular complications has been done by sequence phylogeny. Results: Of 170 samples, 25 (15%) were positive for chikungunya IgM antibody, 10 (6%) for chikungunya antigen, and 30 (18%) for dengue IgM antibody. The remaining 105 seronegative samples were further processed for WNV detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Of 105 samples, 35 (33%) were positive for WNV IgM antibody, 15 (14%) were positive for WNV by RT-PCR, and 27 (26%) were positive for WNV in both real time. RT-PCR and RT-LAMP tests. Comparative evaluation with acute phase patient serum samples revealed 100% agreement between real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP tests. These assays had an overall higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR as they took 12 additional samples with a low copy number pattern. Further genotyping via sequence phylogeny revealed that all WNV isolates were grouped into lineage I. Conclusions: The association of West Nile virus with ocular infection during the mystery fever epidemic in South India in the first half of 2010 was clearly established by the molecular approaches used. envelope gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays, followed by nucleotide sequencing.

1915,Whole genomic sequence analysis of swine genotype 3 hepatitis E virus isolated from Shanghai,"The complete genomic nucleotide sequence of a previously identified genotype 3 hepatitis E virus (HEV), strain SAAS-JDY5, was obtained using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The genome consisted of 7225 nucleotides, excluding a poly-A tail at the 3 end, and encoding three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF-1, ORF-2 and ORF-3, 1702, 660 and 113 amino acids. , respectively. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that SAAS-JDY5 belongs to genotype 3 HEV and is most closely related to the Japanese isolate wbJYG1 (AB222184). SAAS-JDY5 shared approximately 87% nucleotide similarity with human and porcine strains from the United States, compared with 74-75% similarity with Asian (genotype 4) and Mexican strains (genotype 2). Alignment of the SAAS-JDY5 genomic sequence with reference sequences of the same genotype revealed a nucleotide substitution and a deletion at positions 5145 and 7189 (3-² UTR), respectively. Furthermore, SAAS-JDY5 contained two additional nucleotides (AC) at the very end of the 3â€²-terminal before the poly-A tail of the genome.

1916,Evolution of the cytoplasmic triple motif (TRIM) protein in cows restraining retroviral infection,"Primate triplet motif 5Î± (TRIM5Î±) proteins mediate innate intracellular resistance to retroviruses. In humans it is found in a paralogous cluster that includes TRIM5, TRIM6, TRIM34, and TRIM22. Although the orthologs TRIM6 and TRIM34 have been found in other mammals, TRIM5 has so far only been identified in primates. Cow cells exhibit early blocks against infection by several retroviruses. We identify a cytoplasmic TRIM protein encoded by LOC505265 that is responsible for restriction of infection in cow cells by several lentiviruses and N-tropic murine leukemia viruses. The susceptibility of N-tropic murine leukemia virus to 505265-mediated restriction is determined primarily by residue 110 of the viral capsid protein. Phylogenetically, bovine LOC505265 is separated by the TRIM5/TRIM6/TRIM34 group, but is not an ortholog of known TRIM genes. The B30.2/SPRY domain of 505265 exhibits long variable regions characteristic of proteins encoded by this paralogous group, showing evidence of positive selection. The cows apparently evolved a retroviral restriction factor independently of the same TRIM family that produces TRIMS in primates. Certain features of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may aid the convergent evolution of virus-restrictive factors.

1918,Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses isolated during the 2006-2008 outbreaks in Pakistan reveal genetic diversity.,"Background: Since the first recorded outbreak in the northern regions of Pakistan in early 2006, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have been isolated from commercial poultry and wild/domestic birds in different parts of Pakistan until July 2008. Different H5N1 isolates were sequenced. The genetic diversity of these viruses. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed close clustering and highest sequence identity in all 8 genes to HPAI H5N1 isolates of the combined H5 clade 2.2, sublineage EMA-3 from Afghanistan over the same time period. Two subgroups of Pakistani H5N1 viruses from domestic and wild birds were observed on the basis of sequence homologies and mutations. The HPAI motif, preferred receptor specificity for Î±-(2,3) linkages, potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and an additional glycosylation site in the globular head of the HA protein of four Pakistani H5N1 isolates. Amino acids associated with susceptibility to various antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Amantadine) were found to be preserved for Pakistani H5N1 isolates. Of note, some significant mutations observed in critical positions of the antigenic regions of HA-1 (S141P, D155S, R162I & P181S) and in the receptor binding pocket (A185T, R189K & S217P). A high sequence similarity was also observed between the Pakistani HP H5N1 and LP H9N2 viruses. Apart from E627K in PB2, K356R in PA, V33I in NP, I28V in M2, and L107F in NS2 proteins, bird-like host-specific markers were also observed. Conclusion: Various point mutations in different genes were observed during the field circulation of H5 viruses from Pakistan. Outbreaks started in Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa (North West) province in 2006 and spread to Southern regions after a while. While migratory birds play a role in this sustained endemic of 2.2 H5N1 viruses in Pakistan during 2006-2008, the possibility of transmission through the cross-border legal or illegal poultry trade cannot be excluded.

Whole genome sequencing revealed the introduction of a new strain of reassortant Eurasian avian virus. Phylogenetically, the HA, NA, M, NP, and PB2 genes were mostly clustered with Russian influenza virus strains and the PA gene and AI isolates from the Netherlands, while the NS and PB1 genes clustered with a Pakistani H3N1 isolate. Sequence analysis revealed an LP amino acid motif (PEKASR), bird-like receptors, conservation of amino acids at receptor binding sites and amino acids known to be associated with susceptibility to antiviral drugs, loss of glycosylation site in the NA gene, and resulting amino acids. Unique PDZ domain motif (ESEI) at the C terminus of the NS gene. Seroconversion against the H4N6 subtype was most observed in bird populations in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa provinces. The isolation disclosed the role of LBM, where mixing of different bird species provided the perfect environment for the spread and potential reclassification of AIV. Furthermore, the various point mutations in these H4N6 isolates and the close association with Pakistani H3N1 and other Eurasian strains also reflect the prevailing diversity among AIVs circulating in local LBMs. (C)2016 PVJ.

Nucleic acid type and configuration,"Virus particles banded at 1.34 g/ml in CsCl and precipitated at 160S on sucrose gradients were isolated from stool samples of patients afflicted with hepatitis. In the presence of 4 M urea and about 90% formamide, these particles released linear nucleic acid molecules with the characteristic coiled appearance of single-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. They can be distinguished from the nucleic acid of phage lambda added to the preparation as a marker for double-stranded configuration. Experiments in which the investigated virus particles were incubated at pH 12.9 at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes revealed that nucleic acid molecules were hydrolyzed as easily as the RNA genome of poliovirus type 2 analyzed in parallel. However, both the single-stranded DNA of phage phiX174 and that of parvovirus LuIII proved unaffected, and the double-stranded DNA of phage lambda was denatured into single-stranded molecules. Therefore, it was concluded that human hepatitis A virus contains a linear genome of single-stranded RNA and should be classified with picornaviruses.",,"Siegl, G.;Frosner, G. G.",1978.0,Apr,,0

1922,Differentiating genotype 1 genes and proteins of human Wa-like rotaviruses versus porcine rotaviruses.,"The group rotaviruses (RVA) are 11-segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses and are important causes of gastroenteritis in the young of many animal species. Previous studies had suggested that human Wa-like RVAs share a close evolutionary relationship with porcine RVAs. Specifically, the VP1-VP3 and NSP2-5/6 genes of these viruses are generally classified as genotype 1 with >. 81% nucleotide sequence identity. Still, it is unknown whether the genotype 1 genes and proteins of human Wa-like strains are distinguishable from porcine strains. To investigate this, we performed extensive bioinformatics analyzes using all known genotype 1 gene sequences. The RVAs analyzed represent wild-type strains isolated from humans or pigs at various geographic locations between 2004 and 2013, including 11 newly sequenced swine RVAs from Brazil. We also analyzed archival strains isolated between 1977 and 1992 and atypical strains involved in interspecies transmission between humans and pigs. Overall, we found that the genotype 1 genes of typical modern human Wa-like RVAs cluster together in phylogenetic trees and are separate from typical modern porcine RVAs. The only exception was for the NSP5/6 gene, which did not show host-specific phylogenetic clustering. Using amino acid sequence alignments, we identified 34 positions that differentiate the VP1-VP3, NSP2 and NSP3 genotype 1 proteins of typical modern human Wa-like RVAs against typical modern porcine RVAs and documented how these positions changed in archival/unusual isolates. No host-specific amino acid positions were identified for NSP4, NSP5, or NSP6. Altogether, the results of this study support the notion that human Wa-like RVAs and porcine RVAs are evolutionarily related, but suggest that some of the genotype 1 genes and proteins diverge over time, possibly as a reflection of sequestered replication and protein co-adaptation. on their hosts.",,"Silva, F.

1923,Follow-up of the molecular epidemiology of Brazilian Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolates.,"Infectious bursal disease is a highly contagious disease of young chickens caused by the Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Genome segment A encodes capsid protein (VP2) while segment B encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). In this study, we trace the molecular epidemiology of IBDV in Brazil by analyzing 29 isolates collected in major regions of poultry production. To genetically characterize the isolates, phylogenetic and population dynamic analyzes were performed using the coding sequences of 68 VP1 (2634nt) and 102 VP2 (1356nt) from IBDV isolates from different regions of the world. Furthermore, the evolution of IBDV was analyzed by characterizing the selective forces at work during the diversification of viral isolates. We show that IBDV isolates were brought to Brazil predominantly from the Netherlands and the USA. These introductions were associated with all Brazilian poultry production regions analyzed in this study. In addition, we show that the evolution of IBDV has been shaped by a combination of very low recombination rates and relatively high rates of nucleotide substitution (2,988×-10-4 for VP1 and 3.2937×-10-4 for VP2). It is a function of purification selection operating on VP1 and VP2. Furthermore, our expanded Bayesian skyline plot shows that the increase in effective population size of IBDV isolates is consistent with its epidemiological history, with a large increase during the emergence of acute IBD outbreaks in the 1980s. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Silva, F.

1925,Current and Future Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Animals: A Review of Principles and Practices,"There is broad consensus at the international level that surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) levels occurring in various systems forms the basis of strategies to address this issue. The main reasons for monitoring resistance are to determine (i) the extent of the problem, (ii) whether resistance is increasing, (iii) whether previously unknown types of resistance are emerging, (iv) whether a particular type of resistance is spreading. and (v) whether a particular type of resistance is associated with a particular outbreak. The effects of acquiring and using this information need to be considered in the design of a surveillance system. AMR surveillance provides a basis for assessing the burden of AMR and providing the evidence needed to develop efficient and effective control and prevention strategies. Co-development of AMR surveillance programs in humans and animals is essential, but there are several key elements that complicate data comparisons between AMR monitoring programs and across regions. Currently, AMR surveillance is based on uncomplicated in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility methods. However, the lack of compatibility between programs and the limitation of genetic information of AMR remain the major disadvantages of these phenotypic methods. The future of AMR surveillance is moving towards genotypic detection, and molecular analysis methods are expected to yield a lot of information. However, the expectation that these molecular techniques will surpass phenotypic susceptibility testing in the routine diagnosis and monitoring of AMR is a distant reality, and phenotypic testing remains essential in detecting emerging resistant bacteria, new resistance mechanisms, and AMR trends.",,"Simjee, S.;McDermott, P.;Trott, D.

Six small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed on the Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on the Ion Proton System. The resulting reads were aligned to the Bos taurus genome (UMD3.1 assemblage), the species phylogenetically closest to the buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputedly identified in buffalo PBMCs, and 130 new miRNAs (not listed in bovine mirBase) were identified by default. All of these 290 miRNAs identified in six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for buffalo species. Expression profiles of these miRNAs between samples are represented by sample dendrogram and heatmap plots. Uniquely expressed miRNAs were identified in each treatment and control group. A few miRNAs were expressed at very high levels, while most were expressed moderately. The miRNAs bta-miR-103 and -191 were found to be highly abundant and expressed in all samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p and let family members (let 7a-5p) in LPS and CpG-treated PBMCS. , let 7g & let 7f). and bta-miR-191, -103 & -19b in PBMCs stimulated with Poly I:C.

The poultry fecal metagenomes revealed 33 breed-related sequences in both low and high FCR at significantly different rates. Functional analysis revealed that genes for the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and derivatives and for protein metabolism were most abundant in the SEED subsystem in both samples. Genes associated with stress, virulence, cell wall and cell capsule were also abundant. Indeed, genes associated with sulfur assimilation, flagella, and flagellum motility were overrepresented in low FCR birds.

1931,"Full-sequence analyzes of enterovirus 71 strains from cases of fatal and non-fatal hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Singapore (2000).","Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is an important etiologic agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, several epidemics in East Asia have been associated with neurological complications and numerous deaths. An outbreak in Singapore in October 2000 affected thousands of children and resulted in four fatal cases, three of which had EV71 isolated. The genomes of two representative strains of EV71 isolated from a fatal case and a surviving patient were fully sequenced and their nucleotide and amino acid sequences compared with known EV71 strains. The two epidemic strains were classified under genogroup B, together with those previously isolated in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. Comparative sequence analysis of the two Singapore species revealed 99% nucleotide similarity, while their deduced amino acid sequences were nearly identical except for residue 1506 in the nonstructural 3A region. Given that the outbreak contained closely related genetic variants of EV71, the broad spectrum of disease severity could be attributed to critical factors such as varying doses of viral vaccination or different host immune responses following infection, but it is less likely to result from the emergence of EV71. high virulence strains.",,"Singh, S.;Poh, C.

1932,Complex virome in excrement of Native American children in isolated Amazonian villages,"The number of viruses circulating in small isolated human populations may be reduced by viral extinctions and rare introductions. Here, we used viral metagenomics to characterize the eukaryotic virome in the feces of healthy children from a major urban center and three American villages with minimal external contact. A large number of human enteric viruses, mainly from the families Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae, were sequenced from each of the regions. Multiple children from the same villages spread closely related viruses, reflecting frequent clusters of transmission. Feces of isolated villagers also contained multiple viral genomes of unknown cellular origin and higher levels of nematode and protozoan DNA from the Picornavirales order and CRESS-DNA group. Despite cultural and geographic isolation, the diversity of enteric human viruses has not decreased in these Amazonian villages. Frequent viral introductions and/or increased susceptibility to enteric infections may account for the complex fecal virus of Amerindian children in isolated villages.",,"Siqueira, J.

1933,"ENDEMIC INFECTION OF RED SOUTH SEA Otters (ENHYDRA LUTRIS NEREIS) WITH NEW PARVOVIRUS, POLYOMAVIRUS AND ADENOVIRUS","Over the last century, the southern otter (SSO; Enhydra lutris nereis) population has been slowly rebounding from near extinction due to overharvesting. SSO is a threatened subspecies under federal law and a fully protected species under California law in the USA. Through a joint multi-agency program, trapped animals are rehabilitated and released, while deceased animals are necropsied and tissues frozen to facilitate scientific work. Here, we processed archival tissues to enrich particle-associated viral nucleic acids, which we randomly amplified and deeply sequenced to identify viral genomes through sequence similarities. Anelloviruses and endogenous retroviral sequences account for more than 50% of the observed viral sequences. The polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus sequences accounted for most of the remaining reads. We characterized and phylogenetically analyzed the complete genome of sea otter polyomavirus 1 and the complete coding sequence of sea otter parvovirus 1 and found that the closest known viruses infect primates and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), respectively. We tested archived tissues from 69-lane SSO necropsied for 14 years (2000-13) by PCR. Poliomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus infections were detected in 51, 61, and 29% of the animals studied, respectively, and there was no significant increase in frequency over time, suggesting endemic infection. We found that 80% of the SSO tested were infected with at least one of the three DNA viruses whose tissue distribution we determined in 261 tissue samples. Parvovirus DNA was most frequently detected in the mesenteric lymph node, polyomavirus DNA was detected in the spleen, and adenovirus DNA was detected in more than one tissue (spleen, retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph node, lung and liver). This study identifies virome in the tissues of a threatened species and demonstrates that trapped SSO is frequently infected with multiple viruses, warranting future research to explore associations between these infections and observed lesions.",,"Siqueira, J.

Most mallard viruses and two viruses from turkey have indices of 0.0, indicating that they are not pathogenic. Six of the duck-derived viruses had indices ranging from 0.25 to 0.49 and the IVPI for A/chicken/Alabama/75 (H4N8) was 0.49, indicating their low pathogenic potential. Classification of type A influenza virus as highly pathogenic requires 1.25 IVPI up to a maximum score of 3.0. Gross lesions observed in chickens that died following intravenous viral challenge included kidney swelling with more prominent lobular patterns, but no visceral urate deposits. The utility of IVPI testing may be limited in assessing the pathogenicity potential of non-pathogenic and low-pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus.",,"Slemons, R. D.;Condobery, P.

1936,Genetic variability and classification of hepatitis E virus,"Classification of hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants is currently limited to birds, bats, rodents, and fish without agreed definitions for genotypes and subtypes. These conflicts arise due to the viruses being compared and differences in genomic regions and methodology used. We reexamined the published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of whole genome sequences or sequential ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences showed that the HEV variants most closely related to those that infect humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits closely related to genotype 3 occupy an intermediate position. No consistent criteria could be defined for the assignment of virus subtypes. Analysis of amino acid sequences from these viruses in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF, or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) with variants more different from chickens, bats and rodents provided consistent support for a split in humans and pigs. divided into 4 groups corresponding to HEV variants that infect rats and ferrets, and those from bats and chickens.

Genetically, both viruses are heterogeneous and are divided into several genotypes that differ in their geographic distribution and risk group associations. However, there is little evidence that HAV or HEV variants differ antigenically or in their propensity to cause serious disease. Genetically different but mainly hepatotropic variants of both HAV and HEV have been found in a few mammalian species; Those of HAV are classified as eight species in the genus Hepatovirus in the virus family Picornaviridae. HEV is classified as a member of the Orthohepevirus A species in the Hepeviridae virus family, a species that also includes viruses that infect pigs, rabbits, and various other mammalian species.

A subset of these viruses infect humans and can cause self-limited acute hepatitis that can become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. Current published descriptions of taxonomic divisions within the family Hepeviridae are conflicting regarding the assignment of species and genotypes. Through analysis of available sequence information, we propose a taxonomic scheme in which the family is divided into Orthohepevirus (all mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates) and Piscihepevirus (brutal trout virus) genera. Species within the genus Orthohepevirus are Orthohepevirus A (human, swine, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbit, and camel isolates), Orthohepevirus B (chicken isolates), Orthohepevirus C (rat, great bandicoot, Asian muskrat, weasel, and mink), and Orthohepevirus D (isolated from bat). Recommendations have also been made for the determination of genotypes in human and rat HEVs. This hierarchical system is compatible with hepevirus phylogeny and reflects and is consistent with discontinuities in binary spacing intervals between amino acid sequences of the three classification levels (genus, species, and genotype). Adoption of this system would include avoiding hostnames in taxonomic identifiers and would provide a logical framework for assigning new variants.",,"Smith, D. B.;Simmonds, P.;Jameel, S.;Emerson, S.

1940,Dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,"Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant deaths in humans. In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major epidemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the introduction and successful adaptation of a novel hemagglutinin subtype from an animal source to humans and resulted in antigenic shift. Despite the global concern about a new pandemic influenza, the route of emergence of pandemic strains is unknown. Here, we estimated the evolutionary history of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains and the date of their introduction to humans. Our results show that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated in mammalian hosts, namely pigs and humans, as early as 1911 and are unlikely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships indicate that A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was established by reclassification between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in pigs or possibly humans. Also, seasonal and classical swine H1N1 viruses were not derived directly from BM/1918, but their predecessors circulated together during the pandemic. Average estimates of the most recent common ancestry also suggest that pandemic strains H2N2 and H3N2 may have been created through reclassification events in unknown mammalian hosts and spanned multiple avian viruses prior to pandemic recognition. The occurrence of probable pandemic strains in mammals through a series of reclassification events in the years before pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses could halt future pandemics.",,"Smith, G.

The virus was initially detected in tissues using a consensus herpes virus PCR. No viral inclusions or particles were seen on routine histological or transmission electron microscopic sections of cloacal lesions. Virus was isolated from the samples, and transmission electron microscopy of the obtained isolates confirmed that the virus was morphologically compatible with a herpes virus. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product from tissue samples and isolates revealed that the virus was in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and was different from other known herpes viruses. The correlation between the lesions and the new virus is unknown. Two herpesviruses, both in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, have been previously described in macropods and are known to cause systemic clinical disease.

1950,Detection and classification of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Korea by spot immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies,"The spot immunoblotting assay (DIA) using five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used to detect and classify viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. Using a group-specific MAb 3F5, 10 reference IBV strains and 12 Korean IBV isolates were successfully detected by DIA, with the lowest IBV virus titer detected by DIA less than approximately 103.8 mean embryo infective dose/mil. To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy, DIA was compared with the conventional diagnostic method for infectious bronchitis (IB). IBV antigens in allantoic fluid from embryonated eggs inoculated with IB-suspect field specimens were specifically detected by DIA in only one or two egg passages, whereas the traditional embryonated egg vaccination method required four to seven egg passages to confirm IBV infection. These results demonstrated that DIA can significantly reduce the time and cost of diagnosing IB. Four strain-specific MAbs, 3A4, 2A3, 6F7, and 2C6, were used to examine the possibility of classifying IBV with DIA. According to their MAb reaction patterns to IBV antigens, 10 IBV reference strains were classified into six groups; seven strains belonged to three different groups and the other three strains each belonged to a separate group. In the case of 12 Korean isolates of IBV, they were classified into six groups. Among the six groups, the MAb reaction patterns of the three groups matched those of the IBV reference strains, but not the others.

1952,Profiling novel microRNAs elicited by EV71 and CA16 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells using high-throughput sequencing.,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the two main etiologic agents associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Although both belong to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, there are many differences in the infection processes of these viruses. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Numerous studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction. Our previous study reported that EV71 and CA16 infection led to differential expression of miRNAs in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Here, we aimed to further investigate the expression profile and possible roles of other miRNAs differentially expressed in 16HBE cells following EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. We identify 44 new differentially expressed miRNAs in all samples. Among these miRNAs, 7 novel differentially expressed miRNAs show an opposite expression trend during the progression of EV71 and CA16 infections. Subsequently, bioinformatics analyzes, including Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genes (KEGG) databases, were used to identify biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and related pathways. The top 10 GO and Pathway annotation showed that 849 target genes are involved in cell development, such as nervous system development, multicellular organism development, and developmental biology. Finally, genes identified in both GO and Pathway analysis were used to construct a co-expression network to further define the potential function of these co-expressed genes. Therefore, our data may be useful in guiding further studies on the molecular mechanism of developmental regulation in the pathogenesis of EV71 and CA16-induced HFMD. Additionally, it provided novel candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HFMD.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Jiang, X.;Zhu, W.;Wu, Z.;Dong, S.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.02.008,0
1953,miR-1303 regulates BBB permeability and promotes CNS lesions following CA16 infections by directly targeting MMP9,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is a member of the Picornaviridae family and causes mild and self-limiting hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and young children. CA16 infection may also progress to central nervous system (CNS) complications; however, the mechanism underlying CA16's penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent CNS damage remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of CA16 neurotropic tropism by establishing an in vitro BBB model with CA16 infection and an in vivo CA16 rhesus monkey infant infection model. The results showed that CA16 infection induced increased permeability of the BBB along with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression. Next, high-throughput miRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-1303 can regulate BBB permeability by targeting MMP9. We then used dual luciferase, qRT-PCR and western blot assays to provide evidence of MMP9 targeting by miR-1303. Further experiments revealed that CA16 infection promotes degradation of junctional complexes (Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin and ZO-1), possibly by downregulating miR-1303 and upregulating MMP9. Finally, EGFP-CA16 infection can enter the CNS by facilitating degradation of junctional complexes and ultimately induce neuroinflammation and injury in the CNS, which was validated using the in vivo rhesus monkey model. Our results suggest that CA16 can penetrate the BBB and then enter the CNS by directly regulating MMP9 and downregulating miR-1303, which disrupts junctional complexes, ultimately causing pathological CNS changes. These results provide new therapeutic targets in HFMD patients following CA16 infection.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Li, H.;Huang, X.;Zheng, H.;Hu, Y.;Wang, J.;Jiang, X.;Li, J.;Yang, Z.;Fan, H.;Guo, L.;Shi, H.;He, Z.;Yang, F.;Wang, X.;Dong, S.;Li, Q.;Liu, L.",2018.0,,10.1038/s41426-018-0157-3,0
1954,Different microRNA profiles reveal the diverse consequences induced by EV71 and CA16 infection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells using high-throughput sequencing.,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the predominant pathogens in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), but the factors underlying the pathogenesis of EV71 and CA16 infections remain unclear. Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. In this study, we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 135 known miRNAs showed remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 30 differentially expressed miRNAs presented opposite trends in samples infected with EV71- and CA16. Next, we focused mainly on 30 key differentially expressed miRNAs through further screening to predict targets. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of predicted targets showed enrichment of 14 biological processes, 9 molecular functions, 8 cellular components, and 85 pathways. Regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways and co-expression genes were identified, suggesting that miRNAs exhibit complex regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. In conclusion, we specifically analyzed hierarchical GO categories of predicted targets related to biological adhesion. The results showed that the different changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partially linked to the function of the blood-brain barrier. Taken together, this is the first report describing miRNA expression profiles in EV71 and CA16-infected HUVECs using high-throughput sequencing. Our data provide useful information that may help elucidate different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and offer novel therapeutic targets for these infections.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Li, J.;Zheng, H.;Wang, J.;Guo, L.;Ning, R.;Li, H.;Yang, Z.;Fan, H.;Liu, L.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0177657,0
1955,High-throughput Sequencing of Putative Novel microRNAs in Rhesus Monkey Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Following EV71 and CA16 Infection,"Objectives: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the major pathogens in cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), but the mechanisms of the different pathogens that follow EV71 and CA16 infection are largely unknown. Methods: Here, we used microRNA (miRNA) deep sequencing to investigate the roles of novel differentially expressed miRNAs in EV71 and CA16-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: The results identified 13 new differentially expressed miRNAs in each group. In addition, target genes were predicted by the miRanda and RNAhybrid programs, and a total of 2,501 targets were found in the two databases. Later, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyzes showed that these targets are mainly related to cell development and that these targets are mainly related to nervous system development, system development, multicellular organism development, Wnt signaling pathway, PDGF signaling pathway and EGF receptor signaling pathway. Finally, a co-expression regulatory network was constructed with key targets to further predict the functional interactions of targets and their co-expressed genes. Conclusion: Our results not only revealed potential biomarkers or targets for the diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, but also provided new insights to explore the mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 pathogenesis.",,"Song, J.;Jiang, X.;Hu, Y.;Li, H.;Zhang, X.;Xu, J.;Li, W.;Zheng, X.;Dong, S.",2018.0,,10.1159/000493798,0
1956,Evidence of human-to-swine transmission of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus in South Korea,"As the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to infect human populations globally, reports of epidemiologically related animal infections are also increasing. Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009-like viruses have been isolated in pigs from different pig farms of South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyzes of viral segments demonstrated several events of human-to-swine transmission with no visible signs of reclassification. These events were also supported by serological surveillance in pig serum collected from April to December; this suggested that reverse transmission probably started between June and July and there was a drastic increase in prevalence in the following months. Although molecular characterization shows that porcine isolates are generally stable, some viruses are genetically engineered, particularly in surface proteins. Animal studies (ferrets and mice) reveal that swine pandemic isolates recapitulate the biological characteristics currently attributed to circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient transmission, and demonstrate the potential for these viruses to return to circulation among humans. Overall, these results indicate widespread human-to-animal transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in South Korea. Because of the important role of pigs in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events must be closely monitored and minimized to avoid the risk of producing viruses of greater human health concern.

1957,Chilo iridescent virus encodes a putative helix belonging to a separate family within the 'DEAD/H' superfamily: Implications for the evolution of large DNA viruses,"The full nucleotide sequence of the EcoRI DNA fragment M (7099 bp; 0.310-0.345 map units) of the insect iridescent virus type 6-Chilo iridescent virus (CIV)- genome was determined. A 606 codon open reading frame located in this region encoded a protein (p69) related to a distinct family of putative DNA and/or RNA helices belonging to the 'DEAD/H' superfamily. Unique sequence signatures were derived, allowing the putative helices of the new family to be selectively retrieved from amino acid sequence databases. The family includes yeast, Drosophila, mammalian and bacterial proteins involved in transcription regulation and repair of damaged DNA. It is hypothesized that p69 of CIV may be a DNA or RNA helicase, possibly involved in viral transcription. A distant relationship was observed between this helicase family and another group of proteins consisting of putative poxvirus helices, African swine fever virus and yeast mitochondrial plasmids. The p69 of CIV has been shown to be much more closely associated with cellular helicases than any of the other known viral helicases. Phylogenetic analysis suggested an independent origin for the genes encoding the p69 gene and other viral helicases.",,"Sonntag, K. C.;Schnitzler, P.;Koonin, E. V.;Darai, G.",1994.0,,,0
1958,Small RNA deep sequencing identifies viral microRNAs during malignant catarrhal fever induced by alcelaphine herpes virus 1.,"Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) is an Î³-herpes virus (Î³-HV) carried asymptomatically by antelopes. Upon interspecies transmission, AlHV-1 induces a fatal lymphoproliferative disease called malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in several ruminant animals, including the bovine and rabbit model. Delay has been shown to be necessary for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms that cause the activation and proliferation of infected CD8+ T cells are unknown. Many Î³-HVs express microRNAs (miRNAs). These small noncoding RNAs can regulate the expression of host or viral target genes involved in a variety of pathways and are thought to facilitate viral infection and/or mediate the activation and proliferation of infected lymphocytes. Numerous miRNA encodings of the AlHV-1 genome have been predicted. However, their precise contribution in viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo is unknown. Here, using cloning and sequencing of small RNAs, we identified 36 potential miRNAs expressed in a lymphoblastoid cell line propagated from a calf infected with AlHV-1 and developing MCF. Among the sequenced candidate miRNAs, 32 were expressed in the reverse chain of the genome in the two main clusters. Expression of these 32 viral miRNAs was further confirmed in lymphoid organs of calves or rabbits developing MCF using Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. A recombinant virus was generated to determine the concerted contribution of 28 viral miRNAs clustered in the non-protein-coding region of the AlHV-1 genome in MCF. The absence of these 28 miRNAs did not affect in vitro viral growth or MCF induction in rabbits; this indicates that AlHV-1 miRNAs clustered in this non-protein-coding genomic region are indispensable for MCF induction.",,"Sorel, O.;Tuddenham, L.;Myster, F.;Palmeira, L.;Kerkhofs, P.;Pfeffer, S.;Vanderplasschen, A.;Dewals, B.

1960,Pathological and molecular manifestations of avian avulavirus type 1 outbreak in pigeons (Columba livia) from southern Brazil.,"Newcastle disease caused by avian avulavirus type 1 strains (APMV-1) is an important avian disease that causes high mortality rates and economic losses. Several outbreaks have been reported in different parts of the world over the last 30 years, caused by an adapted variant of AAvV-1 called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) in Columbiformes. A high mortality rate associated with an epidemic in free-living pigeons (Columba livia) was analyzed in a public square in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. A total of 24 moribund or freshly dead pigeons were subjected to autopsy, histopathological, immunohistochemical (anti-Newcastle), and RT-PCR, five weeks apart, followed by sequencing of analysis of amplification products. They presented neurological manifestations, non-suppurative encephalitis and encephalomyelitis, and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in different organs. Immunohistochemical analysis in nine pigeon tissues showed that anti-Newcastle was expressed in brain, kidney, liver and pancreas. The RT-PCR test for the M protein of the Newcastle disease virus was positive in six pigeons. The differential diagnosis of Influenza, West Nile, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae was negative in all pigeons. The sequence of amino acids in the cleavage site region of the F protein was 112RRQKRF117, which classified the strain as lethal.

1962,Characterization of low pathogenicity H5N1 avian influenza viruses from North America,"For the purposes of early identification of the Asian H5N1 highly pathogenic AI virus, wild bird surveillance for avian influenza (AI) viruses in North America identified at least six low pathogenic H5N1 AI viruses between 2004 and 2006. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from all 6 H5N1 viruses and an additional 38 North American wild avian H5 subtype and 28 N1 subtype viruses were sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank by phylogenetic analysis. Both HA and NA were phylogenetically different from viruses from outside North America and from viruses from mammals. Four of the H5N1 AI viruses were characterized as low pathogenicity by standard in vivo pathotyping tests. One of the H5N1 viruses, A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06, was shown to replicate at low titers in chickens, turkeys and ducks. However, transmission of A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 was more effective among ducks than between chickens or turkeys due to virus transmission. For A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 and three other wild waterfowl-derived H5 viruses, the 50% chicken infectious dose was also determined, and the 50% egg infective dose ranged from 10 5.3 to 107.5. Finally, seven H5 viruses representing different phylogenetic branches were evaluated for their antigenic kinship by the hemagglutination inhibition assay, showing that antigenic kinship is largely related to geographic origin. Overall, the data support the conclusion that the North American H5 wild avian AI viruses are wild bird-adapted viruses of low pathogenicity and are antigenically and genetically distinct from the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 virus strain.

1963,"Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis E virus in pigs, wild boars, roe deer, red deer and deer in Lithuania","OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the main causes of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. In Europe, foodborne zoonotic transmission of HEV genotype 3 has been associated with domestic pigs and wild boar. Controversial data exist on the circulation of the virus in animals used for human consumption, and to date no gold standard has yet been defined for the diagnosis of HEV-associated hepatitis. To investigate the current HEV infection status in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, the presence of viral RNA was analyzed by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) in randomly selected samples, followed by viral RNA genotyped. RESULTS: Overall, 32.98% and 22.55% of domestic pig samples were HEV-positive when using RT-nPCR targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 fragments. Among hooves, 25.94% of wild boar samples, 22.58% of roe deer samples, 6.67% of red deer samples and 7.69% of deer samples were positive for HEV RNA using primers targeting the ORF1 fragment. Using primers targeting the ORF2 fragment of the HEV genome, viral RNA was detected in only 17.03% of wild boar samples and 12.90% of roe deer samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 348 nucleotide-long region of HEV ORF2 showed that all obtained sequences detected in Lithuanian domestic pigs and wildlife belonged to genotype 3. 3i subtype reference sequences from the GenBank database. Sequences from pig farms located in two different counties of Lithuania belonged to the HEV 3f subtype. Boar sequences clustered in subtypes 3i and 3h; this clearly indicates that wild boars can harbor additional HEV subtypes. For the first time, ORF2 nucleotide sequences from roe deer proved that HEV subtype 3i can be found in a novel host. CONCLUSION: The results of viral prevalence and phylogenetic analyzes clearly demonstrated viral infection in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, thus highlighting a major concern for zoonotic virus transmission both in the food chain and through direct contact with animals. The unexpected diversity of HEV genotype 3 subtypes in Lithuania and neighboring countries suggested that further work is needed to understand the mode of transmission of HEV between animals and humans in the Baltic States region.",,"Spancerniene, U.;Grigas, J.;Buitkuviene, J.;Zymantiene, J.;Juozaitiene, V.;Stankeviciute, M.;Razukevicius, D.;Zienius, D.;Stankevicius, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s13028-018-0367-7,0

This viral agent grows in chicken embryo fibroblast cells, forms bands with a density of 1.37 g/ml in CsCl equilibrium density gradients, has a particle diameter of 75 nm, and has a morphology similar to that of human reovirus type 3. It consists of double-stranded RNA and adenosine-rich oligonucleotides.

1965,Dynamic balance of Marek's disease genomes during in vitro serial migration,"Attenuation of Gallid herpesvirus-2 (GaHV-2), the causative agent of Marek's disease, may occur through serial transmission of a virulent domain isolate in avian embryo fibroblasts. To better understand the genes involved in attenuation and to correlate observed changes in phenotype with specific genetic variations, the genomic DNA sequence of a single GaHV-2 virulent strain (648A) was determined at defined transition intervals. Biological characterization of these ""range isolates"" in chickens has previously shown that the ability to cause transient paralysis is lost by passages 40 and after passage 80 the ability to cause persistent neurological disease coinciding with the loss of neoplastic lesion formation. Deep sequencing of range isolates allowed a detailed cataloging of mutations present in a single passage population and the frequency at which a particular mutation occurred between passages. Gross genetic changes were identified in both novel and well-characterized genes and cis-acting regions involved in replication and division/packaging. Deletions in genes encoding the virulence factors vLipase, vIL8 and RLORF4, as well as a deletion in the ICP4 promoter, appeared between passages 61 and 101. Three mutations were also identified in the virus-encoded telomerase that predominates in late passages. Overall, the frequency of mutations fluctuated greatly during serial crossing, and few genetic changes were absolute. This indicates that serial passage of GaHV-2 results in the generation of a genome collection with limited sequence heterogeneity.",,"Spatz, S. J.;Volkening, J. D.;Gimeno, I.

1969,Characterization of infectious bursal disease viruses from four-layer flocks in the United States,"Twenty bursal specimens were obtained from four infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV)-vaccinated layer herds with immunosuppression problems thought to be infectious bursal disease. All samples were found to be positive for IBDV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the samples identified them as classical molecular group 3 and group 4 viruses. Two samples were sequenced from each of the four flocks and within a flock these sequences were identical; however, some differences were observed between the herds. One virus from each of the four flocks was selected for further analysis. The VP2 hypervariable sequence region of GA-1, H-30 and CS-2-35 samples had nucleotide and amino acid similarities with the D78 and Vi Bursa G classical vaccines used in these flocks. The HPR-2 sequence was similar to the Bursa Vac 4 vaccine used in that flock and the STC lethal classical IBDV strain. The inferred amino acid sequence of these isolates revealed that all isolates have proline at position 222, which is characteristic of US classical viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates clustered GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 with D78 vaccine and HPR-2 with STC, based on the VP2 hypervariable amino acid sequence. The pathogenicity of these isolates was tested in specific pathogen-free chickens. Bursa-body weight (B-BW) ratios and histopathological lesion scores in the bursa were determined. Gross lesions were observed in Bursa, and the B-BW ratios of birds infected with all four wild-type viruses were significantly different when compared with the D78 vaccine and unvaccinated control groups. Histopathology of the bursa from the GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35 and HPR-2 infected groups showed varying degrees of follicular depletion and necrosis. A very mild lymphoid depletion was observed 5 days post-vaccination in the D78-infected group, and no microscopic lesions were observed in this group 8 days post-vaccination or any time in the unvaccinated control group. Bursa collected from birds infected with field virus and D78 at necropsy revealed the presence of IBDV by RT-PCR and the VP-2 hypervariable nucleotide sequences of GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35, HPR-.

Further comparative and phylogenetic analyzes were performed to explore the evolutionary relationship between these groups. RESULTS: Using multiple alignments, Jal view, ClustalW (1.83) and ClustalW2, the alignment phylogeny score results were 375184. However, analysis between nonstructural proteins of Japanese Encephalitis Virus, Westnile Virus and Kunjin Virus revealed that the phylogeny alignment score via multiple sequence alignment and Tree view was 875, respectively.

1971,Animal models of Ebolavirus infection,"Ebola virus is a highly pathogenic member of the Filoviridae family that causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and NHP. The 2013-2016 West African epidemic sparked interest in the development and improvement of animal models of Ebola virus disease. These models are used to test countermeasures and vaccines, gain scientific insight into disease progression and transmission mechanisms, and examine the fundamental correlates of immunology. The Ebola virus is classified as a BSL4 pathogen and a Category A agent that requires the United States government to be prepared in the event of bioterrorism. Rodents such as Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), mice (Mus musculus), and guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) are the most common research species. However, NHP is preferred for Ebola virus disease research, especially in macaques, because of its similarity to humans in pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and causes of death. To meet regulatory requirements for approval of countermeasures against high-result pathogens, the FDA has implemented the Animal Rule, which allows efficacy studies in animal models to replace human clinical data when such studies are not viable or ethical.

1972,Genetic heterogeneity of the classic swine fever virus in Central Europe,"The aim of this study was to genetically characterize Central European isolates of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and to evaluate the applicability of molecular analysis in the epizootiology of CSFV infections. Thirty-four viruses from Central European pigs or wild boars were studied. All of these viruses were detected by each of the three oligonucleotide primer sets designed for specific RT-PCR amplification of different genomic regions. Comparative sequence analysis of the PCR products showed that they were of a genetic type common in Western Europe. It was possible to subdivide the virus isolates into subgroups, which largely overlapped with the regions of origin in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Estonia. The technique's discrimination ability was improved by analyzing a composite dataset of all sequence data from all viruses. Using this approach, we were able to distinguish all viruses, with the exception of a single Estonian isolate grouped with viruses from eastern Poland, and group them in a way that exactly matches their geographic origin.",,"Stadejek, T.;VilÄek, Å ;Lowings, J.

1974,First detection of swine circovirus type 3 in commercial pig farms in Poland,"Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is a new strain of circovirus recently discovered in the USA and China in cases of swine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, respiratory disease, and multisystemic inflammation. This study reports the first European identification of PCV3 in serum of pigs from Polish farms. A total of 1,050 serum samples were collected between 2014 and 2017 from pigs and pigs 3-20 weeks old from 14 commercial farms representing different regions of Poland, different sizes and health statuses. Samples were pooled with 4–6 and tested for PCV3 by real-time PCR. PCV3 DNA was detected in 12 (85.7%) of 14 farms. In PCV3 positive farms, the virus was detected in serum pools of 5.9% to 65%. PCV3 was most prevalent among weaned pigs and finishers (26.1% and 28% of serum pools, respectively). Sequence analysis of the 359 nucleotide fragments of ORF2 showed the highest identity of 99.7% from USA to PCV3-US/SD2016.

1975,Venezuelan encephalitis virus markers that distinguish enzootic strains of the ID subtype from those of IE.,"Venezuelan encephalitis virus strains isolated from enzootic habitats during interepizootic periods in Central America and northern South America can be antigenically distinguished from each other by inhibition of hemagglutination. This test provided the basis for classifying these virus strains into IE and ID subtypes, respectively. The virus strains of these two subtypes were found to differ greatly in virulence for British shorthair guinea pigs. Studies have been described confirming that virus strains of the ID subtype are guinea pig virulent and that virulence is not the result of co-cycle subpopulations of epizootic subtype I-AB or IC virions. Two additional markers were found to distinguish subtype ID and IE Venezuelan encephalitis virus strains. First, hydroxylapatite chromatography of intact virions at pH 6.5 showed differential elution of the ID and IE prototype strains. Virions of subtype ID strains were eluted at 0.08 to 0.11 M phosphate, while virions of subtype IE strains were eluted at 0.15 to 0.20 M phosphate. Second, the isoelectric points of the E1 envelope glycoproteins of the ID and IE prototype strains were significantly different; pH 6.85 to 7.00 and pH 7.25 to 7.30, respectively. There was no significant difference in the isoelectric points of the E2 envelope glycoproteins. These distinctive features likely reflect a fundamental difference in virion surface structure.",,"Stanick, D. R.;Wiebe, M. E.;Scherer, W. F.",1985.0,,,0
1976,Detection and molecular characterization of swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Lithuanian wild boar populations,"BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is recognized as an important and economically devastating pathogen in pig production worldwide. Although PRRSV is common in domestic pigs, there is a lack of information about PRRSV infection in European wild boars (Sus scrofa). Currently available information does not provide conclusive evidence that wild boars are a reservoir of PRRSV. However, wild boars can be infected from domestic pigs through occasional direct or indirect contact. Also, wild boars can serve as a reservoir for infectious diseases of domestic pigs. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to determine the prevalence of the virus and to further investigate the epidemiology and diversity of PRRSV strains in Lithuanian wild boars over a 5-year period. A total of 1597 tissue and serum samples from wild boars living in 44 regions and ten counties in Lithuania were analyzed for detection of PRRSV-specific vulnerability using conventional nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time Taqman RT-PCR. reading frame (ORF) 1 and 6 sequences. RESULTS: PRRSV was highly prevalent in Lithuanian wild boar populations with an average of 18.66% using conventional RT-PCR and 19.54% using real-time RT-PCR. PRRSV was detected in 36.71% and 41.77% of 237 prey sites tested by conventional RT-nPCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of PRRSV by geographic area in ten Lithuanian counties. Animals infected with PRRSV have been described in all age groups; however, significantly higher prevalence rates were found in sub-adult and adult wild boars than in offspring up to 12 months of age. No positive results were obtained using conventional PCR with type 2 specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF5 region revealed that ten wild boar harbored virus sequences belonging to genetic subtypes 3 and 4 and thus could pose a serious threat to Lithuanian pig farms where only subtype two strains are circulating. CONCLUSIONS: The results of virus prevalence and phylogenetic analyzes strongly support the role of wild boars as a possible natural reservoir for PRRSV in Lithuania.",,"Stankevicius, A.;Buitkuviene, J.;Sutkiene, V.;Spancerniene, U.;Pampariene, I.;Pautienius, A.;Oberauskas, V.;Zilinskas, H.;Zymantiene, J.",2016.0,,10.1186/s13028-016-0232-5,0
1977,"Analysis of H1 subtype influenza A viruses from wild birds, turkeys and pigs in Germany reveals incidences of interspecies transmission.","Background Despite significant host species barriers, interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses among wild birds, poultry, and pigs has been repeatedly demonstrated. In particular, viruses of the H1 and H3 subtypes were transmitted among pigs and poultry, predominantly turkeys, in areas with high population density of both species. The seizure of the swine flu H1N1 virus from a turkey flock in Germany in 2009 prompted us to molecularly investigate recently detected subtype H1 viruses in wild birds, pigs, and poultry. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between H1N1 viruses originating from wild and domestic animals of Germany and to identify potential interspecies transmission or reclassification events. Methods Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene or full-length genome sequences were generated from existing H1N1 viruses selected from wild birds, pigs, and turkeys. Phylogenetic analyzes were combined with genotyping and analyzes of amino acid sequences inferred by biologically active regions. Antigenic associations were evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition reactions. Results Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin sequences showed that viruses from different H1 subgroups circulate together between domestic animals and wild birds. In addition, these viruses contained different genotypes and were antigenically distinguishable. An H1N1 virus isolated from a turkey farm in northern Germany in 2009 showed the highest similarity to the bird-like pig H1N1 influenza viruses circulating in Europe since the late 1970s. Results The data demonstrate the genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of H1 viruses currently circulating in domestic and wild animals in Germany and point to turkeys as a possible bridge between avian and mammalian hosts.

1978,Circular replication-associated protein encoding DNA viruses identified in feces of various animals in New Zealand,"In recent years, innovations in molecular techniques and sequencing technologies have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of known viral sequences, particularly those with single-stranded (CRESS) DNA genomes encoding circular replication-associated protein (Rep). CRESS DNA viruses are found in the viromes of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide variety of organisms. The majority of recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into any known viral family, indicating that the current view of the CRESS DNA viral sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal fecal matter has proven to be a particularly useful resource for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem, as it is cost-effective and non-invasive. This study used a viral metagenomic approach to investigate the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses found in the feces of domestic and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (which may be defective molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from forty-nine individual animal stool samples. Based on their shared genome organization and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates as smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity to any member of the known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds significantly to our knowledge of the CRESS DNA virus diversity in New Zealand, highlights the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforces the idea that the majority of CRESS DNA viruses have yet to be identified.",,"Steel, O.;Kraberger, S.;Sikorski, A.;Young, L.

1979,"Extensive recombination, reclassification and transmission of unstable compound viral genotypes in natural arenavirus infections","Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses pack large (L) and small (S) genome segments in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like this, new genotypes can be created by mutation, recombination, and reclassification. Neither recombination nor reclassification in natural arenavirus infections has been conclusively documented, although an ancient recombination event is believed to have led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the viral diversity found in snakes infected with captive arena virus. We identified the complete or nearly complete sequence of 210 genome segments from 48 infected animals grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. Most snakes were multiple infected, with up to 4 different S and up to 11 different L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L disequilibrium was typical: in all cases, intrahost L segment genotypes were more abundant than S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype was dominant in individual animals and at a population level. We supplemented the sequencing results with qRT-PCR and virus isolation and isolates propagated as communities in culture. Numerous examples of recombination and reclassification were identified, including 2 intergenic regions and recombinant segments with unusual organizations with redundant content, capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents a degree and form of intra-host diversity that goes far beyond what is observed for arenaviruses or viruses in general. This diversity can plausibly be attributed to captive interbreeding of subclinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of undesirable anthropogenic effects on viral ecology, diversity and disease potential.",,"Stenglein, M.

1980,Isolation and cloning of two variant papillomaviruses from domestic pigs: Sus scrofa papillomaviruses type 1 variant a and b,"The healthy skin of two female domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) was sampled with cotton swabs. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to PCR with degenerate papillomavirus (PV)-specific primers. Similarity studies with BLASTN showed that the partial E1 and L1 sequences of the two novel PVs were amplified. Next, the complete genomes of these Sus scrofa papillomaviruses (SsPVs) were amplified by long template PCR, cloned and sequenced using a transposon insertion method. They contained the typical PV open reading frames (ORFs) E1, E2, E4, E6, L1 and L2, but neither viruses had E7 ORFs. The binary nucleotide sequence alignment of the L1 ORFs of the SsPVs showed 98.5% similarity, classifying these viruses as SsPV type 1 'variants' (SsPV-1a and -1b). Based on the sequential alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 ORFs of SsPV-1 variants a and b, as well as 81 other human and animal PV-type species, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis showed that variants SsPV-1a and -1b do not cluster with other PVs of the host species of artiodactyls (epidactyls), but cluster at the edge of the genus Alphapapillomavirus, which is very close to the root of this genus. © 2008 SGM.",,"Stevens, H.;Rector, A.;van der Kroght, K.;van Ranst, M.",2008.0,,10.1099/vir.0.2008/003186-0,0
1981,Small RNA cloning and sequencing strategy influences host and viral microRNA expression signatures,"Establishing microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures is essential for investigating the role these regulatory molecules play in an organism's biology. Marek's disease virus 1 (MDV-1) is an avian herpes virus that naturally infects chicken and induces T-cell lymphomas. During latency, MDV-1, like other herpesviruses, expresses a limited subset of transcripts. These contain three miRNA clusters. Several studies have identified the expression of virus and host-encoded miRNAs from MDV-1-infected cell cultures and chickens. However, a high inconsistency was observed when comparing miRNA cloning frequencies from different cloning and sequencing protocols. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of small RNA library preparation and sequencing on miRNA frequencies from the same RNA samples collected during MDV-1 infection of chicken at different steps of oncoviral pathogenesis. Depending on the strategy used, qualitative and quantitative differences were found in the data. One of the mature miRNAs derived from the latency-associated transcript (LAT), mdv1-miR-M7-5p, showed the highest variation. Cloning frequency was 50% of viral miRNA counts when using a small scale sequencing approach. Its frequency was 100 times less when determined by the deep sequencing approach. Northern blot analysis showed a better correlation with miRNA frequencies found by the small-scale sequencing approach. By analyzing the cellular miRNA repertoire, we also found a gap between the two sequencing approaches. Collectively, our study shows that next-generation sequencing data taken alone is limited for assessing the absolute copy number of transcripts. Therefore, quantification of small RNA should be addressed by compiling data obtained using different techniques such as microarrays, qRT-PCR, and NB analysis to support high-throughput sequencing data. These observations should be considered when examining miRNA variations before addressing functional studies. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Stik, G.;Muylkens, B.;Coupeau, D.;Laurent, S.;Dambrine, G.;Messmer, M.;Chane-Woon-Ming, B.;Pfeffer, S.;Rasschaert, D.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.04.005,0
1982,Molecular and biological characteristics of avian polyomaviruses: Isolates from different avian species indicate that avian polyomaviruses form a separate subgenus within the polyomavirus genus.,"The isolation and characterization of two avian polyomaviruses from chicken (BFDV-2) and a parrot (BFDV-3) have been reported. Both isolates are closely related to the non-mammalian polyomavirus budgerigar fledgling disease virus (BFDV) isolated from budgerigars (now called BFDV-1), and all three viral genomes were shown to have the same basic size of 4981 bp. However, a 151 bp insertion was observed in the noncoding region of BFDV-2, representing a complete copy of the left half of the noncoding region, including the putative early promoter and amino terminus of the large T antigen. With 15 base pairs exchanged elsewhere across the three genomes, these viruses have varying degrees of tropism for various bird species. The production of antibodies directed against a β-galactosidase-large T antigen fusion protein of BFDV-1 is described. These antibodies detected large T antigen with an M(r) of about 80K and small t antigen with an M(r) of about 24K in cells infected with BFDV isolates. These antibodies will bind with low affinity to the large T antigen of simian virus 40 (SV40), whereas antibodies specific for SV40- or mouse polyomavirus will not bind to the BFDV large T antigen. Antibodies directed against BFDV structural polypeptides exhibit broad, reciprocal cross-reactivities with all three structural proteins of mammalian polyomaviruses. The importance of polyomavirus infections in various avian species is discussed. Based on the unique structural and biological features, we propose that these viruses should be placed in a separate subgenus (Avipolyomavirus) within the polyomaviruses.",,"Stoll, R.;Luo, D.;Kouwenhoven, B.;Hobom, G.;Muller, H.",1993.0,,,0
1983,Whole Genome Sequencing Shows Geographical Variation of Escherichia coli O157 Genotypes Dominates Host Association,"Genetic diversity in an infectious disease pathogen may be driven by differences in ecological niches resulting from different host species and different geographic locations. Whole genome sequencing was used to compare E. coli O157 isolates from Scottish host reservoirs (bovine and sheep) and genetic variation (human, animal, environment/food) of isolates (human, animal, environment/food) from Scotland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Canada and Canada. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Genetic distance of Nei calculated from core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated that the animal isolates were from the same population. Investigation of Shiga toxin bacteriophage and their insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that cattle and sheep isolates had statistically indistinguishable rarity profiles, diversity and genotypes. In contrast, isolates from different countries exhibited significant differences in genetic distance of Nei and SBI typing. Thus, after successful international transmission that occurs in many cases, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global patchwork of continental and intercontinental phylogeographic branches. These findings are important for three reasons: first, to understand the transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multiple geographic locations; second, emphasizing the importance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm-based interventions; and third, to improve our understanding of why the incidence of human disease varies around the world.",,"Strachan, N.

These genotypes are subdivided based on phylogenetic analysis, namely ap for BVDV-1 and ac for BVDV-2. In this study, the genetic heterogeneity of BVDV-1 in England and Wales was investigated and compared to the situation in 1996/1997. Viral RNA was extracted from 316 blood samples collected between 2004 and 2009 and previously identified as BVDV-1 positive. A region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and the PCR products were sequenced.

Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the Npro region of the viral genome supported the classification obtained by the 5'UTR.

This study sequenced the partial helicase and capsid gene of potentially novel avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolated from chickens with HRHS and tested its clinical manifestations, histopathological changes, viral distribution, viremia, and pathogenicity in SPF chicks. viral spread was monitored 14 days post infection (dpi). The analysis revealed that HRHS-associated avian HEV belonged to a new genotype and infected chicks developed typical symptoms of HRHS. Thus, this study developed a successful experimental infection model to study the pathogenicity and role of the novel avian HEV in HRHS. Meanwhile, the new avian HEV was mainly present in the liver and spleen and caused a rapid viremia and chronic viral shedding in infected chicks and can cause 40% mortality before 14 dpi.

We examined wild birds and pikas of Qinghai for evidence of AIV infections from 2006 to 2009. We sampled 941 healthy wild animals and isolated seventeen H7N2 viruses (eight from picas and nine from wild birds). H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that picas may play an important role in the ecology of AIVs by acting as intermediate hosts to which viruses are more adapted to mammals. Our findings of AI infection in picas are consistent with previous observations, raising the possibility that pikas play a previously unrecognized role in the ecology of AIVs of peridomestic aquatic environments.",,"Su, S.;Xing, G.;Wang, J.;Li, Z.;Gu, J.;Yan, L.;Lei, J.;Ji, S.;Hu, B.;Gray, G.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the Rybp gene on bovine skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation. In this study, the Rybp gene was overexpressed in bovine myoblasts via adenovirus. RNA-seq was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results showed that overexpression of the Rybp gene inhibited myotube formation. Morphological differences in myoblasts started on the second day and were very significant 6 days after adenovirus induction. After 6 days of induction, a total of 1311 (707 up-regulated and 604 down-regulated) DEGs were screened using RNA-sequence among myoblasts spiked with negative control adenoviruses (AD-NC) and Rybp adenoviruses (AD-Rybp). Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis revealed that down-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in muscle-related biological functions, and those associated with muscle growth through 32 pathways were significantly enriched for the identified DEGs. By discovering the roles of the Rybp gene in myoblast differentiation, this study not only provides a theoretical basis for the regulation of skeletal muscle development in cattle, but also provides a theoretical basis for molecular breeding of beef cattle.",,"Su, X.;Zhao, Y.;Wang, Y.;Zhang, L.;Zan, L.;Wang, H.",2018.0,2018-07-01 00:00:00,,0
1993,Isolation and genetic characterization of a novel adeno-associated virus from Muscovy ducks in China.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV; genus Dependoparvovirus, family Parvoviridae) was first discovered in 1965 as a contaminant in adenovirus preparations. AAVs are generally considered non-pathogenic and have the ability to reduce the replication of other more pathogenic viruses, making them attractive as potential therapeutic or preventive measures. This study characterized a novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after spreading a field isolate of DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts. The complete genome sequence of MHH-05-2015 was determined, and its nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of structural and non-structural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was preserved and consistent with other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63 to 64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 did not directly descend from other Dependoparvovirus family members.

1994,Companion animals symposium: Microbes and gastrointestinal health of dogs and cats Review,"Recent molecular studies have revealed complex bacterial, fungal, archaeal and viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria comprising more than 99% of the entire intestinal microbiota. Microbes act as a protective barrier against invading pathogens, aid digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Important for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly acetate, propionate and butyrate. However, microbes can also have a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (eg Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been associated with acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been proposed for canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-sensitive diarrhea. There is increasing evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD support a combination of environmental factors, gut microbiota, and host genetic susceptibility. Recent studies have revealed a genetic predisposition for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (ie, Toll-like receptors) has been described in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similar to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been described in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli) with concomitant declines in Firmicutes, particularly decreased diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e. Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This will show that these groups of bacteria, which are important producers of short-chain fatty acids, can play an important role in promoting gut health.",,"Suchodolski, J. S.",2011.0,May,,0
1995,Viruses detected in the cecum contents of healthy pigs representing a new genetic cluster in gengroup II of the genus 'Norwalk-like viruses',"Viruses of the genus 'Norwalk-like viruses' (NLVs) detected in humans are genetically divided into two main genetic groups, genogroups I and II (GI and GII), which together comprise at least 14 genetic subgroups. However, a comparable classification of other types of NLVs needs to be made. We sequenced a 2 kb region from inside the RNA polymerase gene to the 3–² end of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of two NLV strains previously detected in the caecum contents of healthy pigs. All ORF2 sequences of these two NLV strains were analyzed for an additional two strains and their genetic associations with 15 human strains previously reported and used as references for genetic classification of human NLV strains; one is a recently reported human strain that appears to represent a novel genetic subset of GII; and the other, an animal NLV strain. Analysis of a matrix showing the binary identities and topology of a neighboring conjoining tree showed that the two porcine strains could be classified into a new genetic subgroup of GII on the basis of the amino acid sequences of the entire capsid protein. The grouping of the two pig lines is well supported by the results of similar analyzes of the nucleotide sequences of the entire ORF2 and the 510 base region at the 3-² end of ORF1.

1996,Differentiation of respiratory syncytial virus subsets by cDNA probes in a nucleic acid hybridization assay,"novel approach for respiratory syncytial (RS) virus subgroup determination using a simple nucleic acid filter hybridization technique has been developed. With this method, virus-infected cells are ligated and fixed in a single step, and the viral RNA in the fixed cell preparation is characterized by the ability to hybridize directly to cDNA probes specific to subgroups A or B of the RS virus. Subgroup-specific probes were made from cDNA clones corresponding to a portion of the extracellular domain of the RS virus G protein of a subgroup B RS virus (8/60) or a subgroup A RS virus (A2). The cDNA probes were labeled with 32P and used to analyze RS virus isolates collected over a thirty-year period. Replica templates of infected cell preparations were hybridized with the A or B subset probe. The subgroup assignments of the 40 viruses tested by nucleic acid hybridization were consistent with the results of subgroup determinations based on their reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, which was previously the only method available to determine subgroup classification of RS virus isolates. The nucleic acid hybridization assay has the advantage of providing broad-based discrimination of the two subgroups on the basis of nucleic acid homology, independent of minor antigenic differences detected in assays using monoclonal antibodies. The nucleic acid hybridization technique provides a reliable method for RS virus subgroup characterization.",,"Sullender, W. M.;Anderson, L. J.;Anderson, K.;Wertz, G. W.",1990.0,,,0
1997,Evaluation of an epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus in domestic and wild avian and mammalian species.,"An epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) has been developed for the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus in taxonomically diverse species of domestic and wild vertebrates. Unlike previously published bELISAs, whose reagent generation requires end-user manipulation or has not been evaluated for use with both mammalian and avian species, this assay is performed using commercially available recombinant nucleoprotein antigen and the corresponding nucleoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody. and has been shown to work with multiple bird and mammalian species. The efficacy of bELISA as a serum screening assay was compared with the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay using 251 serum samples from experimentally infected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). The agreement between the AGID test and bELISA was 94.1% (95% CI=89.9, 98.3) for raccoons and 71.2% (95% CI=63.5, 78.9) for mallards and 82.8% (95% CI=78.2, 87.3) overall. was. . bELISA was more sensitive than the AGID test, as demonstrated by the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus at earlier time points and at higher serial dilutions in experimental infection studies. The effectiveness of BELISA in monitoring natural influenza A virus exposure was also compared with the AGID test using an additional 745 serum samples from six bird species and six mammalian species. This bELISA provides a fast, reliable and inexpensive technique for large-scale surveillance of influenza A virus exposure in taxonomically diverse vertebrate species.",,"Sullivan, H. J.;Blitvich, B.

The aim of this study was to investigate PPV infection and its association with diarrhea. Here, seven PBV RT-PCR positive stool samples from children with diarrhea and four stool samples from healthy children as controls were analyzed by viral metagenomics. The results showed that all seven diarrheal stool samples contained high titers of PBV arrays, three of the controls were negative and one had low titers of PBV. Three of the diarrheal stool samples were also positive for other viruses, including anellovirus, human gyrovirus, human parecovirus, and circular virus associated with pig feces. PBV sequences from seven patients were combined and produced seven large contigs with the full ORF of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of RdRp showed that the seven PBVs in this study belonged to three different genogroups.

1999,Epidemiological and genetic features of swine pseudorabies virus in mainland China between 2012 and 2017,"An outbreak of false rabies (PR) on most Bartha-K61 vaccinated farms in China in late 2011 severely damaged the pig industry of one of the world's largest producers of pork products. To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the currently prevalent pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains in China, a total of 16,256 specimens collected from pig farms with suspected PRV infection in 27 Provinces of China between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated for PRV detection. Since the widespread use of the gE-deleted PRV vaccine in China, PRV-gE has been applied to detect wild-type virus infection by PCR. Of the 16,256 samples detected, approximately 1,345 samples were positive for PRV-gE detection, giving an average positive rate of 8.27%. Positive rates of PRV detection from 2012 to 2017 11.92% (153/1284), 12.19% (225/1846), 6.70% (169/2523), 11.10% (269/2424), It was 5.57% (147/2640). , and 6.90% (382/5539), respectively. To understand the genetic characteristics of currently circulating PRV strains, 25 PRV strains isolated from these PRV-gE positive samples were selected for further investigation. Phylogenetic analysis based on gB, gC and gE showed that PRV strains common in China have a remarkably different evolutionary relationship to PRVs in other countries; this may explain the observation that the Bartha-K61 vaccine does not provide full protection against emerging strains. Sequence alignments identified multiple amino acid changes in the gB, gC, and gE proteins of PRVs circulating in China after the epidemic compared to those from other countries or those common in China before the epidemic; these changes may also affect the protective efficacy of previously used vaccines in China and may be partly attributed to the increased virulence of current PRV epidemic strains in China.",,"Sun, Y.;Liang, W.;Liu, Q.;Zhao, T.;Zhu, H.;Hua, L.;Peng, Z.;Tang, X.;Stratton, C.

2000,"Novel triple reassortant H1N1 swine flu viruses in pigs from Tianjin, northern China.","Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and have therefore been proposed as mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses by re-diversification. In this study, we report for the first time the isolation and genetic analysis of three novel triple reassortant H1N1 swine flu viruses from pigs in Tianjin, northern China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel viruses contain genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 (PB2, PB1, PA and NP), Eurasian pig (HA, NA and M) and triple reassortant pig (NS) strains. This showed that reclassification between the 2009 pandemic H1N1, Eurasian swine and triple reassortant swine flu viruses occurred in pigs in Tianjin, resulting in the production of new viruses. In addition, three human-like H1N1, two classical swine H1N1 and two Eurasian swine H1N1 viruses were also isolated during swine flu virus surveillance from 2009 to 2013; this indicated that multiple genetic strains of porcine H1N1 viruses circulate together in the pig population. in Tianjin, China.

2001,Separate evolution of virulent Newcastle disease viruses from Mexico and Central America,"An outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) in poultry was reported in Belize in 2008. Characteristics of the three virulent Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) isolated from this outbreak (NDV-Belize-3/08, NDV-Belize-4/08 and NDV-Belize-4/08) NDV-Belize-12/08, specific pathogen-free (SPF) was evaluated in chickens by genomic analysis and clinicopathological characterization. The results showed that all three strains belonged to NDV genotype V and were lethal as assessed by the intracerebral pathogenicity index and polybasic amino acid sequence at the fusion protein cleavage site. In 4-week-old SPF chickens, NDV-Belize-3/08 behaved like a typical velogenic visserotropic NDV strain, causing severe necrohemorrhagic lesions in lymphoid organs with systemic virus distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple NDV genotype V representatives revealed that genotype V could be divided into three subgenotypes, Va, Vb, and Vc, and that all Belizean isolates tested belonged to the Vb subgenotype. Furthermore, these isolates are nearly identical to the 2007 isolate from Honduras and appear to have evolved separately from other contemporary viruses circulating in Mexico and clustered in a new clade within the NDV subgenotype Vb.

2003,Potency of an inactivated influenza vaccine prepared from A/duck/Mongolia/245/2015 (H10N3) against H10 influenza virus infection in a mouse model,"The H10N8 influenza virus became a public health threat when cases of fatal infections were detected in China in 2013 and 2014. Therefore, the genetic and antigenic characterization of H10 influenza viruses and the development of an appropriate vaccine are crucial to prepare for a future pandemic by H10. flu viruses. However, available information on these characteristics of H10 influenza viruses circulating in birds is limited. In this study, genetic analysis of H10 influenza viruses revealed that viruses recently circulating in wild birds in East Asia are genetically close to human H10N8 influenza viruses. Moreover, the antigenicity of H10 influenza viruses was stable among viruses circulating in birds. An inactivated vaccine has been prepared from A/duck/Mongolia/245/2015 (H10N3) that is genetically and antigenically close to human H10 influenza viruses. The vaccine induced sufficient neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous viruses in mice. The inactivated vaccine induced sufficient protective immunity in mice to reduce the effect of the challenges of A/duck/Hokkaido/W87/2007 (H10N2) pathogenic in mice.

2005,"Past, present and future of hepatitis E virus infection: Zoonotic perspectives.","The origin of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is not fully understood, but it is recognized as an emerging zoonotic pathogen. To date, HEV has been isolated from many animal species. The family Hepeviridae consists of two genera. The genus Orthohepevirus contains four different species (A, B, C, and D), each with different genotypes. Within the Orthohepevirus strain A, the host ranges of HEV-1 and HEV-2 are limited to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 primarily infect a wide variety of animal species as well as being zoonotic for humans. Pig and wild boar species were previously thought to be the primary natural reservoir of HEV, but more recently rabbits have also been identified as major carriers. Moreover, the increasing number of HEV infections in the food supply chain underlines the important role of farming and food processing practices in limiting virus transmission. In particular, a Chinese commercial vaccine has the potential to protect humans and possibly animal reservoirs from HEV infection.

2007,Wide interspecies diversity in virulent and vaccine strains of alphaherpes viruses,"Alphaherpes viruses are common in the human population and include herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV). These viral pathogens cause epithelial lesions and then infect the nervous system, causing lifelong delay, reactivation, and dissemination. A related veterinary herpes virus, pseudorabies (PRV), causes similar diseases in livestock that cause significant economic losses. Vaccines developed for VZV and PRV serve as useful models for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine. We present whole genome sequence comparisons of the PRV vaccine strain Bartha and two virulent PRV isolates, Kaplan and Becker. These genome sequences were determined by high-throughput sequencing and splicing and offer new insights into the attenuation of a mammalian alphaherpes virus vaccine strain. We found many previously unknown coding differences between PRV Bartha and virulent strains, including changes in GH and gB fusion proteins and more than forty other viral proteins. Interspecies variation in PRV protein sequences is much closer to previously observed levels for HSV-1 than for the highly stable VZV proteome. About 20% of the PRV genome contains tandem short sequence repeats (SSRs), a class of nucleic acid motifs whose length variations are associated with changes in DNA binding site efficiency, transcriptional regulation, and protein interactions. We find SSRs throughout the herpes virus family and provide the first global characterization of SSRs in viruses, both within and between strains. We found SSR length variation among different PRV and HSV-1 isolates, which may provide a novel mechanism for phenotypic variation between strains. Finally, we detected a small number of polymorphic bases within each plaque-purified PRV strain and characterized the effect of migration and plaque purification on these polymorphisms. These data add to the growing evidence that even plaque-purified stable DNA virus stocks exhibit limited sequence heterogeneity, which likely seeds future strain evolution.

2008,A new microplate neutralization test for typing herpes simplex virus,"microplate serum neutralization test for the prediction of complement-demanding neutralizing (CRN) antibody was established as a first step to simplify the typing of herpes simplex virus (HSV). When guinea pigs are immunized with type 2 HSV, late sera can often differentiate HSV types better than hyperimmune rabbit sera, with the CRN titer against heterologous type 1 HSV much lower than the homologous titer. Sera from guinea pigs immunized with type 1 HSV cross-reacted to approximately the same level against type 2 HSV as did rabbit antisera. Guinea pig sera with minimal cross-reactivity were selected and their high dilutions (1:160) and their complements were added to serial 10-fold dilutions of virus in microplate titration of virus infectivity. Selective reduction of virus titer by both antisera can identify the type of HSV. No suspicious intermediates were found between a number of stock strains, including many fresh isolates. The typing result coincided with the result determined by a modification of Yang et al's method based on virus titers obtained with Vero and primary chick embryo cells.

The percentage of total cells that formed rosettes in gross lymphoma lines decreased with in vivo passages. If tumor cells are exposed to trypsin treatment, the tumor cells will form rosettes. Lymphoma lines devoid of rosette-forming cells did not show rosette formation after trypsin treatment.

Whole genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates represented 15 genotypes based on genetic sequencing of eight segments. The H1N1 viruses were all purely A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses, whereas the H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were all reassortant between 5 different ancestral viruses: H1 and H3 triple reassortant (TR) from North America before 2009 IAV-S human seasonal H1, human seasonal H3N2 and A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Notably, 93% of reassortant IAV-S retained M genes derived from A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting some advantages for their host adaptation. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that multiple introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 and TR IAV-S into the Vietnamese pig population drive the genetic diversity of the currently circulating Vietnamese IAV-S. In addition, our results suggest that a reassortant IAV-S with human-like H3 and N2 genes and an A(H1N1)pdm09 origin M gene is most likely to cause a human case in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010.

Methods: Three methods were used to sequence 173 Israeli Avian avulavirus-1 domain isolates and one vaccine strain (VH). Sequencing was performed on the Proton and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and, to a lesser extent, Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq sequencers. Sequence Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) products sequenced via target-specific primers (SP) and Ion torrent sequencer had a high error rate and truncated genomes. All next-generation sequencing platform sequencing kits produced high sequence accuracy and near-complete genomic size. Results: High level of mutation was observed in intergenic regions between avian avulavirus-1 genes. Within the genes, multiple regions were more mutated than the Fusion region currently used for typing. Conclusions: Our findings show that whole genome sequencing by the Ion torrent sequencing kit is sufficient. However, when higher accuracy was desired, Illumina NextSeq and Proton torrent sequencing kits were found to be preferred.",,"Tal, S.;Ben Izhak, M.;Wachtel, C.;Wiseman, A.;Braun, T.;Yechezkel, E.;Golan, E.;Hadas, R.;Turjeman, A.;Banet-Noach, C.;Bronstein, M.;Lublin, A.;Berman, E.;Raviv, Z.;Pirak, M.;Klement, E.;Louzoun, Y.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2019.100004,0
2018,Evaluation of the wide-range PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) system and virus microarrays for virus detection,"Advanced nucleic acid-based technologies are powerful research tools for new virus discovery, but need to be standardized for broader applications such as virus detection in biological products and clinical samples. We used well-characterized retrovirus stocks to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD) for wide-range PCR by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. The results showed that, in the absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-associated virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per µL), but not virus microarrays. When virus was added to a background of cellular nucleic acids, the LOD using PLEX-ID remained the same, whereas virus detection by RT-PCR was 10-fold less sensitive and no virus could be detected by microarrays. Expected endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in the cell lines tested, and known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine trypsin. A follow-up strategy was developed using PCR amplification, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics to demonstrate the presence of an RD114-like retrovirus sequence detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Cf2Th canine thymus). was due to defective, endogenous gammaretrovirus-related sequences.

2019,Circulation of highly lethal avian contagious bursal disease virus in Finland,"In the spring of 2014, infectious bursal disease (IBD) was confirmed in a Finnish layer herd exhibiting clinical signs and increased mortality. Organ and blood samples were sent to Evira, the Finnish Food Safety Authority, for identification. IBD virus (IBDV) was detected in RT-PCR studies. Associated with increased mortality (7%-10%, worst case 30%) all chickens on six layer farms were diagnosed with IBD in 2014. Antibodies were detected by IBD-ELISA tests in chickens from both farms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the causative agent of the 2014 IBD outbreak was a non-reassortant, highly virulent type of IBDV. Representative virus strains from previous IBD outbreaks in 1978, 1987 and 1993 were also included in the analysis. The strains isolated in 2014 and 1993 were very similar, indicating that a very lethal IBDV had been circulating in the country for over 20 years.

2020,A general assay for whole genome amplification and deep sequencing of enterovirus A71,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has emerged as the leading cause of major outbreaks of severe and sometimes fatal hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the Asia-Pacific region. Outbreaks of EV-A71 have been associated with (sub)genogroup changes, sometimes accompanied by recombination events. Understanding the EV-A71 population dynamics is therefore crucial to understanding this emerging infection and can provide crucial information for vaccine development. Despite the public health burden of EV-A71, relatively few EV-A71 whole genome sequences are available for analysis and from limited geographic areas. The availability of an efficient procedure for whole genome sequencing will spur the effort to generate more viral sequence data. Here, we report for the first time the development of a next-generation sequencing-based protocol for whole-genome sequencing of EV-A71 directly from clinical specimens. We were able to sequence viruses of C4 and B5 subgenogroups, while RNA was successfully amplified from culture materials of various EV-A71 subgenogroups belonging to both genogroups B and C. The nature of in-host genetic variation was investigated in 22 clinical samples, revealing 107 positions carrying minor variants (ranging from 0 to 15 variants per sample). Our analysis of the EV-A71 strains sampled in 2013 showed that they all belonged to subgenogroup B5, representing the first report of this subgenogroup in Vietnam. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a high-throughput next-generation sequencing-based assay for whole-genome sequencing of EV-A71 from clinical specimens.",,"Tan, L. V.;Tuyen, N. T.

2022,Suppression of coronavirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors,"Coronaviruses infect a variety of mammalian and avian species and cause serious illness in humans, cats, mice, and birds, in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), mouse hepatitis, and avian infectious bronchitis, respectively. . No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for the SARS-coronavirus or FIP virus, both of which cause fatal diseases. It has been reported that cyclosporin A (CsA), a cyclophilin inhibitor, can inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine specific phosphatase. Inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol to the nucleus, thereby preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophyllins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and fold activities. Also, many viruses require cyclophilin for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication.

2023,Characterization of Akabane virus from the native bamboo rat in southern China,"To identify the causative agents of 3 large-scale outbreaks of encephalitis and death among farm bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus). Routine bacterial culture and identification were performed. There were no significant pathogenic bacteria isolated from the brain, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys of diseased bamboo rats. Using PCR-based methods, we excluded the following as causative agents: smallpox virus, herpes virus, adenovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, rabies virus, and sendai virus. In addition, homogenate from diseased bamboo rats was subjected to viral metagenomic analysis that revealed 48506 filtered viral reads annotated to Akabane virus (AKAV) with >75% nucleotide identity, suggesting the presence of AKAVs in bamboo rats. Five novel AKAV isolates were successfully isolated and characterized. Furthermore, the newly isolated AKAV isolate was used to show that bamboo can reproduce severe encephalitic and pneumonic disease in rats and mice. The findings contribute to a better understanding of AKAV epidemiology and to the prevention and control of Akabane diseases in China.",,"Tang, H. B.;Chen, F. L.;Rao, G. B.;Bai, A. B.;Jiang, J.

2024,Metagenomics for the discovery of new human viruses,"As physicians and epidemiologists increasingly deal with infectious diseases caused by new or previously unrecognized pathogens, there is a great need for modern laboratory techniques for the detection of new human viruses. There are many clinical syndromes in which viruses are suspected to play a role but in which conventional microbiology techniques routinely fail to reveal the etiologic agent. In addition, new viruses continue to challenge the human population due to encroachment of human settlements on animals and animal habitats, globalization, climate change, increasing numbers of immunocompromised people and bioterrorism. Metagenomics-based tools such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing are ideal for responding to these challenges. Pan-viral microarrays containing representative sequences from all known viruses were used to detect novel and distantly related variants of known viruses. Sequencing-based methods have also been used successfully to detect novel viruses and have the potential to detect the entire virus spectrum, including those found in low numbers.

2025,"Molecular evolution of Japanese encephalitis virus isolated from pigs in Oita, Japan between 1980-2009","To identify patterns of genetic variation in strains of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) circulating in Oita, the full envelope (E) gene was sequenced for 35 isolates from pigs over a 30-year period. Based on nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences, genetic variation was examined, phylogeny estimated and selection pressures were also analyzed. This study showed that the major genotype (G) of JEV isolates shifted from GIII to GI in the mid-1990s in Oita. The intensities of selection acting on Oita GIII and GI strains were found to be almost the same. He suggests that such a genotype shift observed in Oita may not be due to selection intensity. Pairwise comparisons revealed high conservation of the E gene at the protein level. Compared with Oita GIII strains, all Oita GI strains shared four amino acid changes in E129 (TM), E222 (AS), E327 (ST), and E366 (AS). Among all 70 JEV isolates covered in this manuscript, the GI strains shared only one amino acid change in E222 (AS) compared with the GIII strains. No strong evidence for positive selection was found, JEV evolution was generally subjected to strong purifying selection, but an ongoing evolutionary pathway in Oita was found to be under relaxed purifying selection.

2026,Isolation and characterization of H3N2 influenza A virus from turkeys,"Five 34-week-old turkey brood eggs from a single farm in Ohio, in separate houses of 2550 birds each, experienced a decline in egg production from late January to early February 2004. Tracheal swabs (n = 60), cloacal swabs (n = 50), and convalescent serum from flocks (n = 110) were sent to the laboratory for diagnosis. Virus isolation was attempted in specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and Vero and MDCK cells. Virus characterization was performed using agar gel immunodiffusion, hemagglutination test, hemagglutination inhibition test, virus neutralization test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. A possible influenza virus was successfully spread and isolated on first pass in MDCK cells, but not initially in Vero cells or specific pathogen-free chicken embryos. After two passages in MDCK cells, it was possible to propagate the isolate in specific pathogen-free chicken embryos. Preliminary sequence analysis of the isolated virus confirmed that it was influenza A virus with almost 100% (235/236) identity with the matrix gene of a porcine influenza A virus, A/Swine/Illinois/100084/01 (H1N2). However, it was not possible to determine the subtype of the virus using conventional serotyping methods. The results of the genetic characterization of the isolated virus showed that it was the H3N2 subtype and designated as A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2). Phylogenetic analysis of eight gene segments of the virus showed that isolate A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) was most closely related to triple reassortant H3N2 porcine viruses [A/Swine/WI/ 14094/99 (H3N2)] from avian, porcine, and human viruses. circulating among pigs in the United States since 1998. A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolated from turkeys in this study was classified as low pathogenic avian influenza A virus because it caused a decrease in egg production with only other minor clinical manifestations and no death.",,"Tang, Y.;Lee, C.

Previous studies have shown that PRRSV RNA synthesis correlates with HP-PRRSV virulence. PRRSV RNA synthesis includes genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA, and these processes require minus-stranded RNA as template. However, the mechanisms involved in PRRSV minus-stranded RNA synthesis are not fully understood. A mini-genome system can be used to evaluate viral replication mechanisms and to evaluate the effects of potential antiviral drugs on viral replicase activities. In this study, we developed a mini-genome system using firefly luciferase as a reporter. Based on this system, we found that the PRRSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp9 alone failed to activate virus minus-stranded RNA synthesis.

2031,Combining Comprehensive Analysis of Off-site Lambda Phage Integration with a CRISPR-Based Tool to Identify Downstream Physiology,"During the lysogenic life cycle, the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. In this report, we analyze lambda phage integration into non-canonical sites using next-generation sequencing and target more than 300 unique sites in the host Escherichia coli genome, demonstrating that it generates significant genetic diversity. Furthermore, these integration events can have important phenotypic consequences for the host, including changes in cell motility and increased antibiotic resistance. More importantly, the new technologies we developed to enable this work – sequencing secondary sites using next-generation sequencing and then selecting lysogens of interest using clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based selection – are broadly applicable to other phage bacteria systems. IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogeny, in which the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome. While phage integration usually occurs at a specific location of the host chromosome, it is known to occur at other locations, called secondary sites. In this study, we developed a new experimental technology to comprehensively study the secondary integration sites and discovered that the phage can integrate over 300 unique regions in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. We further developed an assay to examine the phenotypic consequences of such diverse integration events and found that phage integration can result in changes in evolutionarily relevant traits such as increases in bacterial motility and antibiotic resistance. More importantly, our method can be easily applied to other phage-bacteria systems.",,"Tanouchi, Y.;Covert, M. W.",2017.0,09 19,,0
2032,A metagenomic approach to characterize temperate bacteriophage populations from patients with Cystic Fibrosis and Non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), normally a soil commensal, is an important opportunistic pathogen for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (nCFBR). Persistent infection is associated with accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. Horizontal transfer of DNA by temperate bacteriophages can add gene function and selective advantages to bacterial hosts in the restricted environment of the lower lung. In this study, we chemically induced temperate bacteriophages from clonal cultures of Pa and determined their mixed viral communities using metagenomic approaches. We compared 92 temperate phage metagenomes classified from these clinical backgrounds (47 CF and 45 nCFBR Pa isolates) using MG-RAST and GeneWise2. KEGG analysis shows that the complexity of temperate phage accessory gene carriage increases with duration and severity of disease. We also detect the presence of Ig-like motifs in phage structural genes linked to bacterial adhesion and carbohydrate binding, including Big_2, He_Pig and Fn3.

Unselected screening identified 79 viremic donors; 76 participated in a follow-up study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Viral RNA dynamics, phylogenetics, and seroconversion in donors were characterized. Detailed demographic, travel, clinical, and lifestyle surveys were conducted. RESULTS Most viremic individuals (57/79) were seronegative at donation, but all were seroconverted. Viremia was short-lived, with a median of 6.5 weeks until viral clearance was confirmed. All infections were acquired in the UK and were G3, Group 2 viruses predominant (43/54; 80%). Infection was associated with some clinical symptoms both during and after donation (8/77; 10%). Viral loads and symptoms were more prominent in Group 1 infections. There was no serological evidence of reinfection. Donors were mostly male (p = 0.002); both male and female donors were older than comparative donors. Contact with animals was unlikely to be a source of infection. Consumption of chicken and pork was common in all infected donors; processed pork was most commonly purchased from a particular retail chain. CONCLUSION Viremic donors represent primary infection in older members of the population and reflect a common zoonotic disease in the UK. The two phylogenetic groups of HEV G3 exhibit different pathogenicity and the more common Group 2 appears to be less adapted to humans. There are no objective demographic criteria to identify donors at increased risk of HEV.",,"Tedder, R. S.;Tettmar, K. I.;Brailsford, S.

2037,Increased Prevalence of Anellovirus in Pediatric Patients with Fever,"The Anelloviridae family consists of non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. Three anellovirus strains, TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV, are known to infect humans. Although anelloviruses were initially thought to cause non-AG viral hepatitis, ongoing research to date has not demonstrated a definitive association between anellovirus and human disease. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients aged 2-36 months. Although anellovirus was found in large numbers of samples from both febrile and febrile patients, we determined that they were more prevalent in plasma and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples from febrile patients compared with febrile controls. Using PCR to detect each of the three anellovirus strains that infect humans, we found that the anellovirus strains TTV and TTMDV were more prevalent in plasma and NP samples of patients with fever compared with controls without fever. This was not the case for TTMV strains found in similar percentages of febrile and nonfebrile patient samples. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of anellovirus-containing plasma and NP samples increased with age until patients were 19-24 months old, followed by a decrease in the percentage of anellovirus-positive patient samples. This trend was striking for TTV and TTMDV and very modest for TTMV in both plasma and NP samples. Finally, the frequency of detection of TTV and TTMDV increased as the fever of febrile patients increased. Again, TTMV was equally present in both febrile and febrile patient samples. Taken together, these data show that the human anellovirus strains TTV and TTMDV are associated with fever in children, while the highly associated human anellovirus TTMV is not associated with fever.",,"TeKippe, E.

2038,Viral metagenomics on animals as a tool for the detection of zoonoses prior to human infection?,"Many human viral infections have a zoonotic, that is, wild or domestic animal origin. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans by direct contact with an animal or indirectly by exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals, or by the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus can adapt and replicate in a new human host, human-to-human transmission could occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic such as the 2009 A/H1N1 flu epidemic. Therefore, estimating emerging zoonotic infections is an important issue. This is a challenging task for public health officials in the coming decades. Recent advances in viral metagenomics, i.e. the characterization of complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, are promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods in close contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity in such animals (especially blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present possible future applications for surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.

As part of a global metagenomic analysis of viral communities present in biting midges, we report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a Faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and detection in animal hosts. DNA virome analysis of three pools of biting midges Culicoides sp., occluded female Culicoides imicola and non-occluded male/female C. imicola collected in Senegal revealed the presence of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and the majority of sequences among them. Relating to faustovirus. Phylogenetic analyzes performed on various structural genes of Faustovirus confirmed the clustering of arthropod-derived Faustovirus with sewage-derived Faustoviruses with a distinct geographic cluster of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphology and diameters compatible with Faustovirus. The presence of infectious arthropod-derived Faustovirus was finally confirmed by successful isolation on V. vermiformis amoeba. Global proteomic analysis of the biting midges determined that the arthropod blood meals came from cattle, rodents, and humans. Further screening of bovine serum and rodent tissue resulted in an estimated Faustovirus prevalence of 38% in rodents and 14% in cattle, suggesting a possible origin of the presence of Faustovirus in arthropods through ingestion of contaminated blood meal.

In this article, the isolation and characterization of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) from Eurasian collared pigeons between 2000 and 2001 are reported and compared with isolates from wild pigeons (Columba livia) in the same period. All isolates can be classified as avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV1) and belong to the pigeon variant group (PPMV1) because their hemagglutination activities were inhibited by the PPMV1-specific mAb 161/617. Intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranged from 0.68 to 1.38, and all isolates contained multiple basic amino acids in the inferred cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is typical of virulent viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates shows that 18/20 of them formed a separate cluster from isolates obtained from pigeons during the same period. These findings suggest that different lineages circulate in wild pigeon populations and a distinct lineage affects Eurasian collared pigeons.",,"Terregino, C.;Cattoli, G.;Grossele, B.;Bertoli, E.;Tisato, E.;Capua, I.",2003.0,,10.1080/0307,0
2043,Heterologous viral expression systems in fosmid vectors increase the potential for functional analysis of metagenomic libraries,"The extraordinary potential of metagenomic functional assays to identify relevant activities present in uncultured microorganisms has been limited by reduced gene expression in surrogate hosts. By exploiting viral components that inhibit transcription termination at metagenomic terminators, we have developed vectors and specific E. coli strains as advanced metagenomic DNA heterologous expression systems. One system uses phage T7 RNA-polymerase to direct metagenomic gene expression, while the other approach uses lambda phage transcription anti-termination protein N to limit transcription termination. A metagenomic library was constructed and functionally screened to identify genes conferring carbenicillin resistance to E. coli. Use of these enhanced expression systems resulted in a 6-fold increase in the frequency of carbenicillin-resistant clones. Subcloning and sequence analysis showed that efflux pumps, as well as Î²-lactamases, not only contribute to carbenicillin resistance, but may actually be sufficient on their own to transmit carbenicillin resistance.",,"TerrÃ³n-GonzÃ¡lez, L.;Medina, C.;LimÃ³n-MortÃ©s, M.

2044,"Identification of a new aviadenovirus, termed pigeon adenovirus 2, in domestic pigeons (Columba livia)","Young pigeon disease syndrome (YPDS) mainly affects young pigeons less than one year old and leads to crop failure, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and sometimes death. This disease is a major health concern internationally, as it occurs seasonally during competitions such as pigeon racing or ornamental bird display. Although the etiology of YPDS is still unclear, adenoviruses are often discussed as potential causative agents. Electron microscopy of faeces from a YPDS outbreak revealed massive shedding of adenovirus-like particles. Whole genome sequencing of this specimen identified a new adenovirus tentatively termed pigeon adenovirus 2 (PiAdV-2). Phylogenetic and comparative genome analysis suggest that PiAdV-2 belongs to a new species within the genus Aviadenovirus, which we propose the name Pigeon aviadenovirus B. The PiAdV-2 genome shares 54.9% nucleotide sequence identity with pigeon adenovirus 1 (PiAdV-1). . Screening of other YPDS-affected flocks revealed two PiAdV-2 variants (variant A and B) that shared 97.6% nucleotide identity of partial polymerase sequences but only 79.7% nucleotide identity of partial hexon sequences. The distribution of both PiAdV-2 variants was further investigated in stool samples collected between 2008 and 2015 from healthy or YPDS-affected racing pigeons in different lofts. Regardless of their health status, approximately 20% of the young pigeon flocks and 13% of the adult pigeon flocks harbored PiAdV-2 variants. Birds were free of PiAdV-1 or other aviadenoviruses as determined by PCRs targeting the aviadenovirus polymerase or the PiAdV-1 fiber gene, respectively. In conclusion, there is no indication of correlation between YPDS outbreaks and the presence of PiAdV-2 or other aviadenoviruses, opposing a causal role in this disease complex.",,"Teske, L.;Rubbenstroth, D.;Meixner, M.;Liere, K.;Bartels, H.;Rautenschlein, S.",2017.0,01 02,,0
2045,Characterization of a genetically heterogeneous porcine rotavirus C and other viruses found in the fecal virome of a non-diarrheal Belgian piglet.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are becoming more and more accessible, leading to a growing interest in the composition of the porcine enteric virome. In this study, fecal viroma of a Belgian piglet without diarrhea was determined. Although only a single piglet virome was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other fully characterized porcine RVC strain, Cowden. Association with RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed, and the pig strain in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which may be serologically different from most other porcine RVC strains. A new putative RVC VP6 genotype was also identified. A group A rotavirus strain, also found in this stool sample, contained the rare porcine genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical porcine RVA genotypes I5, A8 and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1 and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the piglet's fecal virome also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, whose entire genomes were characterized. The results of the present study show that many viruses can be found simultaneously in stool samples of non-diarrheal piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly related to any disease, but still have a potential subclinical effect on pig growth performance. The rapid evolution of NGS will make it a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections that may not have been noticed using conventional diagnostic techniques. This will encourage the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production.",,"Theuns, S.;ConceiÃ§Ã£o-Neto, N.;Zeller, M.;Heylen, E.;Roukaerts, I. D.

2046,Nanopore sequencing as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for porcine viral enteric disease complexes identifies porcine cobuvirus as an important enteric virus,"Enteric diseases in pigs are often caused by different pathogens and therefore metagenomics is a useful diagnostic tool. The capabilities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics are explored here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a Minion. Reads were already detected 7 seconds after the start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 hours. Next, the diarrheal stool of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Nearly all readings (99%) belonged to bacteriophages that may have reshaped the piglet microbiome. Contigs matched with Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus phages. In addition, swine cobuvirus was discovered in the stool for the first time in Belgium. Lactating piglets shed cobuvirus from one week of age, but no association was observed between the peak of viral shedding (10<sup>6.42</sup>-10<sup>7.01</sup> copies/swab) and diarrheal symptoms. follow the lesson. Retrospective analysis showed a prevalence of genetically moderately related cobuviruses (n = 25, 56.8% positive) among Belgian diarrheal piglets. MiniION provides rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validation should be done. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine cobuvirus has to be questioned, but its subclinical importance cannot be ignored.",,"Theuns, S.;Vanmechelen, B.;Bernaert, Q.;Deboutte, W.;Vandenhole, M.;Beller, L.;Matthijnssens, J.;Maes, P.;Nauwynck, H.

2047,Molecular characterization of positive-strand RNA viruses: pestiviruses and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV),"Molecular characterization has become an important tool for the analysis of viruses, including their classification. The manuscript focuses on the molecular analysis of two members of the pestivirus genus (swine cholera virus, HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus, BVDV) and the recently discovered porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The first protein encoded in the single large pestivirus ORF is a nonstructural protein with autoproteolytic activity. The cleavage site between the protease and the capsid protein p14 was predicted, but recent experimental data indicate that processing occurs at a different site. The capsid protein is followed by a putative internal signal sequence and three glycoproteins that are part of the virion envelope. According to a recent proposal for naming the structural proteins of pestiviruses, they are designated C, E0, E1, and E2. The genomes of BVDV pairs isolated from animals with mucosal disease were analyzed. Genomes from cytopathogenic (cp) BVD viruses may contain insertions that are highly homologous to cellular sequences. In addition, cp BVDV may differ from its non-cytopathogenic (non-cp) counterpart only by rearrangement of viral sequences. PRRS, which appeared several years ago, is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus; The viral genome has positive polarity and is 15 kb in size. Data on morphology, morphogenesis, and virion composition have already suggested that PRRSV belongs to a group of arteriviruses that includes equine arthritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-promoting virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). This conclusion has now been confirmed by analysis of genome organization, gene expression strategy, and comparison of inferred protein sequences.",,"Thiel, H.

2049,Estimation of swine seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) using ELISA and Western blot and comparison between human and porcine HEV sequences in Belgium,"Zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is of particular concern, particularly in high-income countries where waterborne infections are less frequent than in developing countries. High HEV seroprevalences can be found in European pig populations. The aim of this study was to obtain prevalence data of HEV infection in pigs in Belgium and to phylogenetically compare Belgian human HEV sequences with those obtained from pigs. An ELISA screening prevalence of 73% (95% CI 68.8-77.5) was determined in Belgian pigs and some of the results were re-evaluated by Western blot (WB). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed and scenarios that changed ELISA specificity relative to WB were analyzed. Estimated seroprevalences by the different scenarios range from 69% to 81%, consistent with the high exposure of the European pig population to HEV. Pig HEV sequences were genetically compared to those detected in humans in Belgium and genotype 3 subtype f was shown to be predominant in both pigs and humans. The high HEV seroprevalence in pigs and the close phylogenetic relationships between swine and human HEV sequences further support the risk of zoonotic transmission of HEV between humans and pigs. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Thiry, D.;Mauroy, A.;Saegerman, C.;Thomas, I.;Wautier, M.;Miry, C.;Czaplicki, G.;Berkvens, D.;Praet, N.;van der Poel, W.;Cariolet, R.;Brochier, B.;Thiry, E.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.06.004,0
2050,Molecular biology of bovine herpesvirus type 4,"Bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BHV-4) is a ubiquitous bovine virus. Its genome is 144 Â± 6 kb double-stranded DNA and consists of a unique central portion (L-DNA) flanked at both ends by tandem repeats called polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA or H-DNA). The overall arrangement of the genes was obtained by analysis of the homologies between the short BHV-4 DNA sequences and the corresponding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) genes. Gene expression is transiently regulated. The glycoprotein precursor p(gp10/gp17) is expressed as the gamma 1 polypeptide. The glycoproteins gp1, gp8, gp11 and their precursors are gamma 2 proteins. Analysis of strain variations allows the identification of two types of strains based on their DNA patterns: Movar 33/63-like and DN 599-like strains. M40 strain isolated only in India does not fit this classification. Genomic variations were compiled to create a dendrogram that differed at three levels between BHV-4 strains or isolates. Available molecular data indicate that the BHV-4 genome shares much similarity with the DNA of the two representative members of gammaherpesvirinae, EBV and HVS.

2051,Origin of lentivirus research: Maedi-visna virus,"Maedi and visna are contagious sheep diseases brought to Iceland by imported Karakul sheep in 1933. Maedi, a slowly progressive pneumonia, and visna, a central nervous system disease, have been shown to be contagious in sheep and most likely caused by a virus. Visna virus was isolated in tissue culture from sheep brain in 1957 and maedi virus was isolated from sheep lung the following year. Both viruses showed similar cytopathic effect in tissue culture. Electron microscopy studies of ultrathin sections from Visna virus-infected cells showed spherical particles 70-100 nm in diameter, formed by budding from the cell membrane. Subsequent studies showed the same particles in cultures infected with maedi virus. These and several other comparative studies have strongly demonstrated that maedi and visna are caused by strains of the same virus, later called maedi-visna virus (MVV). Comparative studies in tissue culture suggested that MVV is associated with animal RNA tumor viruses, oncornaviruses. This was later supported by the finding that MVV is an RNA virus. A few months after the demonstration of reverse transcriptase in oncornaviruses, the enzyme was also found in MVV virions. Thus, MVV was classified as a retrovirus along with oncornaviruses. However, MVV is not oncogenic in vivo or in vitro and in 1975 was placed in a subgroup of retroviruses called lentiviruses, which are noncogenic but cause cytopathic effect in vitro and slow progressive inflammatory disease in animals. In the early 1980s, the AIDS-causing agent was found to be a non-oncogenic retrovirus and classified as a lentivirus. Thus, HIV became the first human lentivirus.

2052,"Prevalence and diversity of H9N2 avian influenza in North Vietnamese chickens, 2014","Although A/H9N2 viruses are classified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), they cause significant losses in poultry in many countries in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. To date, poultry surveillance in Vietnam has focused on the detection of influenza H5 viruses, and there is limited understanding of influenza H9 epidemiology and transmission dynamics. We determined the prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) in 7 northern Vietnamese provinces using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected between October and December 2014. Screening by real-time RT-PCR showed 1207/4900 (24.6%) pooled swabs positive for influenza A virus; Overall prevalence estimates were 5.8% (CI 5.4-6.0) after taking into account pooling (5 swab/pool). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swab with the M gene Ct<26. No influenza H7 detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence of interaction between H9 and H5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 complete genomes of A/H9N2, 2 genomes of A/H5N6 and 11 partial genomes. All H9N2 viruses have internal genes that cluster with genotype 57 and are closely related to Chinese human A/H7N9 and A/H10N8 isolates. We identified 9 different H9 genotypes using a nucleotide divergence cutoff of 98%.

Methods and Results Two bio-safe, static composting systems were constructed that included cattle mortality at sub-zero temperatures. The temperature at each sampling site was measured continuously and samples were grouped at <= 50 or >= 55 degrees C based on exposure to the temperature required for effective pathogen inactivation during composting. High-throughput 454 sequencing was used to characterize bacterial communities in each sample. Clustering of bacterial communities was observed according to temperature. However, neither richness nor diversity differed between temperature groups. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in both temperature groups, but was more prominent in samples >= 55 degrees C (P<0 center point 05) (63 center point 6%). Similarly, members of Clostridia, Clostridium sensu stricto (3 centers 64%), Clostridium XI (0 centers 59%), UF (Clostridiaceae 1) (5 centers 29%) and UF (Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI) (6 centers) point 20%), was evident at >= 55 degrees C (P<0 center point 05), possibly a reflection of spore survival and/or anaerobic microenvironments within passively aerated compost piles.

2059,A large repertoire of type III secretion effectors in Escherichia coli O157 and the role of lambdoid phages in their dissemination,"Several pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli use type III secretion to inject ""effector proteins"" into human cells, which then turn eukaryotic cell biology to the advantage of the bacteria. We utilized bioinformatics and experimental approaches to determine that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is much greater than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of >60 putative effector genes. Of these, 13 were judged to be probable pseudogene, while 49 were potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were experimentally validated as effectors: 31 via proteomics and 28 via translocation experiments. At the protein level, EHEC effector sequences are divided into >20 families. The largest family, the NIeG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai lineage alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologs of effectors from plant pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG) and two additional members of the Map/IpgB family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors occur at >20 switchable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Importantly, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine replaceable effector loci located within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type III secretion in E. coli is associated with a large phage ""metagenome"" that serves as a crucible for the evolution of pathogenicity.

2061,Circoviruses: immunosuppressive threats to avian species: a review,"Circoviruses are small, non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses that are unique among animal viruses by having circular, single-stranded DNA genomes. Their genomes are also the smallest that animal viruses have. The circovirus family currently consists of three members, chicken anemia virus, porcine circovirus, and psittasine beak and feather disease virus, and pigeon circovirus is classified as a transient member. Infections with each of the four circoviruses are associated with potentially fatal diseases in which damage to lymphoid tissue by the virus and immunosuppression are common features. Experience with other animal virus families indicates that additional animal species will be infected by as-yet undiscovered circoviruses, which may show similar tissue tropism and disease-causing potential. Recent reports describing the association of circovirus-like viruses with immunodeficiency-related diseases of geese and southern black-backed gulls suggest that circovirus infections of avian species may be more common than previously known, raising the question of whether novel circoviruses infect poultry. clinical and/or subclinical diseases that may be economically significant. This review has three purposes. First, it was designed to summarize currently available information on classified circoviruses and viruses that are considered circovirus-like.

2062,Morphogenesis of a cytomegalovirus from an American bison affected by malignant catarrh.,"herpes virus isolated from various organs of an American bison affected by malignant flu was cultured in bovine fetal spleen cells and examined by electron microscopy. The fine structural features and mode of virus morphogenesis of the mature virion were found to be similar to herpes viruses classified in the cytomegalovirus subgroup. The capsids contained granular, hexagonal shaped and thin sections pleomorphic nuclei. Encapsulation of the capsids occurred mainly by budding on the cytoplasmic membranes, which appeared to be formed as elongated vesicles of the Golgi apparatus; budding in nuclear membranes was rarely observed. Cytoplasmic inclusions of granular filaments and amorphous electron-dense material were found in association with virions in the late stages of infection. The formation of cytoplasmic inclusions, morphogenesis and superstructure of the virus is consistent with the classification of this virus as a cytomegalovirus.",,"Todd, W. J.;Storz, J.",1983.0,,,0

Objectives: To genotype Australian VZV strains using high resolution melt (HRM) analysis of SNPs at five gene targets. Study design: DNA from 78 samples from chickenpox and zoster patients was genotyped by HRM analysis of SNPs in five open reading frames (ORFs): 1 (685 G > A), 21 (33 725 C > T), 37 ( 66 288 G > A), 60 (101 464 C > A) and 62 (106 262 T > C), using double-stranded (ds) DNA saturation dye, LC Green Plus. Results: For each genotype, melting curve temperature (Tm) shifts differentiated the nucleotide found at that locus (P < 0.0001), with melting curve shifts ranging from 0.56 Â°C (ORF 37) to 3.34 Â°C (ORF 62) across alleles. The most common genotypes detected were European Type C (59%) and B (18%) strains. This was followed by African/Asian Type A (14%) and Japanese J1 (9%) strains common in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Results: HRM analysis of SNPs showed that European genotypes B and C were most common in Australia and strains A and J were also present. HRM analysis using a dsDNA stain provides a useful tool in the classification of varicella-zoster viruses. Â© 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Toi, C. S.;Dwyer, D.

Here we report the discovery and genetic characterization of a novel virus found in cattle with respiratory disease. Phylogenetic characterization of this virus revealed that it clusters within the subfamily Torovirinae in the family Coronaviridae. The complete genome consists of only 20 261 nt and represents the smallest coronavirus genome reported. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, provisionally termed bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the recently described python-derived nidoviruses and contains several conserved nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the existing NendoU or O-MT domains.

2069,Development of an RT-qPCR assay for the specific detection of a distinct genetic lineage of infectious bursal disease virus,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a major health threat to the world poultry industry despite appropriate biosafety practices and intensive controls, including vaccination. IBDV (Avibirnavirus, Birnaviridae) is a non-enveloped virus with a bipartite double-stranded RNA genome. The virus has traditionally been classified as classical, variable and highly virulent strains, each with different epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. Recently, a new genetic lineage spreading worldwide has been identified and designated as distinct (d)IBDV. Here, we report the development and validation of a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay for the specific detection of dIBDVs in the global poultry industry. The assay uses a TaqMan-MGB probe that hybridizes with a unique molecular signature of dIBDV. The assay successfully detected all evaluated strains belonging to the dIBDV genetic lineage and showed high specificity and absence of cross-reactivity with non-dIBDV, IBDV-negative samples and other common avian viruses. Using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, we obtained acceptable PCR efficiencies and detection coefficients and relatively small intra- and inter-assay variability. The test showed a wide dynamic range between 103 and 108 RNA copies/reactions. This rapid, specific and quantitative test is expected to improve surveillance and control of IBDV worldwide and increase our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of this economically harmful avian pathogen.",,"TomÃ¡s, G.;HernÃ¡ndez, M.;Marandino, A.;Techera, C.;Grecco, S.;HernÃ¡ndez, D.;Banda, A.;Panzera, Y.;PÃ©rez, R.",2017.0,,10.1080/03079457.2016.1228827,0
2070,"Infectious Ecthyma, Rangiferine Brucellosis, and Lungworm Infection in a Muskox (Ovibos moschatus) from the Canadian Arctic, 2014","An adult male musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) harvested on August 26, 2014 in Victoria Island, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, had proliferative dermatitis on the muzzle and fetlocks suggestive of contagious ecthyma or orf (Parapoxvirus). Histopathological features of the lesions were consistent with this diagnosis. Orf virus DNA phylogenetically similar to an isolate from a captive musk bovine in the Minnesota Zoo, USA, was detected in the lesions by PCR using Parapoxvirus primers. There was also a metaphyseal abscess with cortical fistula in the right metacarpus in which Brucella suis biovar 4 was isolated and supported by PCR. Brucella spp. Antibodies were detected in the serum. Finally, 212 nodules were dissected from the lungs. Stool analysis and lung examination revealed co-infection with the lungworms Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis and Varestrongylus eleguneniensis. The zoonotic potential of orf and rangiferin brucellosis adds an important public health dimension to this situation, especially given that muskoxen is a valuable food source for Arctic inhabitants. Careful scrutiny of these pathogens at the population level is necessary as they can contribute to the reduction of the Muskox population and potentially create a driver of food insecurity for local communities.

We cloned a virus isolate from a parrot with lesions characteristic of PD. Three viral clones were partially sequenced, showing that this virus is an alphaherpes virus most closely related to gallid herpes virus 1. Five primer sets were developed from these sequences. Primer sets were used in conjunction with PCR to screen tissues or tissue culture media suspected to contain virus from 54 PD outbreaks. The primer sets the amplified DNA from all but one sample. Ten amplification patterns were identified, suggesting that PD is caused by a genetically heterogeneous virus population. It was a single genetic variant (psittacid herpesvirus variant 1) amplified by all primer sets and the most common virus variant (62.7%). A single primer set (23F) amplified DNA from all positive samples suggests that PCR can be used as a rapid post-mortem assay for these viruses.

2072,Molecular phylogeny of psittacid herpes viruses causing Pacheco's disease: correlation of genotype with phenotypic expression.,"419 bp fragments of the UL16 open reading frame from 73 psittacid herpesviruses (PsHVs) from the United States and Europe were sequenced. All viruses caused Pacheco disease and the serotypes of European isolates were known. A phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences showed that PsHVs causing Pacheco disease contained four major genotypes, with each genotype containing two to four variants. With the exception of two viruses, serotypes of virus isolates can be predicted by genotypes. Genotype 1 and 4 corresponded to serotype 1 isolates, genotype 2 to serotype 2 isolates, and genotype 3 to serotype 3 isolates. The only serotype 4 virus mapped to genotype 4, DNA from a virus with a unique serotype cannot be amplified with primers that amplify DNA from all other PsHVs, and its classification is unknown. Viruses representing all four genotypes were found in both the United States and Europe, and therefore serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were predicted to be present in the United States. Serotype 4 was represented by a single European isolate that was genetically indistinguishable from serotype 1 viruses; therefore, the presence of serotype 4 in the United States could not be predicted. In the United States, the genotype 4 viruses most commonly associated with Pacheco disease in macaws and cones were found to be the least likely to be isolated from chicken embryo fibroblasts. All four genotypes caused deaths in Amazon parrots, but genotype 4 was only associated with Pacheco disease in European Amazons. Genotypes 2, 3 and 4, not 1, were found in African gray parrots. Although parrots in the Pacific distribution represent a relatively small percentage of the total number of birds with Pacheco disease, all four genotypes were found to cause disease in this species.",,"Tomaszewski, E.

Infection in PK-15 cells. Other approaches, including microarray, real-time RT-PCR, and Illumina sequencing, can only detect the collective transcriptional activity of certain genomic regions, but not individual herpes virus transcripts. However, SMRT sequencing allows for a distinction to be made between transcript isoforms, including length and splice variants, as well as between overlapping polycistronic RNA molecules. The non-amplified Isoform Sequencing (Iso-Seq) method was used to analyze the kinetic properties of lytic PRV transcripts and then classify them appropriately.

2074,Metagenomic evaluation of adventitious viruses in commercial cattle serum,"Animal serum is an important supplement to the cell culture medium. Incidental contamination of animal serum with viruses has led to major regulatory action and product recalls. We used metagenomic methods to detect and characterize viral contaminants in 26 bovine serum samples from 12 producers. Among the samples, we detected sequences with homology to 20 viruses at depths of up to 50,000 viral reads per million. The viruses detected represented nine viral families plus four viruses that were not taxonomically assigned, and had both RNA genomes and DNA genomes. Sequences ranged from 28% to 96%, similar to viruses in the GenBank database at the amino acid level. The number of viruses ranged from zero to 11 among samples and from one to 11 among suppliers, and only one product from a supplier was completely “clean”. For a common incidental virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), abundance estimates were calculated from metagenomic data (viral reads per million), obtained from quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtq-PCR), metagenomics being approximately as sensitive as rtq-PCR.

There is also high variation in virulence, with strains covering the entire spectrum from avirulent to highly virulence. The underlying genetic determinants are far from being understood. Because the RNA polymerases of RNA viruses lack any proofreading activity, different genome variations called haplotypes occur during replication. A set of haplotypes is referred to as a viral half-species. Genetic variability may be a fitness advantage, facilitating a more efficient escape from the host immune response. To investigate the correlation of half-species composition and virulence in vivo, we analyzed next-generation sequencing data of CSFV isolates with varying virulence. Viral samples from pigs infected with the highly lethal isolates ""Koslov"" and ""Brescia"" showed higher half-species diversity and greater nucleotide variability compared to pig samples infected with low- and moderate-lethal isolates.",,"Topfer, A.;Hoper, D.;Blome, S.;Beer, M.;Beerenwinkel, N.;Ruggli, N.;Leifer, I.",2013.0,1930-03-01 00:00:00,,0

Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures, reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR with primers targeting the 5-UTR and Npro gene, followed by direct sequencing of the obtained purified PCR products for both genomic regions. Npro sequences provided the best genetic resolution and also gave higher statistical support for the phylogenetic classification of viruses.

The biological properties of these isolates were investigated in 4-week-old SPF chickens and chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures. The isolates neither caused death in vaccinated chickens nor produced CPE in cell cultures, indicating low pathogenicity. PCR products of 486 bp containing cleavage site sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) produced from isolates were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Sequence analysis of the HA region containing the cleavage site of the isolates showed a similar sequence motif (PARSSRG) but different flanking regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the inferred amino acid sequences revealed that the isolates were closely related to those previously isolated, indicating a common origin. Also, the amino acid sequences of the final isolates were very similar to those in Saudi Arabia, Germany, and Pakistan. With the exception of some Chinese isolates, the pathogenicity of Iranian isolates is assumed to be similar to that of other Eurasian isolates. It is possible that an increase in mortality in field conditions was due to co-infection of new isolates with bacteria such as mycoplasma, Escherichia coli and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, rather than the emergence of a pathogenic H9N2 subtype of the virus.",,"Toroghi, R.;Momayez, R.",2006.0,,,0

We analyzed all eight genome segments of two viruses isolated from chickens in January 2010 to understand their genetic association with other Indian H5N1 isolates and possible link between different outbreaks. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the viruses showed multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site, a marker of high virulence in chickens. The major concern was that the viruses showed amino acid substitution from serine to asparagine at position 31 of the M2 ion channel protein, suggesting the emergence of previously unreported amantadine-resistant mutants in HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in India. The amino acid lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein highlights the risk that viruses have to mammals. In phylogenetic trees, viruses are clustered across all genes in progeny of avian isolates from India (2008-2009) and bird and human isolates from Bangladesh (2007-2009).

2079,Initial genetic characterization of Peste des Petits Ruminants from Niger: on the advancing front of the Asian virus lineage.,"Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a serious transboundary infectious disease of small ruminant animals. The causative agent, PPR virus (PPRV), can be separated into four genetically distinct lineages using phylogenetic analysis. In recent years, PPRV's IV. lineage significantly expanded its geographic distribution from Asia to the Middle East and into Africa, where it was gradually replaced by other PPRV lineages. Lineages I and II are historically distributed in West Africa. Currently, lineage II appears to dominate the region, whereas lineage I's last recorded occurrence dates back to 1994. Recent studies reported the existence of lineage IV in Nigeria and suggested that this lineage expanded in West Africa. Despite reports of incidence of PPR in Nigeria's close neighbor Niger, PPRV has never been genetically characterized. In this study, pathological samples collected from sick goats in 2013 during a suspected PPR outbreak in southern Niger near the Nigerian border were compared with samples collected in an earlier study in Southwest Niger in October 2001. These strains were characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to determine their genetic ancestry. Our results, in 2001 I and II. lineages circulate together in southwestern Niger, and that the strain that caused the outbreak in 2013 was IV. ancestry and closely related to strains described in Nigeria. These results confirm the progression of lineage IV in West Africa. The PPRV lineage process and its effects on the epidemiology and control of disease in this region are unclear and should be the subject of further studies in this area.",,"Tounkara, K.;Bataille, A.;Adombi, C.

2080,Genetic and biological characterization of an avian-like H1N2 swine flu virus produced by reclassification of the avian-like H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes circulating in Denmark.,"Background: Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are the most common subtypes in pigs. A reclassified H1N2 swine flu virus (SIV) subtype emerged in 2003 and became widespread in Denmark. In this study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was genetically characterized by an experimental infection study and the infection dynamics were compared with a ""bird-like"" H1N1 virus. Methods Sequence analyzes of the H1N2 virus were performed. Two groups of pigs were vaccinated with reassortant H1N2 virus and a ""bird-like"" H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by vaccination with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were made. Nasal virus excretion and viral load in the lungs were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reclassified H1N2 virus contained a European ""bird-like"" H1 gene and a European ""pig-like"" N2 gene, thus being genetically different from, but similar to, most H1N2 viruses circulating in Europe. It was reported in Sweden and Italy in 2009/2010. Sequence analyzes of internal genes revealed that reclassification likely arose between circulating Danish ""bird-like"" H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies and increased acute phase protein levels after vaccinations. Pigs vaccinated with H1N2 exhibited nasal virus shedding for seven days, peaking at day 1 post-vaccination two days before and six times higher than H1N1-infected pigs. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 post-vaccination had a high viral load in all lung lobes. After the second vaccination, nasal virus excretion was minimal. There were no clinical signs other than high body temperature under the experimental conditions. Conclusions: The ""bird-like"" H1N2 subtype, established in the Danish pig population since at least 2003, is a reasortant between circulating pig ""bird-like"" H1N1 and H3N2. Danish H1N2 has a ""bird-like"" H1 and differs from many other H1N2 viruses reported in Europe and North America/Asia, which have H1 genes of human or ""classic-pig"" origin, respectively. However, the variant also appears to be circulating in countries such as Sweden and Italy. The infection dynamics of the reclassified ""bird-like"" H1N2 are similar to the former ""bird-like"" H1N1 subtype.

2081,Neuropathological research reveals underestimation of prevalence of neuroinfectious diseases in cattle in Switzerland,"Neuroinfectious diseases in farm animals pose a serious threat to animal health, but their prevalence is not well documented and the etiology of the disease is often unidentified. The aim of this study was to establish baseline data on the prevalence of neuroinfectious diseases in cattle in Switzerland by neuropathological research and to identify disease-associated pathogens. The survey was conducted over a 1-year period using a representative number of brainstem samples (n = 1816) from fallen cattle. Overall, 4% (n = 73) of animals had significant lesions, the most common types indicative of viral (n = 27) and bacterial (n = 31) etiologies. Follow-up diagnosis by immunohistochemistry, PCR protocols and next-generation sequencing identified infection with Listeria monocytogenes (n = 6), ovine herpesvirus 2 (n = 7), bovine astrovirus CH13 (n = 2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (n = 6) , bovine retrovirus CH15 (n = 2), pulpavirus 1 (n = 2) and porcine astroviruses (n = 2). A retrospective survey has shown that animal owners observe clinical manifestations of neurological disease in approximately one-third of cases with lesions, which is estimated to correspond to approximately 85 cases per year in the adult fallen cattle population in Switzerland. This estimate contrasts sharply with the number of cases reported to authorities and reveals a gap in disease surveillance. Systematic neuropathological examination and follow-up molecular testing of neurologically diseased cattle can significantly increase the effectiveness of disease detection to predict the prevalence of endemic diseases, identify new or re-emerging pathogens, and provide ""early warnings"" of disease outbreaks.",,"Truchet, L.;Walland, J.;Wuthrich, D.;Boujon, C.

NE was induced by the co-infection model previously described using Eimeria maxima and Clostridium perfringens. The RNA-Seq generated is over 38 million sequence reads for Marek's disease (MD) resistant line 6.3 and over 40 million reads for MD susceptible line 7.2. Alignment of these sequences with the Gallus gallus genome database revealed the expression of more than 29,900 NE-induced gene transcripts in these two lines, among which 7,841 genes were significantly upregulated and 2,919 genes were downregulated in 6.3 chicken lines and 6,043 genes were significantly upregulated. were downregulated and 2,764 genes were downregulated in NE-induced line 7.2 compared to their uninfected controls. Analysis of 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the gene ontology database revealed explanations for 246 biological processes, 215 molecular functions, and 81 cellular components. Among the 53 cytokines and 96 cytokine receptors, 15 cytokines and 29 cytokine receptors were highly expressed in line 6.3, while the expression of 15 cytokines and 15 cytokine receptors was higher in line 7.2 than in line 6.3 (fold change >= 2, p< 0.01). In a hierarchical cluster analysis of novel mRNAs, the novel mRNA transcriptome showed higher expression in line 6.3 than in line 7.2; this is consistent with the expression profile of immune-related target genes. In qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analysis, all examined genes showed similar responses to NE in both lines 6.3 and 7.2 (correlation coefficient R=0.85-0.89, p<0.01). This study is the first to describe NE-induced DEGs and novel transcriptomes using RNA-seq data from two inbred chicken lines showing different levels of NE sensitivity.

2086,There is nothing permanent except change. Emergence of new viral diseases,"The sudden emergence of seemingly new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and is a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a 'new' pathogen is not an isolated event, as evidenced, for example, by the frequent occurrence of new strains of influenza virus. Often new virus strains circulate in a susceptible population with older strains, but replacement of older strains has also been observed. In rare cases, new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or the agent bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the UK. The mechanisms of emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common occurrence. It is often unknown whether there is a true change in host range or whether the virus has adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently. This review attempts to summarize known facts about a wide variety of 'novel' mammalian viruses such as monkey, human and feline lentiviruses, feline coronaviruses, feline parvoviruses, carnivorous morbilliviruses, influenza A viruses. infectious spongiform encephalopathies.

2087,Molecular epidemiological studies on viruses of foot and mouth disease type O Taiwan from the 1997 epidemic,"Sequence diversity was evaluated for the complete VP1 gene directly amplified from 49 clinical samples during an explosive foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Taiwan. Type O Taiwan FMD viruses are genetically highly homogeneous as seen with the minute deviation of 0.2-0.9% occurring in the 20 variants. Viral variants O/HCP-0314/TW/97 and O/TCP-022/TW/97 dominated FMD outbreaks and were common in affected swine farming areas. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences around major neutralizable antigenic sites on the VP1 polypeptide revealed no significant antigenic variation. However, variant O/CHP-158/TW/97 had an alternative critical residue at position 43 at antigenic site 3, which could be due to selective pressure at the site. Two vaccine production strains (O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 and O1/Campos/Brazil/71) probably provide partial heterologous protection against O Taiwan viruses of pig. Taiwan variants of type O are clustered in the A1 subclade from the four major lineages in the phylogenetic tree. The O/Hong Kong/9/94 and O/1685/Moscow/Russia/95 viruses in the A2 subclade are closely related to the O Taiwan variants. The causative agent of the 1997 outbreak likely originated from a single common source of O-type FMD virus prevalent in neighboring areas. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BV",,"Tsai, C.

2089,Emergence of rabies associated with a syllabic enzootic formosan ferret badger in Taiwan and geographical separation of two phylogenetic rabies virus groups.,"Taiwan had been declared rabies-free in humans and pets for five years, until July 2013, when, surprisingly, three Formosan ferret badgers (FB) were diagnosed with rabies. Since then, various wild carnivores and other wildlife species have been found dead, neurologically ill or displaying aggressive behavior around the island. Animal bodies were examined for rabies by direct fluorescent antibody testing (FAT) to identify affected animal species, geographic areas, and environments. Viral genomes from the brains of selected rabid animals were sequenced for the phylogeny of rabies viruses (RABV). Out of a total of 1016 wild carnivores, 276/831 (33.2%) Formosan FBs were FAT positive, with occasional bite events in 1 dog and suspicious spread in 1 house mouse. All other animals tested were negative for rabies, including dogs, cats, bats, mice, rats, and squirrels. Rabies was associated with the badger and was limited to nine counties/cities in syllabic settings. 59 The phylogeny of nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes derived from Formosan FB-associated RABV, their distribution to western and eastern Taiwan provided by the Central Mountain Range and south-central rabies-affected regions by a river bisecting northern rabies and western Taiwan.

2090,An Evolutionarily Young Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) Endogenous Retrovirus Identified from Next-Gen Sequence Data,"Transcriptome analysis of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) tissues identified sequences similar to Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV). Based on these sequences, four proviral copies and 15 solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) of a newly identified endogenous retrovirus were characterized from the polar bear draft genome sequence. Brown bear (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus) closely related sequences were identified by PCR analysis, but were absent in non-Ursinae bear species. That's why the virus was named UrsusERV. Two distinct sets of LTRs were observed, including a recombinant ERV with one LTR belonging to each group, suggesting that genomic invasions by at least two UrsusERV variants have occurred recently. Age estimates based on transient LTR difference among ursids and preservation of integration sites suggest that the viral group is only a few million years old. The youngest provirus was polar bear-specific, had intact open reading frames (ORFs) and could potentially encode functional proteins. Phylogenetic analyzes of the UrsusERV consensus protein sequences indicate that it is part of a swine, gibbon and koala retrovirus lineage. The young age estimates and lineage specificity of the virus suggest that UrsusERV is a recent cross-species transmission from an unknown reservoir, placing the viral group among the youngest ERVs identified in mammals.",,"Tsangaras, K.;Mayer, J.;Alquezar-Planas, D.

2091,Identification of a new bat papillomavirus by metagenomics,"The discovery of new viruses in animals expands our knowledge of viral diversity and potentially emerging zoonoses. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology yields millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a comprehensive search of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we scanned 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattle (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11). monkeys (n = 20), using an HTS metagenomic approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with 60% nucleotide identity of L1 to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6) was identified in a sample from the Common Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii). . ). About 7.5 kb in length, with 45.8% G+C content and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the MscPV1 and CPV6 genomes, maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) were most closely related. The estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was about 60.2-91.9 million years ago and was inferred under strict hours using the L1 and E1 genes. Estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from the common deviation due to possible host drift. Since the nucleotide sequence of this virus shows only limited similarity to that of the respective animal PVs, the conventional PCR approach using consensus primers is unlikely to detect new virus in the sample. Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no obvious mucosal or skin lesions, while RaPV1 was detected in basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the new Dyombda-papillomavirus genus. Â© 2012 Tse et al.",,"Tse, H.;Tsang, A. K. L.;Tsoi, H. W.;Leung, A. S. P.;Ho, C. C.;Lau, S. K. P.;Woo, P. C. Y.;Yuen, K.

In this report, we describe the discovery and genomic characterization of partetraviruses in bovine and ovine samples from China.

2093,A novel activation mechanism of avian influenza virus H9N2 by Furin.,"Avian influenza virus H9N2 is common in waterfowl and has become endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. H9N2 influenza viruses have served as an internal gene store for other avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and the few cases of human infection by H9N2 influenza viruses have demonstrated their pandemic potential. Fortunately, an extensive surveillance program enables close monitoring of H9N2 influenza viruses worldwide and has produced a large repository of virus sequences and phylogenetic information. Despite the large number of sequences in different databases, little is known about specific virus isolates and their pathogenesis. Here we characterize a low pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Israel/810/2001 (H9N2) (Israel810), representative of influenza virus strains that cause severe morbidity and mortality in poultry farms. We show that, under certain conditions, Israel810 hemagglutinin (HA) can be activated by furin, a feature of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We show that Israel810 HA can divide in cells with high levels of furin expression, and that a mutation in HA1 that abolishes a glycosylation site allows Israel810 HA to gain universal cleavage in cell culture. Pseudoparticles produced from Israel810 HA or the glycosylation mutant efficiently transduce cells. In contrast, the addition of a polybasic cleavage site to Israel810 HA leads to pseudoviruses that are compromised for transduction. Our data demonstrate a mechanism for an H9N2 evolutionary pathway that may allow it to acquire virulence differently from H5 and H7 influenza viruses.

2094,"Similarities and differences between the E5 oncoproteins of bovine papillomaviruses type 1 and type 4: cytoskeleton, motility, and invasiveness in E5-transformed bovine and mouse cells.","Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are oncogenic viruses. In cattle, BPV-1/2 is associated with bladder cancer and BPV-4 with upper GI tract cancer. BPV E5 is a small hydrophobic protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). E5 is the main transforming protein of BPVs, which can induce cell turnover in cultured mouse fibroblasts and primary bovine cells in cooperation with E7. E5-induced cell transformation is accompanied by activation of several cellular protein kinases, including growth factor receptors, and alkalinization of endosomes and GA. We report that BPV E5 causes swelling and fragmentation of the GA and extensive vacuolization of the cytoplasm. We now show that E5 from both BPV-1 and BPV-4 disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in transformed bovine cells, and that these morphological and behavioral features are accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of the cellular phosphotyrosine kinase c-src. Both BPV-1 and BPV-4 E5 increase the motility of transformed mouse cells, but only BPV-1 E5 causes the transformed mouse cells to penetrate a matrigel matrix. BPV-1-transformed mouse cells, but not BPV-4-transduced mouse cells, have hyperphosphorylated c-src. Â© 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Tsirimonaki, E.;Ullah, R.;Marchetti, B.;Ashrafi, G.

2095,Dynamics of envelope evolution in pig-tailed macaques infected with class C SHIV during disease progression analyzed by ultra-deep pyrosequencing.,"Understanding the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope during disease progression can provide tremendous insights for vaccine development, and monkey-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection of the non-human primate provides an ideal platform for such studies. A newly developed C SHIV clade, SHIV-1157ipd3N4, capable of infecting Rhesus macaques, closely resembling primary HIV-1 in transmission and pathogenesis, was used to infect several pig-tailed macaques. One of the infected animals later progressed to AIDS, while one remained non-progressive. Viral envelope evolution in infected animals during disease progression was analyzed with a bioinformatics approach using ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Our results showed significant envelope variations that occur in the progressive animal after the onset of AIDS. These envelope variations affected the length of variable cycles and charges of different envelope regions. In addition, multiple mutations were involved in the CD4 and CCR5 binding sites, potentially affecting receptor binding affinity, viral fitness, and these can be selected in late stages of the disease. More importantly, these envelope mutations are not random, as these envelope mutations have been repeatedly observed in a rhesus macaque and a human infant infected with SHIV or HIV-1, respectively, carrying the parental envelope of the infectious molecular clone SHIV-1157ipd3N4. Also, similar mutations were observed in other studies on different types of envelopes, regardless of the host type. These recurrent mutations in different envelopes suggest that there may be a common evolutionary pattern and selection pathway for the HIV-1 envelope during disease progression.",,"Tso, F.

2097,Identification of a novel bovine enterovirus with highly divergent amino acid sequences in the capsid protein.,"Background: Bovine enterovirus (BEV) belongs to the Enterovirus E or F species, the Enterovirus genus, and the Picornaviridae family. Although numerous studies have identified BEVs in the feces of cattle with diarrhea, the pathogenicity of BEVs remains unclear. We previously reported the detection of new kobu-like virus in calf feces by metagenomic analysis. In this study, we identified a novel BEV in diarrheal stool collected for this study. Whole genome sequences were determined by deep sequencing in faeces. Secondary RNA structure analysis of the 5â€² untranslated region (UTR), phylogenetic tree structure and binary identity analysis were performed. Results: The whole genome sequences of BEV were genetically distant from other EVs and the VP1 coding region contained novel and unique amino acid sequences. We named this strain BEV AN12/Bos taurus/JPN/2014 (referred to as BEV-AN12). According to genome analysis, the genome length of this virus is 7414 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail, and its genome consists of 5"" UTR, open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein, and 3"" UTR. The results of the secondary RNA structure analysis showed that at 5â€²UTR, BEV-AN12 has an additional cloverleaf structure and small stem loop structure similar to other BEVs. In binary identity analysis, the BEV-AN12 polyprotein showed high amino acid (aa) identities to Enterovirus F in the P2 and P3 regions (aa identity -82.4%). Therefore, BEV-AN12 is closely related to Enterovirus F. However, aa sequences in capsid protein regions, particularly the VP1 coding region, showed significantly lower aa identity to other viruses in the Enterovirus genus (VP1 aa identity -58.6%). In addition, although BEV-AN12 clustered with Enterovirus F in trees based on sequences in the P2 and P3 genome region, it branched separately from Enterovirus E and F in phylogenetic trees based on aa sequences of P1 and VP1. Results: We identified new BEV with highly different aa sequences in the VP1 coding region in Japan.

Two neutralization patterns were observed against Cowden and Shintoku strains when hyperimmune or recovery phase antisera against three uncultivated pig group C rotavirus and one human group C rotavirus were used in one-way cross-neutralization tests. Two antiserums against swine group C rotavirus and human group C rotavirus neutralized the Cowden strain at high titers but did not neutralize the Shintoku strain, suggesting that these three strains were serotypically related to the Cowden strain. Antiserum remaining to a porcine group C rotavirus (HF strain) reacted with Cowden and Shintoku group C rotaviruses in cell culture immunofluorescence tests, but did not neutralize either virus in one-way cross-neutralization, suggesting that the HF strain belonged to a third group. serotype. However, confirmation of these findings requires additional analysis with two-way cross-neutralization. Our findings support the existence of at least two distinct group C rotavirus serotypes, and possibly a third, between animals and humans. The observed serotypic similarity between the Cowden strain and a human group C rotavirus suggests that the cultivable Cowden strain and serum antiserum against this virus may provide important reagents for the diagnosis of group C rotaviruses in humans.",,"Tsunemitsu, H.;Jiang, B.;Yamashita, Y.;Oseto, M.;Ushijima, H.;Saif, L.

Cross-reactions were observed between the following strains: (a) Equi/1/Prag/1/56, Fowl plague (Netherlands strain) and Turkey/England/1/63 (Langham strain); (b) Equi/2/Miami/1/63, Quail/Italy/1117/65, Pheasant/Italy/647/66, Duck/England/1/62 and Turkey/Canada/1/63; (c) A2/Singapore/1/57 and Turkey/Massachussets/65; (d) Pig/S15/30 and Chicken/Scotland/1/59. Results of HI tests with post-infection sera showed precisely narrower specificity than those of HI with hyperimmune serum or strain-specific CF. Clearly, the antigenic subtypes of influenza A viruses have no sharp boundaries, and studies of a wider range of strains are likely to reveal a continuous spectrum of antigenic variation for the entire group. The authors suggest that in practice it may be necessary to use host specificity rather than antigenic specificity as the main criterion for classifying influenza A viruses.",,"Tumova, B.;Pereira, H.

To identify the gastrointestinal microbial diversity of cats, fecal samples from cats were characterized using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. However, data on the overall microbial composition and functions are lacking. The current descriptive study evaluated both phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of the feline intestinal microbiota using GS Junior titanium shotgun pyrosequencing. A total of 152,494 pyrosequencing reads (5405 combined contigs) were generated and classified according to both phylogenetic and metabolic profiles of the feline intestinal microbiota. The Bacteroides/Chlorobi group was the most dominant bacterial phylum containing ~. 68% of the total classified diversity, followed by Firmicutes (~.13%) and Proteobacteria (~6%). Archaea, fungi and viruses made up small communities of general microbial diversity. Interestingly, this study also identified a number of potential enteric zoonotic pathogens (0.02-1.25%) and antimicrobial resistance-related genes (0.02-0.7%) in cat fecal materials. Based on clustering among nine gastrointestinal metagenomes from five different monogastric hosts (dog, human, mouse, cat, and chicken), the cat metagenome was closely clustered with chicken at both the phylogenetic and metabolic levels (>80%).

The phylogenetic tree topology obtained using thirteen whole genome sequences of JEV was reconstructed with the envelope, NS1, NS3 and NS5 genes, revealing wide variation between the two Indian strains included. A more comprehensive analysis of JEV evolution using the sequence of 107 envelopes available for isolates from different geographic locations worldwide revealed five different JEV genotypes that exhibited a minimum nucleotide variation of 7% with high bootstrapping support values. The tree also revealed general clustering of strains and multiple introductions of JEV into the Indian subcontinent based on geographic location. Unnamed nucleotide divergence rates of the envelope gene estimated that ancestry common to all JEV genotypes emerged within the last three hundred years.",,"Uchil, P.

2106,Studies on Cotia virus; an unclassified smallpox virus,"This article is a report of studies on Cotia virus; this was first isolated in Brazil in 1965 and was later shown to be a smallpox disease. Cotia virus was grown in a wide variety of cell cultures and on chick chorio-allantois (CAM). Its growth characteristics are similar to those of other pox viruses. Microscopy showed that virus factories or type B inclusions arose before the infectious strain virus was proven. Type A inclusions appeared later, after the development of the strain virus; these were shown to differ from type A inclusions of cowpox and other smallpox viruses by electron microscopy, and they were termed Cotia bodies. Immunofluorescent staining also showed ring structures that appeared before the development of Cotia bodies. Growth of Cotia virus in human embryo lung (HEL) cells was sensitive to DNA and protein synthesis inhibitors but resistant to the concentration of rifampicin that inhibited vaccine virus. The sharing of antigens between Cotia virus and vaccinia virus was demonstrated by gel precipitation tests and immunofluorescent staining. There was no cross-neutralization between Cotia virus and vaccine virus, nor did the anti-Cotia sera neutralize representatives of other smallpox virus groups.",,"Ueda, Y.;Dumbell, K.

2107,Use of DOP-PCR for non-specific virus detection,"Detection and identification of pathogens in any sample without any knowledge of the pathogen requires a combination of sample purification and generic signal amplification. Our universal virus detection assay combines virus capsid purification with a general polymerase chain reaction (PCR) optimized for virus-sized genomes. As a general strategy, biochemical and physical purification by targeted digestion of contaminating host nucleic acids precedes nucleic acid extraction. RNA is transcribed into cDNA; cDNA and DNA are then used as templates for degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR (DOP-PCR). This PCR uses a pool of related but different primers that combine degenerate and specific annealing conditions. PCR products can be identified by cloning and sequencing, microarray or high-throughput sequencing. We detected enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses by DOP-PCR in cell culture as well as in clinical samples. The test is capable of detecting single- and double-stranded genomes, circular genomes, segmented genomes, and linear genomes. Both large virus genomes such as herpes virus and very small virus genomes (eg, circovirus) can be precisely detected in the same assay. The DOP-PCR test can be used to identify viruses directly from biological samples or cell culture. A powerful feature of DOP-PCR is its ability to amplify viral sequences without prior knowledge of these sequences, increasing the probability of finding mutated or new viruses. Combined with high-throughput sequencing, DOP-PCR is a very sensitive tool that could potentially be used for the characterization of a given sample. ©PDA, Inc. 2011.",,"Uhlenhaut, C.;McClenahan, S.;Krause, P.

2108,"Complete nucleotide sequence of IT-227/82, an avian paramyxovirus type-1 pigeon strain (Columba livia)","This article describes the complete genome sequence of IT-227/82, a strain of pigeon avian paramyxovirus type-1 (PPMV-1). IT-227/82 is an antigenic variant of chicken Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The genome is 15,192 nucleotides (nt) long, similar to the previously published NDV strain ZJ1. However, it is six nt longer than the genomes of the NDV strains LaSota/46 and Beaudette C. The six nt insertion was located in the 5'² noncoding region of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. The presence of this six-nt insert showed no correlation with the virulence or reservoir of the NDV strains sequenced thus far. Genome length of 15,186 or 15,192 nt can be attributed to ""old"" (I, II, III and IV) and ""new"" (V, VI, VII and VIII) NDV genotypes, respectively. Comparison of open reading frames showed that PPMV-1 strain IT-227/82 encodes the longest W protein (227 amino acids). The length of the W protein varied considerably even within genotypes and therefore cannot be considered a phylogenetic trait. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of strain IT-227/82 consists of 571 amino acids, similar to genotype IV, V and VII NDV strains, while genotype I and II strains have longer HN proteins of 616 and 577 amino acids, respectively. The length of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein has phylogenetic significance. Â© Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",,"UjvÃ¡ri, D.",2006.0,,10.1007/s11262-005-5845-0,0
2109,Identification and subgrouping of pigeon-type Newcastle disease virus strains by restriction enzyme cleavage site analysis.,"host variant of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV, Avulavirus genus, Paramyxoviridae family) is responsible for an autonomous disease in pigeons. It originated in the Mediterranean region in the late 1970s. Despite the great genetic diversity, the vast majority of strains belong to a monophyletic group (subline VIb) within genotype VI of NDV strains native to the region at the time. To date, only one monoclonal antibody assay is available for the specific identification of pigeon-type strains. A specific genetic assay suitable for the identification of pigeon isolates is described. Cleavage site analysis of a 1349 bp amplicon of the fusion protein gene was performed using the restriction enzymes (RE) HinfI, BstOI and Rsal. RE analysis of more than 100 strains isolated from 16 countries between 1978 and 2002 revealed nine RE-patterns that are progressive region variants of the parental (group VI) genotype. Despite significant site variations, current pigeon viruses lacked a BstOI cleavage site at nucleotide 1601 shared by other chicken-derived NDV strains. RE analysis is a simple and reliable method for both identification and subgrouping of pigeon-type viruses.

2110,Genetic characterization of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) viruses: confirmation of the presence of BVD genotype 2 in Africa,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has emerged as one of the economically important pathogens in cattle populations with a worldwide distribution and causing a range of disease syndromes. Two genotypes, BVDV 1 and 2, exist and are distinguished on the basis of the sequence of the 5â€² noncoding region (5' NCR) using real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is more sensitive, specific, and less time-consuming than conventional PCR, and has less risk of cross-contamination of samples. Limited information is available on the genetic subtypes of BVDV in South Africa. The aim of this study was to identify the BVDV genotypes currently circulating in South African fattened areas. A total of 279 specimens (219 tissue specimens, 59 trans-tracheal aspirate and 1 blood specimen) were collected from dead and live cattle with lesions or clinical signs consistent with BVDV infection. Homogenates collected from the same animals were prepared and total RNA was extracted. A screening test was performed on the pooled samples and positive pools were investigated individually. A Cador BVDV Type 1/2 RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for real-time PCR assay on a LightCyclerÂ® V2. 0 real-time PCR machines (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Results were read at 530 and 640 nm for BVDV 1 and 2, respectively. Bovine viral diarrhea virus was detected in a total of 103 samples, including 91 tissue samples, 1 blood sample, and 11 trans-tracheal aspirates. Eighty-five (82.5%) of the strains were genotype 1 and 18 (17.5%) were genotype 2. When sequencing data were compared, genotypes 1 and 2 of the field strains did not cluster with the vaccine strains currently used in the cultivation areas. in South Africa. This study established the presence of BVDV genotype 2 in cattle from South Africa based on the high sequence similarity between the genotype 2 field strains and the 890 strain from North America. The presence of genotype 2 viruses belonging to phylogenetically distinct clusters and coexisting in fattening areas is consistent with the probability of multiple virus introductions. These results represent the first documented evidence for the presence of BVDV genotype 2 in African cattle. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Ularamu, H. G.;Sibeko, K. P.;Bosman, A. B.;Venter, E.

Different protocols for viral enrichment, library preparation and sequencing have become increasingly accessible and less costly. However, no studies to date have focused on optimizing viral sample preparation for commercial deep sequencing. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate an In-House enzymatic protocol for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) synthesis and also to compare the use of a commercially available kit protocol (Nextera XT, Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). ) and its combination (Illumina Miseq) with a library quantification kit (Kapa, Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) for deep sequencing. Two RNA viruses (canine distemper virus and dengue virus) and one ssDNA virus (swine circovirus type 2) were tested with optimized protocols. The tested method for dsDNA synthesis has shown satisfactory results and can be used in vitro especially when enzymes are already available. Library preparation combining commercial kits (Nextera XT and Kapa) provided greater read and genome coverage, possibly due to the lack of small fragment recovery in the normalization step of Nextera XT.

2112,Characterization of the whole genome sequence of genotypes VI and VII velogenic Newcastle disease virus from Japan,"The whole genome sequences of three Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains isolated from commercial layer flocks vaccinated over a thirty-year period in Japan were characterized. All strains had genome lengths of 15,192 nucleotides consisting of six genes in the order 3â€²-NP-P/V/WMF-HN-L-5â€². The overall genomic characteristics of the Japanese field strains were consistent with previously characterized class II NDV, except those belonging to early genotypes (genotypes I-IV), which lacked six nucleotide insertions at nucleoprotein (NP) positions 1,648-1,653. gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Japanese strains can be classified into genotypes VIc and VIIe using the complete genome sequence and the full coding sequence of the fusion (F) gene according to the combined NDV classification system. Characterization of functional domains and neutralizing epitopes of Japanese field strains F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins revealed a total of 31 amino acid substitutions compared with vaccine strains Ishii and B1, widely used in Japan. Approximately two to three-fold reductions in VN titers, although virus neutralization (VN) testing has shown that poor herd immunity due to vaccine failure or partial and non-uniform immunization may be the main factors involved in the infectious mechanism of infection of Japanese field strains. Field NDV strains with a point mutation (E347K or E347G) in the linear epitope of the HN protein were observed in comparison with vaccine strain B1 and field strain 2440/69 without the point mutation. This study may be a useful reference as a genetic map for future research in characterizing future ND outbreaks in vaccinated chickens and developing molecular diagnostic tools to prevent future ND outbreaks in vaccine designs, reverse genetic systems, and vaccinated poultry flocks.

2113,Molecular epidemiology of Newcastle disease virus isolated from vaccinated commercial poultry farms in non-outbreak regions of Japan.,"Background: Newcastle Disease (ND) is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease in poultry. Currently, limited molecular epidemiological data are available on the causes of ND outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry farms. Knowing the genomic characteristics of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which infects commercial poultry operations despite vaccination, can provide important information about the infection dynamics of these viruses. In addition, studies on subgenotype level molecular analyzes and association of Japanese NDVs with other isolates from around the world are lacking. Therefore, in this study, a molecular epidemiological study was conducted to characterize nine NDVs isolated from commercial poultry flocks vaccinated in five different Provinces in non-epidemic regions of Japan between 1969 and 2002. Methods. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed to characterize the complete fusion (F)-protein gene, the 3-prime end of the nucleoprotein (NP)-gene, and the 5-prime end of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L)-gene. Sequence data were compared with 180 NDV strains from GenBank representing different NDV genotypes and subgenotypes from different regions of the world at different time periods. The deduced amino acids were analyzed for homologies, recombination and mutation. Recombination events were predicted using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 3.44. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine evolutionary relationships between strains. Results: Mean time to death (MDT: 48-56 hours), Intracerebral Pathogenicity Index (ICPI: 1.7-1.9) and deduced amino acid sequences of the F0 proteolytic cleavage site (Â§ssupÂ§112Â§esupÂ§RRQKRÂ§ssupÂ§116Â§ esupÂ§ ), revealed that all nine domain isolates were velogenic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates can be classified into two genetic lineages and three sublines VIa (lineage 4a), VId (lineage 4d) and VIId (lineage 5d) genotypes. No recombination events were observed, but a point mutation was identified in one of the neutralizing epitopes of the F-protein in field isolates from Japan. Results: All field isolates from commercial poultry vaccinated in non-outbreak areas of Japan were part of much larger outbreaks in provinces and regions and in some cases on continents. Overall, four ND panzootics occurred in Japan, and these outbreaks were mostly characterized by co-circulation of genetically distinct virus strains due to the involvement of infected wild birds. The point mutation detected in field isolates from Japan may be due to evasion of vaccine pressure. Identification of such mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis to understand the dynamics of NDV infection in vaccinated chickens.

2114,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of newcastle disease virus isolated from clinical cases of Newcastle disease in commercial egg farms in the Philippines.,"Newcastle Disease (ND) is an economically devastating disease in poultry. Currently, limited data on the molecular characteristics of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are available from the Philippines. Clinical and molecular characterizations were performed on five clinical ND cases in inoculated commercial egg farms from four provinces in the Philippines, namely Bulacan, Pampanga, Zamboanga del Sur, and Davao Del Sur. Clinical signs observed in affected flocks are conjunctivitis, panting, tracheal wheezing, facial swelling, lethargy, greenish diarrhea, torticollis, and paralysis. Disease onset ranged from 21 to 124 days, and mortality rates were 15 to 61%. The gross morphological lesions identified were the presence of serous exudates in the infraorbital sinuses, hemorrhagic trachea, inflamed spleen, liver and kidneys, and petechial hemorrhages in the proventriculus and cecal tonsils. Nucleotide sequencing showed that all site strains, models 112RRRKRz.ast;F117 and 112RRQKRz.ast;F117, were velogenic with the FO proteolytic cleavage site. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all field NDV strains belonged to class II genotype VII, subgenotypes Vila, Vllh and Vili. Evolutionary divergence showed that field NDV strains were closely related (up to 99% similarity) to newly identified subgenotypes of virulent NDVs currently emerging in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.",,"Umali, D.

2115,Screening human cell lines for viral infections by applying RNA-Seq data analysis,"Although viruses can have an effect on cell physiology and bioactive substances produced by cell cultures can pose a biohazard for laboratory safety and security, monitoring of viral infections of cell cultures is largely neglected. PCR, immunoassays, and enzyme activity tests represent common methods for detecting virus infections. Applying the Taxonomer bioinformatics tool developed by IDbyDNA, we scanned more than 300 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia RNA sequences and 60 whole exome sequenced human cell line datasets for specific viral sequences and general viral nucleotide and protein sequence evaluation. The results were compared with our previous findings from virus-specific PCR analyses. Results from both the direct alignment method and the Taxonomer alignment method revealed complete agreement with the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus strains. The taxonomer also revealed a bovine polyomavirus infection in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, most likely introduced by contaminated fetal bovine serum. RNA-Seq datasets were more sensitive for virus detection, but a significant proportion of cell lines revealed a low number of virus-specific alignments attributable to low-level nucleotide contamination during the RNA preparation or sequencing procedure. Poor quality reads leading to taxonomer false positive results can be eliminated by trimming the sequence data prior to analysis. Another important result is that no viruses were detected in cell cultures, which were never shown to occur. The results prove that currently applied cell cultures testing is sufficient for detection of contamination and risk assessment of cell cultures. The results highlight that next-generation sequencing is an effective tool to determine the viral infection status of human cells.",,"Uphoff, C. C.;Pommerenke, C.;Denkmann, S. A.;Drexler, H.

2116,cattle transient fever,"Transient fever remains a viral disease of considerable importance for many countries, including Australia. The virus has only been partially characterized and still awaits final classification. Although the BEF virus was originally thought to contain 6 structural proteins, there is increasing evidence that it contains 5 proteins specific to Rhabdoviridae. Although BEF is thought to be transmitted by arthropods, the vector has not yet been identified, but from the distribution of BEF it is clear that more than one vector is capable of transmitting the disease. Despite rigorous investigation of the clinical manifestations and pathology of transient fever, little progress has been made in the pathogenesis of the disease. This is partly due to the difficulty of spreading the BEF virus in vitro and the failure to identify the replication site. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that BEF is immunopathological in nature and that the clinical expression of the disease is affected by the release of one or more mediators of inflammation. The disease is characterized by a series of haematological and biochemical changes, and early and long-term treatment with phenylbutazone can reverse many of these changes. Intravenous administration of calcium can now be considered a justified addition to the treatment regimen in combination with long-term phenylbutazone therapy. Currently available vaccines are prepared from live attenuated or killed virus and may be less than reliable. There seems to be a need for a reliable, inexpensive, cold chain-free alternative vaccine.",,"Uren, M. F.",1989.0,,,0

To resolve the background, contigs were de novo assembled from unmapped RNAseq reads and aligned to bovine genome assemblies and multi-species NCBI databases. The absence of the actual virus sequence refuted the hypothesis that a live virus was causative for the unexplained immune response. Alignment data also showed incomplete bovine reference genome assemblies. In addition, we found that several parasite and virus genome reference assemblies at NCBI were contaminated with bovine DNA, confirming recombination of bovine DNA into BVD virus strains.

No cross-reactivity was detected between the competing EIA and the BuVs, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent different serotypes. We also analyzed BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and for the first time in one nasal swab (0.1%).

2121,S1 gene-based phylogeny of infectious bronchitis virus: an attempt to harmonize virus classification,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of a highly contagious disease that causes serious economic losses to the global poultry industry. The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity between nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group assignments that are inconsistent with the phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Here, we propose a simple and reproducible phylogeny-based classification system combined with a clear and logical lineage terminology for assignment of IBV strains. We determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV using the full nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene, which allowed us to identify 6 genotypes, which together included 32 different viral lineages and a number of interlinear recombinants. Due to the wide ratio variation among IBVs, we propose that the inference of phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an internationally accepted viral terminology is crucial for future studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and new S1 sequences should become available as the classification scheme presented here can be updated and revised.",,"Valastro, V.;Holmes, E.

Although seropositive animals were found in all herds, the virus was isolated from animals in only five of the herds. After 4 to 11 months, all animals older than 6 months in three herds were resampled. Currently, 51-83% of them had neutralizing antibodies. The prevalence of persistently infected (PI) animals in two of the flocks was 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The third pack had probably destroyed all the PI animals. Fourteen virus isolates were obtained. The 5â€² untranslated regions (5â€²UTR) were amplified by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analyzes classified them as a group of Border disease viruses (BDV) that diverged from BDV-1 but showed a relatively low bootstrap value. Three of the 14 isolates were in the same subgroup as previously characterized Spanish isolates from the Basque Country assigned to the BDV-C subgroup. Additionally, they were in the group with the chamois isolate currently allocated in the BDV-4 group. Due to the close association with the mountain chamois isolate, these isolates were tentatively reintroduced into a BDV-4a subgroup. The remaining isolates formed a new subgroup that was related but not in the same cluster as the chamois isolate and was therefore tentatively assigned to a new BDV-4b subgroup.

2124,Anaplasma marginal superinfection attributable to pathogen strains with different genomic histories,"Strain superinfection occurs when a second strain of pathogen infects a host already infected with a primary strain. The selective pressures that drive strain differentiation that underlie superinfection and allow a new strain to enter a host population are critical knowledge gaps regarding changes in infectious disease epidemiology. In endemic areas with a high prevalence of infection, large population immunity develops against Anaplasma marginale, an antigenically highly variable rickettsial pathogen, creating strong selective pressure for superinfection and emergence of strains that differ in their Msp2 variant repertoire. Strains can arise either by duplication and allelic divergence of the msp2 locus on an existing genomic background or by introducing a strain with a different msp2 allelic repertoire on a different genomic background. To answer this question, we developed a multilocus typing assay based on high-throughput sequencing of non-msp2 target loci to discriminate between strains with different genomic histories. The level of technical error was defined statistically based on the percentage of perfect sequence matches of clones of each target locus and validated using experimental single strains and strain pairs. Testing of A. marginale-positive specimens from tropical regions where A. marginale infection is endemic identified individual infections containing unique alleles for all five targeted loci. The data revealed a highly significant difference in the number of strains per animal in the tropics compared to infections in temperate regions, strongly supporting the hypothesis that transmission of genomically distinct A. marginale strains predominates in high prevalence endemic areas.",,"Vallejo Esquerra, E.;Herndon, D.

2125,What's in the tension? Viral metagenomics identifies genetic diversity and contaminating circoviruses in laboratory isolates of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1,"We used next-generation sequencing on randomly amplified viral nucleic acids to sequence the genome of 11 isolates of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) from Belgium (period 1998-2011). The PPMV-1 deep sequence data allowed the identification of sequence variability in multiple isolates of PPMV-1, including a STOP codon in the Matrix gene found in 15% of the viral population of one isolate. In particular, mutations previously associated with pathogenicity in chickens were identified as minor sequence variants in a parent laboratory strain. A phylogenetic analysis of the consensus PPMV-1 genome sequences was performed. In addition to providing nearly complete paramyxovirus genome sequences, our sequence-independent approach identified the presence of pigeon circovirus (PiCV) sequences in four of these viral stocks. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis specific for PMV-1 and PiCV showed that these contaminations were present in seven viral stocks of allantoic fluids and were sometimes detected in stocks passed from embryonated chicken eggs. Phylogenetic analysis of the PiCV consensus genome sequences showed a PiCV circulation encompassing the full genetic diversity of known PiCV. This work demonstrates the value of new sequence-independent technologies for accessing sequence information for control of reference virus stocks and other biological materials. Co-infected viruses or sequence variants from the original sample may remain in stock without being identified by routine virus-specific diagnostic tools. The precise role of PiCV in pigeon disease – particularly Newcastle disease – and its potential interaction with PPMV-1 diagnosis remain to be explored. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Van Borm, S.;Rosseel, T.;Steensels, M.;Van den Berg, T.;Lambrecht, B.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2012.11.017,0

This sequence shares only 36% amino acid sequence identity with its closest homologue, arivirus 1 (an unclassified member of the Picornavirales order), and shares the diccistronic genome arrangement. The new virus was therefore tentatively named ""black bird arylivirus"" (bee-like virus). The nearly complete genome sequence consists of at least 9,228Â nt and contains two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the nonstructural polyprotein (2235 amino acids) and the structural polyprotein (769 amino acids). Two ORF1-specific TaqMan RT-qPCR assays confirmed the presence of high levels of this novel virus in the original sample.

The PsPV-1 genome contains 7879 nt and presents unusual features. An E7 does not contain an E8 and a bona fide E5 open reading frame (ORF) and has a large E6 ORF. The PsPV-1 L1 ORF showed the highest percentage of nucleotide identity (54-55%) with human papillomavirus type 5, bovine papillomavirus type 3 (BPV-3) and Tursiops truncatus papillomavirus type 2 (TtPV-2). This warrants the classification of PsPV-1 as the prototype of the genus Omicronpapillomavirus. PsPV-1 clustered with TtPV-2 in the E6 and E1 E2 phylogenetic trees and with TtPV-2 and BPV-3 in the L2L1 tree.

HEV genotype 3 (Gt3) infections are endemic in pigs from Western Europe and North and South America and cause zoonotic infections in humans. Various serological tests were initially developed based on HEV genotype 1 (Gt1) antigens to detect HEV antibodies in pigs. To develop a sensitive HEV Gt3 ELISA, a recombinant baculovirus expression product of HEV Gt3 open reading frame-2 was produced and plated on polystyrene ELISA plates. After incubation of pig serum, HEV antibodies bound with anti-swine anti-IgG and anti-IgM conjugates were detected. Sets of serum from pigs experimentally infected with HEV Gt3 were used for the primary estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. 1100 batches of pig serum were used to further validate the test and adjust the threshold. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV Gt3 assay and two other serological tests based on HEV Gt1 antigens. As the gold standard for HEV antibody testing did not exist, further validation and a precise cut-off adjustment of the HEV Gt3 testing developed using a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem was performed. The developed and validated HEV antibody assay demonstrated effective detection of HEV-specific antibodies. This assay may contribute to better detection of HEV antibodies and provide more reliable estimates of HEV Gt3 prevalence in pigs in different regions.",,"van der Poel, W. H.

It reduces the amount of reagents required and allows antigenic classification of many isolates simultaneously. To determine the accuracy and sensitivity of this micro-NI assay, 110 influenza A viruses representing all subtypes based on nine known neuraminidases (NAs) were classified with both micro-NI and macro-NI tests in two separate laboratories. NAs were accurately identified by micro-NI assay. Mixtures of viruses were detected in both assays, although macro-NI was clearly more sensitive. The micro-NI assay is also suitable for testing serum for the presence of antibodies against NAs.

2132,"Complete nucleotide sequence of novel simian T-lymphotropic virus, STLV-PH969 from a hamadryas baboon, and unusual features of long terminal repeat","With STLV-PH969 as the prototype, a third primate T-lymphotropic virus strain, PTLV-L, was recently isolated from an African baboon (Papio hamadryas). The classification of this virus is based on partial sequence analysis of cDNA from a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes homologous to all human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) related viruses and their corresponding mRNAs, including the appropriate splicing, were identified. An additional non-homologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region is accessible for translation via alternative splicing. The rank comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistant with HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. Across all coding regions, similarity tends to be lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, the lowest similarity in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region was found between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2. The U3-R and R-U5 boundaries of the STLV-PH969 LTR were determined experimentally at nucleotides 268 and 52.4, respectively. This 695-bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the LTRs of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, but its overall organization is similar to that found in the HTLV-bovine leukemia virus genus. Sequence similarity and secondary structure prediction with the HTLV-1 Rex-responsive element (RexRE) core in the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) region suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21-bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and BLV. In the STLV-PH969 LTR, only two direct repeats were found that were similar to these Tax sensitive items; this may suggest differences in the Tax-mediated handling of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions to suggest a replication cycle comparable to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.",,"Van Marianne, B.;Goubau, P.;Rousseau, R.;Desmyter, J.;Vandamme, A.

2133,Genetic heterogeneity in foot-and-mouth disease virus Leader and 3C proteinases,"Leader and 3C proteinases of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) are responsible for nearly all proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein precursor. Investigating the genetic heterogeneity of the regions encoding these proteins from isolates of the six FMDV serotypes revealed that 3C proteinase was more conserved than the Leader proteinase. Maximum likelihood analysis showed similar phylogenetic groupings for the nonstructural protein coding regions of both Leader and 3C. These groupings differed from the structural VP1 protein coding region, which was grouped by serotype as previously shown. Two distinct segments were evident for both the Leader and 3C coding regions: one consisted of SAT (South African Territories) isolates from eastern Africa, as well as serotypes A, O, and C. The other branch consisted of SAT isolates from South Africa. Only one virus isolate from a Ugandan buffalo did not fit this phylogenetic model. This SAT 1 virus was grouped with types A, O, and C in the Leader analysis, but with southern African SAT types in the 3C analysis, implying intertype recombination. Leading proteinases of South African SAT-type isolates differed from those found in European-type isolates, particularly in the self-functioning region. A three-dimensional structure was modeled for the Leader proteinase of ZIM/7/83/2, one of the SAT type viruses, and compared with the previously described crystal structure of O1Kaufbeuren Leader proteinase. Despite the observed sequence variation between the two molecules, the active sites of the two leaders were found to overlap closely. Comparison of 3C proteinase P1 cleavage sites indicated that FMDV 3C proteinase may have a broader substrate specificity, as observed in hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase.

Amino acids from all eight segments were combined, aligned and used for phylogenetic analyses. In addition, the genes of the polymerase complex (PB1, PB2 and PA) were analyzed separately. All our results showed that the Brevig-Mission/1918 strain was in a basal position relative to the rest of the clan containing human H1N1s, and was consistent with a reclassification hypothesis for the origin of the 1918 virus. Our genome phylogeny also indicates a sibling relationship with the ""classical"" pig H1N1 lineage. Individual PB1, PB2, and PA phylogenies were consistent with reclassification/recombination hypotheses for these genes.

2135,An ecological and conservationist perspective on developments in applied virology of zoonoses.,"The purpose of this manuscript is to explain how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation. We review the latest developments in virology and provide examples of how it informs experimental research in both field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of necessary breakthroughs and ways to bridge the communication gaps between the field and the laboratory. To support this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table listing definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in reservoir hosts is highlighted as a tool both to assess risk factors for spread and to test hypotheses regarding treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for intelligent surveillance, viral discovery efforts, and predictive modelling. As the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, a shift to a predictive approach is necessary in today's globalized society, as identification once it occurs is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow early detection of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs to human or animal populations and cause serious public health or conservation problems.

2136,Comparative genome sequencing identifies a prophage-associated genomic candidate associated with host adaptation of Lawsonia intracellularis infections.,"Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular bacterium and is the causative agent of proliferative enteropathy (PE). The disease is endemic in pigs, occurs in horses, and has been reported in a variety of other animal species, including non-human primates. By comparing the whole genome sequences of a homologous porcine isolate of L. intracellularis grown in vitro for 10 and 60 passages, we identified an 18 kb prophage-associated genomic island at passage 10 (pathogenic variant) and disappeared at passage 60 (pathogenic variant). . -pathogenic variant). This chromosomal island contains 15 genes downstream of the prophage DLP12 integrase gene. The prevalence of this genetic element was evaluated in 12 other L. intracellularis isolates and 53 infected animals and was found to be conserved in all pig isolates reared up to 20 passages and lost in isolates reared for more than 40 passages. In addition, prophage zones were also present in 26 stool samples from pigs clinically affected by both acute and chronic forms of the disease. However, the equine L. intracellularis isolates evaluated did not harbor this genomic candidate, regardless of in vitro passage. In addition, fecal samples from 21 clinically affected horses and four wild rabbits stranded on horse farms experiencing PE outbreaks did not show this prophage-associated candidate. Although the presence of this prophage-associated island is not required for a virulent L. intracellularis phenotype, this genetic element was specific to the porcine isolate and potentially contributed to the ecological specialization of this organism for the porcine host.",,"Vannucci, F.

2137,Sequence-based taxonomic framework for the classification of uncultured single-stranded DNA viruses of the Genomoviridae family.,"With the advent of metagenomic approaches, a wide variety of known and unknown viruses have been identified in various environmental, plant and animal samples. One such common group of viruses is the recently established Genomoviridae family, which includes viruses with small (similar to 2-2.4 kb), circular ssDNA genomes, rolling circle replication initiation proteins (Rep), and unique capsid proteins. Here, we propose an array-based taxonomic framework for the classification of 121 novel virus genomes within this family. Genomoviruses are similar to 47% sequence diversity, which is very similar to that within the well-established and extensively studied family Geminiviridae (46% diversity). Based on our analysis, we establish a 78% genome-wide binary identity as the species restriction threshold. We also establish nine genera within the family Genomoviridae, using a Rep sequence phylogeny-based analysis combined with existing knowledge of the classification of geminiviruses. These are Gemycircularvirus (n=73), Gemyduguivirus (n=1), Gemygorvirus (n=9), Gemykibivirus (n=29), Gemykolovirus (n=3), Gemykrogvirus (n=3), Gemykroznavirus (n=1) , Gemytondvirus (n = 1), Gemyvongvirus (n = 1).

Although smacoviruses are common in fecal matter of various vertebrates, including humans, none of these viruses have been cultured so far. Smacoviruses are similar to 45% genome-wide sequence diversity, very similar to that found in other families of circular Rep-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses, including members of the Geminiviridae (46% diversity) and Genomoviridae families. 47% diversity). Here, we announce the creation of a new family of Smacoviridae and describe an array-based taxonomic framework used to classify 83 smacovirus genomes into 43 species in six new genera, Bovismacovirus (n=3), Cosmacovirus (n=1), Dragsmacovirus. (n=1), Drosmacovirus (n=3), Huchismacovirus (n=7) and Porprismacovirus (n=28). As with genoviruses, species distinction is based on genome-wide binary identity, while genera are determined based on Rep amino acid sequence identity coupled with strong phylogenetic support. A similar sequence-based taxonomic framework should guide the classification of the surprising diversity of other uncultured and currently unclassified CRESS DNA viruses discovered through metagenomic approaches.",,"Varsani, A.;Krupovic, M.",2018.0,Jul,,0
2139,Influenza virus-h1n1 a new variant of swine flu virus,"In 2009, a type of swine-derived H1N1 virus called swine flu caused the 2009 Influenza Pandemic. Most cold climate countries are affected by the disease. Between 1979 and 2001, an average of 41,000 people died from the flu each year in the United States. Influenza, commonly referred to as influenza, is an infectious disease caused by RNA viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family that infects birds and mammals. This virus is basically classified into three types 1) Influenza virus A 2) Influenza virus B 3) Influenza virus C. Swine flu belongs to Influenza virus A(H1N1). The virus particle is 80-120 nanometers. In the early stages of swine flu it can be difficult to distinguish between a cold and the flu, but flu can be identified by the sudden onset and high fever with extreme fatigue. It is transmitted in three main ways: direct transmission, air-bone route, and direct personal contact (such as handshaking). Influenza virus can stay outside the body, or it can be transmitted from contaminated surfaces such as banknotes and doorknobs. H1N1 spreads easily, rarely fatal. One of the mechanisms is believed to be inhibition of H1N1 adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn causes cortisol levels to drop. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight, disinfectants, and detergents. Commonly used antivirals are oseltamivir and zanamivir, these are neuraminidase inhibitors, and amantadine and rimantadine block a viral ion channel and prevent the virus from infecting cells.

2140,Autochthonous hepatitis E-virus infection as a cause of acute hepatitis in Germany - A case report,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis E virus (HEV) triggers acute hepatitis not only in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and the Americas with low sanitary standards, but also in highly industrialized countries. Here we report two patients with HEV infection from Thuringia (Germany) who are not resident abroad. All other common causes of hepatitis were excluded. In both cases, transaminases were significantly increased, whereas jaundice could be demonstrated in only one patient. Both patients fully recovered in the long term. Epidemiological and phylogenetic data from viral analyzes suggest that HEV infection should be considered a zoonosis. Viral transmission from animals to humans is likely to occur through undercooked meat or guts, for example from pigs or wild animals. In summary, HEV infection is a relevant differential diagnosis in acute non-A/B/C viral hepatitis. Further studies are needed to identify other routes of transmission, reservoirs of pathogens, and new concepts for prophylaxis, particularly in patients at risk for liver disease.

2142,Avian influenza viruses in wild birds: virus evolution in a multi-host ecosystem.,"Wild ducks and gulls are major reservoirs of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). The mechanisms driving AIV evolution are complex where various species of ducks and gulls breed, winter or in phase, from various flight paths. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migrant flight paths: the Central Asian flight path, the East Africa/West Asia flight path, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean flight path. During six full study years (2010-2016), we collected AIV samples from various species of ducks and gulls that breed, migrate and overwinter in Georgia. We found a significant diversity of virus subspecies with prevalence varying from year to year. Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes include H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H16N3, and two pathogenic H16. AIVs (HPAIVs) of section 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8 were found. Whole genome phylogenetic trees showed significant differences in observed reclassification rates, as defined by significant host species lineage restriction and quantification of phylogenetic mismatch for nearly all gene segments, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs among different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses circulating in Eurasia in 2014 and 2015 did not recombine, but analyzes after their subsequent spread in 2016 and 2017 revealed reclassification in all gene segments except NP and NS.

2143,Molecular characterization of Belgian pseudorabies virus isolated from domestic pig and wild boar,"Aujeszky's disease is an economically important disease in domestic pigs caused by suid herpesvirus 1, also called pseudorabies virus (PRV). In several European countries, including Belgium, the virus has been successfully eradicated from the domestic pig population. However, the presence of PRV in the wild boar population poses a risk for possible reinfection of the virus into the domestic pig population. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the genetic relationship between circulating strains and possible epidemiological links. In this study, nine historical Belgian domestic pig isolates circulating before 1990 and five novel wild boar isolates from Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg since 2006 were genetically characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic analysis. was done. While all wild boar isolates were characterized as type I RFLP genotypes, the RFLP patterns of domestic pig isolates suggest that there may have been a shift from genotype I to genotype II in the domestic population in the 1980s. By phylogenetic analysis, Belgian wild boar isolates belonging to both A and B branches were observed, while all domestic pig isolates clustered in A sequence. Joint phylogenetic analysis of both wild boar and domestic pig strains showed that some isolates with the same sequences were present in them. In both populations, this raises the question of whether these strains pose an increased risk for reinfection of the virus into the native population. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Verpoest, S.;Cay, A.

2144,The capacity of the UL49.5 proteins to inhibit TAP is widely distributed among members of the varicellovirus genus.,"Life-long infection by varicelloviruses is characterized by a fine balance between the host's immune response and the immune avoidance strategies employed by these viruses. Virus-derived peptides are presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transports peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, where loading of MHC-I molecules occurs. Bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV-1), pseudorabies virus, and equivalent herpes viruses 1 and 4 have been found to encode a UL49.5 protein that inhibits TAP-mediated peptide transport. Homologs of five other varicelloviruses, a mardivirus and an iltovirus were examined to investigate the extent to which UL49.5-mediated inhibition of TAP was conserved within the Alphaherpesvirinae family. UL49.5 proteins of BoHV-5, bubalin herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1 and felid herpesvirus 1 were identified as potent TAP inhibitors. Varicella-zoster virus and simian varicellovirus UL49.5 proteins fail to block TAP; this is not due to the absence of viral cofactors that could assist in this process, as cells infected with these viruses also did not show reduced TAP function. UL49.5 homologues of Mardivirus Marek's disease virus 1 and iltovirus infectious laryngotracheitis virus did not block TAP, suggesting that the capacity to inhibit TAP via UL49.5 is gained only by varicelloviruses. A phylogenetic analysis of viruses that inhibit TAP via the UL49.5 proteins reveals an interesting heritable pattern pointing to the presence of this capacity in defined branches within the genus Varicellovirus.

2145,Detection and Genotyping of Classical Swine Fever Virus Isolates in Serbia,"Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious swine disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. The classic swine fever virus can be classified into three genogroups, each consisting of three or four subgroups. However, there is a lack of information on the genotypes of CSFV isolates in the Republic of Serbia. Based on sequence analysis of the partial E2 gene and 5' noncoding region (NCR) of 15 CSFVs isolated from domestic pigs between 2006 and 2008, this study revealed that they all clustered in genetic group 2.3. In addition, we have shown that the two most commonly used real-time RT-PCR tests can detect all local CSF viruses circulating in Serbia in recent years during the intense vaccination campaign against CSF.",,"Vesna, M.;Sonja, R.;Valcic, A.

2146,Metagenomic detection and characterization of viruses in fecal samples from Australian wild birds,"We present an optimized metagenomic method for the detection and characterization of all virus strains, including single- and double-stranded DNA/RNA and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The initial evaluation included both spiked and nailless bird excrement samples, as well as nail-free human stool samples. We detected 21 viruses from non-spiked bird samples (Australian Muscovy duck and Pacific black duck) and also present a summary of several viruses detected in human fecal samples. Next, we present a detailed analysis of selected virus sequences in bird samples that are somewhat similar to known viruses and have good quality (Q20 or higher) and quantity of next-generation sequencing reads, which are of interest from a virological point of view. for example, avian coronavirus and avian paramyxovirus 6. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses, while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/ranked viruses. In addition to detecting viruses, this technique also allows for the characterization of available host mitochondrial DNA and thus the identification of host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provide insight into the ""ribosomal activity microbiome""; intestinal parasites; and foods we associate with non-avian host-associated viruses, such as plants or insects.",,"Vibin, J.;Chamings, A.;Collier, F.;Klaassen, M.;Nelson, T.

2147,Metagenomic Analysis of Viruses in Stool Samples from Children with Acute Flask Paralysis,"We analyzed viral nucleic acids in stool samples collected from 35 South Asian children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Sequence-independent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of capsid-protected, nuclease-resistant viral nucleic acids were followed by DNA sequencing and sequence similarity searches. Limited Sanger sequencing (35 to 240 subclones per sample) identified an average of 1.4 different eukaryotic viruses per sample, while pyro sequencing yielded 2.6 viruses per sample. In addition to bacteriophage and plant viruses, we detected numerous other members of the Picornaviridae family, including parechovirus, as well as known enteric viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, picobirnavirus, and human enterovirus types A (HEV-A) to HEV-C. Aichi virus, rhinovirus and human cardiovirus. Viruses with the most divergent sequences to previously reported viruses included members of a new genus Picornaviridae and four new viral species (family Dicistroviridae, Nodaviridae and Circoviridae, and members of the genus Bocavirus). Samples from six healthy contacts of AFP patients were similarly analyzed and also contained multiple viruses, particularly HEV-C, potentially including a new Enterovirus genotype. Determining the prevalence and pathogenicity of the novel genotypes, species, genera, and potential novel viral families identified in this study in different demographic groups will require further work with different demographics and patient groups, now facilitated by knowledge of these viral genomes.",,"Victoria, J.

2148,Viral nucleic acids in live attenuated vaccines: Detection of minority variants and an incidental virus.,"Metagenomic and one panmicrobial microarray were used to examine eight live attenuated viral vaccines. Viral nucleic acids in live vaccines for trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and bivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyro-sequenced. At depths reaching 8,000 reads per nucleotide, more than half a million sequence reads were generated, covering 20 to 99% of attenuated viral genomes. Mutations and minority variants were detected in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus that were not known to affect attenuation relative to vaccine strains. Detection of expected endogenous retroviral sequences from producer bird and primate cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown not to be contagious to humans, was present as RNA in viral particles, while simian retrovirus (SRV) existed as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an orally administered rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a highly common, non-pathogenic porcine virus that has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Therefore, deep sequencing and microarrays can detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants and incidental viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live attenuated viral vaccines.

2149,Whole genome characterization by deep sequencing of rotavirus A isolates from neonatal diarrheal outbreaks in pigs in Spain,"Since early 2017, there has been a marked increase in reports of rotavirus involvement in neonatal diarrheal outbreaks in Spain that also affected adult sows. This study investigated 16 unrelated diarrheal outbreaks in lactating pigs and sows, in which rotavirus A was the only pathogen detected. Deep sequencing was performed on total RNA from twenty-four positive stool samples. Genotyping, phylogenetic, and bayesian analyzes showed that all isolates had a common porcine ancestor or pig-like origin. The new species was introduced to the population shortly before the onset of epidemics. In addition, a high variation occurred in the VP7 and VP4 genes in a short time. The isolates showed a higher number of amino acid changes in neutralizing epitopes compared to vaccine sequences. This report demonstrates how a new strain of rotavirus A can spread rapidly and the extremely high diversity in which this pathogen can survive in a short period of time.",,"Vidal, A.;Clilverd, H.;Cortey, M.;Martin-Valls, G.

In January 2007, samples were collected from an epizootiological site in the Republic of Serbia. Newcastle disease virus strains were isolated from four samples. Identification of isolated strains was done using hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition tests. The nucleic acid of the ND virus was identified in all four samples. All strains isolated were confirmed to be velogenic strains. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the gene encoding the F cleavage site of the fusion F protein revealed the presence of motifs (112) RRQKRFIG(119) characteristic for velogenic strains of ND virus.

2151,"Being vigilant against emerging pathogens worldwide: A phylogeographic approach to determine the epidemiology of Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2), taking into account global trade.","Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) is an emerging virus associated with a number of different syndromes in pigs known as Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD). Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 has achieved worldwide distribution, has become endemic in most pig-producing countries and is now considered the main cause of losses in pig farms. In this study, we analyzed the main pathways of PCV-2 spread among pig producing countries using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. A search of the PCV-2 genome sequences was performed in GenBank and the resulting 420 PCV-2 sequences were grouped into haplotypes (group of sequences with 100% identity) based on the infinite site model of genome evolution. A phylogenetic hypothesis was deduced by Bayesian Inference for the classification of viral strains, and a haplotype network was created by Median Joining to predict the geographic distribution and genealogical relationships of haplotypes. To provide an epidemiological and economic context in these analyses, we evaluated all information on PCV-2 sequences available in GenBank, including published articles on viral isolation and live pig trade statistics available in the UN Comtrade database (http://comtrade). .un.org/). In these analyses, we identified a strong correlation between the PCV-2 distribution means predicted by the haplotype network and the statistics on international trade in live pigs. This correlation provides a new perspective on the epidemiology of PCV-2, highlighting the importance of worldwide animal movement in the emergence of new pathogens and demonstrating the need for effective sanitary barriers to trade in livestock. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Vidigal, P.

In this study, we genetically characterized swine Hepadnavirus strains found in pigs from certified abattoirs in the Brazilian State of Rio de Janeiro and evaluated their hepatotropic potential. Results: Bile and liver samples from pigs were positive for partial genome amplification (ORF S and ORF C), direct sequencing, and viral load measurement. Sequencing of the gene encoding the surface antigen allowed Hepadnavirus to be classified into genotypes, similar to the HBV genotype classification. Indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of HBsAg antigen in liver tissue sections.

2153,"Hendra and Nipah infection: Pathology, patterns and potential treatments","The family Paramyxoviridae consists of several genera that present emerging or re-emerging threats to human and animal health without real and specific effective treatment. Hendra and Nipah virus are members of the Henipavirus genus of emerging paramyxoviruses. Since their discovery in the 1990s, henipavirus outbreaks have been associated with a high potential for economic and public health threats. Compared to other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses appear to have unique properties. Henipaviruses are zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a wider tropism than most other paramyxoviruses and can cause severe acute encephalitis with features unique among viral encephalitis. There are currently no approved effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for henipavirus infections. While ribavirin has been used empirically and appears beneficial during the largest outbreak of one of these viruses, the Nipah virus, its efficacy is controversial in light of the lack of efficacy in various animal models of henipavirus infection. However, due to its highly pathogenic nature, much effort has been devoted to the development of anti-henipavirus therapeutics. In this review, we describe the unique features of henipavirus infections and the different strategies and animal models developed so far to identify and test potential drugs to prevent or treat henipavirus infections. Some of these ingredients have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals as they target viral pathogenicity effectors common in other viruses. We will focus on small molecules or biologics rather than vaccine strategies developed as anti-henipaviral therapeutics. Â© 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Vigant, F.;Lee, B.",2011.0,,,0
2154,Analysis of the crow lung transcriptome in response to infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus currently circulating in Asia causes serious illness in domestic birds as well as in wild birds such as crows. However, the molecular pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in crows and other wild birds is not well known. Therefore, as a step to explore, a comprehensive global gene expression analysis was performed on crow lungs infected with HPAI H5N1 crow isolate (A/Crow/India/11TI11/2011) using high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) (GS FLX). . Titanium XLR70). The crow's reference genome is not available, so RNA sequencing was performed on the basis of a de novo-spliced transcriptome. The RNA sequence result shows that 4052 genes are uniquely expressed in the uninfected, 6277 genes are uniquely expressed in the HPAIV-infected sample, and 2279 genes out of 6814 expressed in both samples are significantly different. Our transcriptome profiling data allow for the ability to understand the molecular mechanism behind the recent deadly outbreak of HPAIV in crows, which until recently was thought to cause lethal infections only in gallbladder birds such as chickens and not in wild birds. The pattern of differentially expressed genes indicates that this isolate of H5N1 virus evades the host innate immune response, possibly by downregulating signaling from type I IFN (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and type II IFN receptors, reducing interferon (IFN)-inducible signaling, upregulation. altering the expression of suppressive signaling inhibitors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, and toll-like receptors (TLRs). This may be the cause of illness and death in crows.",,"Vijayakumar, P.;Mishra, A.;Ranaware, P. B.;Kolte, A. P.;Kulkarni, D. D.;Burt, D. W.;Raut, A. A.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2015.01.016,0

The glycoprotein Erns of an atypical bovine pestivirus Th/04_KhonKaen was produced in a baculovirus expression system and purified by affinity chromatography. The recombinant Erns protein was used as an antigen in a microsphere immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to BVDV-1 and atypical bovine pestivirus. The diagnostic performance of the new method was evaluated by testing a total of 596 serum samples and the assay was compared with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the negative/positive cut-off median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of 2800, the microsphere immunoassay had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to ELISA. The immunoassay was able to detect antibodies to both BVDV-1 and the atypical pestivirus.

2157,Complete genomic sequence of human coronavirus OC43: Molecular clock analysis shows a relatively new zoonotic coronavirus transmission event,"Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of about 30 kb. According to genetic similarities, coronaviruses are divided into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), show remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30.738 nucleotides) of the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR7S9). Whole genome and open reading frame (ORF) analyzes were performed compared to the BCoV genome. In the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, there is a 290 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to the absence of the BCoV ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8. Percentages of nucleotide and amino acid similarity were determined for major HCoV-OC43 ORFs and those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity was demonstrated between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs except the E gene. Molecular clock analysis of spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. The evolutionary rate is on the order of 4 × 10 -4 nucleotide changes per region. year estimated. This is the first animal-human zoonotic coronavirus pair that can be analyzed to learn about the adaptation processes of a non-human coronavirus to a human host, and this is important for understanding the interspecies transmission events that led to the origin of the virus. epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome.

2159,Organization and diversity of the 3' noncoding region of the classic swine fever virus genome,"Specific PCR primers were selected to amplify a 359 bp DNA fragment flanking the 3'-portion of the polymerase gene and the 3'-noncoding (3'-NC) region of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) genome. The fragment selected in RT-PCR was amplified from three vaccine strains of CSFV as well as the genomes of 27 viral strains collected from Europe, America and Asia over a half-century period. Eight PCR products were sequenced using an automated sequencing device. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed with DNASTAR and PHYLIP computer programs. Comparative studies revealed that the 3'-NC region contains a variable nucleotide region located immediately after the stop codon TGA or TAA. Also, a strongly conserved constant region was identified near its extreme 3'-end. Two defective repeating sequences were found in both the variable and constant regions. In addition, the variable region was characterized by the appearance of a 50 bp long poly AT trace. Phylogenetic analysis with different mathematical approaches (MegAlign, Neighbor-Joining method, Maximum Likelihood, Parsimony) revealed that the examined CSFV strains were divided into two main phylogenetic groups. Group I consisted of former American and European field isolates and a Brazilian vaccine strain, as well as the reference strain Brescia. Group II included the reference strain Alfort (Tubingen) and the recent European field strains. The Congenital Tremor strain formed a distinct lineage that, although quite different, was more closely related to group I than group II. In conclusion, the current phylogenetic grouping yielded very similar results to previous studies based on comparison of the E2 (gp55) region. The agreement of the phylogenetic analysis in the two different regions confirms the reliability of the genetic grouping of CSFV strains in the two main genogroups.",,"VilÄek, Å ;BelÃ¡k, S.",1997.0,,10.1023/a:1007971110065,0

BVDV isolates are usually typed based on comparison of genomic sequences from the 5â€²-untranslated region (5â€²-UTR), Npro and E2 region. We recently identified 11 genetic groups (subgenotypes) of BVDV-1. Our subsequent experiments confirmed a new subgenotype, BVDV-1k, isolated from cattle in Switzerland. BVDV isolates from India are typed as BVDV-1b, while BVDV-1c is the dominant subgenotype in Australia. The results of genetic typing of BVDV show that the distribution of subgenotypes has no relation to the geographical origin of the viral isolates.

2161,Genetic diversity of recent bovine viral diarrheal viruses from southeast Austria (Styria),"To characterize bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolates circulating in southeastern Austria, namely in the state of Styria, 71 blood samples collected from 62 herds of permanently infected cattle between 1998 and 2000 were subjected to genetic typing. For this, 288bp fragments from the 5â€² untranslated region (5â€²-UTR) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR). The products were sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis. Seventy virus isolates were typed as BVDV type 1 (BVDV-1). Only one isolate was typed as BVDV type 2 (BVDV-2), representing the first isolate of this pestivirus genotype found in Austria. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses belonging to five genetic groups within BVDV-1 circulate in Styria. Most viruses (53) were found in the BVDV-1f group, nine viruses in BVDV-1h, four viruses in BVDV-1b, three viruses in BVDV-1d, and one virus BVDV-1g. No viruses were found in the genetic group BVDV-1a, which is predominant in the UK and common in the US. Similarly, BVDV isolates predominant in a neighboring country, namely Germany, belonged to different genogroups than those circulating in Styria. We conclude that certain BVDV-1 genetic groups predominate in a particular region and environment. New groups, including BVDV-2, may be introduced, for example, through the animal trade. The low incidence of BVDV-2 in Styria is in keeping with the occasional occurrence of these viruses in other parts of Europe.

2162,Molecular characterization of sheep pestiviruses,"Forty-two ovine pestivirus isolates collected over an 18-year period were compared by phylogenetic analysis. The viruses were mostly field isolates from England; the other two came from Sweden and two from New Zealand. RT-PCR products were obtained from two genomic regions, one within the 5' noncoding (5'-NC) region and the other covering the p20 (N(pro)) and C coding regions. Direct sequencing of the 5'-NC PCR products, followed by computer-assisted phylogenetic analysis, separated the ovine pestiviruses into three main genotypes. The results showed that sheep can be naturally infected not only with border disease virus (BDV), but also with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) types I and II. BDV isolates were divided into two main subtypes represented by the Moredun strain from Scotland and the 137/4 strain from England. The BVDV-I group consisted of three clusters, two of which were represented by the BVDV reference strains NADL and Osloss, and the third by sheep isolates D1120/1 and D1432/P, respectively. Grouping of ovine pestiviruses based on comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5'-NC region was confirmed by comparative analysis of the p20 (NP(pro)) and C coding regions performed at both the nucleotide and amino acid level. . The presence of three genotypes, including BVDV-I and BVDV-II, in sheep indicates the inadequacy of current host-species-based nomenclature and classification of pestiviruses.",,"VilÄek, Å ;Nettleton, P.

2163,Genetic variability of the classic swine fever virus,"The genetic variability of the classic swine fever virus was studied by comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of 76 virus isolates collected over half a century from three continents. E2 (gp55) portions of the viral genome and polymerase gene coding regions were amplified by RT-PCR and DNA fragments of 254 and 207 bp were sequenced, respectively. Comparative sequence analysis of the E2 region revealed two major phylogenetic groups of CSFVs, indicating that the virus apparently evolved from two ancestral nodes. Group I (represented by the Brescia species) consisted of old and new American and Asian viruses, as well as old British isolates from the 1950s. This group has been subdivided into three subgroups called IA IC Group II (represented by the Alfort strain) consisting of relatively new isolates from Europe, with the Osaka strain isolated in Japan from a European pig. The group was divided into II.A and II.B subgroups according to genetic distances. Malaysian isolates were split into both groups, indicating multiple origins for concurrent outbreaks in that country. All ten vaccine types tested branched into group I, indicating a common ancestor. The Japanese Kanagawa strain isolated in 1974 and the British Congenital Tremor strain from 1964 were the most prominent variants of CSFV in our collection. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the polymerase coding region of 32 European strains distinguished subgroups II.A and II.B, which were similar to the corresponding subgroups of the E2 phylogenetic tree. Thus, the results revealed that the E2 region and polymerase-encoding regions appear suitable for grouping CSFV isolates from all over the world, distinguishing the two main groups of the virus. The reliability of these regions for phylogenetic analysis is demonstrated by the similarity of results from two separate segments of the CSFV genome.",,"VilÄek, Å ;Stadejek, T.;Ballagi-PordÃ¡ny, A.;Lowings, J.

Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and accumulating evidence indicates that the main reservoirs of HEV-3 are domestic pigs and wild boars. A detailed analysis of HEV-3 subtypes can help determine the interplay of human activity, the role of animals as reservoirs, and interspecies transmission. Although whole genome sequences are best suited for HEV subtype determination, in most cases only partial genomic sequences are available. Therefore, we performed a subtype classification analysis using regions from all three open reading frames of the genome. Using this approach, more than 1000 published HEV-3 isolates were subtyped. Newly obtained HEV partial sequences from hunted German wild boars were also included in this study. These sequences were assigned to genotype 3 and clustered in subtype 3a, 3i, and unexpectedly one of them clustered in subtype 3b, the first non-human report of this subtype in Europe.",,"Vina-Rodriguez, A.;Schlosser, J.;Becher, D.;Kaden, V.;Groschup, M.

2165,Investigation of Human Cancers for Retrovirus with Low-Precision Target Enrichment and High-throughput Sequencing,"Although approximately one-fifth of all human cancers have an infectious etiology, the causes of the majority of cancers remain unexplained. Despite the enormous data throughput from high-throughput shotgun sequencing, viral DNA in a clinical sample typically makes up a fraction of host DNA that is too small to detect. Sequence variation between virus genomes complicates the application of sequence-specific and highly sensitive PCR methods. Therefore, we aimed to develop and characterize a method that allows sensitive detection of sequences despite significant differences. We show that our low stringency in-solution hybridization method enables detection of <100 viral copies. Furthermore, distantly related proviral sequences can be enriched by orders of magnitude, enabling the discovery of hitherto unknown viral sequences by high-throughput sequencing. Sensitivity was sufficient to detect retroviral sequences in clinical samples. We used this method to conduct a new study of retroviruses in samples from three cancer types. According to recent studies, our investigation revealed no retroviral infection in human B-cell lymphoma cells, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or colorectal cancer biopsies. However, our generally applicable method enables sensitive detection and allows sequencing of remotely related sequences from complex material.",,"Vinner, L.;Mourier, T.;Friis-Nielsen, J.;Gniadecki, R.;Dybkaer, K.;Rosenberg, J.;Langhoff, J.

2168,New hemotropic mycoplasmas are common and genetically diverse in vampire bats.,"Bats (Order: Chiroptera) have been widely studied as reservoir hosts for viruses of human and animal health. However, whether bats are equally competent hosts of non-viral pathogens such as bacteria remains an important open question. Here, hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. We investigated blood and saliva samples of vampire bats from Peru and Belize. (haemoplasms), bacteria that can cause undetected infection or anemia in hosts. 16S rRNA gene amplification in blood showed that 67% (150/223) of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were infected by hemoplasmas. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed three new genotypes that are phylogenetically related but not identical to the haemoplasms described from other (non-vampire) bat species, rodents, humans, and non-human primates. The prevalence of haemoplasm in vampire bats was highest in non-breeding and juvenile individuals, did not differ by country and remained relatively constant over time (ie endemic). Metagenomics from D. rotundus saliva collected from Peru detected non-hemotropic Mycoplasma species and hemoplasma genotypes phylogenetically similar to those identified in blood, providing indirect evidence for potential direct transmission of hemoplasmas by biting or social contact. This study shows that vampire bats host several novel haemoplasms and sheds light on the risk factors for infection and its main modes of transmission. Given the high frequency of direct contact that occurs when vampire bats feed on humans, pets, and wildlife, the potential for cross-species transmission of these bacteria should be explored in future studies.",,"Volokhov, D.

OBJECTIVES: We characterized pulmonary changes in these fatal Norwegian cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Detailed clinical information and samples from the upper and lower respiratory tracts were collected after hospitalization. Postmortem lung tissue was collected, fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical and light microscopic examination were performed to visualize the local expression of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and pyro-sequencing of unfixed samples allowed the identification of mutations in the influenza virus surface glycoprotein (hemagglutinin gene), specifically at position 222. 2 to 40 days (9 days on average). Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was evident in 11 cases, 4 of which had no obvious underlying disease. Obesity was evident in 12 cases, three of which were classified as healthy. HA D222G mutation was detected in six cases, 3 of which had no underlying disease. Immunohistochemistry showed that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was prominent at the site of inflammation both near and inside the alveolar structures in lung tissue. In addition to a possible role for the HA D222G mutation, our findings suggest that host factors and underlying conditions in infected individuals are fundamental for disease outcome in many cases.

2170,"99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders: Farm lifestyles and the hygiene hypothesis","It has been nearly 15 years since Strachan first proposed the idea that infections and unhygienic contact can protect against the development of allergic diseases. The so-called ""hygiene hypothesis"" has since undergone numerous changes in epidemiology, clinical science and immunology. Three main areas of research have been proposed: investigating the role of overt viral and bacterial infections in the onset of allergic diseases; to explore the importance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds on the development of allergies; and to examine the effect of both exposures on underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. No concept unifying these various aspects was found, but several parts of the complex interplay between the host's immune responses, the characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and diversity of environmental exposure, and the interactions between an exposed subject's genetic background and the disease were found. environmental exposures become evident. A natural experiment with the hygiene hypothesis is the repeated observation of the protective effect of growing up on a farm for asthma and allergies. This has been demonstrated in numerous epidemiological studies among children and adults worldwide. The timing and duration of exposure is likely to play a critical role. The greatest reduction in risk was shown in those with continued exposure before and after birth into adulthood. The protective factors in these agricultural environments are not fully resolved. Findings from several studies suggest that contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, provides protection. In addition, consumption of unprocessed cow's milk directly from the farm has been shown to protect against childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of microbial substances may contribute, at least in part, to the 'farm effect'. However, there are only a few studies measuring microbial exposures in these settings, and results so far indicate that the underlying protective microbial exposure(s) has not been identified, although a number of studies using metagenomic approaches are currently underway. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures provide protection from respiratory allergies are also not well understood. There is good evidence that innate immune responses are involved, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking. Also, a number of gene x environment interactions have been observed. Â© 2010 British Society of Immunology.",,"Von Mutius, E.",2010.0,,10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04138.x,0
2171,Possible role played by buffalo in recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in South Africa,"African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) acts as a care host for foot and mouth disease (FMD) in South Africa. A single buffalo can be infected with all three of the endemic serotypes of FMD virus (SAT-1, SAT-2 and SAT-3), posing an infection threat to other susceptible equidae. Flooding in South Africa in 2000 greatly damaged the Kruger National Park (KNP) game fence, and there were several accounts of buffalo fleeing the park. The VP1 gene encoding the major antigenic determinant of FMD virus was used to determine phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates from outbreaks and those previously obtained from buffalo in CNP. These results suggest that buffalo is most likely the source of the outbreaks; this shows that, in addition to fencing disease control, vaccination is extremely important to ensure that FMD does not become established in pets.",,"Vosloo, W.;Boshoff, K.;Dwarka, R.;Bastos, A.",2002.0,,,0

A virulent form of IBDV reached South Africa in 1989, and to date very little molecular information has been available for this strain. In this study, the polyprotein coding region of the South African strain SA-KZN95 was sequenced and analyzed together with 52 representative sequences of other serotypes I and II strains. We investigated the relative effect of recombination on phylogenetic remodeling using a multidimensional scaling approach. Phylogenetic analyzes consistently placed the South African isolate in the highly lethal IBDV clade. Selection analyzes were also performed to identify evolutionarily relevant amino acid residues. Previously, 19 residues in the polyprotein were shown to be potentially diagnostic for different IBDV pathotypes. This study identified two additional unique residues in the polyprotein that could be used as genetic signatures in future viral identifications.

2175,Human spermidine synthase: Cloning and primary structure,"Using a synthetic mixture of deoxyoligonucleotides for a tryptic peptide of the bovine enzyme as a probe, cDNA encoding the full-length subunit of spermidine synthase was isolated from a human decidual cDNA library constructed on phage Î»gt11. After subcloning and amplification into the Eco RI region of pBR322, both sequences of the insert were sequenced using a shotgun strategy. An open reading frame was resolved for a 302 amino acid polypeptide, starting from the first start codon immediately preceding a GC-rich region containing four overlapping CCGCC consensus sequences. This peptide had an M(r) of 33,827, started with methionine and ended with serine. The identity of the isolated cDNA was confirmed by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence with the resolved sequences of tryptic peptides of bovine spermidine synthase. The coding strand of cDNA showed no specific regulatory or ribosome binding signal in 82 nucleotides before the start codon and no polyadenylation signal in 247 nucleotides following the stop codon. The coding region containing a 13 nucleotide repeat near the 5' end was longer and very different from its bacterial counterpart. This region appears to be of retroviral origin and shows marked homology with sequences found in a variety of human, mammalian, avian and viral genes and mRNAs. By computer analysis, the first 200 nucleotides of the 5' end of the coding chain appear to be able to form a very stable secondary structure with a free energy change of -157.6 kcal/mol.

2176,Evolutionary insights of the Bean common mosaic necrosis virus and the Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus.,"Plant viral diseases are one of the biggest constraints on legume production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as they are responsible for up to 100% production losses on small-scale farms. In this study, field studies were conducted with viral symptomatic leaf samples collected from the western highlands of Kenya. Next, next-generation sequencing was performed to gain insight into the molecular evolution and evolutionary relationships of Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) and Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) in symptomatic beans and cowpeas. Nearly eleven genomes of BCMNV and two genomes for CABMV were obtained from western Kenya. Bayesian phylogenomic analysis and differential selection pressure tests of viral genomes between tree branches and within sites were performed. Three well-supported segments in BCMNV and one well-supported segment for CABMNV resolved and were compatible with individual gene trees. Selection pressure analysis within regions and between phylogenetic branches showed that both viruses evolved independently, but under strong purifying selection with a slow evolutionary rate. These findings provide valuable insight into the evolution of the BCMNV and CABMV genomes and their relationships to other viral genomes globally. The results will greatly add to the knowledge gap involving the phylogenomic relevance of these viruses, particularly for CABMV for which several genome sequences are available, and inform current breeding efforts towards resistance to BCMNV and CABMV.",,"Wainaina, J.

PROCEDURE: Two MDV challenge isolates (MPF57 or MPF23) were administered to unvaccinated specific pathogen-free (SPF) layer chicks at three challenge doses (500, 2000, or 8000 plaque-forming units (pfu)/chick) on day 5 post-hatch. Mortality, body weight, immune organ weights, MDV load in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and clinical manifestations were measured up to 56 days post-challenge (dpc). RESULTS: MPF23 was more pathogenic between the two viruses, resulting in higher mortality (81% vs 62%) and incidence of MD lesions (76% vs. 100%). MPF23 induced earlier, longer duration, and more severe neurological manifestations in the 26-56 dpc period. However, there was little variation in the order of 0-23 dpc used in the neuropathotyping classification under test. The pattern observed during this early period classified both viruses as neuropathotype B, consistent with a highly virulent pathotype. MDV burden in PBL at 7 and 44 dpc did not differ between virus isolates, but burden at 7 dpc was significantly and negatively correlated with time to euthanasia or death. CONCLUSION: MPF23 appears to be as lethal as or more than MDV strains isolated over the next two decades. The neuropathotyping system developed in the USA did not clearly distinguish between the two isolates tested; however, prolonging the evaluation period of clinical signs beyond 26 dpc revealed clear differences.",,"Wajid, S.

2180,The history of bluetongue and a current global view,"Bluetongue (BT) was first reported more than 125 years ago when European sheep breeds were introduced to South Africa. BT viruses (BTV) have been identified in many tropical and temperate regions of the world. IT, disease, is a phenomenon of ruminant animals in temperate regions. There are few clinical diseases in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. At least 24 BTV serotypes have been identified. While viruses are classified antigenically and taxonomically as BTV, each serotype is unique and may not cause the disease CT. BTVs are transmitted among ruminant animals by competent vector species of the genus Culicoides, namely, biting midges or midges. BTV serotypes are predictable worldwide with Culicoides vector species, but are found in limited geographic and ecological cycles or ecosystems. Despite the almost certain movement of livestock and Culicoides species between these ecosystems, there is little evidence that introduced BTV serotypes have been established in these ecosystems. Instead, periodic cyclical extensions and remissions of these virus-vector ecosystems allow viruses and disease to migrate to and away from adjacent non-endemic areas that are characteristic of many other known arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Earlier publications have suggested that a carrier state occurs in cattle fetally infected with BTV. No subsequent natural experience or research supports the unconfirmed hypothesis. The results of the research are not accepted by the scientific community. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that regulatory restrictions against the movement of cattle from BTV affected countries be relaxed or eliminated.",,"Walton, T. E.",2004.0,Jul-Sep,,0

2184,Microbial phylogeny determines the transcriptional response of the resistome to dynamic composting processes.,"BACKGROUND: Animal manure is a repository of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which poses a potential health risk globally, especially for resistance to antibiotics (such as tetracyclines, sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones) commonly used in livestock production. At present, the effects of biological treatment (composting) on the transcriptional response of fertilizer ARGs and their microbial hosts are not well defined. Composting is a dynamic process that consists of four different stages, distinguished by the temperature resulting from microbial activity, namely the mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling and maturation stages. In this study, changes in resistome expression during dynamic composting were determined and correlated with active microbiome profiles. This was achieved by integrating metagenomic and time-series metatranscriptomic data for the microbial community that thrives during composting. RESULTS: Composting markedly reduced the bulk expression level of manure resistome, which mainly comprised of genes encoding tetracycline, vancomycin, fluoroquinolone, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance as well as runoff pumps. Furthermore, the diverse transcriptional response of the resistome to composting at ARG levels was highlighted. Expression of tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) decreased during composting, where significant shifts in the four stages of composting were associated with changes in antibiotic concentration. Composting had no effect on the expression of sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance genes, these genes increased slightly during the thermophilic phase and then decreased to baseline levels. As native populations changed drastically throughout dynamic composting, the core resistome persisted and the composition of reservoir hosts was significantly correlated with dynamic active microbial phylogenetic structure. The hosts for the sulfonamide and fuoroquinolone resistance genes changed significantly in phylonetic structure and underwent an initial increase and then a decrease in abundance. In contrast, hosts for tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) exhibited a steady decline over time. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional patterns of a core resistome were identified throughout the composting process, and microbial phylogeny was the key determinant in defining the varying transcriptional response of the resistome to this dynamic biological process. This research has demonstrated the benefits of composting for manure treatment. Tetracyclines reduced the risk of introducing clinically relevant pathogens carrying tetracycline resistance genes and ARGs, as well as environmental contaminants such as RNA viruses and bacteriophages.",,"Wang, C.;Dong, D.;Strong, P.

Due to the lack of surveillance of influenza prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and transmission routes of H5N1 viruses during this period have not been defined. To identify the possible source of wave 1 H5N1 viruses, we recently performed further sequencing and analysis of samples collected from live poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan and Yunnan in southern China from 2001 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes A greater genetic diversity emerged from 73 H5N1 isolates from this period than previously reported in Southern China. Furthermore, the results showed that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the 1st part virus subset from Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were associated with viruses from Indonesia. shows that they are most closely related (item 2.1). Further phylogenetic analyzes of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of these viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships to their surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were genotype Z and shared high similarity (-99%) with their corresponding descendant viruses in most gene segments. These results indicate a direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam in 2002 and 2003, as well as between Hunan and Indonesia. While the poultry trade may be responsible for the virus's entry into Vietnam, the route of transmission from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

2190,Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Candidate Genes and Gene Sets Controlling the Response of Pig Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells to Poly I:C Stimulation,"Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic dsRNA analog, has been shown to have stimulatory effects similar to viral dsRNA. To gain in-depth insight into the host transcriptional response of pigs to poly I:C stimulation, in this study, we cultured and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from piglets of a Chinese native breed (Dapulian) and a modern commercial breed (Dapulian) (Landrace) with poly He compared I:C and their transcriptional profiles using RNA sequencing (RNA sequencing). Our results showed that poly I:C stimulation could elicit significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes in Landrace (g = 85) as well as in Dapulian (g = 290). We also performed gene set analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) package and identified some gene sets that were significantly enriched in Dapulian (g = 18) and Landrace (g = 21). Many of the shared DE genes and gene sets were immune-related and may play crucial rules in the immune response to poly I:C stimulation. In addition, we detected significantly large sets of DE genes and enriched gene sets when comparing the gene expression profile between the two breeds, including the control and poly I:C stimulation groups. Besides immune-related functions, some DE genes and gene sets between the two genera were involved in the development and growth of various tissues that may be associated with the different traits of the two genera. The DE genes and gene sets identified here provide important insights into understanding the immune regulation of antiviral responses in modern and domestic pigs and the molecular mechanisms of differential genetic resistance to viral infection.",,"Wang, J.;Wang, Y.;Wang, H.;Wang, H.;Liu, J.

2191,Characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolates emerging in China,"Summary Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is a worldwide devastating poultry disease characterized by increased respiratory, circulatory disorders, hemorrhagic enteritis, and nervous manifestations. Sequence analysis shows substitutions of several amino acid residues in neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of recent Shaanxi strains. Both Cross-protection and cross-serum neutralization tests revealed that conventional vaccine strains could not provide full protection for herds. Methods: To better understand the epidemiology of the Newcastle disease outbreak, part of the F gene and full-length HN gene were amplified from Shaanxi isolates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by sequence and phylogenetic analyzes. In the pathogenicity analysis, both high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and mean time to death (MDT) tests of chicken embryos were performed. A cross-protection experiment was also conducted in which specific pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain were challenged by the final Shaanxi strain. Results: Nine Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) isolates recovered from ND outbreaks in chicken flocks in China were genotypically and pathotypically characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all NDVs recently isolated with Shaanxi have <sup>112</sup>RRQKRF<sup>117</sup> for the C-terminal of the F2 protein, and chicken embryos have high ICPI and MDT'. revealed that all of these were classified as velogenic-type NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates indicated that they belonged to subgenotype VIId, which has been implicated in recent epidemics in northwest China. The percent amino acid sequence identity of the F protein between the final Shaanxi dyes and the five vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9%-88.1%, while the percent amino acid sequence identity of the HN protein between the final Shaanxi strains and vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9-88.1%. 87.4-91.2% range. Furthermore, a number of amino acid residue substitutions were observed in the neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of these isolates, which could lead to altered antibody recognition and neutralization capacity. A cross-protection experiment demonstrated that specific pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain could not provide full protection for flocks threatened by the last Shaanxi strain. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings reveal that recent Shannxi NDV strains exhibit antigenic variations that may be responsible for recent NDV outbreaks in northwest China.",,"Wang, J.

2192,Genome sequence characterization of pigeon circoviruses in China,"Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) was detected by PCR in pigeons from China. In total, 48 out of 244 pigeons tested positive for PiCV (positive rate, 19.67%), indicating that the virus is prevalent in China. From 48 PiCV-positive samples, approximately 2040bp of whole genome fragments were obtained by full-length genome amplification and sequenced with a next-generation sequencing platform. The properties of ORFs from different PiCV strains tested in this study were analyzed. Several insertions, deletions or substitutions were discovered during the analysis of the nucleotide sequence compared to previously reported sequences. In phylogenetic tree analysis, 48 sequences isolated in this study can be further divided into five segments (A, B, C, D and F), segment E contains reference sequences only. In the six branches, two main groups were found, distinguished by the initiation codons ATA and ATG. Most of the viruses isolated in the study were in the ATG group, less in the ATA branch.",,"Wang, K. C.;Zhuang, Q. Y.;Qiu, Y.;Wang, T.;Chen, J. M.",2017.0,04 02,,0

2194,Classification of duck hepatitis virus into three genotypes based on molecular evolutionary analysis,"The nucleotide sequences of the complete VP1, VP0, VP3 and partial 3D regions of seven duck hepatitis virus (DHV) serotype 1 (DHV-1) strains isolated in China between 2001 and 2007 and of a DHV-1 strain originally obtained from ATCC The nucleotide sequences are determined and compared to the DHV sequences pre-existing in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1 sequences showed three distinct genetic groups. There was excellent agreement between genetic groups assigned based on full VP0, VP3, and partial 3D regions. Given the increasing importance of molecular techniques in diagnosis, we propose that the three genetic groups should be named DHV types A, B, and C. While all DHV-1 strains were grouped into genotype A, novel serotype strains isolated in Taiwan and South Korea clustered in genotypes B and C, respectively, suggesting a potential genetic correlate of serotype. In pairwise comparisons of the complete VP1, VP0 and VP3 nucleotide and amino acid sequences and the partial 3D nucleotide sequence, DHVs of the same genotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous genotypes. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the three capsid proteins revealed the presence of intervening domains that vary in sequence among strains of different genotypes, as well as conserved elements forming eight-stranded Î²-barrel structures, as seen in other picorna viruses. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Wang, L.;Pan, M.;Fu, Y.;Zhang, D.",2008.0,,10.1007/s11262-008-0233-1,0
2195,Characterization of miRNAs involved in the response to poly(I:C) in porcine airway epithelial cells,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) have been associated with a variety of pathological conditions, including infectious diseases. Knowledge of miRNAs affected by poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA in porcine respiratory epithelial cells (PAECs), contributes to understanding the mechanisms of porcine viral respiratory diseases that cause huge economic losses worldwide each year. contributes. . In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to profile miRNA expression in poly(I:C)-treated PAECs compared to untreated control. This approach revealed 23 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), five of which had not been previously implicated in viral infection. Nineteen of the 23 miRNAs, including members of the miR-17-92 cluster, a well-known polycistronic oncomir, were downregulated and extensively implicated in viral infection in humans. The target genes of DEMs, which were predicted using bioinformatics methods and validated by luciferase reporter analysis on two representative DEMs, were significantly enriched by various means, including transforming growth factor-Î² signaling. A large amount of sequence variation (isomiRs) was found, including a substitution at position 5, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay combined with bioinformatics analysis to direct miRNAs to a novel target spectrum. Twelve novel porcine miRNAs conserved in other species were identified by homology analysis with cloning validation. Furthermore, expression analysis revealed the potential importance of three novel miRNAs in the pig immune response against viruses. Overall, our data contribute to elucidating the mechanisms underlying the host immune response to respiratory viruses in pigs and enrich the repertoire of porcine miRNAs.",,"Wang, L.;Wang, J.

2197,A new strain of enterovirus identified from severe diarrhea goats,"Backgrounds The Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family consists of 9 Enterovirus species and 3 Rhinovirus species based on the latest virus taxonomy. These viruses contribute significantly to respiratory and digestive disorders in humans and animals. Of the 9 Enterovirus species, Enterovirus EG is closely associated with diseases affecting the livestock industry. Enterovirus infections in cattle and pigs are increasingly reported, while enterovirus infections in small ruminants are largely unknown. Methods Virology, molecular and bioinformatics methods were used to characterize a novel enterovirus CEV-JL14 from goats in China that showed severe diarrhea with up to 84% morbidity and 54% mortality, respectively. Results CEV-JL14 was identified and proposed as a new Enterovirus strain L within the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. CEV-JL14 had a complete genome sequence of 7461 nucleotides with an ORF encoding 2172 amino acids and shared 77.1% of genomic sequence identity with TB4-OEV, a sheep enterovirus. Comparison of the structural genes of 5'-UTR and CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus strains revealed high levels of genetic variation between known Enterovirus strains and CEV-JL14. The VP1 nucleotide sequence identities of CEV-14 were 51.8%-53.5% with Enterovirus E and F, 30.9-65.3 and 43.8-51% with Enterovirus G. 5% with Enterovirus AD, respectively. CEV-JL14 has been proposed as a new strain within the Enterovirus genus according to the current ICTV breakpoints of enteroviruses. Results CEV-JL14 phylogenetically clustered neither Enterovirus E and F nor Enterovirus G. It was identified and proposed as a new L species within the Enterovirus genus.

2198,Metagenomic insights into the contribution of phages to antibiotic resistance in water samples from swine feed wastewater treatment.,"In this study, using a metagenomic approach, we examined the types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) possessed by bacteria and bacteriophages in swine effluent before and after purification. We found that the relative abundance of ARGs in bacterial DNA in all water samples was significantly higher (>10.6-fold) than in phage DNA, and wastewater treatment did not significantly alter the relative abundance of bacteria or phage-associated ARGs. We also determined the distribution and diversity of different ARG strains according to the antibiotic class to which they confer resistance, tetracycline resistance genes were the most abundant resistance genes, and phages were more likely to harbor the ATP-binding cassette transporter family and ribosomal. protection genes In addition, the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was also detected in the phage population. When evaluating the contribution of phages in the propagation of different groups of ARGs, the Î²-lactamase resistance genes had relatively high diffusion ability, although the abundance was low. These findings likely indicated that phages not only serve as important ARG reservoirs, but also carry certain ARGs in pig feed effluents, suggesting that this phenomenon is independent of the environment.",,"Wang, M.;Xiong, W.;Liu, P.;Xie, X.;Zeng, J.;Sun, Y.;Zeng, Z.",2018.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02474,0
2199,Complete sequence and evolutionary genomic analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa transposable bacteriophage D3112,"Bacteriophage D3112 represents one of two distinct groups of transposable phages found in the clinically relevant, opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To advance our understanding of the transposable phage in P. aeruginosa, we sequenced the complete genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp and the total G+C content is 65%. We identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three previously characterized and sequenced genes (c repressor gene and early A and B genes). The organization of putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy has classified D3112 as a lambda-like phage on the basis of its morphology. Similarity-based analyzes identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. Tail proteins were highly similar to prophage sequences in Escherichia coli and phage Phi12 from Staphylococcus aureus, while proteins at the right end were highly similar to proteins from Xylella fastidiosa. We performed phylogenetic analyzes to understand the evolutionary relationships of D3112 relative to Mu-like versus lambda-like bacteriophages. In some cases, different results were obtained from similarity-based phylogenetic analyzes. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic pattern and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.",,"Wang, P.

2200,Nucleotide sequence analysis of the E2 major protective antigen coding region of 12 strains of swine cholera virus (HCV),"The cDNA fragments of the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 major gene from 11 field strains and 1 French reference strain (Thiveral) isolated at different times in China were amplified and sequenced by RT-PCR, respectively. Amplified fragments located 5' 2485 to 2708 of the E2 major domains B and C and encoded the 75 amino acid residues of the E2 glycoprotein. Of the 12 strains in the study, all products of amplifield were 224 bp of the same size by RT-PCR. Comparing the 12 sequences with the other 9 reference strain sequences reported before using the DNAstar software, it was found that Swine Cholera Virus could be classified into two groups by phylogenetic tree analysis. Brescia, Gpe, Ald, Thiverval, C, CW, HCLV, HCVSM, BJCY1/96, BJTX3/96, BJSY2/96, HeNXH2/98, HeNZZ1/82 and GDGZ1/95 strains were assigned to group A and were 85.7%. 100% for nucleotide sequence and 83.8-100% for amino acid sequence in homology; however, strains HCVF98, HCVF94, HeBHH2/95, LN1/84, SZGM1/85, SCCD1/79 and Alfort were assigned to group B and were 84.3-100% for nucleotide sequence and 85.1-100% for amino acid sequence in homology; and 21 HCV strains were 78.1-100% for nucleotide sequence in homology and 78.4-100% for amino acid sequence. In our study, 99.1% homology for nucleotide sequence and 100% homology for amino acid sequence was found between HCLV strains and C strains reported by Rijn's in the Netherlands. It showed that our sequencing method was reliable. There were obvious differences between the two groups in the sequences of the envelope glycoprotein E2 major gene, particularly in the amino acid substitutions of regions 713 and 729, respectively, and it has been shown that the two groups of HCV domain strains may be genetically altered to some extent.

2201,Prevalence of noroviruses and sapoviruses in pigs of various ages as determined by reverse transcription-PCR and microwell hybridization experiments,"Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses (SaVs) are emerging as enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in humans and animals. Pig genogroup II (GII) NoVs reproduce in pigs, but their pathogenesis has not been defined. The swine strain SaV/GIII/Cowden/80/US causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in swine. Recently, genetically diverse swine NoVs (genotypes 11, 18 and 19 within GII) and SaVs containing at least two genogroups (similar to GIII and GVIa/JJ681) and two unclassified strains (Ga/QW19 and Ga/LL26) have been reported. , defined; however, their prevalence has not been reported. To investigate the prevalence of swine NoVs and SaVs, 621 fecal samples were collected from pigs of various ages from seven pig farms and one slaughterhouse in three states in the United States. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription-PCR and microwell hybridization assays with porcine NoV- and SaV-specific primers and probes, respectively. Pig GII NoVs were detected only from terminating pigs with an overall prevalence of 20%. Pig GIII SaVs were detected in 62% of pigs, with the highest prevalence in postweaning pigs and the lowest prevalence in pigs. Pig GVI?/JJ681-like SaVs and G?/QW19-like SaVs were rarely detected in pigs. G?/LL26-like SaVs were detected mainly in young pigs. Because some porcine NoVs and SaVs are genetically or antigenically related to human strains, and recombinants within NoVs or SaVs occur for human and porcine strains, the high prevalence and subclinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs is comparable to that of pigs for human strains. This raises the question of whether there is a reservoir or not. or for the emergence of new human and porcine recombinants. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology.

2203,Calculation of evolutionary correlation between individual genes and the full-length genome: A useful method for selecting phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology.,"Individual genes or regions are still widely used to predict phylogenetic relationships among viral isolates. Genomic regions that can provide assessments consistent with those predicted by full-length genome sequences are preferred to serve as good candidates of phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiological studies of many viruses. Here, we used a statistical method to evaluate evolutionary relationships between individual viral genes and full-length genomes without tree structure as a way to determine which gene might well match the genome in phylogenetic analyses. This method was performed by calculating linear correlations between genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned genome sequences. We applied this method to phylogenetic analyzes of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were created for comparisons and possible factors affecting method accuracy were also discussed in the calculations. The results revealed that this method can produce results consistent with the results of previous studies on suitable consensus sequences that can be used successfully as phylogenetic markers. And our results also suggested that these evolutionary correlates could provide useful information for identifying genes that could be used effectively to reveal genetic relationships.

2204,Analysis of codon usage preference in hemagglutinin genes of swine influenza A (H1N1) virus,"Background Porcine influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) has come to the fore since 2009 and has been identified as a new reassortant strain. Hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates virus binding, contains antigenic sites recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and is associated with viral cross-species infection and adaptation. The comparative study of codon usage preferences in influenza viral genomes was less extensive. In this study, we used codon usage pattern analyzes to confirm the adaptation and origins of S-OIV. Methods The codon usage model was used to predict host adaptation of S-OIVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene was performed to understand the phylogeny of H1N1 viruses isolated from different hosts. The amino acid signature pattern in the antigenic regions of HA was analyzed to understand the antigenic properties. Results The results of the phylogenetic analyzes of the HA gene show that the S-OIVs are grouped into identical clusters. Synonymous codon usage pattern analyzes show that the number of active codons versus GC content at the third codon position in the HA1 gene is slightly different from that in porcine H1N1 and is gradually adapted to human. Our data show that S-OIV evolution occurs according to positive selection within these antigenic regions. Comparison of antigenic region amino acids reveals similar signature patterns between S-OIV and 1918 human influenza strains. Conclusion This study proposes a new and effective way to better understand the evolutionary processes and features of the S-OIV genome based on the codon usage model. It is useful to monitor influenza viral origins and cross-species virus transmission.",,"Wang, S. F.;Su, M. W.;Tseng, S. P.;Li, M. C.;Tsao, C. H.;Huang, S. W.;Chu, W. C.;Liu, W. T.;Chen, Y. M.

2205,"Different Pathogenic Characteristics of Circulating Coxsackievirus A6 Associated with Emerging Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease","Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is an emerging pathogen associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Its genetic characterization and pathogenic properties are largely unknown. Here we report 39 circulating strains of CV-A6 isolated in 2013 from HFMD patients in northeastern China. Three major CV-A6 clusters were identified and associated with CV-A6, mostly from Shanghai, suggesting that local strains of CV-A6 are responsible for HFMD emerging in northeastern China. Four full-length CV-A6 genomes representing each cluster were sequenced and further analyzed. Bootstrap screening tests showed that all four strains of CV-A6-Changchun were most likely recombinant between the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and the prototype CV-A4 or CV-A4 related viruses, while the recombination pattern was related to but different from the strains. It is isolated from other parts of China. Moreover, different strains of CV-A6 showed different abilities of viral replication, release and pathogenesis in a mouse model. Further analyzes showed that viral protein 2C contributes to the diverse pathogenic abilities of CV-A6 by inducing autophagy and inducing cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report lethal and non-lethal strains of CV-A6 associated with HFMD. The 2C protein region may play a key role in the pathogenicity of CV-A6 strains.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major and persistent threat to infants and children. Besides the most common pathogens such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), other enteroviruses are increasingly contributing to HFMD. This study focused on the recently emerged strain CV-A6. We found that strains of CV-A6 isolated in Changchun City, northeast China, were associated with local origins. These Changchun viruses were novel recombinants of CV-A6 prototype Gdula and CV-A4. Our results imply that measures to control CV-A6 transmission are urgently needed. Further analysis revealed differential pathogenicity in strains isolated in a neonatal mouse model. One possible reason was that viral protein was reduced to 2C using phylogenetic studies, viral sequences, and direct testing on cultured human cells. Therefore, viral 2C protein is a promising target for antiviral drugs to prevent tissue damage caused by CV-A6.",,"Wang, S. H.;Wang, A.;Liu, P. P.;Zhang, W. Y.;Du, J.;Xu, S.;Liu, G. C.;Zheng, B.

2206,Discovery of a highly different coronavirus in an Asian house mouse from China illuminates the origin of alphacoronaviruses,"Although shrews are one of the largest mammalian groups, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses. Between 2013 and 2015, we caught 266 Asian house mice (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, China. Coronavirus (CoV) RNA was detected in 24 Asian house mice with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully obtained from RNA positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into one of four lineages, largely reflecting its geographic origins indicative of allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses, but they were different enough to be considered a new member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which we refer to as Wencheng rat virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV is a highly distinct member of the alphacoronaviruses, and more dramatically, the S gene of WESV fell into a genetically distinct cluster from that of known coronaviruses. The diverse location of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house mice. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to any known virus. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution. contains the pathogen. syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and swine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been suggested that the ultimate ancestors of alphacoronaviruses are likely bat-dwelling viruses. Here we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (Wencheng shrew virus, WESV) sampled from Asian house shrews in China. In particular, WESV is a highly distinct member of the alphacoronaviruses and has a genetically distinct S gene from all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to any known virus. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and long-standing hosts for coronaviruses that deserve additional research and surveillance.",,"Wang, W.;Lin, X. D.;Liao, Y.;Guan, X. Q.;Guo, W.

2207,Evidence of Clade 7.1 Avian Flu Virus (H5N1) in Qinghai Lake,"The highly pathogenic influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has spread to Asia since 2003, reached Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2005, raising global concern for a potential pandemic threat over the past decade. A Clade 2.3.2 H5N1 virus became dominant in the Qinghai Lake area with sporadic cases of mammalian infection in 2009 and was transmitted to Russia and Europe via wild migratory birds. Currently, HPAI H5N1 2.3.4, 2.3.2 and 7 are the dominant H5N1 viruses circulating in Asian poultry. 2.3.2 While the Clade is dominant in wild birds all over the world, there is no clear data about Clade 7 circulation in wild birds. We detected Clade 7.1 HPAI H5N1 virus in Qinghai Lake, which is closely related to Shanxi-like and Vietnam viruses circulating in poultry. This is the first report of Clade 7.1 H5N1 in wild birds. According to phylogenetic analysis, the virus may originate from the Clade 7.1 virus gene pool, which is spread in Vietnamese and Chinese poultry and can spread to Qinghai Lake by migratory birds. Qinghai Lake remains a major hotspot for H5N1 surveillance, as regular outbreaks of wild birds and mammals occur there. Based on these facts and findings, relevant researchers should pay more attention to the Qinghai Lake basin as an important hotspot for H5N1 avian influenza surveillance, as regular H5N1 outbreaks occur in wild birds with sporadic cases of mammalian infection.",,"Wang, W.;Sharshov, K.;Li, Z.;Zheng, S.

2208,Genetic characterization of a novel duck-derived picornavirus with six 2A proteins,"new virus has been detected from diseased ducks and has been fully identified. The virus was shown to have a picornavirus-like genome arrangement. Interestingly, the genome contained up to a total of six 2As, including four 2A (2A1-2A4) each with an NPGP motif, an AIG1-like 2A5, and a parecovirus-like 2A6. The 5-UTR has been predicted to have a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosome entry site (IRES). However, the IIIe subdomain consisted of a 3 nt root and five unpaired bases, unlike those found in all other HP-like IRESs. The virus was most closely associated with duck hepatitis A virus, and amino acid identities were 37.7%, 39% and 43.7% in the P1, P2 and P3 regions, respectively. Based on these studies, together with phylogenetic analyses, the virus can be considered as a founding member of a new genus of picornavirus, which we refer to as 'Aalivirus A' as the type species and provisionally 'Aalivirus'.",,"Wang, X.;Liu, N.;Wang, F.;Ning, K.;Li, Y.;Zhang, D.",2014.0,,10.1099/vir.0.063313-0,0
2209,Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of a strain of type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,"The emergence of type 1 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has recently been noticed in China. In this study, the whole genomic characterization of a strain of type 1 PRRSV (designated GZ11-G1) was described and its pathogenicity for piglets was analyzed. The results show that the 15,094 nt whole genome of GZ11-G1, excluding the poly(A) tails, shares 80.2%-96.3% identity with representative strains of type 1 PRRSV, particularly the highest Type 1 PRRSV live vaccine viruses Amervac PRRS and Amervac PRRS. Homology (96.3%) to SHE, a virus recovered from an infectious clone of the virus. Compared to the vaccinia virus, the non-structural and structural proteins of GZ11-G1 exhibited extensive amino acid variations except for ORF5a. GZ11-G1, Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and type 1 PRRSV strains including Amervac PRRS vaccine virus were clustered by further phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, GZ11-G1 has been shown to cause fever, high viremia, and lung and lymph node lesions in piglets. Our findings indicate that GZ11-G1 is genetically related and pathogenic with type 1 PRRSV strains in the cluster of Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and Amervac PRRS vaccine virus. for piglets.

2210,RNA-Seq analysis of duck embryo fibroblast cell gene expression in the early stage of egg laying syndrome virus infection,"Egg laying syndrome virus (EDSV), a member of the Adenoviridae family and an economically important pathogen with a wide host range, causes marked reduction in egg production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the host-EDSV interaction remains unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to examine dynamic changes in host gene expression in EDSV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) at 6, 12 and 24 h post infection. A total of 441 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after EDSV infection. The Gene Ontology category and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs are associated with multiple biological functions, including signal transduction, host immunity, virus infection, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and pathogenicity, and metabolic process signaling pathways. . We scanned and identified 12 grades for further examination using qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq results were quite consistent. This study analyzed viral infection and host immunity caused by EDSV infection from a new perspective, and the results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying host-EDSV interactions that will be useful for the future development of antiviral drugs or vaccines for poultry, and are therefore of benefit. . the entire poultry industry.",,"Wang, X.

2211,Integrated analysis of microRNA expression and mRNA transcriptome in lungs of avian influenza virus-infected chickens,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks pose a threat to both poultry and humans worldwide. Our previous work suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating the host response to AIV infection in laying hens. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether genetic background plays an important role in miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and whether miRNAs differentially expressed in the layer by AIV infection can be likewise modulated in broilers. Furthermore, by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiling, potential molecular mechanisms of the host response to AIV infection can be further exploited. RESULTS: Total RNA isolated from the lungs of uninfected and low pathogenic H5N3-infected chickens four days after infection was used for both miRNA deep sequencing and mRNA microarray analyses. A total of 2.6 M and 3.3 M filtered high-quality reads were obtained from Solexa GA-I Sequencer infected and uninfected chickens, respectively. A total of 271 miRNAs were identified in miRBase 16.0 and one potential new miRNA was discovered. There were 121 miRNAs differentially expressed at a 5% false discovery rate by Fisher's exact test. More miRNAs were overexpressed in infected lungs (108) than in uninfected lungs (13), which was in contrast to the findings in laying hens. This result suggested that there may be a different regulatory mechanism of the host response to miRNA-mediated AIV infection in broilers. Analysis using the chicken 44K Agilent microarray showed that 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed following AIV infection. RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis combining both miRNA and targeted mRNA gene expression, gga-miR-34a, 122-1, 122-2, 146a, 155, 206, 1719, 1594, 1599 and 451 and MX1, IL-8, IRF -7, TNFRS19 are potent candidate miRNAs or genes involved in the regulation of the host response to AIV infection in the lungs of broiler chickens.

2212,Adelaide River virus nucleoprotein gene: analysis of phylogenetic relationships of ephemeroviruses and other rhabdoviruses.,"The nucleotide sequence of the Adelaide River virus (ARV) genome was determined from the 3' end to the end of the nucleoprotein (N) gene. The 3' leader sequence contains 50 nucleotides and shares a terminal trinucleotide (3' UGC-), a conserved U-rich domain, and an AU-rich variable domain in common with other animal rhabdoviruses. The N gene contains 1355 nucleotides from the transcription start sequence (AACAGG) to the poly(A) sequence [CATG(A)7] and encodes a 429 amino acid polypeptide. The N protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49429 Da and a pl of 5.4 and, like bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) N protein, has a highly acidic C-terminal domain. Analysis of amino acid sequence relationships among all available rhabdovirus N proteins showed that ARV and BEFV are closely related viruses (48.3% similarity) that share higher sequence similarity to vesiculoviruses than to lyssaviruses. Phylogenetic trees based on multiple sequence alignments of all available rhabdovirus N protein sequences showed clustering of viruses according to genome organization, host range, and established taxonomic relationships.",,"Wang, Y.;Cowley, J.

2214,Comprehensive analysis of amino acid sequence diversity in the F protein cleavage site of Newcastle disease virus in fusogenic activity.,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an infectious agent of Newcastle disease in avian species and severely affects the poultry industry. The cleavage site of the viral F protein (Fcs) is a key determinant of membrane fusion and viral virulence. In this study, we investigated the precise effect of variable amino acid sequences of Fcs on fusogenic activity. Based on viral pathogenicity, Fcs sequences of native isolates (n = 1572) are classified as eight types of virulent Fcs (VFcs) with the motif “G/R/KRQ/R/KR/K-Râ†“F” and “G/R/ Ten types of avirulent Fcs (AFcs) with ER/K/QQG/E-Râ†“L” motifs. VFcs are found only in the Class II viral classification cluster and not in Class I. AFcs are found in both Class I and II isolates. VFc and AFc species present temporal distribution and an evolutionary relationship with host species. Using an in vitro fusion test, VFcs-1 “RRQKR”F” and VFcs-2 “RRQRR”F” show the highest efficiency in inducing membrane fusion. The neutral Q residue at the P3 position of VFcs plays a reinforcing role compared to the effect of the R and K basic residues. A single K residue at P3 or P5, along with all basic residues, is less effective in fusogenic activity in VFcs. Moreover, the cleavage activities of F0 proteins with different Fcs motif types do not appear to affect membrane fusion. Our findings provide insight into the effect of amino acid variation of Fcs on NDV-induced fusion.",,"Wang, Y.;Yu, W.;Huo, N.;Wang, W.;Guo, Y.;Wei, Q.;Wang, X.;Zhang, S.;Yang, Z.;Xiao, S.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0183923,0
2215,Full-length and defective enterovirus G genomes with distinct torovirus protease insertions are quite common in a Chinese pig farm.,"Recombination often occurs between enteroviruses (EVs) classified within the same species of the Picornaviridae family. Here we describe the genomes of two recombinant EV-Gs (strains EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014 and EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) found in feces of pigs from a pig farm in China using viral metagenomics. The two strains are characterized by the prominent insertion of a papain-like protease gene from toroviruses classified within the Coronaviridae family. According to recent reports, the torovirus protease insertion site was located in the 2C/3A binding site in EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014. For the other EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014 variant, the inserted protease sequence replaced the entire viral capsid protein region up to the VP1/2A junction. These two EV-G strains were quite common in all animals in the same pig farm, while shedding the full-length genome (EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) and 65% also shed the capsid deletion mutant (EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014).

All of these sequences have the same genomic organization, including open reading frames (ORFs) 1, 2, and 3, although their genomic sequences are variable. Some have suggested that they be classified as the new Hepeviridae family, which would be divided into different genera and species based on their sequence variability. The size of these virus particles was generally between 27 and 34 nm. However, HEV virions produced in cell culture are different in structure from viruses found in feces. Those from cell culture have a lipid envelope and some ORF3 on their surface, while viruses isolated from feces lack the lipid envelope and ORF3.

2220,Antigenic analysis of co-circulating highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 sublineages in Egypt.,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has spread to Eurasia and Africa, and outbreaks are now endemic in many countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. The continued circulation of H5N1 virus in Egypt from a single infected source led to significant genetic variation with phylogenetically separable sublineages, providing an opportunity to examine the impact of genetic evolution on viral phenotypic variation. In this study, we analyzed the phylogeny of H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes in influenza viruses isolated from 2006 to 2011 in Egypt and investigated the effect of conserved amino acid mutations in HA genes in each sublineage on their antigenicity. The analysis showed that viruses still persist in at least four sub-lineages in poultry in Egypt as of 2011. Using reverse genetics to generate HA reclassification viruses with specific HA mutations, we found antigenic drift in HA in two influenza virus sublineages. Other influenza virus sublines currently circulating together in Egypt. Also, two sublineages with significant antigenic shift were antigenically distinguishable. Our findings indicated that phylogenetically distinct H5N1 viruses that were not antigenically cross-reactive circulated together in Egypt and there was a problem in using a single strain of influenza virus as the seed virus to produce influenza virus vaccine in Egypt and providing data.

2224,"Evaluation of serum virome in calves persistently infected with pestivirus A, with or without mucosal disease.","Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1, reclassified as Pestivirus A, causes an economically important cattle disease that is prevalent worldwide. Pestivirus A can cause persistent infection as calves secrete the virus throughout their lives and spread the infection to the herd. Most persistently infected (PI) calves die within the first 2 years of life from mucosal disease (MD) or secondary infections, possibly as a result of virus-induced immune depression. Here, (i) clinically significant MD (n = 8); (ii) PI calves without signs of MD (n = 8); and (iii) control, Pestivirus A-free calves (n = 8). All groups were collected at the same time and from the same flock. Serum samples from calves in each group were pooled, submitted to viral RNA/DNA enrichment and sequenced with HTS. Viral genomes of Pestivirus A, Ungulate erythroparvovirus 1, bosavirus (BosV) and hypothetical circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses were identified. Specific real-time PCR experiments were developed to determine the frequency of occurrence of such viruses in each of the groups. The absolute number of different viral genomes detected in both groups of PI calves was higher than in the control group, as revealed by more reads, contigs and genomes representing a wider range of taxa. Genomes representing members of the Parvoviridae family, such as U. erythroparvovirus 1 and BosV, were most frequently detected in all three groups of calves. We found two previously unreported Hypothetical single-stranded DNA genomes co-clustered with CRESS-DNA viruses in PI calves affected by MD only. These findings suggest that the viral genomes most frequently detected in bovine serum are parvoviruses; Since clinically normal or MD-affected/unaffected PI calves are infected with U. erythroparvovirus 1 genome loads similar to those of PI calves, the frequency of detection does not statistically correlate with the status of calves with respect to Pestivirus A infection.

2225,First Evidence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Infection in Wild Boars,"Background: Wild boar farming is booming due to the interest in this exotic meat for human consumption. Such a development may pose an increased risk of disease transmission between pigs and pets. The wild boar population has increased in South America in recent years due to the absence of predators causing direct damage to crops and economic losses due to the risk of disease transmission. The genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae consists of four species recognized by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): classical swine fever virus (CSFV), borderline disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV- 2nd). Other putative strains cited as atypical pestiviruses have been reported as 'HoBi'-like virus, giraffe pestivirus, Bungowannah pestivirus, Pronghorn antelope virus, atypical swine pestivirus (APPV), Norwegian rat pestivirus (NrPV) and Rhinolophus affinis bat pestivirus (RaPestV-1). . ). CSFV is commonly detected in wild boars, but despite positive serology, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has never been detected in this animal species. Thus, the present communication describes the first detection of BVDV in the lungs of captive pigs using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. Materials, Methods, and Results: Forty lung samples were collected from wild boars reared after slaughter in a commercial slaughterhouse. The organs were individually crushed, centrifuged and the supernatant stored for further analysis. Total RNA was isolated using a phenol-based protocol and the RT-PCR protocol was performed, amplifying the 118 bp 5' untranslated region (5' UTR). One out of 40 samples gave a positive result. The positive sample had the 5' UTR and partial fragments of the N-terminal autoprotease (N-pro) sequenced and analyzed. The LV Java/ 2012 strain presented 99% identity in the 5' UTR and 98% in the N-pro region with a BVDV-2 previously reported in cattle from Southern Brazil. In both the 5' UTR and Npro phylogenetic analysis, strain LV Java/ 2015 clustered with strains BVDV-2 and is most closely related to subtype 2b identified in cattle in the Southern Brazilian grouping at the same terminal node. Discussion: Wild boars are commonly associated with pathogen transmission to domestic animals. This animal species is considered a reservoir of the pestivirus CSFV and key keys in CSFV control and eradication programs in Europe. Although the indirect presence of BVDV in wild boars has been reported by serology testing, direct detection of the viral agent has never been reported. The present study demonstrated the presence of BVDV-2 genomic segments obtained by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing in captive wild boars. Reported data suggest a possible importance of this animal species in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses that may interfere with control and eradication programs of these important pathogens for cattle worldwide. The LV Java/ 2012 strain was closely related to BVDV-2b and presented the highest identity with a strain detected in cattle from Southern Brazil. These data suggest that wild boars and cattle may share this pathogen due to the similarity of the strains, and both have been reported in the same region. This may lead to the need for wild boars to be included in BVDV control programs, as pigs can roam between different regions and carry this pathogen to different cattle herds. This study reported the first molecular evidence of BVDV in wild boars in the literature. The data generated here suggest a possible importance of pigs in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses.",,"Weber, M. N.;Pino, E. H. M.;Souza, C. K.;Mosena, A. C. S.;Sato, J. P.

Phylogenetic analysis groups influenza viruses in wild waterfowl into two distinct superfamilies, one in the Americas and the other in Eurasia.

2227,Pan genome of Lactobacillus reuteri strains originating from porcine gastrointestinal tract.,"BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus reuteri is an intestinal symbiont of a wide variety of vertebrate species that diversifies into distinct phylogenetic branches that are largely host-specific. Previous work demonstrated host specificity in mice and set out to identify mechanisms by which intestinal colonization and host restriction are achieved. However, it is unknown how L. reuteri strains colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of pigs. RESULTS: To gain insight into the ecology of L. reuteri in the pig gut, the genome sequence of the porcine small intestine isolate L. reuteri ATCC 53608 was completed and consisted of a chromosome of 1.94 Mbp and two plasmids of 138.5 kbp and 9.09 kbp. , respectively. We also generated draft genomes of four additional strains of L. reuteri isolated from porcine feces or lower GI tract, lp167-67, pg-3b, 20-2 and 3c6, and subjected all five genomes to a comparative genomic analysis with previous ones. Complete genome of strain I5007. A phylogenetic analysis based on whole genomes showed that the porcine L. reuteri strains were separated into two distinct clades, as previously suggested by multilocus sequence analysis. These six porcine L. reuteri genomes contained a core set of 1364 orthologous gene clusters, contributing to a total of 3373 gene clusters, as determined by OrthoMCL analysis. Genome comparisons of six porcine L. reuteri strains and 14 L. reuteri strains from other host origins yielded a total pan-genome of 5225 gene clusters, containing a core genome of 851 gene clusters, but not each pig-specific gene. se. However, genes specific to and conserved between strains of the two porcine phylogenetic lineages were detected; some of these encoded cell surface proteins that may contribute to the diversification of the two lineages and their observed host specificity. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the phylogenetic analysis of L. reuteri strains genome-wide, pointing to different evolutionary trajectories of porcine L. reuteri lineages, and providing new insights into the genomic events that occurred during their specialization in L. reuteri. homeowner.

2228,Genetic dynamic analysis of the influenza A H5N1 NS1 gene in China,"Direct precursors and reassortants of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GS/GD) virus strain were identified geographically and ecologically. To investigate the variation and evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 viruses, whole genome viral sequences (n = 164) were obtained from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. Here, we present phylogenetic evidence for subtype reclassifications among H5N1 viruses isolated from China between 1996 and 2012. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, we identified four main groups and further divided reassortant viruses into three subgroups. Putative mosaic structures were most commonly found in viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes, and 91.0% (10/11) mosaics were obtained from terrestrial birds. Sequence variability and selection pressure analyzes revealed that both surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) have higher dN/dS ratio and variability than other internal proteins. We also identified 47 positively selected regions in genomic segments except for the PB2 and M1 genes. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are considered highly variable due to host immune pressure, but what drives NS1 variability is unknown. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic variation and selective pressure of the NS1 protein (462 existing NS1 sequences). We found that most of the positively selected regions and variable amino acids are located in the C-terminal effector domain (ED) of NS1. In addition, we focused on NS1-RNA and NS1-protein interactions involved in viral replication mechanisms and host immune response. Transcriptomic analysis of H5N1-infected monkey lungs showed that certain PI3K-related genes were up-regulated.",,"Wei, K.;Chen, Y.;Lin, Y.;Pan, Y.",2014.0,,,0
2229,Global genetic variation and transmission dynamics of the H9N2 avian influenza virus,"H9N2 influenza viruses circulate widely in the poultry population and variable genotypes can be generated by mutation, recombination and reclassification; they may be better adapted to infect a new host, resist drug therapy, or escape immune suppression. LPAI H9N2 viruses have the potential to evolve to high virulence levels in humans. Some studies on regional spread have been reported, but global spread and the drivers of the virus are poorly understood, particularly at the genome scale. Here, we analyzed all eight gene segments of randomly sampled 168 H9N2 genomes, aiming to provide a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and genetic variation of viruses, and used phylogeographic and spatial epidemiology approaches to reveal the effects of genetic variation, predictors. and the spread of H9N2 viruses. We found that more frequent reassortment events included PA, NP, and NS segments, and 21 isolates had possible mosaicism resulting from recombination events. Estimates of gene-specific global dN/dS ratios indicated that all genes were subject to purifying selection. However, a total of 13 regions under positive selection were detected by at least two of the three methods contained within the HA, NA, M2, NS1 and PA segments. In addition, we conclude that the NA segment has the highest rate of nucleotide substitution and the tMRCA estimate is the youngest from the inference of the remaining segments. Regarding spatial history, human airborne transport was identified as the dominant driver of global viral migration using GLM analysis, and economic factors and geographic distance were modest predictors. Higher migration rates (>0.01) were predicted between the five region pairs, indicating frequent migration of viruses between separate geographic locations. Furthermore, our Markov jump analysis showed that viral migration was more frequent between Southern China and Northern China, and a high rate of gene flow was observed between the Americas and East Asia. Moreover, the Americas, along with Southeast Asia, acted as the main centers of global transmission, forming the trunk of the evolutionary tree. These findings revealed a complex interplay between virus evolution, epidemiology and human behavior.",,"Wei, K.;Li, Y.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12733,0
2230,Re-emergence of a genotype VIII virulent Newcastle disease virus isolated from Chinese gamebirds 13Â years later,"The circulation of the dominant genotypes VI and VII of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is causing significant economic losses to the poultry industry in China. However, reports of Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks caused by genotype VIII strains of NDV are rare. In this study, a virulent genotype VIII strain of NDV, designated GXGB2011, was isolated from a herd of vaccinated game chickens showing clinical signs of infection in Pinxiang county, Guangxi province, China. The entire genome of the isolate was completely sequenced and found to consist of 15,192 nucleotides (nt) coding for six structural proteins in the order 3â€²-NP-PMF-HN-L-5â€². The cleavage site 112RRQKRâ†“F117 model in the fusion (F) protein and an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) value of 1.5 indicated that strain GXGB2011 is a velogenic NDV. Results of the challenge experiment with 5-week-old SPF chickens showed that the strain was highly pathogenic with 100% morbidity and mortality in threatened birds. Based on virus detection in different organs of infected birds, the highest viral load was observed in the tonsils of the cecum and the viral levels in the immune organs were higher than in the respiratory organs. Bayesian reconstruction of whole genomes based on the sequences of 66 NDV reference strains showed that the strain belonged to genotype VIII of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain was more closely related to foreign strains gamefowl/US(CA)/24225/98, 1ITTY94060 and IT-147/94 rather than the first domestic strains of genotype VIII that emerged in 1979 in Qinghai, China. €“1985.

2231,Genetic and pathobiological characterization of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses from a naturally infected pig herd.,"Since its initial identification in Mexico and the United States, concerns have been expressed that the new H1N1 influenza virus could cause a pandemic of comparable severity to the 1918 pandemic. In late April 2009, viruses phylogenetically related to the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were isolated from an outbreak in a pig farm in Canada. This outbreak also had epidemiological links to a suspected human case. Experimental infections in pigs using one of the swine isolates and the human isolate A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 in this outbreak showed differences in virus recovery from the lower respiratory tract. While virus was consistently isolated from the lungs of pigs infected with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009, only one pig infected with A/swine/Alberta/OTH-33-8/2008 gave live virus from the lung despite comparable amounts of viral infection. RNA and antigen in both groups of pigs. The clinical disease was somewhat similar to other influenza virus infections in pigs, with prolonged virus antigen detection and delayed viral-RNA clearance from the lungs. There was also considerable genotypic variability among viruses isolated from farm pigs. This, together with the somewhat erratic pathobiological features observed in experimentally infected animals, suggests that, despite the swine origin of the virus, significant viral evolution may still be ongoing.

2234,Investigation of potential causes for the development of pig ear necrosis: different study designs-comparable results? German,"In recent years, two studies have been conducted at the Swine Clinic of the Vienna University of Veterinary Medicine to investigate the etiology of pig ear necrosis. In Study 1, the parameters discussed in this context were collected by veterinarians by completing specially designed questionnaires on farms with symptoms of swine ear necrosis syndrome. In Study 2, piglets and feed samples were collected for laboratory analysis of the most important infectious agents as well as mycotoxins. In this paper, the results of both projects are compared. Even if the selection criteria for both studies were different, the age class affected was comparable (5.5 to ten weeks of survival in study 1 and six to ten weeks of survival in study 2). The herd-specific prevalence of pig ear necrosis syndrome ranged significantly from 2 to 10, 100% to percentages, respectively. Evaluation of the questionnaires in Study 1 showed that 51% of the farms had problems with cannibalism. Particles of plant material frequently seen on the histological slides of Study 2 may have entered the tissue through chewing the pen pals' ears or by cannibalism. While in study 1 the negative impact of parameters such as high pig density, insufficient climate, missing enrichment material and poor feed and water quality was considered, in study 2 all these factors were controlled in sample collection and ignored as precursors of cannibalism. In both studies, bacterial agents proved to be a crucial co-factor for the spread of necrosis into deeper tissue layers, while viral pathogens were classified as less important. In both projects, it was not possible to predict the direct action of infectious agents and mycotoxins as direct triggers of necrosis, as well as their involvement as co-factors or precursors in the sense of an immunosuppression or previous blood vessel or tissue damage.",,"Weissenbacher-Lang, C.;Voglmayr, T.;Weissenbock, H.;Pyrek, R.;Waxenecker, F.;Hofstetter, U.;Hoelzle, K.;Hoelzle, L.

The viruses were isolated from Malaysia and various parts of Japan over a 30-year period. Based on available published sequence data, oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR were designed and sequences determined. Our findings showed 100% amino acid homology, despite differences in nucleotide sequences in the nsP1 region. On the other hand, in the capsid region, the nucleotide differences caused a large difference in the amino acid sequence. Therefore, the difference in capsid region is one of the useful markers in genetic classification between strains of Sagiyama virus and Getah virus and may be responsible for the serological difference in complement fixation test. Genomic differences between Getah virus strains are due to time factor rather than geographic distribution.",,"Wekesa, S. N.;Inoshima, Y.;Murakami, K.;Sentsui, H.",2001.0,2008-11-01 00:00:00,,0
2236,"Purification, morphology and partial characterization of a reovirus-like agent associated with neonatal calf diarrhea","Recently, studies have been carried out on a virus thought to be the etiological agent in widely disseminated cases of calf diarrhea. The virus was isolated from the feces and intestinal mucosa of experimentally infected calves and from cell cultures inoculated with material from infected calves. The virus was purified by differential centrifugation, nuclease treatment, extraction with a gradient of Genetron 113 and cesium chloride (CsC1). Purified and unpurified samples were examined by electron microscopy. Both types of preparations contained non-enveloped particles approximately 64 nm in diameter with a hexagonal core region of 36 nm in diameter. It was observed that the subunits of the capsids were arranged according to cubic symmetry. Essential lipids were not associated with the virus. The supernatant density of the purified virus was 1,359. Viral nucleic acid was determined as ribonucleic acid (RNA) by chemical methods.

2237,Avipoxviruses: biology of infection and their use as vaccine vectors,"Avipoxviruses (APVs) belong to the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae of the family Poxviridae. APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, domestic and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods, and are often named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. The virus strain Fowlpox virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is generally low, but in stressed flocks (other diseases, high production) mortality can be up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection (no production of progeny viruses) in mammalian cells and their ability to host multiple gene insertions are some of the features that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells likely represents a major vaccine biosafety advantage, the molecular mechanisms that limit APVs to specific hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes current knowledge of APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnosis, and disease, and further highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors.

2238,Species and strains: essential roles in understanding protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Protein misfolding and aggregation is an important event in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with neurodegeneration. Factors that initiate protein misfolding and the role of protein aggregation in disease pathophysiology pose major challenges for the neuroscience community. Interestingly, although accumulation of the same misfolded protein, eg α-synuclein, can be detected in all idiopathic PD patients, the disease spectrum encompasses a variety of different clinical presentations and disease course. In a more recent attempt, this clinical variance is explained by different protein aggregate conformations, similar to prion diseases. In prion diseases, different prion types have been associated with a course of dementia and ataxic disease in Creutzfeldt-Jakob patients, showing a relationship between protein aggregate conformation characteristics and clinical disease course. This principle is currently being transferred to AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases by protein aggregation. However, differences in protein aggregate conformation are often treated as disease strains. The term ""strain"" also derives from prion research and was developed by adopting viral nomenclature when it is assumed that infectious spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs; later referred to as prion diseases) are caused by a virus. The problem is that in virus taxonomy the term ""type"" refers to the characteristics of the disease agent itself, and the term ""strain"" refers to host-related factors that interact with the disease agent and can moderately alter the clinical presentation of disease. Strain factors can only be discovered after the agent has been transmitted and transmitted to a number of different species. Misuse of terminology confuses disease agent and host factors and hinders understanding of the pathophysiology of protein aggregation-related neurodegenerative diseases. This review article reviews the inventions that explain how the terms ""type"" and ""strain"" for non-conventional disease agents arose. This may help avoid confusion in the terminology of protein aggregation diseases and accurately reflect the influence of protein aggregation conformation as well as the impact of host factor contribution on different clinical variations of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",,"Wemheuer, W.

2239,Comments on Duck circovirus (DuCV) genotype definition,"standardized methodology was used to identify genotypes based on pairwise sequence comparisons (PASC). PASC is a widely accepted method in virus taxonomy based on the histogram of binary differences between sequences. Recently, Zhang et al. (2013) concluded that the mean p-distance of duck circovirus (DuCV) between genotypes 1 and 2 was 0.170, and the subtype distance thresholds were 0.032 in DuCV-1 and 0.018 in DuCV-2, respectively. However, there may be some concerns in applying the methodology to identify the genotype of DuCV. Taking into account the aforementioned concerns, our authors performed PASC analyzes of 54 capsid genes (ORF2) and Zhang et al. (2013).

2241,Detection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) from pig livers in southeastern Germany and high sequence homology to human HEV isolates,"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been identified as an emerging cause of infectious hepatitis in developed countries in recent years. In contrast to travel-associated hepatitis E, zoonotic sources of infection are suspected for autochthonous cases in Europe. Objective: Since pigs are known reservoirs of HEV, we tested pig livers sold as food in Southeast Germany for the presence of hepatitis E virus RNA. Study design: We purchased 200 pork liver samples from 81 butchers and grocers in Regensburg, Germany. Nucleic acid preparations were tested for the presence of HEV RNA by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). HEV isolates from positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the ORF1 and ORF2 regions in the HEV genome and by phylogenetic analysis. Results: Samples from eight (4%) of 200 purchased pig livers had detectable amounts of HEV RNA. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis allowed the two new isolates to be classified as HEV genotype 3, subgenotype 3a (swR437) and 3c (swR269), respectively. Both novel porcine HEV isolates showed high sequence homology to isolates from patients with acute HEV infection from the same geographic region. Conclusions: These results support the proposed role of undercooked pork products in food as a source of zoonotic HEV infection for humans. Whether this transmission mechanism is responsible for the surprisingly high prevalence of anti-HEV IgG recently observed in some European countries and the USA remains to be clarified. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Wenzel, J.

2242,Schmallenberg Virus: A New Virus of Veterinary Importance,"In late 2011, non-specific clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and decreased milk production were observed in dairy cattle in the Dutch/German border region. After excluding classical endemic and emerging viruses by targeted diagnostic systems, blood samples from acutely diseased cows were subjected to metagenomic analysis. An insect-transmitted orthobunya virus of the Simbu serogroup was identified as the causative agent and named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). It was one of the first detections of the introduction of a new virus of veterinary importance to Europe using the new technology of next-generation sequencing. The virus was then isolated from the same samples used for metagenomic analysis in insect and mammalian cell lines, and disease symptoms were reproduced in calves experimentally infected with both this virus grown in culture and blood samples from diseased cattle. Since its emergence, SBV has spread very rapidly throughout the European ruminant population, causing mild nonspecific disease in adult animals, but also severe fetal malformation when naive mothers are infected at a critical stage of pregnancy, such as preterm birth or stillbirth. In the following years, SBV was regularly recirculated to a greater extent; During the 2014 and 2016 vector seasons, the virus was repeatedly detected in the blood of adult ruminants, and a number of malformed calves and lambs were born in the following winter and spring months. The genome of viruses found in viremic adult animals showed a very high sequence stability; In sequences created between 2012 and 2016, only a few amino acid substitutions could be detected compared to the first SBV isolate. In contrast, a high sequence variability was identified in the amino-terminal portion of the glycoprotein Gc-coding region of viruses found in the brain of malformed neonates. This mutation hotspot is independent of the region or host species from which the samples originate and is potentially involved in immune evasion mechanisms.",,"Wernike, K.;Beer, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/bs.aivir.2017.07.001,0

In 2006, a highly pathogenic strain of PRRSV NA (HP-PRRSV), characterized by high fever as well as high morbidity and mortality, emerged on pig farms in China. Therefore, a HP-PRRSV-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was developed and combined with type 1- and type 2-specific RT-qPCR systems. Moreover, an internal control based on a heterologous RNA has been successfully introduced. This final multiplex PRRSV RT-qPCR had a high diagnostic sensitivity of less than 200 copies per µl for type 1-assay and 20 copies per µl for type 2- and HP assays, detecting and typing PRRSV. A panel of reference strains and field isolates were reliably identified, and samples from an animal trial with a Chinese HP-PRRS strain were used for test validation.

Contiguous trees of the F and M protein sequences showed that Paramyxoviridae was divided into two conventionally recognized subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Within the Paramyxovirinae, the results also showed groups corresponding to the three currently recognized genera: Respirovirus, Morbillivirus and Rubulavirus. Relationships between the three genera of Paramyxovirinae were resolved by the M protein sequences and there was substantial bootstrapping support (100%) showing that members of the Respirovirus genus and Morbillivirus genus are more closely related to each other than the Rubulavirus genus. . Both the F and M phylogenies showed that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was more closely related to the Rubulavirus genus than the other two genera, but was consistent with the suggestion (BS Seal et al., 2000, Virus Res. 66, 1-11). ) classification of NDV as a separate genus within Paramyxovirinae.

Fecal material from the diseased bird was collected before and after treatment. For RNA sequencing, the extracted RNA/DNA was subjected to DNase and the remaining RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and subjected to multiple displacement amplification before sequencing. RESULTS: No significant alignment was obtained for any known avian virus sequences from any faecal sample. However, significant BLAST alignments were obtained in the five bacteriophages known to infect enterobacteria. There was strong evidence for the presence of Escherichia coli bacteriophage Escherichia phage TL-2011b, a bacteriophage known to cause outbreaks of foodborne illness in humans, but in the sample from the non-diseased pool. Differences in E. coli community structure between the diseased bird and the non-infected pond were also evident.

Objectives: To gain insight into the zoonotic potential of IDV for adults with occupational exposure to cattle in north central Florida. Study: A cross-sectional serological study was performed on human serum samples from 35 cattle-exposed and 11 cattle-exposed adults to screen for IDV antibodies using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) tests. Results: Seroprevalence was determined 91% by HI test and 97% by MN test in individuals working with cattle in Florida. Among individuals not exposed to cattle, seropositivity as determined by the MN test (only) was lower (18%).

2250,Characterization of Unknown Orthobunya-Like Viruses from India,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of agents causing idiopathic human diseases has been crucial in the identification of novel viruses. This study describes the isolation and characterization of two novel orthobunyaviruses from a jungle myna and a rice bird from Karnataka State, India. Using an NGS approach, these isolates were classified as Cat Que and Balagodu viruses belonging to the Manzanilla clade of the Simbu serogroup. Closely related viruses in the Manzanilla lineage have been isolated from mosquitoes, humans, birds and pigs over a wide geographical area. Because orthobunyaviruses exhibit a high frequency of reclassification and can cause acute, self-limited febrile illness, these data suggest that human and livestock infections of Oya/Cat Que/Manzanilla virus may be more common and/or underreported than expected. Therefore, it becomes imperative to identify new and unknown viruses to understand their role in human and animal pathogenesis. The current work is a step forward in this regard and will serve as a prototype method for the isolation, identification and detection of several other emerging viruses.",,"Whitmer, S. L.

2251,"Prevalence of Antibodies to Hepatitis E Virus Among Ostensibly Healthy Humans and Pigs in Bali, Indonesia: Identification of a Pig Infected with a Genotype 4 Hepatitis E Virus","In Indonesia, where hepatitis E virus (HEV) is believed to be highly endemic, only three outbreaks of HEV transmission have been documented to date in restricted areas (West Kalimantan and East Java). A total of 1,115 serum samples collected from apparently healthy individuals in 1996 in Bali, Lombok and Surabaya in Indonesia, where epidemic HEV transmissions have never been reported, were tested for IgG class antibodies (anti-HEV) to HEV. In Bali, anti-HEV was detected in 20% (54/276) of the population tested, with notable contrast to 4% (17/446) in Lombok and 0.5% (2/393) in Surabaya. detected. On the other hand, antibodies to hepatitis A virus were quite common in all three regions (95% in Bali, 90% in Lombok and 89% in Surabaya). Although the majority of the population in Indonesia is Muslim, Balinese people are mostly Hindu and have a habit of consuming pork. Therefore, serum samples were obtained from 99 farm pigs in Bali and tested for anti-HEV and HEV RNA. Serum from 71 pigs (72%) was positive for anti-HEV, and a 2-month-old pig had detectable HEV RNA. The porcine HEV isolate from viremic pig was named SB66-Bali. The SB66-Bali isolate was most closely related to genotype 4 isolates from China, India, Japan, and Taiwan, but shared only 82.6-90.0% identity at common 241-412 nucleotides in open reading frame 2 (ORF2). These results suggest that a possibly indigenous HEV strain(s) is circulating in Bali, Indonesia, and that zoonotic HEV infection can occur even in developing countries. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Wibawa, I.

2252,Matrix gene of influenza A viruses isolated from wild waterfowl: Ecology and emergence of influenza A viruses.,"Wild waterfowl are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses, but little is known about the viruses' gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by performing a phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated during >18 years of surveillance from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay area and ducks in Alberta, Canada. We included 61 published M genes isolated from various hosts in our analysis. We show that the M genes of the Canadian duck viruses and the M genes of the shorebird and gull viruses of the Delaware Bay share ancestry with the M genes of the North American poultry viruses. We found that bird-like lineages in North America and Eurasia split into sublineages, suggesting that multiple branches of virus evolution may be conserved in wild waterfowl. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that the M genes of gulls do not preferentially fuse with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two wings. The reclassification of Shorebird M and HA genes was clear, but there was no correlation between HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable M gene lineages.",,"Widjaja, L.;Krauss, S. L.;Webby, R. J.;Xie, T.;Webster, R.

2253,A new subset of genotypes emerging within PCV-2b dominates the PMWS episode in Switzerland.,"Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is among the most important swine diseases emerging worldwide. Initially, the insidious nature of the disease made it difficult to detect the pathogen. The presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in all animals with PMWS has led to its recognition as the causative agent of PMWS, possibly with an unknown factor. In addition, the presence of PCV2 in healthy individuals did not facilitate the understanding of the disease. Phylogenetic classification divides PCV2 viruses into at least two main groups. With the aid of a signature motif, a short amino acid motif encoded in the capsid protein, viruses are determined to belong to PCV-2a or PCV-2b. Recently, this classification has received more attention as it identifies PCV-2b as more lethal. However, this simplification could not be verified experimentally. Therefore, we investigated whether virus genetic drift was an initiator for the PMWS epizooty in Switzerland. From 1973 to 2005, piglet lymphoid tissues were investigated by histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and PCR. For genotype classification, a 137 bp sequence amplification covering the signature motif was used. The onset of the Swiss PMWS epizootic exhibited a marked shift to PCV-2b, and one genotype subset in particular, in PMWS diseased and subclinically infected piglets. Complementing these observations, healthy piglets identified as negative by IHC are positive in the PCR reaction and do not contain any PCV-2b virus at the time of the episode. In conclusion, our data support PCV2 genome plasticity as an important contributing factor for PMWS disease manifestation. Â© 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Wiederkehr, D.

2255,Molecular detection and characterization of picobirnaviruses in piglets with diarrhea in Thailand.,"Picobirnavirus (PBV) is a small, bi-segmented, double-stranded RNA virus. Taxonomically, the genus Picobirnavirus belongs to the family Picobirnaviridae. PBV infects a wide variety of hosts and causes opportunistic infections, but its role in diarrheal disease remains unclear. To determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of swine PBVs in northern Thailand, 380 fecal samples collected from diarrheal and nondiarrheal piglets reared on 22 pig farms were tested for the presence of PBV. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using primer sets specific to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. PBV was detected in 86 of 265 (32.5%) piglets with diarrhea and in 26 (22.6%) of 115 piglets without diarrhea. All PBV strains detected in this study belonged to genogroup I, and highly PBV-positive piglets were co-infected with group A rotavirus (RVA) and bocavirus (BoV). Phylogenetic analysis of representative genogroup I strains revealed extremely high similarity between strains; they formed a monophyletic cluster with 97-100% sequence identity in the RdRp gene. The strains were also closely related to the genogroup I PBV Chinese pig strain. The findings show that PPV infection is common in piglets with and without diarrhea in northern Thailand.",,"Wilburn, L.;Yodmeeklin, A.;Kochjan, P.;Saikruang, W.;Kumthip, K.;Khamrin, P.;Maneekarn, N.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-016-3190-3,0
2256,Influenza-A viruses in ducks from northwest Minnesota: Fine-scale spatial and temporal variation in prevalence and subtype diversity.,"Waterfowl from northwest Minnesota were sampled by cloaca swab for Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) from July to October in 2007 and 2008. AIV was detected in 222 (9.1%) of 2,441 ducks in 2007 and in 438 (17.9%) of 2,452 ducks in 2007. 2008. AIV prevalence peaked in late summer. We identified 27 AIV subtypes in 2007 and 31 in 2008. Ten hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were identified each year (ie, H1, 3-8, and 10-12 in 2007; H1-8, 10, and 11 in 2008). All neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were detected in each year of the study. Subtype diversity varies between years and increases with prevalence until September. Dominant subtypes in 2007 (containing ~5% of subtype diversity) included H1N1, H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H7N3, H10N7, and H11N9. Dominant subtypes in 2008 included H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H4N8, H6N1, and H10N7. In addition, within each HA subtype, the same dominant HA/NA subtype combinations were detected each year and included H1N1, H3N8, H4N6, H5N2, H6N1, H7N3, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N9. H2N3 and H12N5 viruses also predominated within the H2 and H12 subtypes, respectively, but were detected only within a single year (H2 and H12 viruses were not detected in 2007 and 2008, respectively). The dominant strain sampled was mallards (63.7% of total) and 531 AIVs from this strain were isolated (80.5% of total isolates). Mallard data collected in both years adequately described the temporal and spatial prevalence observed from the total sample and also adequately represented subtype diversity. Juvenile mallards were adequate in describing subtype diversity as well as temporal and spatial prevalence of AIV.",,"Wilcox, B. R.;Knutsen, G.

2258,Virus-virus interactions and host ecology are associated with RNA virome structure in wild birds.,"Little is known about the factors that shape the ecology of RNA viruses in nature. Wild birds are an important case here, because other than influenza A virus, bird specimens are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics""), we have revealed viral diversity found in Australian wild birds through the lens of ecological factors that can determine virome structure and abundance. Meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly identified species. Viruses identified included a previously described gammakoronavirus and influenza A viruses. We also identified new virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae. We noted differences in virome structure reflecting key differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked Avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from the arid interior of Australia had the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and daredevil ducks (Anas spp.), viral abundance and diversity in hosts positive for influenza A infection was higher and similar compared to those negative for this virus, despite the collection of specimens on it. on the same day and from the same place. This study highlights the scope and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds and lays the foundation for understanding the factors that determine virome structure in wild populations.",,"Wille, M.;Eden, J.

2260,Viral Diversity of House Mice in New York,"The microbiome of wild Mus musculus (house mouse), a globally invasive pest found in close contact with humans in urban centers, remains largely unexplored. Here we report the analysis of fecal virus of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected over a 1-year period at seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. Neutral high-throughput sequencing of faeces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 new viruses and 3 new genera. A representative scan of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in the liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with various viruses associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found neither genetic footprints of known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. IMPORTANT Mice carry a wide variety of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to people in the built environment is therefore a public health concern. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in multiple locations in New York City over a 1-year period, we found a diverse collection of viruses, some of which had not been previously associated with house mice and included others that appeared novel. Although we did not find any known human pathogens, our findings provide insight into viral ecology and may provide models with utility for clinical microbiology.",,"Williams, S. H.;Che, X.

The conference was accompanied by a workshop, ""Virus Removal through Virus Spike Preparations and Filtration: New Trends and Developments"". Presentations and discussions at the workshop are summarized in a separate report, which will also be published in this issue of the journal. As with previous conferences in this series, the PDA Virus and TSE Safety Forum 2013 again provided an excellent opportunity to exchange information and views among industry, research organizations and regulatory bodies. Updates on regulatory considerations regarding virus and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) safety of biopharmaceuticals have been provided by the agencies of the European Union (EU), United States (US), and Singapore. The epidemiology and detection methods of emerging pathogens such as hepatitis E virus and parvovirus (PARV 4) are exemplified, and the risk of contamination of animal-derived raw materials, especially trypsin, is taken into account. The benefit of using new array-based virus detection methods was discussed. Cases of bioreactor contaminations in the past have drawn attention to root cause investigations and preventive actions, illustrated by a few examples. Virus removal data of certain unit operations provided; The discussion focused on the virus clearance mechanism and the strategic concept of viral clearance integration. As in previous years, the virus safety section was followed by a TSE section covering the latest scientific findings that could affect the risk assessment of blood and cell substrates. These included the understanding that cross-species transmission of TSE by blood components in sheep was greater than predicted by assays in transgenic mice. In addition, the pathogenesis of cell substrates and the possibility of productive TSE infection were considered, and cell-based assays that may be suitable for use in TSE clearance studies are discussed.

2262,"Internet-accessible sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and outcome service: A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial.","Background: Testing for sexually transmitted infections (e-STIs), which is accessed online, is becoming more and more available as an alternative to testing in clinics. Typically, this testing method allows users to order a test kit from a virtual service (via a website or app), collect their own samples, return test samples to a laboratory, and be notified of results via text message service (SMS) or phone. . e-STI testing is assumed to increase access to testing compared to in-person services, but the evidence is not clear. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an e-STI test and outcome service (chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis) on STI test uptake and diagnosed STI cases. Methods and findings: The study was conducted in the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Between November 24, 2014 and August 31, 2015, we recruited 2,072 participants aged 16-30, residing in these districts, having at least 1 sexual partner in the last 12 months, willing to have an STI test, and residing in these districts. Internet access. Those who could not give consent and could not read English were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 text message with a web link to an e-STI test and results service (intervention group) or 1 text message with a web link to a bespoke website listing their location, contact information and website. 7 local sexual health clinics (control group). Participants were free to use other services or interventions during the study period. The primary outcomes were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks confirmed by patient registry controls and self-reported STI diagnosis at 6 weeks confirmed by patient registry controls. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants prescribed treatment for an STI, time from randomization to completion of an STI test, and time from randomization to treatment for an STI. Participants received a £10 cash incentive upon submission of self-reported data. We completed all follow-ups, including patient registration checks, until 17 June 2016. In the intervention group, STI test uptake increased at 6 weeks (50.0% vs. 26.6%, relative risk [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.15), P < 0.001). The proportion of participants diagnosed was 2.8% in the intervention group versus 1.4% in the control group (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.70, P = 0.079). Evidence of heterogeneity was not observed in any of the prespecified subgroup analyzes. The proportion of treated participants was 1.1% in the intervention group versus 0.7% in the control group (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, P = 0.231). Test duration was shorter in the intervention group compared to the control group (36.5 days vs. 28.8 days, P < 0.001, limited mean survival time test [RMST]), but no difference was observed for time to treatment (83.2). 83.5 days versus days, P = 0.51, test for difference in RMST). We were unable to recruit the planned 3,000 participants and therefore did not have the power for STI diagnoses and analysis of STI cases treated. Results: The e-STI testing service increased STI testing intake for all groups, including high-risk groups. The intervention required people to go to the clinic for treatment and did not shorten the time to treatment. Service innovations to improve cure rates for those diagnosed online are needed and may include e-treatment and mail-in treatment services. e-STI testing services require long-term monitoring and evaluation.

Standard diagnostic tests for BT/EHD viruses are readily available, and there are described tests published in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Manual. However, there are significant differences in the diagnostic approach to these viruses. Serological tests are well structured and many laboratories are experienced in conducting these tests.

2265,Classification of Marek's disease viruses by pathotype: Philosophy and methodology,"The concept of pathotype in Marek's disease (MD) probably derives from the recognition of a more virulent form of the disease in the late 1950s (Benton & Cover, 1957). The distinctions between MD virus strains were further broadened by the identification of the vv pathotype in the early 1980s and the vv+ pathotype in the 1990s. Pathotype definitions reflect important biological features associated with vaccine immunity in the field. However, the pathotyping methods applied by the various laboratories were not uniform, preventing critical comparison of results. Better uniformity of pathotyping procedures is desirable. The Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory (ADOL) method is based on the induction of lymphoproliferative lesions in vaccinated chickens. This method has been used for the pathotyping of more than 45 isolates and is the basis for current pathotype classification of MD virus strains. Its limitations include requirements for a given chicken breed (15 x 7 ab+), a large number of animals, and a statistical method to compare lesion responses with those of JM/102W and Md5 control strains. Due to these limitations, it has not been used and is not likely to be used in other laboratories. Comparability in pathotyping can be improved by comparing field isolates with standard prototype strains such as JM/102W, Md5 and 648A (American Type Culture Collection) or equivalents. Data can be generated by different in vivo procedures that measure tumor induction, neurological disease (both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions), or non-neoplastic criteria only (such as lymphoid organ weights or virus replication). Methods based on neoplastic criteria will probably be most closely related to that of the ADOL method and most relevant to the evolution of the MD virus in the field, especially when produced in MD-vaccinated chickens. Based on data from several trials, a modification of the ADOL method has been proposed that uses less chicken and can be run with commercial specific pathogen-free strains. The modified method is based on ""best fit"" comparisons with prototype strains and is expected to provide results generally comparable to the original method. Various other alternative criteria (see previous) are also considered, both for primary pathotyping and in addition to other pathotyping methods. Advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods are presented. © 2005 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Witter, R. L.;Calnek, B. W.;Buscaglia, C.;Gimeno, I. M.;Schat, K.

2267,Application of enteric viruses for fecal contamination source tracking in environmental waters,"Microbial source monitoring (MST) tools are used to identify sources of fecal contamination in order to accurately assess public health risk and implement best management practices (BMPs). This review focuses on the potential of enteric viruses for MST applications. Following host infection, enteric viruses multiply and are excreted in high numbers in the faeces and urine of the host. Because of the specificity in host infection, enteric viruses have been recognized as one of the most accurate library-independent culture-independent MST tools. In an evaluation of molecular viral assays based on the sensitivity, specificity and density of target virus in fecal affected samples, human adenovirus and human polyoma virus were found to be the most promising human-specific viral markers. However, due to the cross-reactions observed between animal species or the limited number of samples tested for specificity, more research is needed to identify promising viral markers for farm animals. Other viral markers of fecal origin, F+ RNA coliphage and pepper light speckle virus have also been proposed as potential targets for the development of MST markers. Increasing the use of enteric viruses for MST applications through next-generation sequencing (NGS) and virus concentration technology is discussed in the second part of this review. Huge sequence databases created by shotgun and gene-targeted metagenomics enable more efficient and reliable design of MST assays. Finally, recent studies have revealed that alternative virus concentration methodologies may be more cost-effective than standard technologies such as 1MDS; however, improvements in recovery efficiency and consistency are still needed. Overall, advances in metagenomic information combined with efficient concentration methodologies, as well as high host specificity, make enteric viruses a promising tool in MST applications. © 2012 .",,"Wong, K.;Fong, T.

2269,Neutralizing DNA aptamers against swine flu H3N2 viruses,"Pig triple reassortant influenza A viruses (IAVs), particularly the North American H3N2 subtype, circulate in pig herds and can recombine and give rise to new zoonotic strains. Current diagnostic tools rely on isolation of viruses followed by serotyping by hemagglutination or genome sequencing; both of these can be expensive and time consuming. Therefore, new subtype-specific ligands and methods are needed for rapid testing and subtyping of IAVs in the field. To meet this need, we selected recombinant HA protein versus DNA aptamers from pig IAV H3 cluster IV using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Four candidate aptamers (HA68, HA7, HA2a and HA2b) have been identified and characterized. The dissociation constants (Kd) of HA68, HA7, HA2a and HA2b aptamers against the recombinant H3 protein were 7.1, 22.3, 16.0 and 3.7 nM, respectively. The binding site of HA68 to H3 was determined to be between nucleotide residues 8 and 40. All aptamers inhibited H3 hemagglutination. HA68 was highly specific to all four lineages in the North American H3N2 subtype. Furthermore, three other aptamers specifically identified live viruses belonging to phylogenetic clusters I, II/III and IV, particularly the virus closely related to the last H3N2 variant (H3N2v). Aptamer HA68 was also able to bind and detect H3N2v isolated from recent human cases. As a result, we now provide subtype-specific aptamers that can be used in rapid detection and typing protocols for field applications against H3N2 IAVs of pigs.

2270,Metagenomic analysis of viromes of dromedary stool samples reveals a large and high diversity of circovirus and picobirnavirus.,"The discovery of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus and another novel dromedary coronavirus UAE-HKU23 in dromedary animals has fueled interest in the search for new viruses in dromedary camels. In this study, faecal samples of 203 dromedary dromedaries in Dubai were pooled and deep sequenced. 1970 of the combined 7330 viral contigs were assigned to mammalian viruses. The largest groups of these contigs paired with Picobirnaviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, and Hepeviridae. Many of these viral families were previously unknown to dromedaries. In addition to the high abundance of contigs from Circoviridae (n=598 14 complete genomes) and Picobirnaviridae (n=1236), a high diversity of contigs was found from these two families, and 14 Circoviridae complete genomes forming at least five clusters and both genogroup I and genogroups It continues from II, potentially from new picobirnaviruses. Further studies comparing the incidence of these viral families in healthy and sick dromedary dromedaries will reveal their pathogenic potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

2271,High Diversity of Genogroup I Picobirnaviruses in Mammals,"In a molecular epidemiology study using 791 fecal samples collected from different terrestrial and marine mammals in Hong Kong, genogroup I picobirnaviruses (PBVs) were positive by RT-PCR targeting the partial RdRp gene in samples from five cattle, six monkeys, 17 horses, and nine animals. . pig, a rabbit, a dog, and 12 California sea lions, with sequence types 11, 9, 23, 17, 1, 1, and 15, respectively, in positive samples from the corresponding animals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBV sequences from each animal species were widely distributed throughout the tree with high diversity, sharing 47.4–89.0% nucleotide identities with other genogroup I PBV strains based on the partial RdRp gene. Nine complete segments 1 (viral loads 1.7 x 10(4) to 5.9 x 10(6)/ml) and 15 segments 2 (viral loads 4.1 x 10(3) to 1.3 x 10(6) )/ml) otarin PBVs were sequenced from serially collected stool samples from California sea lions. In two phylogenetic trees constructed using ORF2 and ORF3 of segment 1, nine segment 1 sequences were clustered into four different clades (C1-C4). In the tree constructed using the RdRp gene of segment 2, 15 segment 2 sequences were clustered into nine different clades (R1-R9). In four sea lions, PBVs were detected in two different years, different clades were present in the same segment 1 Glade (C3) in two consecutive years from a sea lion and in different years from three sea lions. A high diversity of PBV has been observed in a variety of terrestrial and marine mammals. Multiple sequence types with significant differences were present in most of the PBV-positive samples from different animal species, representing multiple strains of PBV.",,"Woo, P. C. Y.;Teng, J. L.

2272,Analysis of Bovine viral diarrhea virus subtypes from permanently infected US cattle calves with whole genome sequence.,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified into 2 genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, each containing different subtypes with genetic and antigenic variation. To effectively control BVDV through vaccination, it is important to know which subtypes of the virus are in circulation and how their prevalence has changed over time. Accordingly, the aim of our study is to estimate the current prevalence and diversity of BVDV subtypes from persistently infected (PI) cattle calves in the central United States. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR (5' untranslated region) for 119 virus strains revealed that the majority (82%) belonged to genotype 1b, with the remaining strains distributed between genotypes 1a (9%) and 2 (8%). ; however, the BVDV-2 subtypes could not be resolved safely. Therefore, to better describe the variability of US BVDV isolates and further investigate the subtypes of BVDV-2 isolates, whole genome sequences were obtained for these isolates, as well as representatives of BVDV-1a and -1b. Phylogenetic analyzes of the complete coding sequence provided more precise genetic classification and revealed that the US BVDV-2 isolates belonged to at least 3 different genetic groups, which was statistically supported by both complete and individual coding gene analyzes. These results suggest that a more complex subtype of BVDV-2 is circulating in this region than previously thought.",,"Workman, A. M.;Heaton, M. P.;Harhay, G. P.;Smith, T. P.;Grotelueschen, D.

To estimate the potential risk, we sequentially passaged the A/Hamburg/04/2009 isolate in A549 human lung epithelial cells. After passage 6, we observed a 100-fold increased replication rate. High-throughput sequencing of viral gene segments identified five dominant mutations whose contribution to enhanced growth was analyzed by reverse genetics. An increased replication rate was noted for two mutations near the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment (HA1 D130E, HA2 I91L), the receptor binding site, and the root domain. The adapted virus also replicated more efficiently in vivo in mice. Improved replication rate is associated with increased fusion pH of the HA protein and a decrease in receptor affinity.

2275,Does complexity of rumen microbial ecology hinder methane reduction?,"Ruminant animals are responsible for the production of some of the greenhouse gases, especially methane (61 Tg/year), which is believed to contribute to global warming and climate change. Methane is the end product of fermentation of plant material by the microbial ecosystem in the rumen. Methanogenesis is undertaken by the methanogenic archaea and is a mechanism by which H(2) is removed from fermentation to regenerate biochemical co-factors such as NAD+. The microbial ecosystem is very complex and includes thousands of bacterial species (10(10)-10(11) cells/ml), archaea (10(7)-10(9) cells/ml), protozoa (10(4). -10(6) cells/ml), fungi (10(3)-10(6) cells/ml), and viruses (10(9)-10(10) cells/ml), their host and each other. This ecosystem is relatively poorly understood, particularly interspecies interactions and interactions with the host. Less than 15% of the microbial species in the gastrointestinal tract have been cultured and characterized. However, knowledge about this ecosystem is accumulating, especially with the advent of molecular biology and culture-independent technologies. New high-throughput sequencing methodologies such as pyrosequencing will greatly increase the rate of information retrieval, and techniques such as Stable Isotope Probing will improve our ability to understand interspecies relationships. While we expect an increase in our knowledge of this complex ecosystem and an improved ability to predictably reduce CH(4) emissions, the use of feeds (eg cereal grains) and chemical additives (eg 2-bromo-ethane sulfonate, bromochloromethane) Achieving meaningful reductions in CH(4) emissions may be possible with advances in our knowledge of the intricacies of this complex ecosystem.

2276,Molecular characterization of H1N1 influenza A viruses from human cases in North America,"While subtypes of the H1N1 influenza virus can be found in humans in North America, they are also associated with swine infection. Characterization of genotypes of viral strains in human populations is important for understanding the source and distribution of viral strains. The genomic and protein sequences of 10 isolates of influenza A (H1N1) virus that emerged in North America in 2009 were obtained from the GenBank database. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, phylogenetic trees of PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, NS and M genes were constructed with the Phylip3.67 program and N-Linked glycosylation sites of HA, NA, PB2, NS1 and M2. proteins were analyzed online with the NetNGlyc1.0 program. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates were nearly identical but could be recombinant viruses as their genomic fragments came from different viruses. The isolates also contain a characteristic low-pathogenic amino acid motif at their HA cleavage sites (IPSIQSRa dagger""GL) and an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein, indicating high affinity for humans. The homologous pattern of M proteins has shown that viruses, due to mutation in the drug-susceptible region, anti-amantadine Sequence analysis of NA proteins showed that the viruses were still susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor drug (i.e. oseltamivir and zanamivir) because there were no mutations. These findings may further facilitate the treatment and prevention of possible disease transmission from North America to other countries.",,"Wu, B.;Wang, C. M.;Dong, G. Y.;Luo, J.;Zhao, B. H.;He, H.

2277,"Genetic and molecular characterization of H9N2 and H5 avian influenza viruses from live poultry markets in Zhejiang Province, eastern China.","Live poultry markets (LPMs) are a major source of reclassified avian influenza viruses (AIVs) due to the density of terrestrial and aquatic poultry and the frequency of AIV infection. H9N2 viruses are common in terrestrial poultry in Asia and have been isolated from poultry epidemics worldwide. They infect both avian and mammalian species and can be important donors of genetic material to emerging human pathogens. LPMs in Zhejiang Province were investigated for AIVs from 2013 to 2014. Three hundred seventy-four (374) AIV strains were isolated from 3,328 specimens. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. We identified a novel H9N2 virus genotype reclassified by gene segments from Qa/HK/G1/97-like, Ck/BJ/1/94-like and Dk/HK/Y439/97-like viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes suggested that H9N2 viruses are subject to reclassification with other AIV subtypes. The results also showed that two different H5 viruses (2.3.2 and 2.3.4.6) were circulating together in Zhejiang Province. Given that reclassified H5 AIVs have been detected in geese and ducks, it is possible that apparently healthy birds contribute to the resulting H5 AIVs.

Here we identified 5â€² UTR and adjacent 289-nt sequences and 3â€² UTR sequences for six group 2 coronaviruses and compared them with each other and with three previously reported group 2 members. Extensive regions of highly similar UTR sequences were found, but regions of minor difference were also found, indicating that group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-like (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus-OC43, human enteric coronavirus, porcine hemagglutination). encephalomyelitis virus and equine coronavirus) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) analogues (A59, 2 and JHM strains of MHV, puffinosis virus and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus). It has been shown previously that the 3–² UTRs of BCoV and MHV are interchangeable. Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA is shown to be transcribed by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), indicating that group 2 is common. 5â€² and 3â€² replication signaling elements. In addition, BCoV DI RNA achieved the leader of HCoV-OC43 by leader replacement, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules.

2280,"Impact of Live Poultry Market Interventions on Influenza A(H7N9) Virus, Guangdong, China","Since March 2013, three waves of human infection with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been detected in China. To investigate virus transmission within and between epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole-genome analysis of viruses sampled in Guangdong between 2013 and 2015. We observed a geographical shift of human A(H7N9) infections from the second wave to the third wave. Live poultry market interventions were made in epicenter cities; however, spatial phylogenetic analysis showed that third wave outbreaks in central Guangdong were most likely due to local virus persistence rather than entry from elsewhere. Although the number of clinical cases in humans decreased by 35% from the second wave to the third wave, the genetic diversity of third wave viruses in Guangdong increased. Our results highlight the epidemic risk of a region reporting relatively few A(H7N9) cases.

All serum samples were tested for anti-HEV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both serum and liver samples were evaluated for the presence of HEV RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting partial nucleotide sequences of open reading frame 2 (ORF2). The results show that sheep seroprevalence was 35.20% (176/500) and four (5.3%Â) of 75 sheep livers showed detectable amounts of HEV RNA. The seroprevalence of the butchers was 57.7Â% (15/26).

2282,High-throughput sequencing of the pituitary and hypothalamic microRNA transcriptome associated with high egg production rate,"Background: MicroRNAs are commonly found in viruses, plants, and animals. As endogenous small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs regulate a variety of biological processes. Tissue miRNA expression studies have discovered multiple functions for miRNAs in various tissues of chicken, but the regulation of miRNAs in the chicken pituitary and hypothalamic development regarding high and low egg laying performance remain unclear. Results: In this study, we sequenced two tissues (pituitary and hypothalamus) in 3 high and 3 low rate egg production Luhua chickens at 300 days of age using high-throughput sequencing technology. Comparing low and high rate egg laying hens, it was determined that 46 known miRNAs and 27 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed (P < 0.05). Six differently expressed known miRNAs expressed in both tissues were used for RT-qPCR validation and SNP detection. Among these, seven SNPs were found that could increase or decrease the production of mature miRNAs in two miRNA precursors (gga-miR1684a and gga-miR-1434). In addition, 124 and 30 mutually expressed miRNA-target pairs were identified by RNA-seq in pituitary and hypothalamic tissues, respectively, and randomly selected candidate miRNA and miRNA-target pairs were confirmed by RT-qPCR in Jiuyuan black chicken. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) roadnote showed that multiple pathways related to laying are enriched in highly egg-producing hens, including ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Conclusions: These differentially expressed miRNAs and specifically predicted target genes identifying reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs advance studies of miRNA identification associated with miRNA function and egg production. Analysis and effects of miRNA-related SNPs have provided insights into the effects of SNPs on miRNA biogenesis and function.

2283,Genetic diversity of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from domestic poultry species in eastern China during 2005–2008.,"Seventy-nine Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) isolated from clinical specimens of different poultry species, including chickens, pigeons (Columba livia), geese, and ostriches, in eastern China between 2005 and 2008, were biologically and phylogenetically characterized. The results showed the genetic diversity of these viruses: three class I viruses of class II circulating in chickens and one genotype I and 12 genotype II viruses were avirulent; The four genotype VIb viruses isolated from pigeons were moderately virulent; and two genotype III viruses and 57 genotype VIId viruses were highly lethal. Three class I viruses were further classified as genotypes 2 and 3. Very high F protein sequence identity of one genotype I virus with the Queensland V4 strain and 12 genotype II viruses with the La Sota strain indicated that these viruses originated from the two vaccine strains. The two genotype III viruses shared more than 99% sequence identity with the moderately virulent vaccine strain Mukteswar, but exhibited significantly higher virulence, suggesting that they evolved from the vaccinia virus and that the Mukteswar vaccine should be banned in China. Fifty-seven of the 63 virulent NDVs in this study belonged to genotype VIId, indicating its dominance in eastern China. Genotype VIId viruses can be further divided into two subgroups. Of the five NDVs isolated from pigeons, four belonged to genotype VIb, indicating host-specific preference.

2284,Molecular and antigenic properties of newcastle disease virus isolated from domestic ducks in China.,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most devastating diseases for the poultry industry. The causative agents of ND are virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), members of the genus Avulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Waterfowl such as ducks and geese are generally considered potential reservoirs of NDV and may show little or no clinical signs when infected with viruses that are clearly lethal in chickens. However, outbreaks of ND in domestic waterfowl have been frequently reported in many countries over the past decade. In this study, 18 NDV strains isolated from domestic ducks in southern and eastern China between 2005 and 2013 were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. The complete genomes of these strains were sequenced and they exhibited a genome size of 15,186 nucleotides (nt), 15,192. nt and 15,198. Following the ""rule of six"" required for replication of NDV strains, nt. Based on the cleavage site of the F protein and pathogenicity tests in chickens, 17 of our NDV isolates were categorized as lentogenic viruses and one was characterized as velogenic virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the F gene and whole genome sequences showed that there are at least four circulating NDV genotypes in domestic ducks; GD1, AH224 and AH209 belong to genotypes VIId, Ib and II of class II NDVs, respectively, and the remaining 15 isolates belong to genotype 1b of class I NDVs. Cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition tests showed that the antigenic relationship between NDV strains may be related to their genotype rather than their host. These results show that although these NDV isolates are from ducks, they still do not form a phylogenetic group because they come from the same species; however, they may play an important role in promoting the evolution of NDVs.",,"Wu, W.;Liu, H.;Zhang, T.;Han, Z.;Jiang, Y.;Xu, Q.;Shao, Y.;Li, H.;Kong, X.;Chen, H.;Liu, S.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.02.016,0
2285,DEF cells infected with virulent duck enteritis virus generate a unique viral microRNA model and a novel host microRNA set,"Background: Duck enteritis virus (DEV) belongs to the Herpesviridae family and is an important epornitic agent causing economic losses in the waterfowl industry. Chinese virulent (CHv) and attenuating vaccines (VAC) are two different strains of pathogenic DEV. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in viral infection. However, little is known about miRNAs encoded by virulent duck enteritis virus (DEV). Results: Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 39 mature viral miRNAs from CHv-infected duck embryo fibroblast cells. Compared to the reported 33 VAC encoded miRNAs, only 13 miRNA sequences and 22 ""seed sequences"" of miRNA were identical, and 8 new viral miRNAs were detected and confirmed by stem loop RT-qPCR in this study. Using RNAhybrid and PITA software, 38 CHv-encoded miRNAs were predicted to target 41 viral genes and form a complex regulatory network. Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) confirmed that viral giant-miR-D8-3p can directly target the 3'-UTR of the CHv US1 gene (p < 0.05). Gene Ontology analysis on host target genes of viral miRNAs was mainly involved in biological regulation, cellular and metabolic processes. In addition, 598 new duck-encoded miRNAs were detected in this study. Thirty-eight host miRNAs showed significant differential expression after CHv infection: 13 miRNAs were up-regulated and 25 miRNAs were down-regulated, which could affect viral replication in the host cell. Results: These data suggested that CHv encodes a distinct microRNA sequence and forms a unique regulatory network compared to VAC. This is the first report of the expression profile of DEF miRNAs and an analysis of the regulatory mechanisms of these miRNAs during DEV infection. These data provide a basis for further investigation of miRNA regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of DEV infection and contribute to the understanding of CHv-host interaction at the miRNA level.",,"Wu, X.;Jia, R.;Zhou, J.;Wang, M.;Chen, S.;Liu, M.;Zhu, D.;Zhao, X.;Sun, K.;Yang, Q.;Wu, Y.;Yin, Z.;Chen, X.;Wang, J.;Cheng, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1468-2,0

2288,Molecular characteristics of avian influenza viruses (H9N2) from air samples in live poultry markets,"Objective: To examine the molecular characteristics of H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from air samples collected in live poultry markets (LPMs) and to investigate their sequence identity with AIVs that cause human infection. Methods: From 2015 to 2016, weekly surveillance of LPMs airborne H9N2 subtype AIVs was performed. H9-positive samples were isolated from chicken embryos. Whole genome sequences of isolated AIVs were obtained by high-throughput sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences and key locus variations were also analyzed. Results: A total of 327 aerosol samples were collected from the LPMs. Nine samples were positive for H9-subtype AIVs based on quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR). According to whole genome sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis, 8 gene segments belonging to 8 aerosol H9N2 isolates and 2 H9N2 human isolates were included in the same clade in 2015, except for A/Environment/Zhongshan/ZS201505/2015 (ZS201505) strain. Among key locus variations, except strain ZS201505, H9N2-subtype AIVs did not have mutations in the eight receptor binding sites of hemagglutinin (HA) and stems of neuraminidase (NA) proteins exhibited a deletion region of three bases. The PA gene of ZS201503 and ZS201602 exhibited a L336M mutation. N30D and T215A mutations in the M1 gene and amino acid residues L89V in PB2, P42S in NS1, and S31N in M2 were retained in these 9 strains of H9N2 isolates, which can increase the virulence of the virus. Result: Live H9N2 AIVs survived in the aerosol of LPMs in Zhongshan City. Aerosol viruses had a close evolutionary relationship with human epidemic strains, suggesting that there may be a risk of AIV transmission to humans from contaminated aerosols in LPMs. Mutations in H9N2-subtype AIVs isolated from air samples collected from LPMs suggested that their pathogenicity is enhanced to infect humans.",,"Wu, Y.;Lin, J.;Yang, S.;Xie, Y.;Wang, M.;Chen, X.;Zhu, Y.;Luo, L.;Shi, W.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.01.009,0
2289,Pig epithelial cell line infected with Pseudorabies virus generates diverse host microRNAs and a specialized viral microRNA cluster,"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) belongs to the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which has caused great economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. It has been shown recently that many herpes viruses encode microRNAs (miRNAs) that play crucial roles in the viral life cycle. However, information on PRV-encoded miRNAs is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of both viral and host miRNA expression profiles in the PRV-infected porcine epithelial cell line (PK-15). Deep sequencing data showed that the ~4.6 kb intron of the large latency transcript (LLT) functions as a primary microRNA precursor (pri-miRNA) encoding 11 different miRNA clusters and 209 known and 39 novel porcine miRNAs in the PRV genome. Detected. Viral miRNAs were further validated by stem loop RT-PCR and northern blot analysis. Surprisingly, all of these viral miRNAs exhibited terminal heterogeneity at both their 5' and 3' ends. Seven miRNA genes produced mature miRNAs from both strands, and two of the viral miRNA genes showed partial overlap in their leader regions. Unexpectedly, a high-abundance terminal loop-derived small RNA and a specific miRNA offset RNA (moRNA) were processed from the same viral miRNA precursor. Polymorphisms of viral miRNAs shed light on the complexity of host miRNA processing machinery and viral miRNA regulatory mechanism. Pig genes and PRV genes were collected for target prediction of viral miRNAs, revealing a complex network formed by both host and viral genes. GO enrichment analysis of host target genes indicates that PRV miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways including cell death, immune system process, metabolic pathway, and that these miRNAs play important roles in virus-cell interaction of PRV and its hosts. Collectively, these data suggest that the PRV-infected epithelial cell line generates diverse host miRNAs and a specialized viral miRNA cluster that can facilitate PRV replication in cells.",,"Wu, Y.

2290,Discovery of various rodent and bat pestiviruses with different genomic and phylogenetic features in various Chinese provinces,"Bats and rodents are widely distributed worldwide and may be natural or intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a group of virus species of the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae and can infect a wide variety of artiodactyly hosts, including pigs and ruminants. Two classical pestivirus strains, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classic swine fever virus are major causative agents of mild to severe disease in cattle and swine hosts, respectively, causing enormous economic losses to these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents can also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses, and that an atypical porcine pestivirus that causes disease in piglets shows a close genetic relationship with a specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of new pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different localities by analyzing available bat and rodent viroma data from across China. Two strains of bat pestiviruses and four strains of rodent pestiviruses different from other known viruses were identified and sequenced. These viruses were detected from two bat species and four rodent species in different provinces of China. Two different strains were present in these viruses that differed from the artiodactylous pestivirus. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the existence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactyly hosts. This study may provide new insights for the prevention of future viral disease outbreaks from bats and rodents.",,"Wu, Z.;Liu, B.;Du, J.;Zhang, J.;Lu, L.;Zhu, G.;Han, Y.;Su, H.;Yang, L.;Zhang, S.;Liu, Q.;Jin, Q.",2018.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02562,0
2291,Deciphering the bat virus catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases,"Studies have shown that ~60-80% of human-emergent infectious diseases (EIDs) are caused by wildlife. Bats are natural reservoirs for a wide variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause serious illness in humans and pets. However, understanding of the viral population and ecological diversity found in bat populations is unclear, making it difficult to determine the origins of certain EIDs. Here, virome analysis was performed based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals from 40 large bat species across China, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model. The aim of this study is to investigate the ecological and biological diversity of viruses living in these bat species, to investigate the existence of potential zoonotic viruses originating from bats, and to evaluate the effects of these viruses on public health. Data from this study provided an overview of the viral community found in these bat samples. Many new bat viruses have been reported for the first time, and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens have been identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in investigating the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses. These data offer meaningful ecological information for estimating and monitoring wildlife-derived EIDs.",,"Wu, Z.;Yang, L.;Ren, X.;He, G.;Zhang, J.;Yang, J.;Qian, Z.;Dong, J.;Sun, L.;Zhu, Y.;Du, J.;Yang, F.;Zhang, S.;Jin, Q.",2016.0,,10.1038/ismej.2015.138,0
2292,Virome Analysis for Detection of Novel Mammalian Viruses in Bat Species from Chinese Provinces,"Bats are natural hosts for a wide variety of zoonotic viruses. This study aimed to describe the range of bat viruses, including viruses from mammals, insects, fungi, plants, and phages in 11 insectivorous bat species (216 bats in total) common in six provinces of China. We used sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina) to analyze viromes. Viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons with known viruses. Mammalian viruses include Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Retroviridae, Circoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Astroviridae, Flaviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Parvovirinae; insect viruses include viruses of Baculoviridae, Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tetraviridae and Densovirinae; fungal viruses belonging to Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae and Totiviridae; and phages included Caudovirales, Inoviridae and Microviridae and unclassified phages. We identified the complete or partial genome sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses, in addition to viruses and phages associated with insects, plants, and bacterial flora associated with bat diet and habitat. These include herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyzes showed that these new viruses showed little genetic similarity to previously reported viruses. This study also revealed high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces. These findings expanded our understanding of bat viruses in China and pointed to the existence of a wide variety of unknown mammalian viruses in many common bat species in mainland China.",,"Wu, Z.

2293,Investigation of virome of cattle with non-suppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology by metagenomics.,"Non-suppurative encephalitis is one of the most common pathological diagnoses in cattle with neurological disease, but there is a lack of knowledge about disease-associated pathogens. To identify viruses associated with non-suppurative encephalitis in cattle, we used a viral metagenomic approach in a sample set of 16 neurologically diseased cows. We identified six virus candidates: parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5), bovine astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1), bovine polyomavirus 2 (BPyV-2 SF), ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (BHV-6) and a new bovine betaretrovirus named BoRV-CH15. In a case-control study using PCR, BoAstV-CH13 (p=0.046), BoPV-2 SF (p=0.005) and BoHV-6 (p=4.3E-05) were statistically associated with disease. These data expand our knowledge of pathogens associated with encephalitis in cattle and point to the value of NGS in solving complex infection scenarios in a clinical disease setting.",,"WÃ¼thrich, D.;Boujon, C.

2294,At rhinovirus serotypes 1 and 2: Relationship with each other and with aftoviruses and cardioviruses,"Equine rhinoviruses (ERVs) are picornaviruses that cause a mild respiratory infection in horses. The disease is similar to the common cold in humans caused by rhinoviruses; however, the presence of a viremia during ERV-1 infection, the occurrence of persistent infections, and the physical characteristics all more closely resemble foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). CDNA cloning and sequencing of the ERV-1 and ERV-2 genomes between the poly(C) and poly(A) pathways showed that the serotypes were heterogeneous. However, the genomic architecture of both serotypes is most similar to that of FMDV. Indeed, a comparison of ERV-1-derived protein sequences shows that their identity is the largest FMDV. In contrast, most ERV-2 proteins are more associated with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) proteins than with FMDV or ERV-1. These results place ERV-1 next to FMDV in the aphthovirus genus of the picornavirus family and indicate that this virus may serve as a model system for studying FMDV biology.",,"Wutz, G.;Auer, H.;Nowotny, N.;Grosse, B.;Skern, T.;Kuechler, E.",1996.0,,,0

2298,Comparative Transcriptomics Highlights Role of Activator Protein 1 Transcription Factor in Host Response to Ebola Virus,"Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus contain two types of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Despite significant research efforts, the molecular events following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection are poorly understood. To identify host factors promoting EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, porcine, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection through a potent induction of extracellular growth factors. Furthermore, a significant increase in activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members FOS and JUN was observed in the allowed cell lines. Functional studies focusing on human cells have shown that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of JUN and, to a lesser extent, FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity in human cells at 48 and 72 hours post infection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown reduces the expression of EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study highlights the role of AP1 in developing the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many questions remain about the molecular events underlying filovirus pathophysiology. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as post-exposure therapeutics, will be significantly enhanced by an in-depth understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV may be possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically diverse cell lines (derived from human, pig, and bat). We first identified the responsive pathways using an RNA-seq-based transcriptomic approach. Further functional and computational analyzes focusing on human cells highlighted an important role of the AP1 transcription factor in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our work sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and support the transcriptional landscape following viral infection.",,"Wynne, J.

2300,Molecular phylogenetic analysis of bovine viral diarrhea virus: Bayesian approach,"Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is important for the precise classification of viruses. Traditionally, the inferred BVDV phylogeny has been performed by the distance-based method, that is, by neighbor splicing for single genes. In this study, Bayesian approach was used to analyze the five genetic regions of the BVDV genome (5-² UTR, Npro, E2a, E2b and NS3) for 68 taxa from GenBank. The results showed that all taxa in the consensus tree of E2a were correctly assigned to the corresponding groups, namely type-2 BVDV and BVDV-1a, -1b, -1c, -1e and -1g, supported by a high posterior probability. . In contrast, subgroup 1a formed polytomies in the consensus trees of the 5â€² UTR and NS3. Polytomies also emerged between subgroup 1b in consensus trees of Npro and E2b. Analysis of a combined dataset produced a clear, well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis. The individual and combined topologies were different for each genetic region, but the differences were mainly poorly supported by the data. Combining the data allowed the identification of well-supported strain groups corresponding to some predefined subgroups. Only a combined approach will allow the safe insertion of new strains into the current classification of viruses as genotypes and subgenotypes.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is contagious to at least 250 bird species, but the role of wild birds in virus epidemiology is largely unknown. 14 NDV isolates were obtained from 2040 samples collected from wild birds or the environment between 2013 and 2015 in southern China's Guangdong province. The highest rate of isolation is during the wintering period, while the lowest is spring migration, nesting and postnesting. Maximum clade reliability phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least four genotypes circulate in southern China: three class II genotypes (II, VI, and IX) and one class I (1b). We also showed that most isolates from wild birds were quite similar to isolates from poultry, and two isolates were associated with viruses from wild birds in northern China. These data suggested that wild birds could spread NDV and that poultry-derived viruses could spread to wild birds. Accordingly, vaccine development and poultry management strategies should be considered to prevent future NDV outbreaks, especially given the strength of the poultry industry in developing countries such as China.",,"Xiang, B.;Han, L.;Gao, P.;You, R.;Wang, F.;Xiao, J.;Liao, M.;Kang, Y.;Ren, T.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.020,0

2305,Molecular evolutionary genetic analysis of emerging parvoviruses identified in pigs,"Parvoviruses infect a wide variety of vertebrates and arthropods and are associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. Due to the emergence of new sequence-independent PCR methods and high-throughput sequencing, several new parvovirus members within the Parvovirinae subfamily have been recently identified. Many of these viruses do not fit into the current classification, and others now have confusing or conflicting designations, as two or more names are used for similar or identical groups of parvoviruses, or the same names are used for different groups of viruses. In this study, recently described vertebrate parvoviruses were classified through phylogenetic analyzes based on the sequences of their complete or near-complete genomes, with emphasis on those identified in pigs, open reading frame (ORF) 1 (nonstructural protein, NS1), ORF2 (capsid protein, VP1) and ORF3 (nuclear phosphoprotein, NP1) genes were investigated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods. Among all existing vertebrate parvovirus lines, eight different clades were identified, corresponding to the five well-established genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Denpendovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus. In addition, three new segments of the PARV4-like virus, new segment 1 and new segment 2, were identified and tentatively identified. All porcine parvoviruses identified to date were organized according to the available analysis.

2307,Understanding PRRSV infection in pig lung based on genome-wide transcriptome response identified by deep sequencing.,"Pig reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been one of the most economically important diseases affecting the pig industry worldwide and causes huge economic losses every year. PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent potentiation (ADE), interstitial pneumonia, and immunosuppression. However, the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection are still not fully understood. Here we report the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to infection of the classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a using the digital gene expression (DGE) system of Solexa/Illumina, a tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method. and systematically analyzes the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles and infection pathology after N-PRRSV infection. Our results demonstrate that N-PRRSV employs multiple strategies for its replication and dissemination in infected pigs, including disrupting the host innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state, as well as developing ACE. Expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and upregulation of inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation was likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression may be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which causes depletion of immune cells and induces an anti-inflammatory cytokine response that they are unable to eliminate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will be of benefit to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, develop new antiviral therapies, and identify genetic components for susceptibility to swine resistance/PRRS. © 2010 Xiao et al.",,"Xiao, S.;Jia, J.;Mo, D.;Wang, Q.;Qin, L.;He, Z.;Zhao, X.;Huang, Y.;Li, A.;Yu, J.;Niu, Y.;Liu, X.;Chen, Y.",2010.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0011377,0
2308,Abnormal host immune response induced by highly virulent PRRSV identified by digital gene expression tag profiling,"Background: There was a large-scale outbreak of highly pathogenic swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in China and Vietnam in 2006 and 2007, resulting in unusually high morbidity and mortality among pigs of all ages. The mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV) are unknown. Therefore, the association between pulmonary gene expression profiles and infection pathology after H-PRRSV infection was analyzed in this study using high-throughput deep sequencing and histopathology. Results: H-PRRSV infection caused severe lung pathology. The results suggest that the induction of aberrant host innate immune responses against H-PRRSV and an anti-apoptotic state may be responsible for the aggressive replication and spread of H-PRRSV. Prolific rapid replication of H-PRRSV may have triggered aberrant sustained expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in a markedly robust inflammatory response combined with significant cell death and increased oxidative damage. The result was severe tissue damage and high pathogenicity. Conclusions: The systems analysis used in this study provides a comprehensive basis for better understanding the pathogenesis of H-PRRSV. It also enables the identification of genetic components related to H-PRRSV resistance/susceptibility in swine populations. © 2010 Xiao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Xiao, S.;Mo, D.;Wang, Q.;Jia, J.;Qin, L.;Yu, X.;Niu, Y.;Zhao, X.;Liu, X.;Chen, Y.",2010.0,,10.1186/1471-2164-11-544,0
2309,"Reverse Genetic Creation of an Effective, Stable, Live-Atenuated Newcastle Disease Virus Vaccine Based on an Currently Circulating, Highly Virulent Indonesian Strain","Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can cause serious illness in chickens. Although NDV vaccines are available, there are frequent reports of outbreaks in vaccinated chickens. In 2009-2010, despite intensive vaccination, NDV caused major outbreaks among commercial poultry farms in Indonesia. These outbreaks have raised concerns about the protective immunity of current vaccines against virulent strains circulating in Indonesia. In this study, we investigated whether a recombinant attenuated Indonesian NDV strain could provide better protection against common Indonesian viruses. A reverse genetics system was constructed for the highly virulent NDV strain Banjarmasin/010/10 (Ban/010) isolated in Indonesia in 2010. Ban/010 virus is classified in genotype VII of class II NDV, which is genetically different from commercial vaccine strains B1 and LaSota belonging to genotype II and shares only 89% and 87% amino acid identity for the protective antigens F and respectively. HN. A mutant virus named Ban/AF was developed, in which the lethal F protein cleavage site motif ""RRQKRâ†""F"" was modified to an avirulent motif ""GRQGRâ†""L"" with three amino acid substitutions (underlined). Ban/AF vaccinia virus did not infect or produce plaques in cell culture even in the presence of added protease. Pathogenicity tests showed that Ban/AF was completely avirulent. Ban/AF was efficiently amplified and remained genetically stable in chickens during 10 consecutive passages. Serological analysis showed that Ban/AF induced higher neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against common viruses than commercial vaccines B1 or LaSota. Both Ban/AF and commercial vaccines protected against clinical disease and mortality after challenge with the virulent NDV strain Ban/010 (genotype VII) or GB Texas (genotype II). However, Ban/AF significantly reduced virus transmission from vaccinated birds compared to B1 vaccine. These results suggest that Ban/AF may provide better protection than commercial vaccines and is a promising vaccine candidate against NDV strains circulating in Indonesia.",,"Xiao, S.;Nayak, B.;Samuel, A.;Paldurai, A.;Kanabagattebasavarajappa, M.;Prajitno, T.

This universal influenza enrichment probe set contains 46,953 120nt RNA biotin-labeled probes designed based on all available influenza viral sequences and can be used to enrich influenza sequences without prior type or subtype knowledge. Significant enrichment was demonstrated in influenza A/H1N1, influenza B, and H1-to-H16 hemagglutinin plasmids inserted into human DNA, and cultured influenza A/H2N1 virus. In addition, enrichment effects and mixed influenza A virus infections were revealed in wild bird cloacal swab samples. Therefore, this universal influenza virus enrichment probe system can selectively and effectively capture and enrich influenza viral sequences in different samples, especially those with gradient RNA or those containing low amounts of influenza RNA.",,"Xiao, Y.;Nolting, J.

2312,Analysis of miRNA expression profile in an Aedes albopictus cell line in response to bluetongue virus infection.,"Cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be key regulators of virus-host interactions. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-borne virus that causes great economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. Aedes albopictus cell lines have become powerful and useful tools for studying BTV-vector interactions. However, the role of miRNAs in A. albopictus cells during BTV infection is not well understood. In this study, we performed a deep sequencing analysis of small RNA libraries of BTV-infected and mock-infected A. albopictus cells, and a total of 11,206,854 and 12,125,274 clean reads were identified, respectively. A differential expression analysis showed that 140 miRNAs, including 15 known and 125 novel miRNAs, were significantly dysregulated after infection, with a total of 414 and 2307 target genes annotated, respectively. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression patterns of 11 selected miRNAs and their mRNA targets. Functional annotation of target genes suggested that these target genes are mainly involved in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, endocytosis, RNA transport as well as FoxO, Hippo, Jak-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. This is the first systematic study of the effect of BTV infection on miRNA expression in A. albopictus cells. This research provides information on the cellular miRNA expression profile in response to BTV infection and provides clues to identify potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.",,"Xing, S.;Du, J.;Gao, S.;Tian, Z.;Zheng, Y.;Liu, G.;Luo, J.;Yin, H.",2016.0,Apr,,0
2313,First identification of swine parvovirus 7 in China,"Porcine parvovirus (PPV) are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses that can be taxonomically classified within the Parvoviridae family. To date, seven PPV genotypes (PPV1 to PPV7) have been identified. PPV7, the most recently discovered PPV genotype, was first reported in US pigs in 2016. To investigate the status of PPV7 in Chinese pig populations, a total of 64 serum samples collected from two commercial farms in Guangdong province in 2014 were analyzed. PPV7 DNA was detected in 32.8% (21/64) of the samples tested. In the pig circovirus type 2 (PCV2) positive farm, the prevalence rate of PPV7 was 65.5% (19/29); this was significantly higher than in the PCV2 negative farm (2/35, 5.7%), suggesting a possible association between them. PCV2 and PPV7 infections. The sequences of the three PPV7 strains were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the identified strains of PPV7 circulating in China shared 98.7%-99.7% nucleotide homology with the US strain. Further sequence comparison analysis showed that GD-2014-2 and GD-2014-3 had sequential 9-nt deletion in the VP gene. This is the first report of the presence of PPV7 in China, and this finding will strengthen the understanding of the epidemiology of porcine parvovirus in Chinese pigs.",,"Xing, X.;Zhou, H.;Tong, L.;Chen, Y.;Sun, Y.;Wang, H.;Zhang, G.",2018.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3585-9,0

Screening and analysis of PERV in putative pig breeds can provide key parameters for assessing the biological safety of xenotransplantation from pigs to humans. In this study, PERV was investigated among the conservation population of Ningxiang pig. The result was that the genotype of the PERV distribution was subtype A, 100%; subtype B, 100%; and subtype C, 100%. The env sequences of PERV-A and -B showed 11 clones detected by KpnI and MboI digestion, indicating multiple variants of PERV-A and -B in Ningxiang pig. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results showed that PERV had transcriptional activity in these individuals. In addition, PERV A/C recombinant was detected in most individuals of Ningxiang pig. The strain may not be a suitable donor for xenotransplantation, as PERV A/C recombinants increase the potential risk of infection. Crown Copyright © 2009.",,"Xing, X. W.;Hawthorne, W.

2315,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine bocaviruses carried by murine rodents and house mice in China.,"Bocaparvovirus infections in humans and both wild and domestic animals have been widely reported worldwide. In this study, we detected and genetically characterized the porcine bocavirus (PBoV) carried by mouse rodents (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus grainzumi and Rattuslosa) and house mice (Suncus murinus) in China. Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 murine rodents and 23 house mice were caught in four provinces of China. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the prevalence of PBoV in throat swab, stool and serum samples. A total of 7.5% (39/519) throat swab samples, 60.5% (309/511) stool samples and 22.9% (52/227) serum samples were PBoV-positive. The prevalence among R. nor norvegicus and R. tane grainzumi was higher than that of R. Los Losa and house shrews. PBoV positive samples were found in all four provinces. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial viral capsid protein 1/2 (VP1/VP2) showed that the sequences obtained in this study formed a new group (PBoV G4). In addition, close to five full-length PBoV genomes (4,715–4,798Â nt) were obtained. These genomes encoded two nonstructural proteins, NS1 (1,908Â nt in four genomes and 1,923Â nt in the remaining genome) and NP1 (600Â nt), and the structural proteins, VP1/VP2 (1,851Â nt). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBoV G4 differed from rodent, human and other bocaviruses. In conclusion, the prevalence of PBoV G4 was high among the two common murine rodents in China, and the pathogenicity of PBoV G4 needs further clarification.",,"Xiong, Y. Q.;You, F. F.;Chen, X.

2316,Metagenomic analysis of the Rhinopithecus bieti fecal microbiome reveals a wide variety of bacterial and glycoside hydrolase profiles related to lignocellulose degradation.,"BACKGROUND: The animal gastrointestinal tract contains a complex microbe community whose composition ultimately reflects the co-evolution of microorganisms with their animal hosts and the diet adopted by the host. Although the importance of the human gut microbiota has been well demonstrated, there is little research on non-human primates (NHPs), particularly herbivorous NHPs. RESULTS: In this study, 97,942 pyrosequencing reads generated from Rhinopithecus bieti fecal DNA extracts were analyzed to aid in a better understanding of the microbial diversity and functional capacity of the R. bieti gut microbiome. Taxonomic analysis of metagenomic reads indicated that the R. bieti stool microbiome was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Comparative analysis of taxonomic classification revealed that the R. bieti metagenome is characterized by an overrepresentation of bacteria from the phylum Fibrobacteres and Spirochaetes compared with other animals. The primary functional categories were mainly associated with protein, carbohydrates, amino acids, DNA and RNA metabolism, cofactors, cell wall and capsule and membrane transport. Comparison of the glycoside hydrolase profiles of R. bieti with those of other animals revealed that the R. bieti microbiome is most closely related to the cow rumen. RESULTS: Metagenomic and functional analysis showed that R. bieti has a wide bacterial diversity and multiple glycoside hydrolases responsible for lignocellulosic biomass degradation, which may reflect adaptations associated with a diet rich in fiber. These results will contribute to the limited number of NHP metagenome studies and provide a unique genetic source of plant cell wall-degrading microbial enzymes. However, future studies on metagenome sequencing of R. bieti regarding the effects of age, genetics, diet, and environment on the composition and activity of metagenomes are needed.",,"Xu, B.;Xu, W.;Li, J.;Dai, L.;Xiong, C.;Tang, X.;Yang, Y.;Mu, Y.;Zhou, J.;Ding, J.;Wu, Q.;Huang, Z.",2015.0,,10.1186/s12864-015-1378-7,0
2317,Hybrid DNA virus in Chinese patients with seronegative hepatitis discovered by deep sequencing,"Seronegative hepatitis – non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis – is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. Between 1999 and 2007, we collected 92 serum samples from patients with non-AE hepatitis in Chongqing, China. Ten serum pools were scanned by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3,780-bp contig found in all 10 pools that gave BLASTx E scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The full sequence of the in silico-assembled 3,780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over nearly the entire genome, and the virus was tentatively named NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig consists of two main ORFs. With the BLAST protein, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. The prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three (70%) of 90 patient samples were positive, but all from 45 healthy controls were negative. The mean virus titer in patient samples was 1.05 e4 copies/microL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were searched by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG and 31% were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78% of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although further studies are needed to determine the etiological role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data suggest that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-AE hepatitis.",,"Xu, B.;Zhi, N.;Hu, G.;Wan, Z.;Zheng, X.;Liu, X.;Wong, S.;Kajigaya, S.;Zhao, K.;Mao, Q.;Young, N.

ORF3, an important regulatory protein of HEV, affects multiple signaling pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the function of ORF3 from the porcine form of HEV (SHEV), high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screening was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and gene ontology was used to assign differentially expressed genes into functional categories. The results showed that in resident ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB and FREM1 were upregulated, whereas SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2, and PTGR1 were downregulated. Deregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 may contribute to changes in integral membrane protein and basement membrane protein expression, expression changes for NLRP1 may affect apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3 and DKK1 may affect lipid metabolism in HepG2. cells. In conclusion, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane protein and basement membrane proteins and altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells.

This study was an attempt to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of H9N2 AIVs in two geographically diverse regions of China where vaccination is routinely practiced. A total of 18 emerging H9N2 isolates were identified and genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes confirmed that the isolates belonged to the Y280 lineage. The isolates were divided into two subgroups according to their HA genes. Viruses from Zhejiang Province clustered together in Group I, while isolates from Guangdong Province clustered together in Group II. Antigenic characterization showed that the tested viruses were antigenically different compared to the currently used vaccine strain. It was noteworthy that 14 out of a total of 18 isolates had an amino acid substitution (Q?L) in the receptor binding site at position 216 (226 with H3 Numbering), suggesting that the virus has potential affinity for binding to the human-like receptor. .

We analyzed serum samples from 34 patients diagnosed with sporadic acute hepatitis of non-A, non-B, and non-C etiology, seen at a city hospital in Sendai, Japan, between January 1997 and December 2002. . Of these 34 patients, 3 (9%; all men; 54, 59, and 61 years old) were positive for both IgG and IgM anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA. HEV isolates (HE-JAS1 and HE-JAS3) from case 1 and case 3, respectively, were divided into genotype III; They both had the highest nucleotide sequence identity of 99.5% and 99.0%, respectively, with HE-JA7 and HE-JA8 isolated in Iwate, a neighboring province of Sendai.

Antiserum for strain IBDV TY2 showed higher neutralizing activity against heterologous IBDV strains than antiserum against strain K strain vaccinia virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequences encoding the hypervariable region of virus protein 2 of strain IBDV TY2 do not cluster with the classical, variant, or highly lethal IBDV groups.

2333,Failed detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 subgenotype a (BVDV-2a) by direct fluorescent antibody test on tissue samples due to reduced reactivity of field isolates to crude anti-BVDV antibody,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is associated with mild or subclinical infections, while BVDV-2 is often involved in severe thrombocytopenia and acute fatal disease outbreaks. In this study, carcass samples of a bovine cow and tissue samples of a calf were taken for laboratory diagnosis. Both animals exhibited severe clinical signs consistent with thrombocytopenia or hemorrhagic syndrome. The direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) failed to detect the BVDV antigen in the tissue samples of both cases. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the presence of BVDV antigen in the oral and esophageal mucosa and Peyer patches of bovine cows. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detected BVDV-2 in selected tissues of both animals. Subsequently, BVDV was isolated from both cases and subjected to genetic and serological characterizations. Mutations in the 5'-untranslated genomic region (5'-UTR) primer and probe binding sites and in the E2 gene were associated with reduced efficiency of an established real-time RT-PCR assay and amino acid changes in the E2 glycoprotein, respectively. Both viral isolates were classified as BVDV-2 subgenotype a by real-time RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Unlike the BVDV reference strains Singer and 125c, the isolates cross-reacted with anti-BVDV-1 and anti-BVDV-2 reference sera showing antigenic variations in field isolates. The isolates also showed low reactivity to porcine anti-BVDV antiserum (crude serum used to produce BVDV DFA conjugate). In summary, data from the present study demonstrated that genetic and antigenic variations affect the performance of detection assays, particularly DFAT, highlighting the need for regular evaluation and modification of BVDV tests.",,"Yan, L.;Pace, L.

2334,Genome-wide identification of copy number variations between two chicken lines that differ in genetic resistance to Marek's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV) is an important source of genome polymorphisms that directly contribute to phenotypic variation, such as resistance to infectious diseases. Lines 63 and 72 are highly inbred experimental chicken lines that differ greatly in susceptibility to Marek's disease (MD) and are widely used in efforts to identify the genetic and molecular basis of genetic resistance to MD. Using next-generation sequencing, we present a genome-wide assessment of CNVs potentially associated with genetic resistance to MD. METHODS: Three randomly selected chickens from each line were arrayed to an average depth of 20x. Two popular software, CNVnator and Pindel, were used to separately call genomic CNVs. The results were combined to obtain a combined set of genomic CNVs in the two chicken lines. RESULTS: After combining the two datasets, a total of 5,680 CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified, of which 1,546 and 1,866 were MD resistant or susceptible line specific, respectively. More than half of the line-specific CNVRs were shared by 2 or more chickens, reflecting reduced diversity in both self-raised lines. CNVRs fixed in susceptible lines were significantly enriched in genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. We also found 67 CNVRs overlapping with 62 genes previously shown to be strong candidates of the underlying genes responsible for susceptibility to MD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of the two chicken lines and additional evidence that the MAPK signaling pathway may play an important role in the host response to MD virus infection. The rich source of line-specific CNVs is valuable for future disease-related association studies in two chicken lines.",,"Yan, Y.;Yang, N.;Cheng, H. H.;Song, J.;Qu, L.",2015.0,2023-10-01 00:00:00,,0

Here we isolated and characterized a DTMUV, designated GDLH01, which has been thought to be responsible for the noticeable egg drop in flocks of Muscovy ducks in Southern China since 2011. The genome sequence of GDLH01 shared 97-99% homology with other avian Tembusu viruses, and 99.5% homology with the mosquito-borne strain SDMS recently reported in China. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequence of the entire open reading frame confirmed that the isolate was of avian origin and closely related to a mosquito-borne strain.

The complementary sequences of the M RNA segments of AKAV, AINV, and PEAV contain a single large open reading frame (ORF), like other orthobunyaviruses. ORFs potentially encode 1401 amino acids (aa), 1404 aa and 1400 aa polypeptides, respectively. The identity of the M segment among these viruses is quite low, but previous researchers have reported that the small RNA segments are highly conserved. Because the M segment encodes the viral surface glycoproteins G1 and G2, the variability of the M segment may affect the antigenicity of these viruses. Phylogenetic studies based on M and S segment sequences suggested that genetic reclassification occurred among the ancestral viruses of the three Simbu serogroup viruses during their evolution.

2338,Newcastle disease virus isolated from recent outbreaks in Taiwan is phylogenetically related to viruses (genotype VII) from recent outbreaks in Western Europe,"Three major Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks have occurred in Taiwan over the past three decades (in 1969, 1984, and 1995). Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) isolated in three outbreaks, along with those isolated in 1998, were sequenced between nucleotides 47 and 435 of the fusion gene. A phylogenetic tree based on the sequences obtained showed that NDV isolated in 1969 was similar to genotype III viruses. In contrast, all isolates in 1984 and seven out of eight isolates in 1995 entered genotype VII with all isolates in 1998. These results show that the 1969 ND outbreak in Taiwan was caused by the genotype III virus, while the 1984 and 1995 outbreaks were caused by the genotype VII viruses. To date, genotype VII viruses have caused many epidemics in East Asia and Western Europe. We suspect that these outbreaks constitute the fourth panzootic of ND, which differs from the third panzootic caused by ""pigeon PMV-1 viruses"".

It has been adopted as a critical technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major disadvantage of phage display technology is that it often results in a limited number of clones, as the degree of enrichment cannot be controlled during the bioscrolling process. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen for clones from a library and determined whether a larger number of clones could be identified using NGS than with conventional methods. Three chicken immune single chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were bioannealed on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). After each round of bioscrolling, phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries and Escherichia coli pool was analyzed using NGS and heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of scFv clones were determined. Next, by two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bioscrolling, the traditional colony screening method was applied for comparison. The scFv clones from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method, along with many additional clones.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for gene expression and are involved in the regulation of virus defense and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed to compare small RNA libraries from SCK2, SCDY2 and LDT3-A infected chicken kidneys. By comparing these data with healthy chickens, a total of 58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. DE miRNAs were further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up- or down-regulation compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, it has been shown that DE miRNAs are mostly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activities, gene expression, binding activities, and immune responses. Seven highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538, and gga-miR -2954) ) was selected for miRNA-mRNA confluent analysis. In addition, miRNAs were inversely proportional to their corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs were considered to play an important role in IBV-host interactions and differential virulence of IBV strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent IBVs elicits differential miRNA expression in chicken kidneys; this expression also appears to be related to the virulence of IBV.

Virus isolation, virus neutralization test and RT-PCR were used to determine the causative pathogen, sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variations of S1 subunit and M genes. The results showed that ducks were infected with IBV due to the emergence of a dwarf phenotype and death of embryos 48 to 144 hours after inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results of the virus neutralization test showed that strains JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with isolate ZZ2004, and almost no cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 with strains M41 was observed. , H120, Grey, Holte or Aust-T.

The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains enigmatic and no effective prevention measures have been established. To better understand the virulence differentiation of S. suis and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a natural avirulent S. suis strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and can protect piglets from attack by virulent strains. Comparative genomic analyzes demonstrated the genetic basis of virulence deficiency in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some key virulence-related factors and an intact 89K island of pathogenicity. The lack of virulence was also demonstrated by the reduced survival time of 05HAS68 compared to a lethal strain in pig whole blood. Further investigation revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68 that was suggested to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have resulted in the genomic diversity of S. suis and may have resulted in biological differences between 05HAS68 and the highly virulent S. suis strains.",,"Yao, X.;Li, M.;Wang, J.;Wang, C.;Hu, D.;Zheng, F.;Pan, X.;Tan, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Hu, L.;Tang, J.;Hu, F.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep09835,0

Using a deep sequencing approach on RNA from cultures of infected chicken embryo fibroblasts, we identified several novel DEV-encoded micro(mi)RNAs. Unlike most mardivirus encoded miRNAs, DEV encoded miRNAs mostly map to the uniquely long region of the genome. The precursors of DEV miR-D18 and miR-D19 overlapped, suggesting similarities to miRNA-offset RNAs, but only DEV-miR-D18-3p was functional in reporter assays. The identification of these new miRNAs will add to the growing list of virus-encoded miRNAs, enabling investigation of their role in pathogenesis.",,"Yao, Y.;Smith, L.

2357,Relationship of SARS-CoV to other pathogenic RNA viruses discovered by its tetranucleotide utilization profile,"BACKGROUND: The exact source of the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is still an open question. The genomic sequence association of SARS-CoV with 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses from various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with a vectorial profile of the tetra-nucleotide utilization pattern V for each virus. In the first approach, a distance measure of a vector V based on the correlation coefficient was designed to construct a relationship tree with the neighbor-joining algorithm. In the second approach, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive embedded tetra-nucleotide utilization patterns. These models were then used to classify selected viruses. RESULTS: Both approaches yielded association results consistent with known virus classification. They also noted that the genome of RNA viruses from the same family conformed to a particular pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of overall tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, Infectious Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly also, RNA viruses that did not go through a DNA stage showed remarkable discrimination against CpG and UpA di-nucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48) and UpG and CpA selection (z = 65.79.49.99, respectively). . Potential factors influencing these biases are discussed. CONCLUSION: Genomic word usage study is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses. The agreement of association results with known classification indicates phylogenetic signals in tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, most evident in replicase open reading frames.",,"Yap, Y.

2358,Frequency of D222G and Q223R hemagglutinin mutants of the 2009 influenza virus pandemic (H1N1) in Japan between 2009 and 2010,"Background: A new swine-derived influenza A virus (H1N1pdm) emerged in April 2009 and spread rapidly around the world, including Japan. It has been suggested that, unlike contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses, which have a preference for 2.6-linked sialic acid, the virus can bind to both 2.3- and 2.6-linked sialic acid receptors in infected mammals. Methods/Results: To elucidate the presence and transmissibility of Î±2,3 sialic acid-specific viruses in H1N1pdm, amino acid substitutions within viral hemagglutinin molecules, particularly D187E, D222G and Q223R, were investigated for a shift from human. to bird receptor specificity. Samples from individuals infected during the first and second waves of the outbreak in Japan were analyzed using a high-throughput sequencing approach. In May 2009, three samples from mild cases showed D222G and/or Q223R substitutions in a small subpopulation of viruses infecting these individuals. However, in samples from five mild cases in December 2010, the substitutions nearly disappeared. The D187E substitution was not common in samples, even in May 2009. Conclusions: These results showed that Î±2.3 sialic acid-specific viruses, including G222, and R223 were present as a small population in humans in the early phase of the pandemic, and D222 and Q223 became more predominant through human-to-human transmission during the first and second waves of the epidemic. These results are consistent with the low rates of substitution identified in seasonal H1N1 viruses in 2008.

2359,Isolation and molecular characterization of influenza A/H5N1 viruses isolated during avian influenza epidemics among birds in the European part of Russia in 2005: A virus strain with the Ozeltamivir-resistance mutation was found.,"The operation Karalat Furrow was performed for the isolation and characterization of influenza A/H5NI viruses isolated from chickens that died during the avian flu epidemic in the village of Yandovka (Tula region) in autumn 2005, and from a wild swan that died in the area near the mouth of the Volga River. Molecular-biological and phylogenetic analyzes were carried out to determine possible geographical origins of strains, phylogenetic similarities of viruses, as well as to predict their pathogenicity, epidemic hazards for humans and possible resistance to antiviral drugs. The virus has been shown to belong to highly pathogenic variants that originated in China as a result of reclassification of viruses of the Z and V genotypes circulating among poultry and wild birds. A number of molecular markers were revealed that characterize the high pathogenicity of the virus for gallinaceous birds and mammals, but not specific mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that support the high rate of virus replication in a human organism, and also adaptation mutations to it. found. Variants of the circulating influenza A/H5N1 virus in this epizootic have been shown to be susceptible to remantadine.

2361,Phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity assessment of two strains of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 isolated from migratory birds: high homology of human H10N8 virus and internal genes.,"Two human-infecting avian influenza viruses (AIVs), H7N9 and H10N8, have emerged in China, which also cross-species infectivity and pathogenicity as an internal gene donor of the H9N2 subtype of AIVs. H9N2 viruses containing such internal genes are commonly found in poultry but are rarely reported in migratory birds. In this study, two strains of H9N2 virus were isolated from stool samples of migratory birds in 2014: one from Caizi Lake in Anhui Province and the other from Chen Lake in Hubei Province, China. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed high homology of all six internal genes of these two strains with internal genes of human H10N8 virus from Jiangxi Province, as well as human H7N9 virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a possible origin of these two strains from southern China poultry. Both of the two tested viruses could be replicated in the respiratory organs of infective mice without adaptation by both strains of H9N2 AIVs from wild birds, suggesting their potential capacity to directly infect mammals. Our findings indicate the existence of H9N2 viruses containing internal genes that are highly homologous to human H10N8 or H7N9 viruses. Wild birds may contribute to the spread of H9N2 virus containing the ""harmful"" internal gene complex, leading to gene rearrangement with other influenza viruses and the formation of new pathogenic viruses. Therefore, strengthening AIV surveillance in wild birds can promote understanding of the presence and prevalence of viruses and provide scientific evidence for the prevention and control of AIVs and AIVs that infect humans.",,"Ye, G.;Liang, C.

2362,"Full sequence analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes and proteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus detected in Iran, 2015","In the last two decades, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has received great attention due to its zoonotic and mutated nature. Iran is among the countries that have been significantly affected by the virus, as it hosts migratory birds during seasonal migration. In this study, molecular characterizations of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes and proteins of H5N1 strain A/chicken/Iran/8/2015 detected in backyard chickens of Mazandaran province were investigated. Phylogenetic analysis classified this virus as a member of the 2.3.2.1c subset with the 'PQRERRRK-R/GLF' cleavage site motif. HA carried several mutations that altered affinity for mammalian cells; however, the virus was classified as avian. The NA protein had a 20-amino acid deletion at position 49-69 aa, similar to those isolated since 2000. NA had H253Y and H274Y mutations that contributed to antiviral resistance. From this analysis it can be concluded that wild migratory birds flying from West Asia to East Africa are probably the main carriers of seasonal H5N1 in the country.",,"Yegani, S.;Shoushtari, A.

2363,Molecular characterization of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses isolated from food products imported into Singapore.,"We completed the genetic characterization of all eight gene segments for four low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. The aim of this study is to detect the presence of new signatures that can serve as early warning indicators of the transformation of LPAI viruses into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 viruses isolated from live poultry imported into Singapore as part of the national avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance programme. Based on the molecular criteria of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), sequencing analysis with the translated amino acid (aa) sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed the absence of multibasic aa at the HA cleavage site and identified all four viruses. Isolates as LPAI. Detailed phylogenetic tree analyzes using the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes clustered these isolates in the Eurasian H5 lineage, but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes. This analysis also revealed that internal genes clustered into different avian and pig subtypes, suggesting that the four isolates could possibly share ancestry with these different influenza subtypes. Our results show that the four LPAI isolates in this study mainly contain avian signatures, and the phylogenetic tree for internal genes also reveals the potential for reclassification with other different avian subtypes in circulation.

2364,Presence of bovine hepacivirus in Turkish cattle,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a common human pathogen worldwide, causes one of the most important viral infections in humans. HCV is the type species of the Hepacivirus (Flaviviridae) genus to which recently discovered animal viruses, namely horse, bat, rodent and cattle, are assigned. A broad distribution of bovine hepacivirus (BovHepV, Hepacivirus N) was proposed following preliminary reports from German and African cattle in 2015. We investigated the possible presence of BovHepV in serum samples from cattle from different regions of Turkey. Analysis of a total of 120 samples from 98 female (dairy) and 22 male (cattle) cattle by real-time RT-PCR yielded 15 (12.5%) positive results. BovHepV infection was detected in 6 of the 10 locations included in the study. There were positive samples from both the eastern and western parts of the country showing the possible wide distribution in the Turkish cattle population. Phylogenetic analysis of 9 selected positive samples clearly assigned 8 sequences to a separate cluster on the basis of NS3 gene region, while one of the sequences from an animal imported from northern Italy was grouped with sequences from cattle in Germany. The second finding may indicate the possible occurrence of this genetic group of BovHepV not only in Germany but also in other European countries. The results of this study indicate the presence of BovHepV infections in Turkey and the Middle East region.",,"Yesilbag, K.;Baechlein, C.;Kadiroglu, B.;Toker, E.

2365,Detection and genetic characterization of feline bocavirus in northeastern China,"Background: Bocaviruses have been reported to cause respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis in most animal species. Different genotypes of bocaviruses have been identified in cats in the USA, Japan, Hong Kong and Portugal. However, the clear relationship between clinical symptoms and FBoV infection is unknown, and the prevalence of FBoV and the distribution of FBoV genotypes in China is still unclear. Results: In this study, 197 fecal samples were collected from cats with diarrhea (n = 105) and normal cats (n = 92) in different regions between January 2016 and November 2017 and investigated using PCR targeting different FBoV genotypes. Screening results showed that 51 of 197 samples (25.9%) were positive for FBoV and a higher positive rate was observed in cats with diarrhea (33.3%, 35/105) than in normal cats (17.4%, 16/92). Of these FBoV positive samples, 35 were identified as FBoV-1, 12 as FBoV-2, and 4 as FBoV-1 and FBoV-2 coinfections. A phylogenetic analysis based on the partial NS1 gene showed that 24 sequences from randomly selected FBoV-positive samples were separated into 2 different FBoV groups: FBoV-1 and FBoV-2. In addition, 6 strains were randomly selected and the whole genome was sequenced and analyzed. These strains exhibited the typical genome organization of bocavirus and were closely related to FBoV. The two FBoV-2 identified strains shared high homologies with the whole-genome and whole-coding gene-based FBoV-2 reference strains, but lower identities in the NP1 and VP1 regions for the other 4 strains identified with FBoV-1 compared to the FBoV-1 reference strains. Conclusion: These findings suggest that genetically diverse FBoV-1 and FBoV-2 are widely circulated in cats in Northeast China, and FBoV-1 is more prevalent. The high prevalence of FBoV in cats with diarrheal symptoms suggests that FBoV infection may be associated with diarrhea in cats.",,"Yi, S. S.;Niu, J. T.;Wang, H. L.;Dong, G. Y.;Zhao, Y.

2366,Highly different sapoviruses detected by metagenomic analysis in straw-colored fruit bats in Cameroon,"Sapoviruses (SaVs) belong to the genus Sapoviruses in the family Caliciviridae. It has been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and pigs, but not in other animals. In addition, some strains from pigs, chimpanzees, and rodents show close sequence identity with human SaVs, thus suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission. Bats are known to be an important reservoir of zoonotic viruses, but little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats. To investigate the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were processed according to the NetoVIR protocol and sequenced with Illumina technology. Nearly complete genome sequences of six highly distinct SaVs and one partial SaV (VP1 region only) were identified in Eidolon helvum, and based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, they represent two novel genogroups that are potentially only distantly related to known SaVs. . Furthermore, comparison of these sequences with currently used screening primers and probes showed that new SaVs would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies in humans if interspecies transmission occurred. Therefore, we designed and validated novel primers capable of detecting both human and bat SaVs. In this study, we identified a large number of novel bat SaVs, but further epidemiological studies in humans are needed to reveal their potential role in gastroenteritis.",,"Yinda, C.

2367,"Cameroon fruit bats harbor different viruses, including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses, using an alternative genetic code.","Most human-emergent infectious diseases originate in wildlife, and bats are major reservoirs of viruses, a few of which are highly pathogenic to humans. In some parts of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This proximity between humans and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroon fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples from Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed that there are many known and new viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome showed clearly segregated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, without showing recent interspecies transmission events. In addition, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a new group of newly identified viruses related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and providing further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-linked RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyzes suggested that they may have a lifestyle similar to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect mitochondria. mushrooms. Although the identified strains of bat coronavirus, parvovirus and cyclovirus belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses form putative new genera in their own families.

2368,Phylogenetic evidence for intertype recombination in the emergence of the human enterovirus 71 subgenotype,"Background: Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a common causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks, with numerous deaths and serious neurological complications. Several new EV-71 subgenotypes were identified from these outbreaks. The mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of these subgenotypes are unknown. Results: Six EV-71 isolates from an outbreak in Malaysia in 1997 were fully sequenced. These isolates were identified as EV-71 subgenotypes, B3, B4 and C2. Using these whole genome sequences and all other available whole genome sequences of EV-71 and human enterovirus A (HEV-A), a phylogenetic tree was constructed that correlates well with the current enterovirus classification scheme. However, using genomic regions 5–² UTR, P2 and P3, isolates of EV-71 subgenotypes B3 and C4 were isolated from other EV-71 subgenotypes, coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16/G10) and EV-71. divided into clusters. Subgenotype C2 clustered with CV-A8. Results from similarity plot analyzes supported clustering of these isolates with other HEV-A. In contrast, at the same genomic regions, Tainan5079, a CV-A16 isolate, clustered with EV-71. This indicates that only structural genes are conserved between EV-71 and CV-A16. The 3–2 ends of the virus genome were variable and consisted of very similar sequences to various HEV-A viruses. Multiple recombination cross breakpoints were identified in the nonstructural genes of some of these newer EV-71 subgenotypes. Conclusion: Phylogenetic evidence from whole-genome sequence analyzes supports possible intertype recombination involving EV-71 and various HEV-A, including CV-A16, the most common causative agent of HFMD. It has been suggested that these recombination events play important roles in the emergence of various EV-71 subgenotypes.

2369,Tracing the genetic history of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses derived from the complete ORF 5-7 sequences: a Bayesian combinatorial approach.,"To trace the genetic history of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), we identified the complete sequences of the ORFs of 5 to 7 of the four PRRSV isolates. These sequences were analyzed together with published sequences from 146 isolates from various regions of the world using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods, as well as the Bayesian combinatorial approach. All viruses of the European type (type AB) were classified into either group or unclassified (4 isolates), while all viruses of the North American type (type NA) belonged to one of the three main groups or were not classified (5 isolates). Within each genotype, no significant periodic and/or geographic effects on the evolution of PRRSVs were observed. The evolutionary rate of PRRSV isolates was estimated to be 1.55 × 10-3 substitutions/place/year and the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) time was 491.2 years ago. Here, TMRCA for EU and NA type viruses was 58.7 and 62.6 years ago, respectively. A Bayesian skyline plot revealed that viruses evolved at an almost constant population size until the late 1970s, when they experienced a population expansion that continued into the late 1980s. Population size remained stable again until the early 2000s, when a rapid and sharp decline in the number of effective infections occurred. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Yoon, S.

The results strongly supported the monophyly of the five FMDV serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C, and SAT 3, while the sequences for the remaining two FMDV serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2, did not branch completely apart. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister group relationships, serotypes O + Asia 1, A + C and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SAT 1 , 2, 3)}. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the evolution of global FMDVs. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these sequences provided evidence for the impact of purification selection on the evolution of FMDV. Using the Bayesian combinatorial approach, the evolutionary rate of FMDV isolates circulating between 1932 and 2007 was estimated to be 1.46 × 10-3 substitutions/place/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus existed about 481 years ago. . The Bayesian silhouette graph revealed a population expansion in the early 20th century, followed by a rapid decline in population size from the late 20th century to the present.

Japanese PRRSVs were genotyped by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using reported primer pairs, either North American type specific or European type specific, which were reactive to both types. All PRRSV genomes from 66 tissue homogenates or serum and 55 infectious viruses were of the North American type, while the European type of viral genome was not detected. The two PCR primers specific to the North American type showed different detection efficiency. Half of the tissue samples and 15% of infectious viruses were not detected with one primer pair, but all were detected with the other primer pair. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the forward and reverse primer binding sites of non-reactive viruses showed that all these viruses have nucleotide mismatches within 4 bases corresponding to the 3-² end of the reverse primer.

2372,Molecular and serological epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) on a remote island of western Japan: an effect of JEV migration over the East China Sea.,"Background: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). About 1-10 cases with severe central nervous system symptoms are consistently reported each year in Japan. To clarify the maintenance mechanism of JEV, this study sought isolated JEV strains and serological evidence of JEV infection from pigs and mosquitoes in Isahaya City (Isahaya) and Goto City (Goto) on the islets of Goto, Nagasaki State, from 2008. Results: Serological investigation of pigs showed increased IgM seropositivity to JEV in July or August and was maintained until October or November in both Isahaya and Goto each year. Including the isolates in this study, there were 47 JEV strains isolated in Nagasaki between 2001 and 2014 and belonged to genotype 1. Thirty-four of the isolated strains were from pigs from Isahaya, and six subsets (1-A-1, 1-A-2, 1-A-3, 1-A-4, 1-A-5, and 1-A-9) . Thirteen strains were isolated from pigs and mosquitoes in Goto and classified into three subsets (1-A-5 (2008); 1-A-1 (2009); and 1-A-2). In the 1-A-2 subset, there are three different monophyletic subgroups, 1-A-2-2 (2010), 1-A-2-3 (2011) and 1-A-2-1 (2013, 2014). Appeared on goto. Conclusions: These data strongly suggest that the appearance of the JEV in Goto appears to be due to frequent off-island entry of the JEV and that this pattern is different from that observed on subtropical islands such as Okinawa and Taiwan in the East China Sea. the same JEV populations (1-A-7 (1998-2008) in Okinawa; genotype 3 (until 2012) in Taiwan) were conserved for a long time.",,"Yoshikawa, A.;Nabeshima, T.;Inoue, S.;Agoh, M.;Morita, K.",2016.0,,10.1186/s41182-016-0010-0,0

Genetic characteristics of CV-A6 complete viral protein 1 (VP1) obtained from patients with HFMD in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. CV-A6 was detected in 105 of 280 clinical samples and all VP1 sequences could be analyzed for 90. 105 samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CV-A6 strains were classified in clan A and subdivided into sub-clan A3 or sub-clan A4. Each sub-clade strain carried amino acid substitutions in the putative DE and GH loops of VP1, and no amino acid substitutions were identified as detrimental to protein function. No significant difference in clinical symptoms was found between genetic sub-branches using statistical analyses. In conclusion, this study clarified the genetic diversity of CV-A6 in Fukuoka from 2013 to 2017.

In this study, we report avian-like H1N1 and novel resortant H1N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China. Homology and phylogenetic analyzes showed that H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) was close to bird-like H1N1 viruses and appeared to be derived from European porcine H1N1 viruses first reported in China; and two H1N2 viruses (A/swine/Shanghai/1/07 and A/swine/Guangxi/13/06), classic porcine (HA, NP, M and NS), novel resistant H1N2 influenza viruses containing human genes (NA and PB1 ) and avian (PB2 and PA) strains claimed that reclassification between human, avian and swine flu viruses occurred in pigs in China, resulting in the production of new viruses. The isolation of the avian-like H1N1 influenza virus from European swine H1N1 viruses, particularly the emergence of two new resortant H1N2 influenza viruses, provides further evidence that pigs serve as intermediate hosts or ""mixing vessels"", and swine flu virus surveillance in China is needed. should be given high priority. © 2009.",,"Yu, H.;Zhang, P.

2376,Genetic diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China: a potential threat to human health?,"Pandemic strains of influenza A virus can arise through genetic reclassification between viruses from different hosts. Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and have been suggested to be intermediate hosts or mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reclassification or adaptation to the mammalian host. In this study, we summarize and report for the first time the coexistence of 10 (AJ) genotypes in pigs in China by analyzing eight genes of 28 porcine H9N2 viruses isolated in China from 1998 to 2007. Porcine H9N2 viruses in genotypes A and B were entirely derived from Y280-like and Shanghai/F/98-like viruses, respectively, indicating that interspecies bird-to-swine transmission of H9N2 viruses is present in China. The other eight genotype (CJ) viruses may be double reassortant viruses in which six genotypes (EJ) viruses have 1-4 H5-like gene segments, indicating that they are reassortants of H9 and H5 viruses. In conclusion, the genetic diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China provides further evidence that interspecies bird-to-swine transmission of H9N2 viruses occurs and can result in the generation of new reassortant viruses by genetic reassortment with swine H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses, therefore , these swine H9N2 influenza viruses may be a potential threat to human health, and maintaining swine flu virus surveillance in China is of paramount importance. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Yu, H.;Zhou, Y.

2377,Further evidence for infection of pigs with human-like H1N1 influenza viruses in China,"Classical swine and avian-like H1N1 influenza viruses have been widely reported in the worldwide pig population, but human-like H1N1 swine viruses have been reported occasionally. In 2006, a human-like H1N1 swine virus (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) was isolated from pigs in Guangdong province, which was first reported in China. To obtain further evidence of infection of pigs with human-like H1N1 influenza viruses, three human-like pig H1N1 viruses (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06, A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01) /06) Isolated in China. All eight genes of the three viruses are highly homologous to recent (about 2000) and early (in the 1980s) human H1N1 influenza viruses, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that A/Swine/Guangdong/96/06 is directly derived from approximately 2000 human H1N1 influenza viruses, while A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06 appear to be human descendants. took it out.

2378,Detection of new viruses in pig stool samples from China,"Background: Pigs are well-known sources of infectious diseases in humans. To better understand the spectrum of viruses present in pigs, we used the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX high-throughput sequencing platform to sequence fecal samples from healthy pigs. Results. Total nucleic acid was extracted from stool samples of healthy piglets and randomly amplified. The amplified materials were pooled and processed using a high-throughput pyro-sequencing technique. Raw sequences were parsed on the basis of barcodes and then processed through a standard bioinformatics pipeline. The unique reads (348, 70 and 13) had limited similarity to known astroviruses, bocaviruses and parecoviruses. Specific primers were synthesized to assess the prevalence of viruses in healthy piglets. Our results show extremely high positivity rates. Results: Several novel astroviruses, bocaviruses and Ljungan-like viruses were identified in stool samples from healthy pigs. Isolation rates for new viruses were high. The high detection rate, diverse sequences and categories indicate that pigs are well-established reservoirs and possible sources for different enteric viruses. © 2013 Yu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Yu, J.

2379,Identification of a Novel Picornavirus in Healthy Piglets and Seroepidemiological Evidence for Its Presence in Humans,"In this study, we describe a novel porcine parechovirus-like virus (provisionally named PLV-CHN) from healthy piglets in China using 454 high-throughput sequencing. The complete genome of the virus consists of 6832 bp (32% identity) encoding a predicted polyprotein of 2132 amino acids most similar to Ljungan virus. A similar virus belonging to a new genus Picornaviridae named swine pasivirus 1 (SPaV-1) was reported during the preparation of this article. Sequence analysis revealed that PLV-CHN and SPAV1 shared 82% nucleotide identity and 89% amino acid identity. Further genomic and phylogenetic analyzes suggested that both SPAV1 and PLV-CHN share similar genomic features and belong to the same new genus Picornaviridae. A total of 36 (20.0%) stool samples from 180 healthy piglets were positive for PLV-CHN by RT-PCR, while no stool samples from 100 healthy children and 100 children with diarrhea and no cerebrospinal fluid samples from 196 children with suspected viral encephalitis were positive for the virus. However, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using recombinant PLV-CHN VP1 polypeptide as an antigen showed a high seroprevalence of 63.5% in the healthy population. When grouped by age, antibody positivity rates showed that the majority of children under the age of 12 were infected by the virus. It has been suggested that PLV-CHN, SPAV1, or a yet uncharacterized virus could infect humans early in life. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the role of this new virus. © 2013 Yu et al.",,"Yu, J. M.;Li, X. Y.;Ao, Y. Y.;Li, L. L.;Liu, N.;Li, J. S.;Duan, Z. J.",2013.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0070137,0
2380,Molecular features of the full-length genomic A segment of three infectious bursal disease viruses in China: two attenuated strains and one virulent domain strain,"Full-length cDNA of genomic segment A of three infectious bursal disease viruses, two attenuated strains (HZ2 and JD1) and one virulent domain strain (ZJ2000), amplified in a single step by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cloned into pGEM - T Easy Vector and sequential. The full length of the cloned segment A contains 3259 nucleotides containing two partially overlapping open reading fragments (ORFs) ORF1 and ORF2 flanked by 5' and 3' non-coding regions. These strains shared high sequence identity with each other at either the nucleotide level or the deduced amino acid level. HZ2 and JD1 strains were highly associated with two attenuated strains, CEF94 and P2, while ZJ2000 was closely associated with two other virulent strains, Cu-1 and Harbin. Substitutions of four amino acids at positions 253, 279, 284 and 330, a common feature of attenuated and most virulent strains, were also observed in these three strains. Two major hydrophilic peaks were preserved in the three strains; however, there are two amino acid substitutions at positions 280 (N to S) and 290 (M to L) at the second minor hydrophilic peak for all three strains, which can have a critical effect on antigenicity. Two amino acid substitutions near the VP2-VP4 cleavage site were identified in the virulent strain JZ2000, which may play a role in enhancing the virulence of the virus. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that these three Chinese strains are most closely related to some European virulent strains but distinct from the highly virulent infectious bursal disease virus and variant strains.",,"Yu, L.;Li, J.

2381,Growth characteristics and whole genomic sequence analysis of a novel pseudorabies virus in China,"Pig liars (PR) have re-emerged in Bartha-vaccinated pig herds and have killed millions of piglets in China since the last part of 2011. We isolated a novel pseudorabies virus (PRV) strain HNX from the brains of abortion fetuses. to diagnose the disease. To reveal the genomic organization and characterize the HNX strain, the complete genomes of an isolate HNX and Fa strain were sequenced and analyzed in the 1960s. The genomic size of HNX and Fa strains was 142,294 and 141,930 nt, respectively, and their corresponding GÂ +Â C contents were 73.56% and 73.70%Â. The two strains consistently had 70 open reading frames. In addition, comparative genomic analysis was performed between HNX and Bartha strains to understand the possible cause of immunodeficiency. The HNX strain had slight changes in the major virulence-related genes, while the HNX strain had 73 mutations in the glycoprotein B and glycoprotein C genes; Homology at the whole genomic level between HNX and Bartha strains was 90.6%. Genome-wide comparison between HNX and Fa strains showed that the strains shared approximately 96.4% homology and clustered in a separate group of Chinese isolates; both strains are far from isolates from other countries. Similarity plot and bootstrap analysis of whole genome sequences of nine PRV strains, including HNX and Fa, four novel Chinese strains and three traditional reference strains, revealed that non-recombination events occurred in strain HNX. The PRV HNX strain with genomic variations may contribute to the PR epidemic in China since the last part of 2011.",,"Yu, T.;Chen, F.;Ku, X.;Fan, J.;Zhu, Y.;Ma, H.;Li, S.;Wu, B.;He, Q.",2016.0,,10.1007/s11262-016-1324-z,0
2382,Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 viruses: coexistence in poultry linked to human H7N9 infection and genome features,"Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Based on the exposure histories of the cases and sequence similarities between viral isolates, sources of human H7N9 infection were suspected in live poultry markets. To investigate the role of live poultry markets in the source of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental samples from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and then high throughput. - generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified positive samples for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all 12 poultry markets epidemiologically associated with 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks and environmental samples from the markets contained heavily mixed subspecies including H7, N9, H9 and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea that H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes coexist in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, all human H7N9 infection cases (n=31) were negative for H9N2 virus by real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2 and inner segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus recently circulating in chickens in China. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains co-exist with novel human pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically relevant live poultry markets.

Here, we examined poultry samples from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2 and N9). Later, AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9 and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originates from A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1) belonging to item 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originates from human infecting A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to the genes of other H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 virus strains. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif, characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs, at the HA cleavage site. Receptor binding experiments showed that the virus binds Î±-2.3 sialic acid, but not Î±-2.6 sialic acid. Likewise, pathogenicity experiments showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice.

2386,"Hepatitis E virus: Foodborne, waterborne and zoonotic transmission","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, mainly through waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic transmission routes. HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae and encompasses four known Genotypes (1-4), at least two new putative genotypes of mammalian HEV, and a floating bird HEV genus. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEVs affect only humans, while Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and are responsible for sporadic and autochthonous infections in both humans and many other animal species worldwide. HEV has an ever-expanding host range and has been described in numerous animal species. Pig acts as a reservoir species for HEV transmission to humans; however, other animal species are likely to act as reservoirs as well. HEV poses a significant public health concern, with cases of disease definitively linked to the handling of infected pigs, consumption of raw and undercooked animal meat, and animal manure contamination of drinking or irrigation water. Infectious HEV has been identified in numerous sources of concern, including animal feces, sewage, insufficiently treated water, contaminated shellfish and products, and animal meats. As HEV is an extremely understudied but important human pathogen, many aspects of HEV pathogenesis, replication and immunological responses remain unknown. This article reviews current understanding of HEV transmission routes and the prevalence of HEV in animal species with zoonotic potential in humans, with emphasis on food and environmental sources.

The genomes of rumen virophages (RVP) encode a typical virophage major capsid protein, ATPase, and a Polinton-type, protein-prepared family B DNA polymerase-fused protease. RVP genomes appear to be linear molecules with terminal inverted repeats. Thus, RVP appears to represent virophage-Polinton hybrids, possibly capable of generating infectious virions.

2396,New ecological aspects of hantavirus infection: A paradigm shift and prevention challenge - A review,"In recent years, despite intensive research and the extraordinary efforts of modern medicine to eradicate infectious diseases, a significant number of hitherto unknown or underestimated pathogens have emerged as the main health hazards of the human population. Almost all events caused by such emerging pathogens can be attributed to factors that are zoonotic or that expand host range and cross species barriers. Many different factors affect whether a pathogen goes undetected or becomes a worldwide threat. The ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and changes in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, social and health status are relevant factors influencing the relationship between pathogen and host. Hantaviruses belong to emerging pathogens that have received more and more attention in recent years. These viruses are members of the Bunyaviridae family and are grouped in a separate genus known as Hantavirus. Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus serotypes predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock. Recently, many isolates of hantavirus have been identified and classified, affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing acute pulmonary syndrome, in hitherto unaffected geographical areas in the New World (North, Central and South America). Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States at the beginning of the 10th year of the last century fundamentally changed our knowledge of the emergence of the hantavirus-specific clinical picture, mortality, origin and route of transmission in humans. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners District of the United States, and its fatality rate was greater than 50%. Although the causative virus was first named in connection with the geographical name of the epidemic region, analysis of individual viruses shows that the virus that causes HPS is a genetically distinct hantavirus, hence the name Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are assumed to share a long process of coevolution with certain rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of kinship between virus serotypes normally coincides with that between their respective hosts. There are no known diseases associated with hantavirus infections in rodents, underlining the friendly relationship between virus and host that has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years of interaction. Although rodents are the main reservoir, antibodies to hantaviruses are also found in domestic and wild animals such as cats, dogs, pigs, cattle and deer. Pets and rodents live together in a similar habitat. Therefore, transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to pets seems possible if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of cohabiting pets have sufficient virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely incidental infection of non-rodent species such as humans, for example, transforms hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogenic agents to protect the human population from a serious health risk, drawing attention to this group of viruses, their ecology and evolution. Much more work is needed on the influence of non-native hosts on the ecology of hantaviruses to understand the directions that hantavirus evolution may follow. At the very least, pets that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans should be screened profusely, especially in areas known as high endemic hantavirus regions. Any transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other often random hosts is accompanied by a change in ecology, a change in the environment, possibly modulation of multiple factors influencing the pathogenic nature and virulence of the virus. The new environment puts a modified evolutionary pressure on the virus, forcing it to adapt and possibly adopt a form that is much more dangerous to other host species than the original. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Zeier, M.;Handermann, M.;Bahr, U.;Rensch, B.;MÃ¼ller, S.;Kehm, R.;Muranyi, W.;Darai, G.",2005.0,,10.1007/s11262-004-5625-2,0

2398,Molecular-based classification of bovine enteroviruses,"Bovine enteroviruses are currently classified into two serotypes within the Bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain. Comparison of the sequences of six American and eleven German BEV isolates with published BEV sequences revealed the need to revise the taxonomy of these viruses. Molecular data indicate that bovine enteroviruses consist of two clusters (referred to as BEV-A and -B) each with two and three geno-/serotypes, respectively. The low amino acid identity of the capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for differentiation of geno-/serotypes, while BEV clusters, possibly representative of species, differ in sequence identity of all viral proteins. In addition, characteristic lengths of (i) capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D, (ii) protein 2C, and (iii) 3â€² untranslated region are observed. BEVs can be distinguished from other enteroviruses by their sequence identity and unique features of the 5'² untranslated region, namely a conserved second cloverleaf and characteristic RNA structures of the internal ribosome entry site. Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of bovine enteroviruses are porcine enteroviruses.

2399,Application of genome sequence information in classification of bovine enteroviruses: importance of 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions,"Comparative genomics of viruses are well established in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. Previous nucleic acid sequence analyzes have shown that enteroviruses and rhinoviruses of the Picornaviridae family exhibit a similar structure of the 5'-untranslated region (NTR), which differs significantly from the 5'-NTR of cardiovirus, aphtovirus, hepatovirus and echovirus 22 (temporarily parecovirus). . one). The available nucleotide sequence information of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of more than 70 enterovirus, bovine enterovirus and rhinovirus serotypes was compared and correlated with previous findings obtained after analysis of the coding and non-coding genome regions. Consequently, the 5'- and 3'-NTRs of all three virus groups are characterized by group-specific nucleotide sequences. When focusing on bovine enterovirus (BEV) serotypes, unique features were observed in all secondary structures of NTRs. These features clearly distinguish BEVs from human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Regarding the 5'-NTR, the most striking feature is the insertion of about 110 nucleotides between the putative cloverleaf structure and the IRES element at the very 5'-end of the viral genome. This addition was shown for BEV I and :! and has a predictive folding pattern very similar to the 5'-cloverleaf structure. One root ring of this second cloverleaf is almost identical to the 3CD(pro)-binding domain of rhinoviral 5'-clover leaves. Moreover, IRES elements and 3'-NTRs of both enteroviruses and rhinoviruses have been shown to have group-specific features that differ significantly from the corresponding genome regions of BEV. These results indicate that bovine enteroviruses occupy an exceptional taxonomic position alongside the established Enterovirus and Rhinovirus genera. The existence of virus clusters representing subspecies within the Enterovirus and Rhinovirus genera has been suggested previously. The 5'-NTRs of the four human enterovirus clusters are divided into two groups, while all four clusters have characteristic secondary structures at the 3'-NTR, supporting the concept of enterovirus clusters. The existence of two virus clusters was confirmed for rhinoviruses.",,"Zell, R.;Stelzner, A.",1997.0,,10.1016/s0168-1702(97)00096-8,0

Therefore, to understand the possible mechanism in the interaction of REV with CEF, we performed high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis to identify functional miRNAs. In total, 50 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified. The target genes of DEmiRNAs were then predicted and identified by the transcriptome profile results. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment was performed to analyze the identified target genes of miRNAs, showing that metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis are the most relevant pathways involved in REV infection. We analyzed cell cycle-related genes showing that the CyclinD1-CDK6 complex plays an important role in regulating the transition of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase during REV infection. Fluorescent microscopy identification showed that REV inhibited CEF apoptosis, in agreement with transcriptome results. A new miRNA named Roman-72 was found, KEGG analysis was performed to predict the biological function of its target genes and showed that these target genes are significantly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway and function to promote cell cycle and cell growth during REV infection. .

The 15 different mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrheal sample, in order of nucleic acid sequence abundance, were Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-. 2, fecal-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), cobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV), and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was confirmed by PCR assay from diarrheal and healthy piglets. Piglets with diarrhea shed an average of 5.5 different viruses, and in fact one piglet was co-infected with 11 different viruses. In contrast, healthy piglets shed an average of 3.2 different viruses. A high prevalence rate of PEDV and PBoV co-infection in diarrheal samples compared with samples from healthy piglets suggests a correlation with the appearance of diarrhea in piglets. In addition, we report here for the first time the existence of several recently identified viruses and the identification of new genotypes in China.

Diverse hosts increase the likelihood of crossing the species barrier, which is a feature of emerging viruses. Among mammalian hosts, rodents are generally recognized as important reservoirs of emerging viruses. Here, rodent samples collected from six provinces and autonomous regions of China (Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Yunnan) were used to investigate the prevalence and distribution of bocaparvoviruses. First, using next-generation sequencing, the partial nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene of a possible novel bocaparvovirus was discovered. Subsequently, PCR-based screening of the NS1 gene was performed in 485 rodent samples, and 106 positive results were found in seven rodent species (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Apodemus agrarius, Cricetulus barabensis, Rattus flavipectus, Rattus rattus and Rhombomys opimus). Finally, six nearly full-length genomes and three complete CDS were obtained, and the newly identified bocaparvovirus was tentatively named rodent bocavirus (RoBoV). RoBoV has three ORFs: NS1, NP1 and VP, which are features of bocaparvoviruses. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the porcine bocavirus isolate PBoV-KU14, a member of Ungulate bocaparvovirus 4, is the virus most related to RoBoV, with 92.1-92.9% amino acid identity in the NS1 protein. Alignment of RoBoV-related sequences showed that RoBoV isolates could be classified into two clades with an inter-host genetic variation.

In this study, a transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) procedure was used to examine gene responses to PEDV infection. Genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Vero E6 cells after PEDV infection was performed. mTOR signaling pathway activator-MHY1485 and inhibitor-PP242 were used to study antiviral function. The results revealed that IRF3 was significantly upregulated after PEDV infection. While most of the IFN regulatory and IFN-related genes evaluated in this study were either downregulated or unchanged, IL11 acted significantly upregulated with a peak at 16 hpi. While approximately 90% of PEDV infections were suppressed in cells pretreated with PP242, The opposite effect was observed in cells pretreated with MYH1485.

Staphylococcus aureus infections. The latent period was about 30Â min and the burst size was about 272PFU/cell. The phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 survives in a wide pH range from 3 to 12. A treatment at 70Â°C for 20Â minutes may cause the phage to become inactive. Morphological analysis of vB_SauS_IMEP5 revealed that the vB_SauS_IMEP5 phage was morphologically similar to phages in the Siphoviridae family. Among our tested multiplicity of infections (MOIs), the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of this phage was determined as 0.001, indicating that the phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 has high bacteriolytic potential and good efficacy to reduce bacterial growth. The complete genome of IME-P5 is a 44,677-bp, linear, double-stranded DNA with 34.26% G+C content, containing 69 putative ORFs. The termini of the genome were determined by next-generation sequencing data using our previously proposed termini identification method; this indicates that this phage has 9nt 3â€² non-redundant termini with protruding sticky ends. The genomic and proteomic features of IMEP5 show that this phage does not belong to any of the previously recognized Siphoviridae Staphylococcus phage groups, suggesting the creation of a new lineage, thus adding to the knowledge about the diversity of Staphylococcus phages. One N-acetylmuramoyl-1-alanine amidase gene and several conserved genes were predicted, while no virulence or antibiotic resistance genes were identified. This study isolated and characterized a novel S. aureus phage vB_SauS_IMEP5, and our findings suggest that this phage could potentially be used as a therapeutic or prophylactic candidate against S. aureus infections.",,"Zhang, Q.;Xing, S.;Sun, Q.;Pei, G.;Cheng, S.;Liu, Y.;An, X.;Zhang, X.;Qu, Y.;Tong, Y.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1445-z,0
2419,Phylogenetic and pathotypical analysis of two virulent Newcastle disease viruses isolated from domestic ducks in China.,"In this study, two velogenic Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) from outbreaks in domestic ducks in China were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both strains clustered with class II viruses, one phylogenetically close to genotype VII NDVs and the other genotype IX. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein confirmed that both isolates contained the lethal motif 112RRQK/RRF117 at the cleavage site. Two NDVs had severe pathogenicity in fully susceptible chickens and resulted in 100% mortality. One of the isolates also showed some pathogenicity in domestic ducks. This study suggests that multiple NDV genotypes circulate in domestic ducks in China and there may be viral transmission between chickens and domestic ducks.

2420,Serological and virological investigation for evidence of infection with velogenic Newcastle disease virus in Chinese duck farms,"serological and virological study was conducted to determine the prevalence and distribution of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in Chinese duck herds. NDV infection was detected in nine of the 12 farms sampled across the two geographic regions covered by the survey. The percentage of antibody positivity among 406 serum samples was 35.7%. Three velogenic NDVs were obtained from different flocks of ducks identified by hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition tests, a pathogenicity test, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on fusion (F) genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all three isolates clustered with class II viruses; two were phylogenetically close to genotype VII NDVs and the other was more closely related to genotype IX NDVs. These findings suggest that NDV infections are common and that at least two different virulent genotypes may be responsible for recent outbreaks in Chinese duck herds.

2421,Transcript Profiling Identifies Early Response Genes to FMDV Infection in PK-15 Cells,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that causes huge economic losses worldwide. Although the protection afforded by vaccination during early infection is limited, it is considered the best method of preventing foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the mechanism of early host responses to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection remains unclear. In our study, a porcine kidney cell line (PK-15) was used as a cell model to reveal the mechanism of early porcine responses to FMDV infection. Four untreated control and four FMDV-treated PK-15 cells were sequenced by RNA-seq technology and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed. The results showed 1212° in FMDV-infected PK-15 cells, including 914 up-regulated and 298 down-regulated genes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were significantly enriched in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, NF-kappaB, and chemokine signaling pathways. To validate the results of DEGs, 30 immune-related DEGs (19 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated) were selected for Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validation. The results showed that genes measured by RT-qPCR exhibited a similar pattern as RNA-seq analyses. Based on the bioinformatic analysis, during FMDV early infection, a set of cytokines such as interleukins (IL6), chemokines (CXCL2, CCL20 and CCL4) and transcription factors (ZFP36, FOS, NFKBIA, ZBTB3, ZNF503, ZNF283), dymeclinic (DYM) and orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)) took part in the battle between FMDV and the host. Along with its characteristics and functions, we propose inflammation as the main early mechanism by which the host responds to FMDV infection. These data provide an additional panel of candidate genes to decipher the mechanisms of a host's early response to FMDV infection.",,"Zhang, T.;Chen, H.;Qi, L.;Zhang, J.;Wu, R.;Zhang, Y.;Sun, Y.",2018.0,07 11,,0
2422,Effects of PrPC on biological processes of DF-1 cells and RNA-seq-based analysis of differential genes,"To reveal the effects of PrPC on cells' biological processes and gene expression. We generated stable DF-1 (PrPC-knockdown (KD)) cells and fused them with previously generated DF-1 (wt) and DF-1 (PrPC-overexpression (OE)) cells and examined the effects of chicken PrPC (PrPC) DF -1 in the processes of cells. Next, we analyzed genes (DEGs) differentially expressed among these cells, using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS) and bioinformatics. The results show that, when compared with DF-1 (wt) and DF-1 (PrPC-scramble), DF-1 (PrPC-KD) significantly decreased in terms of adhesion, proliferation, colony formation rate and colony cell number, scratch wound. recovery rate, number of cell invasion and migration, S phase cell populations, but apoptosis rate and G1 phase cell populations were significantly increased. Conversely, it is the opposite of all these features in DF-1 (PrPC-OE). We also found a total of 1055 DE genes between DF-1 (PrPC-KD) and DF-1 (PrPC-OE) cells compared with DF-1 (wt). After Go and pathway enrichment analysis, we know that these DEGs are significantly enriched in cell, cell fragment, cellular process and metabolic pathway. In short, we found that PrPC can promote processes of DF-1 cells other than apoptosis. Moreover, PrPC involves focal adhesion, cancer, ribosome, metabolic pathways and so on, and overexpression of PrPC can promote the amoebiasis pathway, but its downregulation can promote the serotonergic synapse pathway. However, the details are unknown and this will be our next investigation.",,"Zhang, T. L.;Wan, X. R.;Wu, R.;Wang, C.",2018.0,Oct,,0
2423,Evolution and variation of the H3 gene of influenza A virus and interaction between hosts,"Objective: Continuous mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A virus produce new antigenic strains that cause annual epidemics. The aim of this study is to evaluate the evolutionary trend of the H3 gene over a long period of time. Methods: 1842 H3 HA1 nucleotide strains of different hosts were collected for analysis. A two-step clustering method was used to group the strains into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the cluster results. The rate of evolution in lineages was predicted in the future. Results: The tree structure showed three lineages: horse/dog, human/pig, and bird. As a single trunk, the human/pig lineage consisted mainly of human lineages, and larger branches have emerged in recent years. The tree topology showed no evidence that pig influenced the major evolutionary trend of human H3 strains. The evolutionary rate of H3 strains varied between lineages. We observed that the proportion in the human lineage decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. Conclusion: We conclude that human H3 gene variation is associated with swine strains but independent of others including avian strains. Although the evolution rate of human H3 strains seems to have decreased in recent years, the reasons for the change in rate need to be further investigated. Copyright © 2007 S.

Antibodies to HEV and HEV RNA have been detected in some Chinese population and pig groups, but few other domestic animals. In this study, we tested serum for anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 788 pigs, 100 cows, 50 goats, 49 horses, 101 domestic dogs, 105 chickens, 47 ducks and 45 pigeons in eastern China to investigate the prevalence of HEV. . We also tested 50% of pig serum positive for anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) for HEV RNA, all serum from other domestic animals, and 13 Shanghai human serums using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that 82.5% (222/269) of pigs, 53.9% (104/193) of pigs 4 to 6 months old, 63.4% (168/265) of pigs 1 to 3 months old . old pig, 55.7% (34/61) of slaughter pigs, 24% (12/50) of goats, 16.3% (8/49) of horses, 17.8% of domestic dogs ( 21/101), 6% of cows (6/100), 12.8% of ducks (6/47), 4.4% of pigeons (2/45) and 1.9% of chickens (2/ 105) showed anti-HEV IgG positivity. The inhibition test confirmed infection with HEV or HEV-like viruses in these domestic animals except pigeons and chickens. We isolated 18 porcine HEV strains, one equine HEV strain, and two human HEV strains from greenhouses. Sequence analysis showed that a horse HEV isolate and a pig isolate belonged to genotype 3. Other isolates belonged to genotype 4. The two human isolates were phylogenetically closely related to the eight pig isolates. In short, the presence of anti-HEV antibody was confirmed in various domestic animal species in eastern China, and HEV RNA was detected in pig, human and horse.

Viral infections have become a potential threat to the health of these endangered animals, but limited information is available regarding these infections. Methods: Using a viral metagenomic approach, we investigated viruses in the faeces, nasopharyngeal secretions, blood, and different tissues of a wild giant panda that had died of an unknown disease, a healthy wild giant panda, and 46 healthy captive animals. Results: Previously uncharacterized complete or near-complete genomes of four viruses from three genera in the Papillomaviridae family, six viruses in a proposed novel Picornaviridae genus (Aimelvirus), two unclassified viruses associated with pulpaviruses in the Picornaviridae order, 19 anellovirus families in four different divisions of Anelloviridae, four putative circoviruses, and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described Genomoviridae family were sequenced. Numerous insect virus sequences belonging to the subfamilies Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iridoviridae, Baculoviridae, Polydnaviridae and Densovirinae, reflecting the diet of giant pandas, and plant virus sequences belonging to the families Tombusviridae, Partitiviridae, Secoviridae, Geminiviridae, Luteoviridae and Rhabdoviridae, Virgadoviridae; Umbravirus, Alphaflexiviridae and Phycodnaviridae genera were also detected in stool samples. A small number of insect virus sequences were also detected in the nasopharyngeal secretions of healthy giant pandas and lung tissues from dead wild giant panda. Although viral families in the sick giant panda were also detected in healthy ones, higher rates of papillomavirus, picornavirus and anellovirus readings were detected in the sick panda. Conclusion: This viral research increases our understanding of eukaryotic viruses in giant pandas and provides a basis for comparison with viruses detected in future infectious disease outbreaks.

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm infection. Embryo chicken eggs were used for virus isolation from pharyngeal swabs taken from infected human patients. H7N9 isolates were first identified by hemagglutination testing and electron microscopy, then used for whole genome sequencing.

Extensive studies of HIV-1 have revealed several strategies the virus uses to evade host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1 infected individuals at genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels through deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequencing analysis to determine the frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV. 1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs). METHODS: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1 infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deeply sequenced and sequences analyzed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action). The frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in their use of heavy and light chain V-gene sequences than cDNA libraries; This indicates that human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have greater potential than cDNA repertoires for developing HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions with V(D)J recombinations identical to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. However, regardless of (D)J-gene use, we found relatively high frequencies of heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions using the same V-genes and having the same CDR3 lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs. B cells bearing B cell receptors of such heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions can be stimulated to induce HIV-1 bnAbs.

By RT-PCR, the full-length cDNA of the envelope gene of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (exJSRV-env) was amplified from the extract of naturally infected sheep lung. The clone of the target gene was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression system pEGFP-C1 and verified by PCR, restriction endonuclease and sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of the biological function and cellular localization of exJSRV-env was also performed. The recombinant clone of exJSRV-env was transfected with Lipofectamine LTX into 293T cells and NIH3T3 cells. Expression and cellular localization in 293T cells were confirmed by confocal microscopy. The soft agar colony formation assay was used to test the anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3. DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion with Kpn I and Hind III showed the correct structure of the recombinant plasmid named pEGFP-C1/exJSRV-env. Amino acid sequence alignment of exJSRV-env with reference sequences found 85-100% homogeneity. A YRNM motif found only in exogenous viruses was discovered in the cytoplasmic tail of the envelope gene. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that our exJSRV-env clone clustered closely with pathogenic exogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses. Fluorescence microscopy showed typical membrane localization of the exJSRV-env protein. NIH3T3 cells transfected with exJSRV-env lost contact inhibition and gained the ability to form colonies on soft agar.

2440,A simple method for high-throughput quantification of genome-wide DNA methylation by fluorescence polarization.,"To rapidly determine DNA methylation levels from large numbers of biological or clinical samples, we developed an accurate and sensitive method for high-throughput quantification of global methylation of 5'-Cm(5) CGG-3' regions in the genome, visualized by fluorescence polarization of DNA methylation (FPDM). with FP) based measurement. In FPDM, methyl-sensitive HpaII and methyl-insensitive MspI restriction enzymes were used to induce DNA cleavage, followed by incorporation of fluorescent dCMP into enzyme cleavage products via polymerase chain extension, resulting in a ratio of FP between HpaII- and MspI. - limited preparations as a measure of methylation. FPDM provided stable estimates of the methylation level of submicrograms of lambda or human DNA and a 255-bp DNA segment containing a single HpaII/MspI restriction site that is more accurate than and suitable for detection by gel electrophoresis. FPDM was also applied to measure dose-dependent DNA hypomethylation in human embryonic kidney 293T cells treated with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC.",,"Zhao, C.;Xue, H.",2012.0,Apr,,0
2441,Unfolded protein response induced by Tembusu virus infection,"OBJECTIVE: Tembusu virus (TMUV), classified in the Flavivirus genus, causes decreased egg production and neurological problems in poultry. Flavivirus replication is dependent on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress leading to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an important signaling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved in viral pathogenesis and innate immunity. However, the mechanism of TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we systematically investigated three UPR pathways in TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that the expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 is upregulated during TMUV infection. Next, we show that TMUV activates the PERK pathway in the early phase of infection, resulting in the upregulation of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP with the induction of CHOP leading to caspase-3 activation. We also found that the IRE1 pathway was activated, leading to splicing of X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and increased expression of p58IPK. Finally, we observed increased expression of ATF6 and activity of ER stress-response elements, suggesting stimulation of the ATF6 pathway. In addition, ATF6 pathway activation correlates with the induction of the downstream chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57 and PDI. UPR activity was also observed in TMUV-infected DF-1 cells with marked elevation of GRP78 and sXBP1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that ER stress induced by TMUV infection activates three branches of the UPR, and these results provide the basis for elucidating the pathogenesis of TMUV and understanding the host response as well as the natural mechanism of TMUV infection.",,"Zhao, D.;Yang, J.;Han, K.;Liu, Q.;Wang, H.;Liu, Y.;Huang, X.;Zhang, L.;Li, Y.",2019.0,,10.1186/s12917-019-1781-4,0
2442,Transcriptomic analysis of porcine PBMCs in response to FMDV infection,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important zoonotic infectious disease. It has a significant economic impact worldwide. It is also a significant threat to food security. At present, the molecular mechanism of FMDV infection is largely unclear. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against infectious diseases. Systematic analysis of the host immune response to infection has an important role in understanding the pathogenesis of infection. However, there are few reports on the effect of immune regulation in virus and host cellular interaction on virus replication. As a powerful and efficient tool for transcript analysis, high-throughput RNA-seq technology provides a new perspective on FMDV study. In this study, RNA extracted from porcine PBMCs infected with O subtype FMDV at 4 dpi. A total of 29942658 and 31452917 Illumina read pairs were obtained from the uninfected (NI) group and the infected (I) group, respectively. The clean bases for all samples are 3.61G (NI group) and 3.79G (I group), respectively. The clean reads of NI and group I mapped to pig genome data were 47195073 (81.82%) and 46556714 (76.85%), respectively. Most of the clean reads were distributed in the exon region, followed by the intron region and the intergenic region. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using edgeR software. 451 genes were differentially expressed between the infected and uninfected groups. According to the comparison analysis, more genes were down-regulated in uninfected samples than in FMDV-infected ones. Of 451 genes, 66 were down-regulated, followed by FMDV infection, 385 of 451 genes were up-regulated. For function classification and pathway analysis, among the 17741 merged unigenes, there were 349 genes with distinct genes of GO annotations. Also, 49 genes were down-regulated, 300 genes were up-regulated in relation to the GO term. 1621 was successfully annotated by GO designations that belonged to one or more of three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. According to the KEGG analysis, the major pathway involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, cell cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was represented. Some key DE genes related to the immune process and signaling pathways were analyzed and quantified by RT-PCR. This is the first systematic transcriptome analysis of FMDV-infected porcine PBMCs. These findings will help us better understand the host Cell-FMDV interaction and its relationship to pathogenesis, and will also contribute to the prevention and control of FMDV.",,"Zhao, F.

2443,Characterization of an H6N6 influenza virus isolated from pigs in China.,"There is ample evidence that swine can act as a vessel for the generation of new influenza A viruses. In this study, we analyzed the evolution and pathogenicity of an H6N6 influenza virus strain isolated from pigs with clinical signs of infection in China. Although phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus could originate from domestic ducks, pathogenicity experiments showed that the virus replicated in mice without prior adaptation. These findings suggest that the virus was transmitted from ducks to pigs in China and replicated in mammalian hosts without prior adaptation, which could pose a threat to both veterinary and public health. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Zhao, G.;Chen, C.;Huang, J.;Wang, Y.;Peng, D.;Liu, X.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.06.013,0

2445,Molecular evolution of H6 subtype influenza a viruses from poultry in eastern China from 2002 to 2010.,"Background: Although extensive data indicate that the majority of H6 duck isolates belonged to a single H6N2 virus strain with a single gene constellation in southern China from 2000 to 2005, the prevalence of H6N2 virus in poultry in eastern China is largely unknown. Results: Epidemiology revealed that H6N2 viruses were the most frequently detected influenza subtype in live bird markets in eastern China from 2002 to 2008, but from 2009 they were replaced by new H6N6 viruses. We analyzed phylogenetically and antigenically 42 H6 viruses isolated mainly in domestic ducks from 2002 to 2010 in eastern China. Surprisingly, none of these isolates grouped with previously described H6N2 viruses, which belonged to a single H6N2 virus strain with a single gene constellation in South China domestic ducks from 2000 to 2005. multiple virus subtypes from the natural gene pool, but few reassortants were persistent or widespread. Conclusions: In eastern China, five subtypes of H6 influenza viruses (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, and H6N8) circulate together, constituting a significant part of the natural reservoir of influenza virus in domestic ducks, and significant viral reclassification in this species is still ongoing. © 2011Zhao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Zhao, G.;Lu, X.;Gu, X.;Zhao, K.;Song, Q.;Pan, J.;Xu, Q.;Duan, Z.;Peng, D.;Hu, S.;Wang, X.;Liu, X.",2011.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-8-470,0
2446,Bayesian evolutionary characterization of the VP1 sequence of Coxsackievirus A16 isolates,"Background: Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), an important etiopathological cause of pediatric hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide, has been reported to cause several deaths. Uncovering the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of CV-A16 in time and space is crucial to understanding its epidemic potential. Methods: In this study, we isolated six CV-A16 strains in Jilin province, China, and constructed a maximum clan confidence (MCC) tree for the CV-A16 VP1 gene by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using 708 strains from GenBank with epidemiological information. The evolutionary features of the CV-A16 VP1 gene were also dynamically analyzed via Bayesian silhouette plot. Results: All identified CV-A16 strains can be classified into five major genogroups denoted by GI-GV. GIV and GV have been in common circulation in China since 2007, and the CV-A16 outbreak strain isolated in Jilin province of China can be classified as GIV-3. The CV-A16 genogroups recently circulating in China have the same ancestry since 2007. The genetic diversity of the CV-A16 VP1 gene has been increasing steadily since the mid-1990s, with sharp increases in genetic diversity in 1997 and 2007, and has peaked in recent years. 2007. There was very low genetic diversity after 2010. The CV-A16 VP1 gene evolution rate was 6,656E-3 substitutions per site per year.

2447,Metagenomic Analysis of Jinding Duck Fecal Virome,"Ducks play an important role in the transmission and protection of mammalian viruses in nature and are reservoir hosts of many animal viruses. We analyzed fecal virus of four duck strains (A, B, C and D) living in isolation using metagenomic analysis. The feces of the tested ducks contained 18 families of animal viruses. Percentage values of RNA virus reads compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01% (C), and 67.49% (D), and were primarily Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae and reoviridae Meanwhile, the paucity of DNA virus reads was associated with Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae and other low abundance viral families. The percent values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae readings were not significantly different between strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study provides an unbiased examination of viral diversity in faeces of four duck strains during specific pathogen-free periods and the percentage of viral families present.

2458,Characteristics of codon usage bias at two sites downstream of the initiation codons of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"The mechanism of use of the two alternative AUGs in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is still unknown to date. In this study, the features of codon usage bias (CUB) of the region between two AUGs (region-La) and the same-sized region behind the second AUG (region-Lb) in 94 different FMDV RNA sequences were determined. analyzed using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values. The results showed that many codons with negative CUB were used preferentially in the -La region. There were two conserved residues (Thr and Cys) at residue positions 4 and 6 of the La region. Conserved residues had a general tendency to select codons synonymous with negative CUB. Although most positions in the -La region did not contain conserved residues, many positions tended to use codons with negative CUBs in this region. The majority of these codons belonged to amino acids containing codons synonymous with clearly positive and negative CUB, including Asp, Val, Ile, Leu, Thr, Ala, Ser, Asn, and Arg. The presence of many codons with negative CUB in the La region may impair the efficiency of the initial AUG selection. The phylogenetic mismatch of region-La and region-Lb implied that intertype recombination played an important role in the evolution of FMDV. Also, due to the presence of more positions with positive CUB and more widespread phylogenetic incompatibility in the -Lb region than in the -La region, a possible association between the degree of CUB and the evolution of the two target regions emerged. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",,"Zhou, J.

We examine four RNA-binding proteins of phage, viral and human origin. Our approach uncovers regulatory motifs, distinguishes between edited and unedited RNAs in their native genomic context, and accurately predicts the outcome of mutational events on binding activity. We design binding elements that increase binding activity in cells and infer mutational pathways between regulated motifs that reveal permissive and destructive evolutionary trajectories.

2462,MicroRNA expression profile in alveolar macrophages of native Chinese Tongcheng pigs infected with PRRSV in vivo,"Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS), caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), is one of the most serious infectious diseases in the swine industry worldwide. Native Chinese Tongcheng (TC) pigs are reported to show strong resistance to PRRSV infection. The miRNA expression profiles of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) of control TC pigs and those infected with PRRSV in vivo were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to investigate infection-induced changes. A total of 182 known miRNAs, including 101 miRNA-5p and 81 miRNA-3p, were identified with 23 upregulated differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 25 downregulated DEmiRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the predicted target genes for DEmiRNAs were enriched in immune response, transcription regulation, and cell death. Integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed that downregulated methylation-related genes (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were targeted by five upregulated DEmiRNAs. Moreover, 35 pairs of miRNAs (70 miRNAs) were co-expressed after PRRSV infection and six pairs were differentially co-expressed. Our results describe the miRNA expression profiles of TC pigs in response to PRRSV infection and provide a strong basis for developing new treatments to control PRRS in pigs.",,"Zhou, X.;Michal, J.

2464,Molecular characterization of a novel bat-associated circovirus by a poly-T pathway in the 3â€² intergenic region,"The Circoviridae family includes a large group of small circular single-stranded DNA viruses, several members of which cause serious swine and poultry diseases. In recent years, the number of new viruses within the family has increased explosively, showing a high level of genetic diversity and a wide host range. In this report, we describe two more circoviruses detected from bats in Yunnan and Heilongjiang provinces, China. Whole genome sequencing revealed that these bat-associated circoviruses (bat ACV) should be classified as new species within the genus Circovirus based on the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) limitation criteria. The most striking result is the new finding of the 21-28 nt polythymidine (poly-T) pathway in the 3-2 terminal intergenic region of bat ACV isolates from Heilongjiang province. To understand its role in viral replication, a wild-type bat ACV and a mutated version with all deletion of poly-T were rescued by constructing infectious clones. In vitro replication comparison showed that poly-T is not required for viral replication. The identification of additional bat ACV isolates and the study of their biological characteristics will be the main task to understand the potential roles of bats in the transmission of circoviruses to terrestrial mammals and humans in the future.",,"Zhu, A.;Jiang, T.;Hu, T.;Mi, S.;Zhao, Z.;Zhang, F.;Feng, J.;Fan, Q.;He, B.;Tu, C.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.04.012,0
2465,Comparative genomic analysis identifies structural features of CRISPR-Cas systems in Riemerella anatipestifer,"Background: Riemerella anatipestifer infection is a contagious disease that causes great economic losses to the duck industry worldwide. This study sought to characterize CRISPR-Cas systems in the disease-causing agent Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer). The CRISPR-Cas system confers adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes, and CRISPR-cas loci are commonly found in archaeal and bacterial genomes. However, the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems have not been clarified due to the limited availability of genomic data. Results: To identify structures and components associated with CRISPR-Cas systems in R. anatipestifer, we performed comparative genomic analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems in 25 R. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that most of the analyzed R. anatipestifer strains (20/25) had two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). CRISPR1 has been shown to be flanked by cas genes on one side, while CRISPR2 has been designated orphan. Other strains analyzed harbored only one locus, either CRISPR1 or CRISPR2. The length and content of the consensus direct repeat sequences and the length of the spacer sequences associated with the two loci differed. Only three cas genes (cas1, cas2 and cas9) were inserted upstream of CRISPR1. CRISPR1 was also shown to be flanked by a 107 bp long putative leader sequence and a 16 nt long anti-repeat sequence. Combined with analysis of the spacer organization similarity and phylogenetic tree of R. anatipestifer strains, CRISPR sequences can be subdivided into distinct subgroups. Diversity of spacer organization was observed in the same subgroup. Overall, spacer organization in CRISPR1 was different than in CRISPR2. In addition, only 8% (13/153) of the spacers were homologous to phage or plasmid sequences. The cas operon surrounding CRISPR1 was observed to be relatively conserved based on multiple sequence alignments of Cas amino acid sequences. Cas9-related phylogenetic analysis showed that the Cas9 sequence from R. anatipestifer is closely related to Bacteroides fragilis and forms part of the II-C subset. Conclusions: Our data revealed for the first time the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems. Elucidating the structural features of the CRISPR-Cas system may aid in studying the specific mechanism associated with CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in R.",,"Zhu, D.

2467,Origins and Evolutionary Dynamics of the H3N2 Canine Flu Virus,"UNLABELED: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are primarily found in wild birds, and despite the frequent spread of infections by avian IAVs to mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new avian H3N2 canine flu virus (CIV) emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations in China, South Korea and possibly Thailand. The emergence of CIV offers new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes, along with all CIV genomes available to the public, from their initial isolation to 2013. We show that CIV may have emerged as a result of segment reclassification between Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages as early as 1999. We also identified amino acid changes, some of which were not previously identified in other interspecies jumps, that may have played a role in the emergence of CIV. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses, and viral phylogenies display geographic structure consistent with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reclassification events, including acquisition of the NS segment of a previously overlooked H5N1 avian influenza virus. In summary, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to settle in mammals, and also highlight the potential role of dogs, particularly to act as intermediate hosts from which, by an approximate estimate, viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential can emerge. ~700 million dog population. IMPORTANT: Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multi-host ecology has important implications, as past pandemics have been caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to interspecies jumps, and therefore understanding the evolutionary processes that have shaped influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms underlying viral emergence. An avian canine flu virus (CIV) has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading across Asia. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and showed that it originated in both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified mutations that may be responsible for the interspecies jump. Finally, we present evidence of multiple reclassification events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is a cause for concern as there is a large global dog population to which humans are highly exposed.",,"Zhu, H.;Hughes, J.;Murcia, P. R.",2015.0,May,,0

From January to March 2010, we conducted a study of avian influenza viruses at nine semi-artificial waterfowl farms in Poyang Lake. Three H3N2 and one H4N6 influenza virus were isolated from healthy mallards from 1036 cloacal swabs collected. All isolates were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Analysis of putative HA cleavage sites showed that all four isolates had molecular characteristics of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus (QTRGL for H3N2 viruses, PEKASR for H4N6 virus). Phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes showed that all four virus isolates clustered in the Eurasian influenza viruses branch. The M gene of the viruses had the highest homology with the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses. Also, co-infection of H3N2 and H4N6 was observed in the same farm. And interestingly, we isolated two subtypes of viruses (H3N2 and H4N6) and their progeny virus (H3N2) with evidence of genome reclassification from the same farm, in which the PB1 and PB2 gene segments of H4N6 replace those of the H3N2 strain. Results of animal infection experiments showed that all four isolated viruses were low pathogenic to chickens and nonpathogenic to mice; this was consistent with the results of the genetic analysis.",,"Zhu, N.;Zhao, J.

2470,Phylogenetic and pathogenic analysis of Newcastle disease virus isolated from house sparrow (Passer domesticus) living around poultry farm in southern China.,"The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is one of the most common wild birds in China. Five strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were isolated from house sparrows living around poultry farms in southern China. These isolates were characterized by pathogenic testing and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that all NDV isolates except one were velogenic and virulent for chickens. For chickens, these four virulent strains have the amino acid sequence 112R/KRQK/RR-F117 at the F0 cleavage site typical of velogenic NDV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates belong to genotype VII and are closely related to strains isolated from NDV outbreaks in chickens since 2000. An NDV isolate from the house sparrow was proven to belong to genotype II and to be a vaccine strain (Chicken/US/LaSota/46). The result of this study proved that the house sparrow can carry virulent strains of NDV and that the same genotype viruses circulating in poultry are also found in house sparrows living around the poultry farm in southern China.

2473,Selected microRNA-192 mutant shows association with several function genes in bovine cells,"MicroRNAs are involved in many cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development, tumorigenesis, and immune regulation. In this study, miR192 was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) when MDBK cells were exposed to Escherichia coli. bta-miR-192 defective cells were generated using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Finally, bta-miR-192 mutant cells were screened for differentially expressed genes using RNA sequencing (RNA sequencing). The results showed that miR192 was significantly reduced in cells exposed to E. coli F18ac and E. coli K88ac. RNA-seq results showed that 1673 differentially expressed transcripts were identified; 890 genes were upregulated and 775 genes were downregulated. By gene ontology enrichment analysis, 431 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into 937 gene ontology terms. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that 535 genes were located in 254 pathway terms. Interestingly, many of these DEGs were associated with pathways in cancers or infectious diseases. When DEGs (n = 162) selected in these pathways intersected with 120 differential transcripts, 11° were identified. Subsequently, several genes associated with regulation, cancers or viral infections, such as LEF1, AXIN2, MX1 and FCGR2B, were identified among DEGs using functional analysis. Furthermore, relationships between bta-miR-192 and DEGs were detected by crossing the target genes of bta-miR-192 with DEGs; this indicates that three genes are involved in this association, including CBL, DICER1 and TRERF1.

Based on environmental surveillance data on poultry in mainland China from 2013 to 2016, a total of 68 representative environmental isolates were selected and systematically further investigated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that during 2013-2016 Y280-like H9N2 viruses predominated and acquired multiple specific amino acid substitutions that could support viral transmission from birds to mammals. In addition, viruses have undergone dramatic evolution and reclassification, resulting in increased genetic diversity or acting as gene contributors to new avian viruses.

In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was applied to investigate systemic transcriptome responses of mouse lungs infected with porcine (Jia6/10) and human (LN/09) H1N1/2009 viruses. The transcriptome data indicate that Jia6/10 activates stronger virus detection signals such as toll-like receptor, RIG-I-like receptor, and NOD-like receptor signals, as well as a stronger NF-ÎºB and JAK-STAT signals. They play an important role in stimulating innate immunity. Most cytokine and interferon-stimulated genes show a higher expression arm in Jia/06 infected groups. Meanwhile, the virus Jia6/10 activates the stronger production of reactive oxygen species, which can further increase the higher mutation rate of the virus genome.

The viruses are derived from ducks and guinea pigs with relatively severe respiratory symptoms from the eastern part of Hungary. In addition to the hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H4, H5, H6, H7, and H10) defined by serological methods at that time, neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were also identified by genetic analysis (table). Based on the amino acid pattern in the proteolytic cleavage site of HA, all H5 and H7 strains were determined to belong to the low pathogenicity (LP) category. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA, and NS genes allowed the following epidemiological conclusions to be drawn. (1) All Hungarian strains belonged to the Eurasian lineage of AIV. (2) H5 strains were members of an ancient European group (Fig. 1). H4 strains (Figure 2) originated from three different sources (two from the Far East, one from Europe). (3) The fact that most viruses in the H4 and H5 subtypes were reassortant (some even more than one; Figure 3) suggested that their reservoirs were probably domestic ducks and not wild waterfowl.

A panel of 123 rabies viruses from two host species between 1980 and 2006 was characterized by the nucleotide sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein gene and the noncoding GL intergenic region. Through phylogenetic analysis, a viral cluster unique to black-backed coyotes and spanning a 5-year period was identified in western Limpopo. The virus strains associated with domestic dogs predominate in densely populated common areas in northeastern Limpopo and in southern and eastern Mpumalanga. The data presented in this study demonstrated the possibility that black-backed coyotes could sustain rabies cycles independently of domestic dogs.

2481,Novel Picornavirus Associated with Avian Keratin Disorder in Alaskan Birds,"UNLABELED: Avian keratin disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the bird's beak, was first documented in the black-capped bird (Poecile atricapillus) from Alaska. Later, similar deformations of a large number of species appeared on the continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of ACD remains unclear. As a result, it is unknown whether cases of suspected ACD in the affected species are causally linked, and the effects of this pathology at population and community levels are difficult to assess. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to look for candidate pathogens in birds affected by AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a new picornavirus, which we call poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 black-capped birds and 9 control individuals affected by ACD for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) ACD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9 (22%) control individuals were infected. poecivirus Two northwest crows (Corvus caurinus) and two red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) with pathology consistent with AKD also tested positive for poecivirus. We propose that Poecivirus is the candidate etiologic agent of AKD. IMPORTANCE: Avian keratin disorder (AKD) is an increasingly common disease in wild birds. Characterized by beak overgrowth, this disease was first described in the late 1990s and is spreading rapidly, both geographically and in terms of affected host species. AKD reduces host fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive and its impact on host populations is not fully understood. We found a new and different picornavirus in the 19/19 AKD-affected black-capped bird we studied, but only in 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals from 2 other passerine species exhibiting symptoms consistent with ACD. Our data indicate that this new picornavirus warrants further investigation as the causative agent of AKD.",,"Zylberberg, M.;Van Hemert, C.;Dumbacher, J. P.;Handel, C. M.;Tihan, T.;DeRisi, J.
