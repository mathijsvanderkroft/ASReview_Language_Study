1,"Binding Selectivity of Methanobactinin from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b for Copper(I), Silver(I), Zinc(II), Nickel(II), Cobalt(II), Manganese(II), Lead(II) and Iron(II)","Methanobactin (Mb) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a member of a class of metal-binding peptides identified in methanotrophic bacteria. Mb will selectively bind and reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) and is thought to mediate the acquisition of the copper cofactor for the methane monooxygenase enzyme. These copper chelating properties of Mb make it potentially useful as a chelating agent for the treatment of diseases in which copper plays a role, including Wilson's disease, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Competition for Mb copper binding site from Ag(I), Pb(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Ni(II) using traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TWIMS), and Zn(II) was determined by a series of metal ion titrations, pH titrations, and metal ion displacement titrations. TWIMS analyzes allowed the unambiguous identification and quantification of all individual Mb species present during the titrations and quantified their collision cross-sections and collision-induced dissociation patterns. The results showed that Ag(I) and Ni(II) can bind irreversibly to Mb and not be effectively displaced by Cu(I), whereas Ag(I) can partially replace Cu(I) from the Mb complex. . At pH = 6.5, the Mb binding selectivity follows the order Ag(I)=Cu(I)>Ni(II)=Zn(II)>Co(II)>>Mn(II)=Pb(II)>Fe(. II) and at pH 7.5 to 10.4 the order is Ag(I)>Cu(I)>Ni(II)>Co(II)>Zn(II)>Mn(II)=Pb(II)>Fe(II) . ). The fragmentation curves of disulfide-reduced Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes showed a correlation between their relative stability and compact folded structure as indicated by their CCS. Fluorescence spectroscopy, which allows determination of the binding constant, compares well with TWIMS analyzes except for the Ni(II) complex. Graphic abstract.",,"McCabe, J.

2,Characteristics and prevalence of Wilson's disease: an observational population-based study in France in 2013.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, only a few epidemiological studies have been conducted on the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD), and results vary widely according to reports. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, outpatient care and treatment of patients with WD in France. METHODS: Among 58 million general health program beneficiaries (86% of the French population), persons administered for WH in 2013 were identified using diagnosis of hospitalization in 2011-2013 or certain long-term disease states with 100% reimbursement for certain health services . 2013. Data obtained from Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). Prevalence was calculated according to age and gender. RESULTS: In 2013, 906 common cases were identified, resulting in a crude prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 for men and 1.44 per 100,000 for women. This prevalence is comparable to that reported in other population-based studies in European countries and a study using a similar method. Approximately 40% of patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% were treated with zinc acetate. Trientine delivered on the basis of compassion was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients had a liver transplant and 4% had a liver transplant in previous years. 15 percent of patients took antidepressants at a higher rate than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population based on administrative data and represents an important step towards understanding the impact of WD and examining quality of care.",,"Poujois, A.;Woimant, F.;Samson, S.;Chaine, P.;Girardot-Tinant, N.;Tuppin, P.",2017,2022-06-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2017.05.011,0,1,
3,Treatment modality and potential outcome for Wilson's disease in Taiwan: A population-based longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, drug preference and possible consequences of Wilson's disease in Taiwan. Based on the data from this study, we aimed to provide better treatment options for patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which maintains the clinical records of approximately 99% of Taiwanese residents. The database used is a random sample of two million out of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD region in 2005. Integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson's disease, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and specific prescription drugs (including d-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in the outpatient or inpatient registry. RESULTS: During the study, 66 cases of Wilson's disease were detected. The male female ratio was 1.75. The mean prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the mean annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was mostly made at the ages of 20-24 and 10-14, followed by the ages of 25-29. Fifty-four (81.8%) of all subjects started treatment with d-penicillamine compared to zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Liver transplantation was performed in 27 (40.9%) of these 66 cases due to liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) due to liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: d-penicillamine is still the most popular prescription for Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a positive potential outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study. Copyright Â© 2017. Published by Elsevier BV",,"Tai, C. S.;Wu, J.

4,"Early history of manganese and recognition of its neurotoxicity, 1837-1936","Biomedical recognition reflects technologies ranging from the history of manganese-induced neurotoxicity to the ontology of parkinsonism. The first 1837 report of neurological injury from manganese was made by John Couper, a doctor at the university in Scotland. He made it clear that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach factory near Glasgow. The relatively new technology of chlorine production using manganese was responsible for the new exposure involved. At that time this factory was the world's largest producer of hypochlorite bleach powder. As the 19th century progressed, the technological change in steel production requiring higher manganese content greatly increased the demand for the metal. However, more than six decades passed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity appeared. Two unrelated outbreaks (both in Continental Europe) were reported within weeks in 1901, one by von Jaksch and the other by Embden. All cases were heavily exposed to dust containing manganese. On the eve of the First World War, a total of 9 patients with manganese-induced neurological disease were reported in five separate Continental European publications. Meanwhile, new technology has given way to another source of exposure. Magnetic separation techniques also allowed the extraction of zinc from mixed ore containing iron and manganese, leading to the exploitation of a unique high manganese content ore resource found in New Jersey. Shortly after the introduction of this technology, in 1912 Casamajor reported the first US cases of manganism detailing the classical findings. Several years later, additional cases were reported from the same cohort, and continued exposure due to World War I demand for manganese for use in armaments. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity remained in flux only with great emphasis on common features with Wilson's disease, a recently described syndrome. A groundbreaking 1924 primate study by Mella demonstrated manganese-induced basal ganglia damage; Human autopsy study data in the years that followed further supported the view that manganese toxicity represented a Parkinson's syndrome. As the 1937 centenary of Couper's first report approaches, newer technologies (electric arc welding and battery making) have been linked to manganese-related diseases, even as mineral extraction is expanding as a global source of exposure.

5,Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Few studies of zinc monotherapy for presymptomatic Wilson's disease have focused on young children. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for such children and established criteria for maintenance therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively and prospectively examined children under 10 years of age with presymptomatic Wilson's disease who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met the entry criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly reduced starting 1 month after the start of treatment and generally remained below 50 U/L after 1 to 8 years of treatment. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and generally remained below 75 microg/day and between 1 and 3 microg/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc and none became symptomatic. In patients younger than 6 years of age receiving 50 mg/day of zinc as an initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly reduced at 1 month after the start of treatment, and gamma-glutamyltransferase and 24-hour urinary copper at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease. Such monotherapy has proven to be quite effective and safe. It is a reasonable target to maintain normal transaminase values (or values below 50 U/L, which is difficult to normalize) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 microg/kg/day and below 75 microg/day. A starting dose of 50 mg/day is suitable for patients under 6 years of age. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

6,[Elastosis Perforans Serpiginosa and Wilson's Disease: A Rare But Predictable Outcome of Long-Term Treatment with D-Penicillamine],"Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is a rare perforating dermatosis characterized by transepidermal elimination of abnormal elastic fibers, mainly found in adolescents and young adults. The only drug known to induce elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is D-penicillamine. We present a 52-year-old female patient with keratotic papules located in the anterior cervical region, in an annular pattern with central clarification and centrifugal enlargement. The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. The lesion biopsy showed transepidermal elimination of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-like elastic fibers. Clinical and pathological findings were consistent with elastosis perfurans serpiginosa secondary to D-penicillamine. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is estimated to occur in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. D-penicillamine directly or indirectly blocks the desmosine cross-links between elastin molecules, leading to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa may be the first manifestation of a multisystemic degenerative process of elastic connective tissue.",,"Castro Pinho, A.;Cardoso, J.

7,Combination Therapy Using Chelation Agent and Zinc for Wilson's Disease,"There is no clear international consensus on the optimal drug therapy for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). This study systematically reviews the efficacy of various commonly used drug therapies, focusing specifically on the preliminary findings regarding a chelating agent and zinc combination. A systematic PubMed search was conducted between January 1989 and August 2014 to find original studies of the efficacy of commonly used drugs for WD. The results were used to conduct a systematic review of studies on combination therapies. A total of 17 combination therapy studies involving 1056 patients were reviewed. These were analyzed for data on efficacy, adverse events, and mortality. Results from a pooled analysis show that combination treatments for liver disease are significantly less effective than the same treatments for neurological symptoms (47.1% vs. 78.6%; pooled relative hazard ratio (RR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval CI 0.43- 0.94; p = 0.02). Data from a subgroup analysis show that penicillamine plus zinc sulfate combination therapy resulted in a significantly higher mortality rate than all other types of combination therapy (4.7% vs 16.3%; RR: 3.51, 95% CI 1.54-8.00; p < 0.001). The use of combination therapies containing zinc and a chelator should be carefully monitored with close clinical observation and frequent biochemical testing, especially for WD patients with hepatic manifestations.",,"Chen, J.

8,Long-term effects of a combination of D-penicillamine and zinc salts in the treatment of Wilson's disease in children,"The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a combination of high-dose zinc sulfate and low-dose D-penicillamine in the treatment of pediatric Wilson's disease (WD). A retrospective chart review of 65 patients with WD was performed. These patients were given D-penicillamine (8-10 mg/kg/day) and zinc sulfate as primary treatment. Pediatric elemental zinc dose is 68-85 mg/day up to 6 years of age, 85-136 mg/day up to 8 years of age, 136-170 mg/day up to 10 years of age, and then 170 mg/day. 3 divided doses 1 hour before meals. After clinical and biochemical improvement or stabilization, zinc sulfate alone was administered as maintenance therapy. Positive results were obtained in the majority of patients (89.2%) under treatment, and 3 patients died due to poor treatment compliance. Penicillamine-induced neurological deterioration was not noted and adverse events were observed in <11% of patients during the entire follow-up period. Beneficial results on liver and neurological symptoms have been reported following extremely long-term treatment with the combination of low-dose D-penicillamine and high-dose zinc sulfate. Therefore, this regimen is an effective and safe treatment for children with WD.",,"Chang, H.;Xu, A.;Chen, Z.;Zhang, Y.;Tian, F.;Li, T.",2013,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2013.971,0,0,
9,Brain Transport of Zinc-Ions as a Potential Treatment for Neurological Diseases: Mini-Review,"Homeostasis of metal ions such as Zn(2+) is essential for proper brain function. Furthermore, the list of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders involving dysregulation of brain Zn(2+)-levels is long and growing continuously, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as well as schizophrenia, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, depression, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down's. syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Wilson's disease and Pick's disease. In addition, changes in Zn(2+)-levels are seen in transient forebrain ischemia, seizures, traumatic brain injury and alcoholism. Therefore, the possibility of changing Zn(2+)- levels in the brain emerges as a new target for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Although the role of Zn(2+) in the brain has been extensively studied over the past decade, methods for the controlled regulation and manipulation of Zn(2+) concentrations in the brain are still in their infancy. Since the use of Zn(2+) supplementation and restriction in the diet has major limitations, new methods and alternative approaches are still being explored, such as the use of intracranial infusion of Zn(2+) chelators or nanoparticle technologies, to increase or decrease intracellular Zn. (2+) levels. Therefore, this review briefly summarizes the role of Zn(2+) in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the main findings and barriers to brain Zn(2+) level manipulation. In addition, some methods and compounds are evaluated to control brain Zn(2+) levels, such as metal ion chelation, redistribution and supplementation, which are used to treat brain disorders.",,"Grabrucker, A.

10,Copper dyshomeostasis in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as indicated by serum and urine copper indicators,"Abnormal use of copper is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare disorder characterized by increased plasma copper levels not bound to ceruloplasmin (nCp-Cu, also known as 'free' copper). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analyses show that copper decreases in the brain but increases in the serum due to an increase in the nCp-Cu component. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of copper biological status in the two diseases has never been made. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu, and Cu:Cp at 385 CE and 336 healthy controls previously studied and compared with 9 newly diagnosed WD patients. We next evaluated 24-hour copper urinary excretion in 24 WD patients on D-penicillamine (D-pen) therapy and 35 healthy controls, and compared the results with AD patients who participated in a previously published D-pen phase II clinical trial. After adjusting for sex and age, serum nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp resulted higher in AD and WD than in healthy controls (both p<0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p<0.016). 24-hour urinary copper excretion (12.05mug/day) was higher in AD patients than healthy controls (4.82mug/day; p<0.001). 24-hour urinary excretion was higher than 200 ug/day in 77.8% of AD patients under D-pen therapy, suggesting that copper control failed. This study provides a new insight into the pathophysiology of copper homeostasis in AD by demonstrating the failure of copper control and the Cu:Cp ratio as a suitable marker.",,"Squitti, R.;Ghidoni, R.;Simonelli, I.;Ivanova, I.

11,Insights into the management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare, inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism; where the active gene, ATP7B, causes the absence or reduction of the ATP7B transporter, which is important for the biliary excretion of copper and incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excess copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues. A disease primarily seen in children, adolescents and young adults; clinical features range from asymptomatic status to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical testing, hepatic copper content testing, and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene; To date, there are more than 500 mutations of ATP7B in patients with Wilson's disease. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in an excellent prognosis, while untreated disease is almost always fatal. Drug treatments include chelating agents such as penicillamine or trientine, and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is curative that corrects the underlying pathophysiology and has traditionally been indicated in acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease refractory to medical therapy. This review provides an overview of several aspects of Wilson's disease, including the molecular basis of the disease, clinical features, diagnosis, and management strategies, along with their current limitations.",,"Kathawala, M.;Hirschfield, G.

13,"Biscoline tetrathiomolybdate in patients with Wilson's disease: an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study.","BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is a genetic disease in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues. Therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple daily dosing. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (WTX101) is an oral premium copper-protein binding molecule that targets hepatic intracellular copper and reduces plasma ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) by forming ternary complexes with albumin and increasing biliary copper excretion. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in the initial or early treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We conducted this open-label, phase 2 study at 11 hospitals in the US and Europe. We enrolled patients (>=18 years) with Wilson's disease who were untreated or not treated with chelators or zinc for more than 24 months, had a Leipzig score of 4 or more, and had NCC concentrations above the lower limit of normal. reference range (>=0.8 mumol/L). Eligible patients received an initial dose of 15-60 mg/day of WTX101 monotherapy based on baseline NCC concentrations for the first 4-8 weeks, followed by response-guided individualized dosing for the remaining weeks up to Week 24. Researchers, other hospital staff and patients were aware of the identity of the treatment. The primary endpoint was change in baseline NCC concentrations corrected for copper in tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes (NCC<sub>corrected</sub>) at 24 weeks, and treatment success was defined as achieving or maintaining normalized NCC<sub>corrected< /sub> (<=2.3 mumol/L [upper limit of normal]) or at least 25% reduction in <sub>adjusted</sub> NCC from baseline at 24 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02273596. RESULTS: Between November 24, 2014 and April 27, 2016, 28 patients were enrolled and received WTX101; 22 (79%) patients completed the study by week 24. At 24 weeks, 20 of 28 patients (71%, 95% CI 51.3-86.8; p<0.0001) met criteria for treatment success: 16 (57%) treated WTX101 normalized NCC<alt>corrected</sub> concentrations were reached or maintained, and 4 (14%) had at least a 25% reduction from their baseline NCC<sub>adjusted</sub> value. The mean NCC<sub>adjusted</sub> was reduced by 72% from baseline to week 24 (least squares mean difference -2.4 mumol/L [SE 0.4], 95% CI -3.2 to -1.6; p<0.0001). No cases of paradoxical drug-induced neurological deterioration were recorded. Liver function was stable in all patients, although reversibly increased concentrations of asymptomatic alanine or aspartate aminotransferase or gamma-glutamyltransferase concentrations, with no increase in bilirubin, occurred in 11 (39%) of 28 patients receiving at least 30 mg/day. Eleven serious adverse events were reported in seven (25%) patients and included psychiatric disorders (six events in four patients), gait disturbance (one event), elevation of liver aminotransferases (two events in two patients, one with agranulocytosis), and decrease. neurological function (possibly an event due to natural disease progression, although causation cannot be excluded). Seven serious adverse events categorized as psychiatric disorders and gait disturbance were considered unlikely to be study drug-related, while the remaining four events were likely or possibly related. COMMENT: Our findings suggest that WTX101, with a unique mode of action, could be a promising new therapeutic approach for Wilson's disease. Given its once-daily dose and favorable safety profile, WTX101 could improve the treatment of patients with this debilitating condition. FUNDING: Wilson Therapeutics AB.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

15,Bioavailable Trace Metals in Neurological Diseases,"EXPLANATION OF THE IDEA: Medical treatment in Wilson's disease includes chelators (D-penicillamine and trientine) or zinc salts, which must be maintained for life. This pharmacological treatment is divided into two phases; the first is the decoupling phase and the second is the maintenance phase. The best therapeutic approach is controversial because only a few uncontrolled studies have compared these treatments. Gradually increasing chelator doses relative to exchangeable copper and urinary copper during the initial phase may help prevent neurological deterioration. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute fulminant liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis; should be discussed separately in cases of neurological deterioration. During the maintenance phase, the most important challenge is good compliance with lifelong medical care. Neurodegenerative diseases leading to iron mislocalization can result from the culmination of localized overload (pro-oxidant siderosis) and localized deficiency (metabolic distress). A new therapeutic concept with protective iron chelation rescues iron overloaded neurons by scavenging unstable iron and delivers this chelated metal to endogenous apo-transferrin, allowing for iron redistribution to prevent systemic iron loss.",,"Poujois, A.;Devedjian, J.

16,Early Onset of Wilson's Disease: Diagnostic Challenges,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyze the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients <=5 years of age with early-onset Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: Data from 143 pediatric patients with WD treated at our center between January 1996 and November 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A review of 143 pediatric patients with WD identified 21 (10 girls, 11 boys) with first symptoms at <=5 years of age or abnormal liver function test results. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed in 8 patients younger than 5 years of age. The mean serum alanine aminotransferase level at baseline was 222 U/L and the mean serum aspartate aminotransferase level was 130 U/L. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration in the 16 patients tested was <20 mg/dL. Levels were between 40 and 100 cups/day in 8 of 15 patients tested for urinary copper excretion, only 4 had levels >100 cups/day. In 16 patients, the liver copper content was >250 mug/g dry weight. The most common mutation was p.H1069Q with compound heterozygosity in 5 patients and homozygosity in 9 patients. Sixteen patients were treated with zinc salts and 5 patients with D-penicillamine. Both treatments were effective and no serious side effects were seen after 3 to 24 months. RESULTS: WD can occur as early as 2 years of age. A combination of tests may be required for diagnosis, as biochemical tests may be less sensitive in very young children. If molecular tests are inconclusive, liver copper content should be measured.",,"Wiernicka, A.;Dadalski, M.;Janczyk, W.;Kaminska, D.;Naorniakowska, M.;Husing-Kabar, A.;Schmidt, H.;Socha, P.",2017,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000001700,0,1,
17,Wilson's disease: Prospective advances in new treatments,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. A clear demand has emerged for new WD treatment strategies. Although treatments using zinc salts and copper chelators can effectively improve WD, these drugs exhibit limitations in a substantial pool of WD patients who develop intolerance and/or serious adverse events. Several lines of research have demonstrated the intriguing potential for new strategies and targets for the development of new treatments. Here, we review these novel approaches, including the correction of ATP7B mutants and the discovery of new compounds that ameliorate ATP7B deficiency, as well as cell and gene therapies. We also discuss whether and when these new therapeutic strategies should be translated into clinical use, based on the key requirements of clinical trials that remain to be met. Finally, we discuss the current rapidly evolving research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of WD and the hope of relevant potential therapeutic targets to provide a solid foundation for the next generation of WD treatments that could lead to an effective, tolerable, and safe treatment.",,"Ranucci, G.;Polishchuck, R.;Iorio, R.",2017,2014-08-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i30.5451,0,0,
18,Dietary supplement causing fulminant liver failure in a patient with well-controlled Wilson's disease,"We encountered a patient with previously well-controlled Wilson's disease who experienced fulminant liver failure with hemolytic anemia, possibly due to the dietary supplement Health Proportion() (Jubilant Co., Ltd., Ehime, Japan). A 21-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with significant hepatic dysfunction and severe hemolytic anemia. Free serum copper level increased at 101 mug/dl and urinary copper excretion was excessively increased (25,600 mug/day). Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were applied to remove serum copper and treat hemolytic anemia. However, his liver function did not improve and liver transplantation was performed on the 28th day of his hospitalization. Although the patient had been taking D-penicillamine regularly since diagnosis and the copper level was well controlled 1 year before hospitalization, the copper and iron content in the resected liver was high with 851.9 cups and 551.7 cups/dry liver weight (g), respectively. . Two months before hospitalization, the patient took a dietary supplement made from soybeans for 1 month. This supplement has been labeled as containing large amounts of copper and iron, and we hypothesize that this caused fulminant hepatic failure with hemolytic crisis in this patient. It is important to pay attention to the micronutrient content of dietary supplements, especially for patients with metabolic disorders.",,"Kawai, K.;Atarashi, Y.;Takahara, T.;Kudo, H.;Tajiri, K.;Tokimitsu, Y.;Nakayama, Y.;Hirano, K.;Yata, Y.;Minemura, M.;Yasumura, S.;Onishi, Y.;Tsukada, K.;Tsuneyama, K.;Takano, Y.;Sugiyama, T.",2009,Apr,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12328-008-0056-6,0,0,
19,U251 Cell D-Penicillamine and Copper Combined Chemosensitivity: Wilson's Diseases in Patients,"D-Penicillamine (PA), a copper chelator and one of the drugs recommended for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD), has been reported to worsen the symptoms of patients with neurological presentation. However, the reason for this paradoxical response has not been fully elucidated and requires further investigation. Accordingly, we examined the in vitro effect of Copper (Cu) and/or PA treatment on human glioblastoma U251 cells as an in vitro model of Cu cytotoxicity. Treatment of U251 cells with Cu or PA showed no significant effects on their morphology, viability, or ROS levels. In contrast, co-treatment with Cu-PA caused a decrease in viability, changes in glutathione and ceruloplasmin expression, and a marked increase in ROS; depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential; and an increase in Sub G0 phase; with alpha-Fodrin proteolysis. These findings, together with the absence of LDH release in these experiments, suggest that combined Cu-PA exposure induced apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, pre/or concomitant treatment with antioxidants demonstrated a protective effect, with catalase more effective than N-acetyl cysteine or trolox in restoring vitality and reducing the levels of ROS produced. In comparison, a similar analysis using other cell lines found that rat PC12 cells were resistant to Cu and/or PA treatment, while the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y alone was sensitive to both compounds, resulting in decreased viability and increased ROS level. showed. Taken together, this study demonstrates that glioblastoma U251 cells provide a model for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated Cu-PA cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that PA oxidation in the presence of Cu yields H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which in turn penetrates the plasma membrane and induces apoptosis. However, other cell lines exhibited differential responses to these treatments, potentially providing a model for cell type-specific cytotoxic responses in the nervous system. Therefore, the susceptibility of different neural and glial cell types to Cu-PA treatment may underlie the neurological deterioration that occurs in some PA-treated WD patients. Our results also raise the possibility that the side effects of PA therapy can be reduced or avoided by the administration of antioxidants.",,"Katerji, M.;Barada, K.;Jomaa, M.;Kobeissy, F.;Makkawi, A.

20,Is high serum copper concentration a risk factor for implantation failure?,"BACKGROUND: Contraceptive devices containing copper can accumulate copper ions in the endometrium, resulting in implantation failure. Accumulation of copper ions in multiple organs has been reported in patients with untreated Wilson's disease. Since these patients sometimes experience subfertility and/or early pregnancy loss, it is thought that copper ions also accumulate in the uterine endometrium. Wilson's disease patients treated with zinc have successfully given birth to babies because zinc interferes with the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings led to the hypothesis that infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations may have implantation failure due to excessive accumulation of copper ions. The relationship between implantation (pregnancy) rates and serum copper concentrations has not yet been studied. The Japanese government recently stated that the actual copper intake among the Japanese is overstated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether serum copper concentrations are associated with in vivo implantation (pregnancy) rates of human embryos. METHODS: We included 269 patients (age < 40) who underwent vitrification and warming single embryo transfer with a hormone replacement cycle using good blastocysts (3BB or greater according to Gardner classification). Serum hCG, copper and zinc concentrations were measured 16 days after the first date of progesterone replacement. 96 women (group P) who became pregnant without miscarriage at the 10th gestational week and 173 women who were not pregnant (group NP) were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age or BMI. Copper concentrations were significantly higher in group NP (mean 193.2 cups/dL) than group P (mean 178.1 cups/dL). The Cu/Zn ratio (AUC 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.71) of the area under the curve (AUC) in the recipient study characteristic curve was a better predictor than copper or zinc for estimating clinical pregnancy rates. When we determined the cut-off for Cu/Zn ratio as 1.59/1.60, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0.98, 0.29, 0.71 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-center retrospective study suggests that high serum copper concentrations (high Cu/Zn ratio) are a risk factor for implantation failure.",,"Matsubayashi, H.;Kitaya, K.;Yamaguchi, K.;Nishiyama, R.;Takaya, Y.;Ishikawa, T.",2017,2010-08-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-017-2708-4,0,0,

22,Inherited disorders of transition metal metabolism: an update.,"Elements with a biological role include six trace transition metals: manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc and molybdenum. Transition metals participate in group transfer reactions such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, and those that can transfer an electron by switching between two redox states such as iron (3+/2+) and copper (2+/1+) are also biologically very important. redox reactions, including reduction of molecular oxygen and transport of oxygen. However, these trace metals are also potentially toxic and generate reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry. Recently, a role for trace metals in host defense (""nutritional immunity"") has been recognized. The host can deprive the pathogen of a trace metal or poison it with a toxic concentration. Disorders that result in low concentrations of a trace metal can usually be treated by adding that metal; Disorders that result in extremely high concentrations can usually be treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine and disodium calcium edetate. This update will address: i) manganese/zinc transporters (as two new treatable disorders were identified in 2016 – SLC39A8 deficiency and SLC39A14 deficiency); ii) copper transporter disorders as we need to improve the treatment of patients with neurological symptoms associated with Wilson's disease; and iii) iron homeostasis, as recent advances in research on iron metabolism and regulation help us better understand some of the innate errors that affect these pathways.",,"Clayton, P.

23,Childhood Wilson's Disease: Bangladesh Perspective,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease that affects copper metabolism and causes copper-induced damage to various organs. In children, the liver is often involved. The central nervous system, eyes, RBC, kidneys, brain and bones may also be affected. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory profile of Wilson's disease in children. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2011 to December 2013. One hundred consecutive children with WD aged 3 to 18 years were evaluated for clinical and biochemical profile. The mean age of the children studied was 8.5+/-1.5. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Ninety-one percent of the patients were Muslim and nine percent Hindu. Consanguineous marriage was detected in 30% of the cases. Seven parents were first cousins. A family history of chronic liver disease was present in 15% of the patients. Most of the hepatic WD cases (53%) presented between the ages of 5 and 10 years, and most of the neurological WD occurred in the 10-15 age group. Of 100 WD patients, 69 were admitted with hepatic symptoms only, 6 with only neurological symptoms, 14 with both hepatic and neurologic symptoms, 10 children were asymptomatic, and 1 patient with psychiatric features. WD presented with chronic liver disease (CLD) in 42%, CLD with portal hypertension in 34%, acute hepatitis in 20%, and fulminant liver failure in 4%. Chronic liver disease stigmatism was found in 18% of the patients. The most common stigmata were thenar and hypothenar melt (n=8). Keiser-Fleischser ring (CF ring) was detected in 76% of total patients. The CF ring was present in 84% of hepatic Wilson-only patients (58 of 69 patients) and 90% of all neurological Wilson patients (18 out of 20). There was no CF ring in the asymptomatic and psychiatric patient. Approximately 26% of WD patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia in PBF. Most WD patients have altered liver function. Elevated serum transaminase was found in 85% of all cases, prolonged prothrombin time in 59% of cases, and low serum albumin in 53% of cases. Seventy-three percent of patients had low serum ceruloplasmin, basal urinary copper >100mug/day in 81% of cases and urinary copper following penicillamine loading >1200mug/day in 92%. Esophageal varices were identified by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 28 patients with hepatic presentation. Penicillamine and zinc sulfate were given to the WD patient with hepatic presentations. All patients with neurological manifestations as well as asymptomatic cases continued on zinc therapy. WD is a treatable metabolic cause of liver disease. Most of the children with WD studied presented with hepatic manifestations, 76% of whom presented with CLD. Any child presenting with jaundice after the age of 3 should be investigated for WD.",,"Rukunuzzaman, M.;Karim, A. B.;Nurullah, M.;Sultana, F.;Mazumder, M. W.;Rahman, M. A.;Billah, S.

24,"Sip-1 mutations cause disturbances in NMDA- and AMPA- activity, but not kainate receptors of neurons in the cerebral cortex.","Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1) [Zinc finger homeobox (Zfhx1b), Zeb2] is a transcription factor involved in the occurrence of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) in humans. MWS is a rare genetic autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the Sip1 gene (aka Zeb2 or Zfhx1b) that maps to the 2q22.3 locus. MWS affects 1 in every 50-100 newborns worldwide. It is characterized by mental retardation, small stature, typical facial abnormalities, as well as disorders in the development of the cardiovascular and renal systems, as well as some other organs. Sip1 mutations cause abnormal neurogenesis in the brain during development as well as susceptibility to epileptic seizures. In the current study, we investigated the role of the Sip1 gene in the activity of NMDA-, AMPA- and KA- receptors. We show that a particular Sip1 mutation in mouse causes changes in the activity of both NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in neocortical neurons in vitro. We show that neocortical neurons with only one copy of Sip1 (heterozygous, Sip1<sup>fI/wt</sup>) are more sensitive to both NMDA- and AMPA-receptor agonists compared to wild-type neurons (Sip1<sup). >weight/weight</sup>). This is reflected in higher amplitudes of agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals as well as a lower half-maximum effective concentration (IEC50). In contrast, neurons from homozygous Sip1 mice (Sip1<sup>fI/fI</sup>) show higher resistance to these respective receptor agonists. This is reflected in the lower amplitudes of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responses and therefore a higher concentration of receptor activator is required for activation.

25,New perspectives on Wilson's disease treatment,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder that causes hepatic and neurological symptoms. Commonly used medical therapy shows satisfactory results with respect to liver disease, but only limited effects in neurologically affected patients. In recent years, several new treatment options have been developed that show promising results that could improve the treatment of Wilson's disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens based on the biochemical response pattern appears to be particularly beneficial during the copper removal phase of treatment. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising treatment option currently in clinical research. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelator and appears to be associated with early neurological deterioration after initiation of therapy at a lower level than currently used drugs. Treatment with non-chelating drugs characterized by alternative modes of action is under investigation, but has so far been limited to animal or in vitro studies. This includes basic research studies showing proof of principle for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson's disease to restore adequate bile copper excretion even before disease onset.

26,Symptomatic treatment of neurological symptoms in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a potentially treatable neurodegenerative disease. In most cases, treatment with drugs that cause a negative copper balance (usually chelators or zinc salts) results in improvements in liver function and neurological symptoms. However, some patients show severe neurological symptoms such as tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism and chorea at the time of diagnosis. In this patient group, some neurological deficits may persist despite adequate treatment, and further neurologic deterioration may occur after initiation of treatment. Such patients may require additional treatment to relieve neurological symptoms. Other than general recommendations for WD anticancer treatment, there are currently no guidelines for managing neurological symptoms in WD. The purpose of this section is to summarize possible treatments for neurological symptoms in WD based on the available medical literature.

27,Wilson's disease - currently used anticancer therapy,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that can be successfully treated with pharmacological therapy. Currently, two groups of drugs are used: chelators that increase urinary copper excretion (for example, d-penicillamine and trientine) and zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Its mechanisms of action lead to a negative copper balance, stopping the pathological copper accumulation in the tissues and purifying the affected organs from copper overload. Due to the lack of prospective clinical trials, the use of drugs mainly depends on the experience of the center and availability in different countries or regions. This section presents the different reports and recommendations on WD treatment. In addition to the differing expert opinions regarding pharmacological agents, there are several axioms regarding the treatment of WD: even in clinically presymptomatic cases, treatment should begin soon after diagnosis; the patient must be treated for life, making compliance a key factor in treatment success; Treatment should be monitored regularly by liver and haematological tests, neurological examination, and copper metabolism, and therapy should be modified accordingly. Other drugs recommended for the treatment of WD (eg, tetrathiomolybdate) are in clinical trials and lack current recommendations. Therefore, only currently available options for the pharmacological treatment of WD are discussed.

28,Wilson's disease in children,"Wilson's disease (WH) is an inherited disorder of hepatocellular copper distribution mainly due to dysfunction of Wilson's ATPase, a P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPase encoded by the ATP7B gene. In children, as in older age groups, the clinical disease is quite diverse. Although liver disease is common in children/adolescents, neurological, psychiatric and hematological clinical manifestations occur. Very young children may have clinically evident liver disease due to WD. Early detection, preferably when the child/adolescent is asymptomatic, is likely to result in generally near-normal longevity and general health as long as the patient tolerates effective medication, adheres to a lifelong treatment regimen, and has continued access to medication. . Biochemical tests, including liver tests, serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and genotype determination, are key for diagnosis, as well as a lively index of clinical suspicion for physicians. Although zinc may seem like an attractive option for the presymptomatic child, oral chelation therapy remains at the center of medical therapy. Pediatric patients presenting with Wilsonian fulminant liver failure should be differentiated from patients with decompensated cirrhosis because the latter may respond to intensive medical interventions and may not require liver transplantation. Recently identified WD-mimic disorders reveal important aspects of WD pathogenesis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Roberts, E.

31,One-step synthesis of amine-functional mesoporous magnetite nanoparticles and their applications for removal of copper ions from aqueous solution,"Amine-functional mesoporous superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average size of 70 nm were synthesized using a one-step solvothermal method using triethylenetetramine (TETA), a chelating agent recommended for removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, vibratory sample magnetometry (VSM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It has been confirmed that magnetic nanoparticles are functionalized with TETA during the synthetic process and the TETA concentration is crucial for the formation of monodisperse mesoporous nanoparticles. The resulting single-crystal magnetic nanoparticles have a high magnetization that increases their response to the external magnetic field and should therefore greatly facilitate the manipulation of particles in practical uses. The reaction parameters affecting the formation of the mesoporous structure were investigated and a possible formation mechanism including templated aggregation and recrystallization processes was proposed. The capacity of the synthesized amine functional Fe3O4 nanoparticles to remove Cu(II) from the aqueous solution was investigated. The adsorption rate of Cu(II) on amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic pattern. The results of this study showed that amine-functional mesoporous superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles can be used as an effective adsorbent in water treatment and also find potential application for Cu(II) removal in vivo.

33,Rapid and reliable diagnosis of Wilson's disease using X-ray fluorescence,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the gene encoding the copper transporter ATP7B. The variability of symptoms caused by copper accumulation, the inconsistency of pathognomonic findings, and the lack of a reliable diagnostic test make the diagnosis difficult. We explored the diagnostic potential of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), which allows for quantitative analysis of multiple elements. Studies were performed on animal models using Wistar rats (n=10) and Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats (n=11) and on human samples including normal livers (n=10), alcoholic cirrhosis (n=8), hemochromatosis. (n=10), cholestasis (n=6) and WH (n=22). XRF experiments were first performed using synchrotron radiation to address elemental composition at the cellular level. High-resolution mapping of tissue sections allowed measuring the density and distribution of copper, iron, and zinc while maintaining morphology. Studies were also conducted using a laboratory X-ray source to irradiate all tissue pieces. The sensitivity of XRF was highlighted by distinguishing LEC rats from wild-type even under a copper-deficient diet. XRF on all formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded needle biopsies allowed elements to be profiled within minutes. The concentration of copper associated with iron and zinc significantly differentiated WD from other genetic or chronic liver diseases with 97.6% specificity and 100% sensitivity. This study established the definitive diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on XRF. This rapid and versatile method can be easily applied in a clinical setting.",,"Kascakova, S.;Kewish, C.

34,Difficulties in Diagnosing and Following Wilson's Disease in the Presence of Proteinuria,The association of Wilson's disease with Alport syndrome has not been reported before. Diagnosis and ongoing follow-up of Wilson's disease is difficult when associated with an underlying kidney disease such as Alport syndrome. Proteinuria can lead to low ceruloplasmin as it is among the serum proteins that are improperly filtered by the damaged glomeruli and can also cause increased urinary loss of heavy metals such as zinc and copper. Elevated transaminases can be attributed to dyslipidemia or drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Accurate diagnosis of Wilson's disease is essential for targeted therapy and improved prognosis. We describe a patient with Alport syndrome who had chronic elevations of transaminases and was eventually diagnosed with Wilson's disease based on liver histology and genetics.,,"Khan, S.;Schilsky, M.;Silber, G.;Morgenstern, B.;Miloh, T.",2016,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2016.19.2.139,0,0,
35,Metal pathways to Alzheimer's disease: lessons learned from genetic disorders of copper trafficking,"Copper is an important metal ion that provides catalytic functions to many enzymes and also regulates neurotransmission and intracellular signals. Conversely, copper deficiency or excess can cause chronic disease in humans. Menkes and Wilson's disease are two rare inherited copper transport disorders characterized by copper deficiency and copper overload, respectively. Changes in copper status are also a common feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In AD characterized by brain copper depletion, changes in the distribution of copper have been associated with various aspects of the disease process; protein aggregation, defective protein degradation, oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although AD is a multifactorial disease, possibly caused by a disruption in multiple cellular pathways, copper and other metal ions such as iron and zinc play a central role in many of these cellular processes. The pioneering work of researchers examining relatively rare copper transport diseases has shed light on potential metal ion-related disease mechanisms in other forms of neurodegeneration such as AD.",,"Greenough, M.

36,Clinical efficacy of combined sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate and zinc therapy in neurological Wilson's disease with D-penicillamine therapy failure.,"OBJECTIVES: There are limited pharmacological treatments available for patients with neurological Wilson's disease (WD) and a history of copper chelator therapy failure. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical records of 38 patients with WD treated with sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) and zinc (group 1) or zinc alone (group 2). All patients had a history of neurological deterioration during previous D-penicillamine (DPA) therapy. RESULTS: 21 patients were treated with intravenous DMPS for 4 weeks, followed by 6 months of zinc gluconate treatment, and the treatment protocol was repeated twice. Compared to baseline, repeated DMPS therapy and zinc maintenance therapy consistently reduced neurologic scores (p < 0.01). Sixteen patients (76.2%) showed neurological improvement after 1 year of treatment, and four patients (19.0%) showed neurological deterioration at the follow-up session. In addition, zinc monotherapy was applied to 17 patients for 12 months. Two patients (11.8%) showed neurological improvement and five patients (29.4%) showed neurological deterioration. Compared with patients in group 2, a greater rate of improvement (p < 0.01) and a lower rate of deterioration (p < 0.01) were observed in patients in group 1 after 1 year of treatment.

The aim of this study was to describe the consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-based, Internet-based research of pediatric hepatologists. The questionnaire cases were developed with the consensus of the authors and aimed to identify differences in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven (44%) of 253 clinicians responded. Of these, 84% of North Americans and 41% of European respondents used guidelines published in their region. Despite consensus on first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants disagreed on how much liver copper content is required for diagnosis: 57% considered .250 cups/g dry weight . Consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 cups/g diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners do genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% do genetic testing after learning the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose to enlist for transplantation, then track using a disease-severity score, and then transplant only when the score reached a critical limit. 43% of practitioners chose zinc to treat mildly affected siblings of index patients. Most reported using chelation to treat patients with liver dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists differ in the approaches they use to care for children with WD. Regional preferences and access to treatments can create diversity. However, non-guaranteed variation can also contribute to differences in outcomes and improvement of quality of care should be aimed.",,"Sturm, E.;Piersma, F. E.;Tanner, M. S.;Socha, P.;Roberts, E.

42,Wilson's disease: A review of what we've learned,"Wilson's disease (WD), resulting from defective ATP7B protein product, is characterized by impaired copper metabolism and clinical outcomes range from an asymptomatic condition to fulminant liver failure, chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, and neurological and psychiatric manifestations. A high degree of suspicion is warranted to avoid missing cases of WD, particularly less fluoride cases with only mild transaminase elevation or isolated neuropsychiatric involvement. Screening of first and second relatives of index cases is mandatory and treatment should be initiated after diagnosis. Treatment strategies include chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine, while zinc salts act as inducers of metallothioneins, promoting negative copper balance and reduction of free plasmatic copper. As an orphan disease, research is lacking in this area, particularly regarding therapeutic strategies associated with better patient compliance and ultimately reversing established injury.",,"Rodriguez-Castro, K.

45,"Zebrafish in the sea of mineral (iron, zinc and copper) metabolism","Iron, copper, zinc, and eight other minerals are classified as essential trace elements because they occur in vivo in amounts within minutes and are essential for life. Because excess or insufficient levels of trace elements can be harmful to life (cause human diseases such as iron deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease), endogenous levels of trace minerals must be tightly regulated. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of systems that maintain trace element homeostasis, and these systems are highly conserved in many species, from yeast to mice. As a model for studying trace mineral metabolism, zebrafish are indispensable for researchers. Several large-scale mutagenesis screens have been performed in zebrafish, and these screens have led to the identification of a number of metal carriers and the generation of several mutagenesis lines that provide an in-depth functional analysis at the system level. In addition, due to its developmental advantages, zebrafish have also been used in chemical screenings of mineral metabolism and in toxicology studies. Here, we systematically review the main findings of trace element homeostasis studies using the zebrafish model, with a focus on iron, zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and iodine. We also provide homology analysis of trace mineral carriers in fish, mice and humans. Finally, we discuss the evidence that zebrafish are an ideal experimental tool for uncovering new mechanisms of trace mineral metabolism and developing approaches to treat diseases related to mineral imbalance.",,"Zhao, L.;Xia, Z.;Wang, F.",2014,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2014.00033,0,0,
46,A review and current perspective on Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and may be more common where inbreeding is common. Much is known about the disease after it was first described by Kinnier Wilson in 1912 as progressive lenticular degeneration. More than 500 mutations of the ATP7B gene were identified without genotype-phenotype correlation. Loss of ATP7B function leads to varying degrees of decreased biliary excretion of copper and decreased incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin; accumulation and toxicity of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues causes liver toxicity and numerous other manifestations of the disease. Clinical features can range from asymptomatic status to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, neuropsychiatric manifestations and hemolytic anemia. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical findings, biochemical features, histological findings and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene. There are subtle geographic differences, with a disproportionate proportion of children presenting with acute liver failure. A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis. Biochemical index ratios need to be verified across geographic regions for early diagnosis and may not be valid, especially in children. There remains a need for better biomarkers or tests for early detection of ALF. Medications used to treat Wilson's disease include copper chelating agents such as d-Penicillamine, trientine, and zinc salt. Untreated, Wilson's disease uniformly leads to death from liver disease or severe neurological disability. Early diagnosis and treatment has an excellent prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute liver failure and end-stage liver disease. Family screening is required to detect the disorder in first-degree relatives. This review provides an overview of different aspects of Wilson's disease, including geographic differences in presentations and limitations of clinical management and testing currently available.",,"Patil, M.;Sheth, K.

47,Biometals in rare neurodegenerative disorders of childhood,"Copper, iron, and zinc are just three of the major biometals critical to the correct functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). They have diverse roles in many functional processes, including but not limited to enzyme catalysis, protein stabilization, and energy production. The metal concentration range in the body is tightly regulated, and when the balance is disturbed, debilitating effects occur. Homeostasis of brain biometals is mainly controlled by various metal transporters and metal sequestration proteins. The biological roles of biometals have been extensively reviewed in the literature, with a broad focus on the link with neurological conditions associated with aging. Biometals are also implicated in a variety of debilitating inherited childhood disorders, some of which appear soon after birth or as the child progresses into early adulthood. This review attempts to highlight what we know about biometals in childhood neurological disorders such as Wilson's disease (WD), Menkes disease (MD), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), and brain iron deposition and neurodegeneration (NBIA). We also discuss some of the animal models available to identify pathological mechanisms in these childhood disorders, which we hope will help us understand the role of biometals in disease and reach possible therapeutics in the future.",,"Parker, S.

49,Refractory rickets due to Fanconi Syndrome secondary to Wilson's disease,"Renal tubular disorders are an important cause of resistant rickets. Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, has a variety of presentations. We present a case of refractory rickets due to Fanconi syndrome attributable to Wilson's disease. An adolescent girl was admitted with complaints of pain and palpitations in the hip and knee joints and knee deformity for six years. He had taken multiple doses of cholecalciferol with little improvement. There was no family history of seizures, polyuria, jaundice, drug use, and similar complaints. Examination revealed severely short stature with enlargement of the wrist joint and genu valgum. Central nervous system (CNS) examination was normal. Skeletal radiographs showed features suggestive of rickets in the hip and knee joints. Routine biochemistry was normal, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was adequate (57.1 ng/dL), normal corrected calcium (9.24 mg/dL), low phosphate (2.76 mg/dL), high bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and normal kidney functions. Normal blood sugars and aminoaciduria, as well as phosphaturia, kaliuresis, and glucosuria were detected in the 24-hour urine. Blood gas analysis revealed normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a urine pH of 7. The ammonium chloride (NH4CL) loading test revealed proximal tubular acidosis. A search for the causes revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed by low serum ceruloplasmin levels (6.5 mg/dL; normal: 18-35 mg/dL) and high 24-hour urine copper levels (433 mcg; normal: 20-50 mcg). Replacement of alkali, phosphate, calcium and vitamin D with zinc acetate was started for Wilson's disease. Rickets has been rarely reported as a presentation feature of Wilson's disease.

52,Penicillamine neurotoxicity: a hypothesis,"Penicillamine, dimethyl cysteine, thiovaline remains the drug of choice for the treatment of patience with Wilson's disease. It is also valuable in the treatment of cysteineuria and rheumatoid arthritis, and has been suggested to be of value in the treatment of other rare diseases. It also has multiple toxicities. Most of these can be explained as chemical toxicity, for example, weak antipyridoxine action and ability to interfere with lysyloxide causing skin lesions. More important is its ability to induce immune reactions such as SLE, immune complex nephritis, Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Goodpasture syndrome. However, the sudden increase in neurological findings that can be seen in a small number of patients cannot be explained. The theory is that this is due to deadly synthesis. In susceptible patients, the -SH radical is released from penicillamine and inhibits SH-dependent enzymes in the Krebs cycle, leading to neuronal death. Other toxic metabolites may also be produced, such as methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan, both of which can produce a similar metabolic block.",,"Walshe, J.

53,A paradigm shift in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: zinc therapy is now a conscientious choice for the care of individual patients,"Breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with a shift from irrationally dangerous chelation therapy to rational safe evidence-based oral zinc therapy. Evidence-based medicine: After synthesizing the best available clinical evidence, I conclude that oral zinc therapy is an informed choice for the treatment of free copper toxicosis in individual patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hypothesis 1: Age-related free copper toxicosis is a causative factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There are 2 neurodegenerative diseases with abnormalities in copper metabolism: (a) the juvenile form with degeneration of the basal ganglia (Wilson's disease) and (b) the age-related form of cortical neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease). Initially the hypothesis was that neurodegeneration was caused by copper deposition in the brain, but later experience with the treatment of Wilson's disease led to the belief that free plasma copper is the toxic form of copper: oxidative stress, which catalyzes the formation of amyloid, produces free radicals. and degeneration of cortical neurons. Hypothesis 2: Oral zinc therapy is an effective and safe treatment of free copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease. Recommended dose: 50 mg elemental zinc/day. Warning: Chelation therapy in the treatment of copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease is unreasonable and dangerous.",,"Hoogenraad, T. U.",2011,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4061/2011/492686,0,0,

When presenting only with psychiatric symptoms or with extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to neuroleptic exposure, the diagnosis of underlying Wilson's disease may be missed. METHODS: An 18-year-old boy was admitted to the psychiatry clinic with manic syndrome and extrapyramidal symptoms predisposing to neuroleptics. At the first examination, splenomegaly and pancytopenia were found. Subsequent detection of the Kayser-Fleischer ring and typical biochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. RESULTS: While psychiatric symptoms are controlled with lithium carbonate, extrapyramidal symptoms continue after neuroleptic withdrawal. Pancytopenia, which is thought to be due to hypersplenism, persists and the patient develops features of liver cirrhosis. Zinc and folic acid treatment has been started and the patient is under evaluation for penicillamine treatment. CONCLUSION: The psychiatrist should accept that Wilson's disease may rarely present with isolated psychiatric symptoms, including mania. Early and severe extrapyramidal symptoms due to neuroleptic exposure in an adolescent age group warrant a detailed evaluation to rule out underlying neuropsychiatric conditions.",,"Chand, P.

RECENT FINDINGS: For Wilson's disease, there are new data regarding the structure and function of the responsible protein, ATP7B, and the importance of its proper cellular localization in hepatocytes. The initial use of tetrathiomolybdate in asymptomatic patients and neurologically affected patients will change our future approach to treating patients with this disorder. New guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have also been introduced. The new data has also improved our understanding of hemochromatosis and iron overload disorders. Highlights of this year include new data on iron metabolism, the discovery of a new gene for hemojuvelin, and the role of HFE mutations in the development of iron overload. Other data suggest that altered regulation of the peptide hepcidin may play a pivotal role in the development of the iron overload phenotype in patients with hemochromatosis. For alpha-an antitrypsin, new information is accumulating on the incidence of the disease in populations of African descent, and the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of the disease continues to be explored.

62,Zinc Salts Inhibit Hepatitis E Virus Replication by Inhibiting the Activity of Viral RNA-Independent RNA Polymerase,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women leads to more serious consequences, with a mortality rate of up to 30%. Although the virus usually causes sporadic infection, outbreaks have been reported in developing and resource-strapped countries. There is no specific antiviral available against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by several viruses. Here we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts dose-dependently inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of the g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility that zinc salts act on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which leads to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies reveal the ability of zinc salts to inhibit HEV replication, demonstrating their potential therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-hungry countries. due to frequent epidemics. It is also a health problem in developed countries due to its ability to cause acute and chronic infections in organ transplantation and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat cases of HEV, this type of therapy has known side effects and limitations. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication through their ability to inhibit viral RdRp activity is important because these findings pave the way for testing the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and high-dose zinc is used to treat Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-related health problems with a similar treatment regimen.",,"Kaushik, N.;Subramani, C.;Anang, S.;Muthumohan, R.;Shalimar;Nayak, B.;Ranjith-Kumar, C.

In a separate experiment, a group of tx-j puppies continued to receive choline-supplemented or control diets with or without the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA) for 12 weeks until they were 24 weeks old. Combined choline supplementation and PCA treatment of 24-week-old tx-j mice was associated with increased liver transcript methionine metabolism and genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Gender differences in gene expression were also observed within each treatment group. These results suggest that transcriptional changes in the oxidative phosphorylation and methionine metabolism genes in WD that occur during fetal life are partially prevented by prenatal maternal choline supplementation; this is a finding that has potential relevance to preventive treatments for WD.",,"Medici, V.;Kieffer, D.

66,Copper induces hepatocyte damage due to endoplasmic reticulum stress in cultured cells and patients with Wilson's disease.,"Copper is an important trace element, but excess copper is harmful to human health. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson's disease, and oxidative stress causes the accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in proper protein folding and the accumulation of misfolded proteins disrupts ER homeostasis and causes ER stress. However, the copper-induced ER homeostasis disorder has not been fully elucidated. We treated the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and the immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses. We also examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper caused not only oxidative stress but also ER stress. Also, excess copper caused DNA damage and decreased cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper-induced hepatotoxicity via ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of the ultrastructure of the ER of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that ER stress plays a crucial role in Wilson's disease and suggest that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson's disease.

67,Triethylenetetramine modulates polyamine and energy metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation.,"Polyamine metabolism is an attractive anticancer drug target because polyamines are absolutely essential for cellular proliferation, and increased levels of polyamines and their biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) are associated with cancer. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a charge-deficient isosteric analog of polyamine spermidine (Spd) and a Cu(II)-chelating compound used for the treatment of Wilson's disease and has been implied as a potential anticancer therapeutic drug. In this study, we examined the effects of TETA on polyamine metabolism in DU145 prostate carcinoma, MCF-7 breast carcinoma and JEG in comparison with two other Cu(II)-chelators, D-penicillamine (PA) and tetrathiomolybdate (TTM). -3 choriocarcinoma cells. TETA induced antizyme, down-regulated ODC, and inhibited [(14)C]Spd uptake. It also completely prevented alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced increase in [(14)C]Spd uptake and inhibited [(14)C]putrescine (Put) uptake and ODC activity in vivo. TETA induced growth arrest by reducing intracellular polyamine levels and suppressing the formation of hypusinized eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). TETA or its N-acetylated metabolites also inhibited spermine (Spm), diamine and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases and reduced the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, TETA inhibited the use of Put as an energy source via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as indicated by decreased production of (14)CO2 from [(14)C]Put. These results suggest that TETA attacks multiple proven anticancer drug targets not attributed to copper chelation; this warrants further study to reveal its potential in cancer chemoprevention and treatment.

68,Solid state stability and solubility of triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride,"API triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride, used as an alternative treatment for Wilson's disease, is water sensitive and exhibits polymorphism. As this may become an issue for drug formulation, physical stability has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry, high-pressure thermal analysis, dynamic vapor absorption, and X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature. In addition, high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to examine the purity and chemical stability of the API. A pressure-temperature phase diagram of the pure compound has been established and it can be concluded that form II is monotropic with respect to form I, which is the monostable solid. The solubility of the different solid forms was determined with the aid of a temperature-composition phase diagram. API is very soluble, about 10% of the saturated solution at 20°C consists of API compared to the dihydrate, and the solubility of pure form I is twice as high. It has also been shown that at 20°C, a relative humidity of over 40% induces the formation of the dihydrate, resulting in a 70% saturated solution. At higher temperatures, the formation of dihydrate occurs at lower relative humidity values. A clear link has been established between the chemical stability, physical stability and relative humidity of the API. Humidity levels above 40% degrade the quality of the API.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of BMSC treatment on hepatic fibrosis caused by hepatolenticular degeneration and its effect on serological indicators. Sixty patients with liver fibrosis caused by hepatolenticular degeneration were randomly divided into two groups, a penicillamine group of 30 patients each, and a BMSCs plus penicillamine group. The therapeutic effects on hepatic fibrosis, liver function and serological markers before and after treatment were recorded and data were compared. After treatment, serum HA, PCIII, LN, CIV, TIMP-1 and MMP-1 levels decreased in both groups (P < 0.05). However, cytokine levels in the BMSCs plus penicillamine group were significantly lower than those in the penicillamine group (P < 0.05).

72,Predictive value of low plasma copper and high plasma zinc in detecting zinc-induced copper deficiency,"BACKGROUND: Zinc-induced copper deficiency is a condition that is often delayed in diagnosis and causes the development of severe and often irreversible neurologic symptoms. Plasma copper concentrations are generally low and plasma zinc concentrations are high. The aim of this study was to measure the predictive value of this combination of outcomes as a way to facilitate early diagnosis. METHODS: Low plasma copper (<=6micro mol/L) and high plasma zinc results (>18micro mol/L) were obtained from the laboratory database between 2000 and 2014. Medical records and laboratory notes of 20 patients found were accessed. determine which ones may have a zinc-induced copper deficiency. RESULTS: Fifteen (75%) patients were diagnosed with zinc-induced copper deficiency, and 13 patients were symptomatic. Of the remaining five patients, two were treated with zinc for Wilson's disease causing hypocupraemia, and two were treated with zinc parenterally. and the last patient had insufficient information. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low plasma copper and high plasma zinc is a strong predictor for the diagnosis of zinc-induced copper deficiency. Therefore, there is an opportunity for the reporting biochemist to facilitate earlier diagnosis so that treatment can be administered before the condition worsens.

However, WD is often prone to neglect and misdiagnosis at an early stage. We reported a rare WD pedigree, and clinical features, laboratory testing, and gene mutations were analyzed in detail. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 17-year-old, 136 cm tall girl who presented with extremity weakness accompanied by multiple organ disorders such as blind eye, epilepsy, and hypopituitarism. DIAGNOSIS: Clinical tests showed low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. The compound carried heterozygous mutations in the ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). His younger brother, as an asymptomatic patient, presented with elevated transaminases, but without neurological and hepatic symptoms. He was eventually diagnosed with WD. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6, sodium dimercaptosulfonate fortified with vitamin C, as well as restriction of dietary copper. RESULTS: Urinary copper excretion and serum transaminase levels gradually decreased. Abnormal signals in the brainstem and basal ganglia were also significantly reduced after 4 years of copper removal treatment. LESSONS: Extrapyramidal symptoms and basal ganglia signals should be considered in patients with complicated clinical findings.

76,Long-term metabolic correction of Wilson's disease in a murine model by gene therapy,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited copper storage disorder due to mutations in the ATP7B gene that causes hepatic and neurological symptoms. Current treatments are based on life-long copper chelating drugs and zinc salts, which can cause side effects and do not restore normal copper metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of gene therapy for treating this condition. METHODS: We transformed the liver of the Atp7b(-/-) WD mouse model with an adeno-associated vector serotype 8 (AAV8) encoding human ATP7B cDNA placed under the control of the liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter (AAV8-AAT). -ATP7B). We performed periodic evaluation of parameters associated with copper metabolism and disease progression after vector application. Animals were sacrificed 6 months after treatment to analyze copper storage and hepatic histology. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a dose-dependent therapeutic effect of AAV8-AAT-ATP7B, manifested by decreased serum transaminases and urinary copper excretion in response to copper overload, normalization of serum holoceruloplasmin, and restoration of physiological biliary copper excretion. The liver of treated animals showed normalization of copper content and no histological changes.

77,"If Wilson's disease is treated early, subclinical neurologic involvement does not develop.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that causes dysfunction in various organs, mostly liver and brain. Left untreated, WD is fatal, although early treatment results in a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome is not yet clear. To address this issue, we evaluated the neurological status of early-treated WD patients without significant nervous system disorders using neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging procedures at least 10 years after initiation of therapy. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with WD (18 women, age 24.47 +/- 7.50 years) diagnosed early (presymptomatic or mild/moderate liver disease stages without neurological involvement) and receiving rapid treatment were clinically evaluated by the Global Assessment. Scale. While the presentation was hepatic in 36 patients (95%), it was presymptomatic in 2 patients (5%). A neurophysiological study was performed to investigate the central motor conduction time of the upper and lower limbs and motor cortex excitability using single beats and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Neuroimages were obtained with brain magnetic resonance scans. Cognitive abilities, psychiatric and behavioral disorders were evaluated with neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Patients were treated with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good compliance. They did not show any neurological signs on clinical assessment or on a particular impairment scale, with a mean Global Rating Scale score of 0.3 +/- 0.7. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric evaluation excluded subclinical involvement.

80,Novel Zeb2 gene variation in Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS),"BACKGROUND: Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare association of Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Phenotypic features may develop over time and cause initial difficulties in diagnosis. MWS is caused by haploinsufficiency of the Zinc Finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene, and molecular diagnosis of the ZEB2 mutation is required to confirm the diagnosis. We report the first confirmed cases of MWS in three children with typical facial features, mental retardation, absence of the corpus callosum, epilepsy, and new Zeb2 variations in HSCR and DNA analysis. METHODS: Clinical features were monitored. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was subjected to bidirectional sequencing analysis after PCR DNA amplification. ZEB2 gene results were compared with the ZEB2 reference sequence (ENS00000169554) for variation. Bioinformatics search of novel gene variants was done through the ""Blastx"" program function available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.bioinfo.org/NPInter/blast/blast_link.cgi). RESULTS: Clinical follow-up showed that not all phenotypic features are present at birth, but develop over time in the 2 surviving patients. Several Zeb2 variations were detected in the promoter region of the ZEB2 gene, 2 of which were novel (-56A/T 1174 11A/12A). In addition, insertion of a new heterozygous single nucleotide into exon 2 of ZEB2 in a patient results in a frameshift that causes deletion of the first 8 amino acids of the ZEB2 protein and replacement of amino acids 9 (G9A), 11 (R11G) and amino acids. 12 (C12A). In patient three, a novel single nucleotide deletion exon 8 (1784delC Het) results in a frameshift at amino acid 595 of the translated protein. This shortens the protein from 1214 to 594 amino acids and affects the functionality of the critical ZEB2 protein. CONCLUSIONS: MWS is an important link to recognize clinically. Underlines the functionality of the Zeb2 gene in some syndromic Hirschsprung disease. These variations likely contribute to the clinical features of the Mowat Wilson phenotype in Hirschsprung disease, but should be confirmed in further investigation. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

81,D-penicillamine-induced ANA (+) ANCA (+) vasculitis in pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with systemic vasculitis. The pathophysiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is not clearly established and drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis has been reported. Wilson's disease is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the copper-transporting gene ATP7B, and conventional treatment relies on copper chelation with substances such as D-penicillamine. There are rare reports that long-term D-penicillamine therapy can cause adverse renal events such as membranous nephropathy and minimal change disease, but it is questionable whether D-penicillamine induces ANCA-associated vasculitis. We describe 2 patients with Wilson's disease who presented with ANCA (+) vasculitis and renal involvement and were treated with D-penicillamine. All 2 patients showed positive results for antinuclear antibody (ANA). Kidney biopsy findings were consistent with pauci-immune crescentic/necrotizing glomerulonephritis. D-penicillamine was discontinued after the diagnosis of AAV was made. Patients were then treated with plasmapheresis and immunosuppressants, including methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous cyclophosphamide. One patient progressed to end-stage renal disease and the other showed persistent proteinuria. These cases suggest that D-penicillamine may induce ANA (+) ANCA (+) vasculitis with severe renal involvement in pediatric patients and that combined plasmapheresis with an immunosuppressant should be considered.",,"Lee, Y.;Lee, S.

The development of chelator-induced immunological adverse events is a concern, particularly under d-penicillamine therapy. This study evaluated the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson's disease patients and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 235 Wilson's disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to side effects and antinuclear antibody courses. RESULTS: 19/235 (8.1%) patients had accompanying immune-mediated diseases, 13/235 (5.5%) of whom had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. An on-treatment autoimmune disease developed in six patients (2.6%), all of whom were on long-term d-penicillamine therapy. Data on on-treatment antinuclear antibody courses and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n=91), trientine (n=58), and zinc salts (n=58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers was found in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%). CONCLUSION: Immune-mediated disease developed in a small proportion of patients under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were frequently found, but no correlation was seen between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimens.

We studied consecutive patients treated with d-penicillamine (DPA) for whom routine follow-up studies were performed at our center. We performed a 24-hour urinary copper excretion analysis 48 hours after cessation of chelation therapy. Thirty-two patients were enrolled. After discontinuation of DPA, normalization of copper excretion was observed in 91% of patients reported to be compliant. The specificity and sensitivity values of this test were 87% and 77%, respectively.

86,Trientine-induced colitis during treatment of Wilson's disease: a case report and review of the literature.,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver due to impaired biliary excretion of copper. Copper accumulation in the brain can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered as an option for initial and maintenance therapy of WD because of its safety profile. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old female patient, who was recently diagnosed with WD, was started on trientine treatment for WD. Within a month she developed severe bloody diarrhea that did not respond to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and a biopsy colonoscopy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis, consistent with drug-induced mucosal injury. Colitis resolved soon after trientine was discontinued and recurred when the drug was reintroduced due to worsening WD symptoms. After the second mandatory discontinuation of trientine, she continued zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved over time. CONCLUSION: Drug-induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and less adverse effects have been reported with this drug than penicillamine, colitis may occur during trientine therapy. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for the treatment of WD in patients who experience side effects from chelation therapy.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.

The first successful characterization of binary Cu(I)-CSH and Cu(I)-GSH species over the entire pH range was achieved by the addition of a second thioamino acid, which prevents precipitation that normally occurs in this study. Appropriate combinations of binary and triple (mixed ligand) titration data were used to optimize speciation patterns and formation constants for binary species. The results obtained differ significantly from literature data regarding the detection and quantification of protonated and polynuclear complexes. The present results are considered to be more reliable due to the exceptionally wide pH and concentration ranges used, excellent reproducibility of the data, close agreement between the calculated and observed formation functions, and low standard deviations and absence of numerical correlation. they fix. The available formation constants were incorporated into a large Cu speciation model used to predict for the first time the metal-ligand balance in biological fluids of the human eye.

89,Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in an eight-month-old boy,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that can cause fatal neurological and liver disease if not diagnosed and treated. The youngest child with normal liver function ever reported is an 8-month-old Japanese boy with low ceruloplasmin levels, and the youngest child with elevated aminotransferase ever reported is a 9-month-old Korean boy confirmed by genetic testing. Here we report an 8-month-old Chinese boy presenting with elevated liver enzymes and low serum ceruloplasmin level. Genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene detected two heterozygous diseases causing mutations (c.2621C>T/p.A874V and c.3809A>G/p.N1270S) and their parental origins were determined. Persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase in this infant returned to normal after zinc therapy. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with elevated liver enzymes ever reported worldwide. We hope this will increase awareness among pediatricians, leading to early detection, timely treatment and better clinical outcomes.",,"Abuduxikuer, K.;Li, L. T.;Qiu, Y. L.;Wang, N. L.;Wang, J.

90,Elevated copper impairs hepatic nuclear receptor function in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WH) is an autosomal recessive disease that results in copper accumulation in the liver as a result of mutations in the gene encoding the copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B). WD is a chronic liver disorder and various complications such as steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure occur in people with the disease. Similar to patients with WD, Atp7b-/- mice have markedly elevated levels of hepatic copper and liver pathology. Previous studies have shown that replacing zinc with copper at the estrogen receptor (ER) DNA-binding domain impairs specific binding to DNA response elements. Here, we found decreased binding of nuclear receptors FXR, RXR, HNF4alpha and LRH-1 to promoter response elements and decreased mRNA expression of nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b-/- mice, as well as in adult and pediatric WD patients. Excess hepatic copper has been identified in progressive familial cholestasis (PFIC), and, similar to individuals with WD, we found that PFIC2 or PFIC3 patients with clinically elevated hepatic copper levels exhibit impaired nuclear receptor activity. Together, these data suggest that copper-mediated nuclear receptor dysfunction impairs liver function in WD and other disorders potentially associated with increased hepatic copper levels.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

91,Zinc Treatment for Wilson's Disease in Children at French Pediatric Centers,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Zinc therapy is considered a good option in Wilson's disease (WD) as first-line therapy in presymptomatic children and as maintenance therapy after initial chelator therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the practical use of zinc therapy in French pediatric centers. METHODS: A national study was conducted at 6 French centers using zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological parameters, dosage and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 26 children were reported to be treated with zinc acetate alone or in combination with chelators. Of the 9 children (35%) who received zinc alone as first-line therapy, 2 switched to D-penicillamine for ineffectiveness and 7 remained on zinc alone, but only 4 of these had serum transaminase levels returned to normal. Five children (19%) were initially treated with zinc together with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or Trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Of 12 children (46%) who received zinc as maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, there was no recurrence of hepatic cytolysis at a median follow-up of 5.2 years, although 2 of these were switched to Trientine due to zinc-related adverse events. Effects. Epigastric pain was observed in 4 children and gastric perforation was observed in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the poor efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy to control liver disease in semi-presymptomatic children and the high incidence of related gastrointestinal adverse events in children with WD.",,"Santiago, R.;Gottrand, F.;Debray, D.;Bridoux, L.;Lachaux, A.;Morali, A.;Lapeyre, D.;Lamireau, T.",2015,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000000926,0,1,
92,The Role of Oxidative Stress in the Worsening of Neurological Wilson's Disease After Chelation Therapy,"Patients with neurological Wilson's disease (NWD) may worsen on treatment, but there are no studies evaluating the role of oxidative stress. We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in worsening NWD following treatment. Fifty-one untreated NWD patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted and dystonia was measured with the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasonic abdominal and cranial MRI changes were recorded. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum-free copper (Cu), and 24-hour urine Cu were measured at admission and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Patients were considered worsened if one or more graded deteriorations on the severity scale, >10% deterioration in the BFM score, or the appearance of new neurological signs were present. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, 12 of them were female. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had a stable course. GSH (1.99 +/- 0.17 vs. 2.30 +/- 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 +/- 0.12 and 1.82 +/- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L) were lower in the deteriorating group at 3 months P = 0.001) and higher MDA (5.24 +/- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +/-0.46 nmol/ml; P < 0.001) compared with the enhanced group. These changes were associated with serum-free Cu (41.81 +/- 3.31 vs. 35.62 +/- 6.40 microg/dl; P = 0.02) and 24-hour urine Cu (206.42 +/- 41.61 vs. 121.99 +/- 23.72). micro g/24 h; P < 0.001) worsened compared to the recovered group. All patients who deteriorated were using penicillamine. Worsening following chelating therapy in NWD may be due to oxidative stress induced by increased serum free Cu.

93,Zeb2: Multifunctional regulator of nervous system development,"Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (Zeb) 2 is a transcription factor identified for its ability to bind Smad proteins and consists of multiple functional domains that interact with various transcriptional co-effectors. The complex nature of Zeb2, at both the genetic and protein levels, underlies its multifunctional properties; Zeb2 can act individually or as part of a transcriptional complex to suppress and occasionally activate target gene expression. This review introduces Zeb2 as a key regulator of nervous system development. Zeb2 is expressed in the nervous system throughout its development, indicating its importance in neurogenic and gliogenic processes. Indeed, Zeb2 mutation has dramatic neurological consequences in both animal models and people with Mowat-Wilson syndrome resulting from heterozygous ZEB2 mutations. The mechanisms by which Zeb2 regulates neuroectoderm (CNS primordium) and neural crest (PNS primordium) induction are reviewed here. We then describe how Zeb2 acts to direct the formation, delamination, migration and specification of neural crest cells. Zeb2 regulation of development of a number of cerebral regions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, is described later. The various molecular mechanisms that mediate the evolution of various neuronal and glial populations towards Zeb2 are reviewed. The role of Zeb2 in spinal cord and enteric nervous system development is outlined, while its essential function in CNS myelination is also described. Finally, this review discusses how the neurodevelopmental defects of Zeb2 mutant mice describe the developmental dysfunctions that underlie the multiple neurological defects observed in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

Changes in copper metabolism have been associated with changes in coagulation factors. The aim of this study was the analysis of coagulation factors in WD patients. METHODS: 100 patients admitted to a tertiary WD outpatient clinic were analyzed in a prospective cross-sectional cohort study. From peripheral venous blood samples, clotting factors including complete blood count, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand factor/- were evaluated. antigen, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein S, protein C, activated protein C (APC) resistance. Subgroup analyzes of blood tests for gender, initial clinical presentation, treatment of WD, and liver function were performed. RESULTS: Subgroup analysis by liver function showed decreased levels of factor II, V, VII and X. Subgroup analysis by sex or clinical course of disease did not show significant coagulation changes. A significant decrease in factor II, VII and antithrombin III levels and an increase in von Willebrand factor/-antigen levels were detected in patients treated with trientine. Factor VIII levels were significantly reduced in patients receiving zinc. CONCLUSION: Although there were significant differences in some coagulation parameters in the subgroup analysis, no clinically significant change was found in the coagulation system in WD patients.",,"Schaefer, M.;Weber, L.;Gotthardt, D.;Seessle, J.;Stremmel, W.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Weiss, K.

95,Early neurological deterioration in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Early neurological worsening at initiation of therapy for Wilson's disease (WD) is an unresolved problem. Our aim was to determine the frequency and outcome of early neurological deterioration in patients with WD. METHODS: We analyzed 143 symptomatic patients diagnosed with WD between 2005 and 2009. Early neurological deterioration was based on worsening or the appearance of new neurological symptoms on the Unified Wilson's Disease Score, which was initially scored over 6 months. Reversibility of worsening was followed for up to 24 months. RESULTS: Early neurological deterioration was observed in 11.1% (16/143) and included only patients with neurological findings at the time of diagnosis. The mean time from initiation of treatment to worsening was 2.3 +/- 1.9 months. Neurological deterioration was partially reversible in 53% (8/15) and 13% (2/15) of patients over 9.2 +/- 5.2 months. Patients with early worsening showed significantly more severe baseline neurological deficit, higher prevalence of thalamic (66% vs 29%) and brainstem lesions (73% vs. 73%) on baseline magnetic resonance imaging, and dopamine used more frequently receptor antagonists (46% vs. 5%). Disease duration, type of treatment (d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), type of neurological signs, initial copper metabolism results, and liver function parameters did not differ between the groups evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: More than 10% of WD patients may experience neurological deterioration at the start of anti-copper therapy. Particular attention should be paid to those with severe initial neurological symptoms, advanced brain damage, and those using dopamine receptor antagonists. The type of anti-copper therapy did not show a clear association with early neurological deterioration.

96,MRI and oxidative stress markers in neurological worsening of Wilson's disease after penicillamine,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: No correlation of MRI with neurological deterioration following chelation therapy has been reported in Wilson's disease with a neurological manifestation (WDN). We report the radiological changes in four patients with WDN that worsened after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, CF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper. Hematological, biochemical and cranial MRI was repeated during clinical deterioration following chelation therapy. RESULTS: Four WDN patients experienced neurological deterioration within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions in the white matter, thalamus, pons, and midbrain, and these lesions showed diffusion restriction. Neurological deterioration was associated with increased free serum copper and malanodialdehyde and decreased glutathione. A few weeks after penicillamine was discontinued, clinical conditions stabilized. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening was associated with new lesions on MRI revealing diffusion restriction. Increased free copper-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Ranjan, A.;Kalita, J.;Kumar, V.;Misra, U.

101,Laser ablation of metals inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry imaging in experimental and clinical Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease in which the liver does not properly release copper into the bile, causing significant copper accumulation in various tissues. Affected patients suffer from liver disorders and severe neurological defects. Experimental studies in mutant mice in which the copper-transporting ATPase gene (Atp7b) is disrupted revealed a severe, time-dependent hepatic copper accumulation accompanied by the formation of regenerative nodes resembling cirrhosis. Therefore, these mice are an excellent exploratory model for Wilson's disease. However, the precise time course of hepatic copper accumulation and its effect on other trace metals in the liver are not yet fully understood. We have recently established novel laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry protocols that allow for quantitative metal imaging in human and murine liver tissue with high sensitivity, spatial resolution, specificity, and quantification ability. Using these techniques, we aimed to comparatively analyze hepatic metal content in wild-type and Atp7b-deficient mice during aging. We show that age-related hepatic copper accumulation is strictly associated with a concurrent increase in iron and zinc, while the intrahepatic concentration and distribution of other metals or metalloids are not affected. The same findings were obtained in well-defined human liver samples from patients suffering from Wilson's disease. We conclude that in Wilson's disease, imbalances in hepatic copper during aging are closely related to changes in intrahepatic iron and zinc content. Copyright Â© 2015 Authors.

102,Bone demineralization in a large cohort of Wilson's disease patients,"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: We compared the bone mineral density (BMD) of adult Wilson's disease (WD) patients (n=148) with an age- and sex-matched healthy control population (n=148). In the WD cohort, correlations of BMD with WD disease parameters, laboratory results, type of therapy, and known osteoporosis risk factors were analyzed. METHODS: Hip and lumbar spine absolute BMD and T-score were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as T-score <=-2.5 and -1 to -2.5, respectively. RESULTS: There were significantly more subjects with abnormal T-scores in the WD population (58.8%) than in the control population (45.3%) (chi(2)=6.65, df=2, p=0.036), because they had 50.0. In controls, 41.2% and 4.1% versus osteopenic and 8.8% osteoporotic WD patients, respectively. In particular, L2-L4 spine BMD measurements (BMD and T-scores) differed significantly between the WD population and matched controls. L2-L4 spine BMD for WD patients was on average 0.054 g/cm(2) (5.1%) lower than matched normal controls (0.995+/-0.156 vs 1.050+/-0.135; p=0.002). We found no significant association between BMD values and WD disease parameters (eg, severity of liver disease), laboratory results, type of therapy, or known osteoporosis risk factors. Duration of D-penicillamine treatment was negatively associated with femoral BMD, but not clinically relevant compared to age and gender. Importantly, BMD remained significantly lower in WD patients (n=89) compared to controls (p=0.009) after excluding WD patients with cirrhosis.

The predetermined ion exchange reaction, rather than chelation, between ZnPB NPs and copper ions leads to the high selectivity of such NPs for copper in the presence of other endogenous metal ions.

Anetoderma is a rare benign condition with focal damage to the dermal elastic tissue. Previous reports have described this skin disorder as associated with long-term D-Penicillamine therapy. CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old male patient was referred for the evaluation of asymptomatic aminotransferase elevation. Studies showed negative markers for chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis, low ceruloplasmin level, and increased copper urinary excretion. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderate activity and severe bridging fibrosis. Mutation analysis found a compound heterozygous genotype and supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. During the primary physical examination, skin lesions consisting of multiple white to pale papules less than 7-8 mm in diameter with central prominence on the upper part of the body were also observed. It was formed according to primary anetoderma, presentation and skin biopsy findings. Treatment with 1500 mg daily of D-Penicillamine was initiated and during the 12-month follow-up, aminotransferase returned to normal and skin lesions remained unchanged.

Methods: STUDY GROUP: Eight patients (seven men) aged 22-71 years with stable Wilson's disease treated for 4 to 50 years. After 3 months, the patients were followed up with trientine (15 mg/kg) once daily for 12 months. RESULTS: All patients remained clinically well. ALT and AST fluctuated in some, but none required discontinuation of treatment or adverse effects. Liver synthetic function was not changed. Mean 24-hour urinary copper and zinc excretion at the end of treatment was 313.4 +/- 191.7 and 2.214 +/- 1,346 cups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily trientine should be further investigated for possible maintenance therapy for WD. A single daily dose may improve adherence to treatment.

108,Detection of D-penicillamine in skin lesions in a case of dermal elastosis after previous long-term treatment for Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Skin adverse events associated with D-Penicillamine (DPA) are common and multifaceted, but the presence of DPA or its metabolites has never been documented in the skin due to the inherent difficulties in determining tissue levels. Therefore, the relationship between DPA and DPA-related dermatoses has been hypothesized only on the basis of careful history, clinical observation, and typical histopathological findings. OBJECTIVE: To detect DPA in biopsy specimens, presence of DPA in the skin in a unique case of 25-year late-onset elastosis perforans serpiginosa and pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum associated with a long-term history of high-dose DPA. METHODS: We used a reliable analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography combined with amperometric detection to look for the presence of DPA in skin biopsy samples. RESULTS: A chromatographic peak corresponding to DPA was demonstrated in some affected skin samples from the patient. CONCLUSION: We documented 25 years of effective presence and persistence of DPA in the skin of a woman affected by elastotic cutaneous change due to long-term DPA treatment. This report provides further evidence of the relationship between DPA deposition in the affected skin and the clinical manifestation.

109,A case of Wilson's disease with characteristic laparoscopic findings.,"44-year-old male patient noted hepatic dysfunction during medical control. Liver cirrhosis was detected in blood examination and computed tomography. He was then referred to our hospital for further examination. After blood testing, viral markers revealed prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We guessed the etiology of liver disease as previous HBV infection. On laparoscopic examination, the liver surface was nodular, mixed yellowish nodules, and nodules 3-10 mm in diameter in ash gray to copper color. There were large regenerative nodules in segments 3 and 4. Large regenerative nodules and irregular adiposity were inconsistent with HBV-associated liver cirrhosis, so we hypothesized Wilson's disease. The amount of copper excreted in the urine was 326.6 cups (>100 cups/24 hours). Urinary copper excretion increased to 2151.5 cups/24 hours after D-penicillamine administration. Although the hepatic copper concentration was 174.5 µg/g wet tissue (>200 µg/g wet tissue), the laboratory data met the Leipzig diagnostic criteria recommended by EASL.

In favor of the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, there were reduced concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin in the CNS and concentrations of metal deposits, but no other pathognomonic signs and symptoms: increased copper in the urine, Kayser-Fleischer rings in the Descemet's corneal membrane, and copper deposits in the body. liver. Initiation of penicillamine therapy resulted in improvement in the patient's mental and general health. Molecular genetic analysis certainly confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease may remain undetected for a long time if it is masked by dominant or specific psychiatric symptoms. If clear clinical symptoms and signs and definitive laboratory findings are not available, molecular genetic analysis is required to confirm the definitive diagnosis.",,"Krstic, D.;Antonijevic, J.;Spiric, Z.",2014,Dec,,0,0,

112,Health impact of discovery of human zinc deficiency,"The importance of zinc in humans was established in 1963. Over the past 50 years, tremendous advances have been observed in both the clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans. growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment are the major clinical effects in man. We currently know of >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that require zinc for their activity. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells and intracellular free zinc in these cells participates in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry macular degeneration. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity, but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Zinc supplementation in the elderly results in reduced incidence of infections, decreased oxidative stress, and decreased inflammatory cytokine production. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

114,The promise of copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of cancer and the treatment of inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a unique anticopper drug developed for the treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease and is perfect for this. Because copper is known to be required for angiogenesis, TM was tested in mouse cancer models to see if it inhibits tumor growth based on an antiangiogenic effect. TM was extremely effective in these models, but all tumors in the models started small in size - micrometastatic in size. Subsequently, TM was tested in multiple human cancer trials, where it showed only modest effects. However, the lesson of efficacy against microdisease of mice was forgotten—all trials were cumbersome, against advanced cancer. Now, mouse evidence comes back to life. The three groups have great efficacy of TM or TM in treating advanced human cancers that have hitherto been virtually incurable, particularly if the cancer has not been reduced to evidence of disease (NED) status by conventional therapy. In this case, where the remaining disease is micrometastatic, TM therapy appears to be curative. To help put these findings on a solid scientific basis, we designed and initiated a TM study in canine osteosarcoma in the micrometastatic phase. TM also has important anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting copper-dependent cytokines involved in inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect may be involved in the anticancer effect of TM because as cancers progress, it attracts inflammatory cells that provide a large number of additional proangiogenic agents.

115,Penicillamine challenge test in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases in children. Early diagnosis of the disease is important because specific treatment can be recommended to prevent further hepatocellular damage and neurological complications. There is no single diagnostic test that can definitively exclude or confirm the disease. The penicillamine test has proven to be a useful diagnostic test in detecting WD. The main purpose of this study was to observe the reliability of the penicillamine challenge test in the diagnosis of WD. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Dhaka, BSMMU, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition with a case-control design. The study was conducted on 60 CLD patients. 24-hour urinary copper excretion was estimated before and after penicillamine loading, along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations. Study results were analyzed statistically. Thirty CLD patients meeting the WD inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered cases (Group I), and the remaining 30 CLD patients were considered non-Wilsonian CLD and labeled as controls (Group II). It was determined that 12 CLD patients from the control group were HBsAg positive, 1 had hepatitis-C virus infection, 1 had autoimmune hepatitis, and the remaining 16 CLD patients were Cryptogenic. The (mean+/-SD) age of WD patients was 9.90+/-28; The male female ratio was 1.5:1. The most common presentation was ascites (70%). CF ring was found in 86.7% of the cases. Serum ceruloplasmin level was found to be significantly lower in WD patients (mean+/-SD, 0.1197+/-23g/L, p<0.001). Baseline urinary copper excretion of WD patients was significantly different from controls (median 219.0 cups/24 hours, range 35-2018 cups/24 hours, median 44 cups/24 hours, range 20-238 cups/24 hours, p<0.001). Basal urinary copper excretion over 100 ug/24 hours was observed in 80% of WD patients, while it was 10% in controls. Urinary copper excretion after penicillamine was significantly higher in WD patients than in controls (median 2635 µg/24 hours, range 648-6222 µg/24 hours, median 423 µg/24 hours, range 91-1250 µg/24 hours, p<0.001 ). Urinary copper after penicillamine over 1600mug/24h was observed in 70% of WD patients, while not a single patient reached the value in the control group. A 24-hour urine copper measurement after penicillamine loading was found to be a valuable test in the diagnosis of WD.",,"Mazumder, M. W.;Karim, M. B.;Rukunuzzaman, M.",2014,Jul,,0,0,
116,Metalloproteomics: focus on metals-related metabolic issues,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: By identifying metalloproteomes with high-throughput methodology, metalloproteomics provides a research strategy to investigate nutritional and metabolic issues related to metals. In this review, we examine recent advances in metalloproteomics since the early days nearly 12 years ago, when we used metalloproteomics to investigate copper distribution in hepatocytes in relation to Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A metalloproteome is a group of proteins capable of metal binding, either as metalloproteins or by displaying metal binding sites. Like all proteomes, a metalloproteome is determined in the context of a well-defined system. It can be detected for a single metal or multiple metals in that system. Besides major technological advances in analytical techniques, recent studies have examined metalloproteomes for metals other than copper, particularly nickel, zinc, and manganese. Given the importance of microbiomes for metabolism, microbial metalloproteomics is a rapidly expanding and promising new field. SUMMARY: Metals play a key role in metabolic processes. Enough technological progress has been made in the last decade to make metalloproteomics an exciting and innovative type of research in nutrition and metabolism. Explain how metals contribute to metabolic physiology throughout the phylum, including microbes. For humans, it can clarify mechanisms as well as identify informative diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.",,"Roberts, E. A.;Sarkar, B.",2014,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MCO.0000000000000085,0,0,
117,Symptomatic copper deficiency in three Wilson's disease patients treated with zinc sulfate,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by an excess of copper, which leads to copper deposition mainly in the liver, brain, and requires lifelong copper removal therapy. However, overtreatment with anti-copper agents can lead to copper deficiency, which can cause neurological and haematological symptoms. Copper is an important cofactor for many enzymes. This report describes three WD patients diagnosed with copper deficiency during zinc sulfate (ZS) therapy. After 5-16 years of treatment, leukopenia developed in all patients. Two of the patients had spinal cord injury. One of them also presented myopathy. As a result, copper deficiency may occur at different times after initiation of therapy, so regular copper metabolism and haematological monitoring are required.

METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (16 men) and two age- and sex-healthy children for each patient were included in the study. Bone mineral content (BMC, grams) and density (BMD, g/cm(2)) in lumbar vertebrae 1-4 were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Urinary calcium excretion was calculated in 19 patients. The effect of cirrhosis and hypercalciuria on BMC and BMD was also evaluated in WD patients. RESULTS: Mean BMC (33.0+/-13.9 and 35.8+/-13.8 g) (p=0.940) and mean BMD values (0.66+/-0.16 and 0.71) between patients and healthy controls +) there was no statistically significant difference. /-0.18 g/cm(2)) (p=0.269), respectively.

In ~5% of WD patients with acute liver failure, most commonly in the second decade of life or presenting with end-stage liver disease and severe liver failure, most commonly third and fourth decades.

122,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WH) is a copper transport disorder resulting from defective function of the copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B. The incidence of WD is approximately 1/50-10,000 live births worldwide. The clinical manifestations of WD can be of any type, but usually the presenting symptoms are hepatic or neuropsychiatric, and there is a wide variety of disturbances for both symptom groups. However, children may not have clinical symptoms, which makes the diagnosis of the disease more difficult than in adults. Hepatic manifestations can range from asymptomatic minor biochemical disorders to acute, but mostly chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or severe fulminant hepatic failure. The spectrum of neurological manifestations is wide, including tremor, hypersalivation, Dysarthria, coordination defects, dystonia, ataxia. The spectrum of psychiatric symptoms is extensive and can include different disorders such as altered work performance, anxiety, depression and antisocial behavior. Kayser-Fleischer rings (CF) are present in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms and slightly more than half of those without neurological symptoms. CF rings are usually absent in children presenting with liver disease. To obtain a more reliable diagnosis of WD, the Leipzig scoring system was recommended by an international consensus of experts. Wilson's disease copper overload is treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate.

123,Tripodal derivatives of D-Penicillamine as efficient copper(I) chelators,"New tripodal metal chelating agents are presented, derived from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and extended by three unnatural amino acids D-penicillamine (D-Pen). The D-Pen is actually the most widely used drug to treat copper (Cu) overload in Wilson's disease and is therefore a very attractive building block for the design of chelating agents. D-Pen is also a bulkier cysteine analog in which beta-methylene hydrogen atoms have been replaced with larger methyl groups. Inhibition of the gem-dimethyl group close to thiol functions has been shown to affect the speciation and stability of metal complexes. L(4) (ester) and L(5) (amide) ligands were obtained from NTA and commercial D-Pen synthons in four and five steps in 14% and 24% overall yields, respectively. Cu(I) binding abilities through the three thiolate functions were investigated using both spectroscopic and analytical methods. UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate the formation of two Cu(I) complexes with L(5): the mononuclear complex CuL(5) and a cluster (Cu2L(5))2. In contrast, the more voluminous ethyl ester derivative L(4) cannot accommodate the mononuclear complex in solution and thus only forms cluster (Cu2L(4))2. Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS and EXAFS) shows that Cu(I) is bound only in trigonal-planar sulfur-containing environments in all these complexes with Cu–S distances ranging from 2.22 to 2.23 Å. correct. C3-symmetric CuS3 nuclei are the coordination modes often adopted in Cu(I) proteins, such as metallothioneins.

124,Clinical considerations for an effective medical treatment in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder that causes hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. More than a century after Wilson's disease was first described, current medical treatment options have not been standardized. The efficacy of commonly used drugs is satisfactory for liver disease, but disappointing in neurological patients, including the risk of neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy. One approach to overcome this problem is careful and systematic evaluation of biochemical response patterns and quantitative monitoring of symptoms using validated rating scales. Standardized dosing strategies that address changes in copper pools can improve compliance and reduce side effects. Such an approach can reduce long-term morbidity. In this article, we discuss an effective medical treatment in Wilson's disease and the requirements for future studies. Copyright © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Weiss, K.

125,AP1S1 defect causing MEDNIK syndrome: a novel adaptinopathy associated with defective copper metabolism.,"MEDNIK (mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratodermia) syndrome has recently been described as a new disorder of copper metabolism. This multisystem disease combines the clinical and biochemical manifestations of Menkes and Wilson's diseases in which hepatic copper overload can be treated using zinc acetate therapy. MEDNIK syndrome is caused by a mutation of the AP1S1 gene, which encodes the sigma1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 and directs intracellular trafficking of the copper pumps ATP7A and ATP7B. Adapter protein complexes regulate clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, protein cargo sorting, and vesicle trade between organelles in eukaryotic cells. An increasing number of diseases have been associated with mutations in genes encoding subunits of adapter protein complexes, and we propose the term adaptinopathies for them as a new organic category of intracellular trafficking, which offers an opportunity to examine mechanisms involved in crosstalk. between the Golgi apparatus and other organelles.

In clinical practice, high suspicion is very important for early diagnosis and timely treatment to achieve better results. Conventional diagnostic criteria established for adults are generally accepted for children, but may not always be appropriate at very young ages.

Early detection of Wilson's disease is crucial because effective medical treatments such as chelating agents and zinc salts are available that can prevent lifelong neurological disabilities and/or cirrhosis. Despite the availability of effective treatments, it is unfortunate that most patients are brought to our attention after they develop serious complications such as brain damage or cirrhosis. Diagnosis is usually made by measuring copper in liver tissue and then confirmed by genetic testing of the ATP7B gene. Currently, there are no effective biomarkers or methods available for newborn screening for Wilson's disease. Ceruloplasmin has been tested with limited results for pediatric and neonatal screening. Recently, liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) has emerged as a robust technology that can enable multiplex quantification of signature proteotypic peptides with low abundance. Application of this technology could facilitate research on Wilson's disease for protein expression, biomarker study, diagnosis and hopefully screening.

Treatment of WD patients with mild liver disease is not clearly defined. To address this issue, we evaluated the long-term outcomes of three treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, zinc, or both) in patients diagnosed in childhood. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated efficacy, compliance, and reasons for discontinuation of treatment in 42 WD patients with mild liver disease (median age at diagnosis: 6 years; median follow-up: 12 years). Treatment duration was analyzed for each treatment block until a medication change or follow-up was completed. Treatment change events were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Patients receiving D-penicillamine (45%) or the combination (36%) had more total discontinuations due to treatment failure or adverse events than patients receiving zinc (12%) (P = .001 and P = .02), respectively. ). Treatment failure was more common with D-penicillamine (28%) and combination therapy (36%) than with zinc (12%); the difference was statistically significant between zinc alone and combination therapy (P = .03). First-line zinc monotherapy-controlled WD-related liver disease in 13/15 patients (87%); The two subjects who failed on the zinc had poor adherence. Zinc was effective in 3/5 (60%) patients who failed D-penicillamine and combination regimens. All 15 D-penicillamine responders who switched to zinc had good control of liver disease at a median follow-up of 13.1 years. Of the 6 D-penicillamine non-responders who switched to zinc, 4 (67%) responded. At the end of follow-up, only 5/42 (12%) patients failed.

131,Current status of human hepatocyte transplantation and potential for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of hepatic copper excretion that leads to its accumulation in various vital organs such as the liver, brain, and kidneys. Medicines such as penicillamine, trientine and zinc salts are the basis of treatment with good results; however, non-responders or non-adherence to drug therapy can lead to disease progression and acute liver failure (ALF). Current treatment for WD with ALF is an emergency liver transplant and lifelong immunosuppression. Human hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is increasingly used as a treatment for liver-derived metabolic defects. HTx may benefit WD patients with ALF either as a temporary supplement until chelation therapy takes effect, or as a definitive therapy through liver repopulation by healthy donor cells, as demonstrated in animal models of WD. Although clinical trials of HTx have already proven its safety and efficacy in different ALF etiologies, it needs to be demonstrated similarly in WD cases.

METHODS: 143 consecutive patients diagnosed with symptomatic WD from January 2005 to December 2009 and followed up through December 2010 were included. The decision regarding first-line treatment was made after individual discussion with the patient. Doctors did not have a clear preference for one drug over another. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neurological (DPA, 35; ZS, 21) and hepatic (DPA, 36; ZS, 51) WD. RESULTS: Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, neurological WD patients scheduled for DPA had a similar probability of not staying in primary care as patients with ZS (20% vs. 24% at follow-up end), with adjusted rates. 0.9 ratio (OR) (95% CI 0.2-3.5). In patients with hepatic WD, this probability was significantly higher for DPA (31% vs. 12%; adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9-9.9), especially in the first 6 months. Early worsening occurred only in patients with neurological WD and there was no difference between the two treatment groups (35% vs. 19%; OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.7-10.8). Neurological improvement and decrease in liver enzymes were achieved with similar frequency. Compliance with DPA was better in hepatic patients (97% versus 80%), but not in neurological patients (81% versus 91%). Drug adverse events were more common on DPA (15% vs. 3%). CONCLUSIONS: DPA and ZS are effective in most WD patients. Neither treatment appears to be clearly superior. Therefore, ZS can be considered as a reasonable alternative to DPA as first-line therapy.

Deviations in copper homeostasis can create favorable conditions for superoxide-producing redox cycling and oxidative tissue damage. The drugs used in the treatment of WD aim to remove the accumulated copper and normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood. In this study, the effect of decoppering on copper metabolism and systemic antioxidant capacity parameters was analyzed. Patients with untreated WD (TNWD) (n = 33), those treated with anti-copper drugs (TWD) (n = 99), and healthy controls (n = 99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients were characterized by decreased copper metabolism parameters, as well as decreased total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) level, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and S-transferase glutathione compared to controls. TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolism parameters, higher total AOP, and higher GSH levels than TWD patients; however, no difference was observed between these two patient groups in terms of other antioxidant capacity parameters. Patients treated with D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate did not differ in parameters of copper metabolism or antioxidant capacity, except for GPx, which was lower in those treated with D-penicillamine. These data show that anti-copper therapy affects copper metabolism as well as improves, but does not normalize, the natural antioxidant capacity in patients with WD.

136,Worsening of Wilson's disease following penicillamine therapy,"BACKGROUND: Penicillamine is the standard treatment for Wilson's disease (WD), although some patients have paradoxical worsening. Predictors of such degradation have not been evaluated. This study documents the frequency and predictors of deterioration following treatment in WD. METHODS: 59 consecutive patients with neurological WD and their 4 asymptomatic siblings were prospectively evaluated. Clinical, laboratory, ultrasound abdominal and cranial MRI findings with and without worsening were compared. Patients were treated with oral penicillamine and/or zinc and were followed for 1, 3, and 6 months or earlier if necessary. Deterioration was defined by a .10% worsening of the baseline Burke-Fahn-Marsden score or the appearance of a new neurologic sign. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 13 and 13 were female. 19 patients (30.2%) worsened following treatment; 10 within 1 month, 7 within 1-3 months and 2 after 3 months of treatment. Impairment was associated with drooling, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and evidence of chronic liver disease. None of the asymptomatic patients worsened following zinc therapy. RESULTS: In the worsening group, discontinuation of penicillamine resulted in improvement/stabilization in 11 patients, 2 patients improved with trientine therapy, and 4 patients continued to worsen for up to 3 months. 30.2% of patients with WD worsened after penicillamine, especially those with chronic liver disease, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

137,Consistent therapy with anti-copper agents prevents clinically overt Wilson's disease in non-symptomatic patients,"Background and Aim: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes dysfunction of the affected tissues, mostly in the liver and brain. Anti-copper therapy should prevent clinically significant WD in non-symptomatic patients, but this is not supported by strong evidence. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of treatment in clinically pre-symptomatic patients, with particular emphasis on patient adherence to treatment. METHODS: Data were analyzed for 87 consecutive patients without clinical symptoms of WD, defined by family screening between 1957 and 2009. Since diagnosis, all have been treated with either zinc sulfate (Zn) (66.7%) or D-penicillamine (DPA) (33.3%). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 12 years (range 3-52), 55 (63%) patients developed no clinical symptoms, 13 (15%) patients developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 21 (24%) developed hepatic dysfunction, including five deaths. from liver failure. Non-compliance was observed in 39 patients for at least three consecutive months, and in 29 cases this persisted for more than 12 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the probability of developing symptomatic WD increased independently with nonadherence (odds ratio 24.0, 95% confidence interval 6.0-99.0). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, treatment-compliant patients were significantly more likely to remain symptom-free, and their overall survival was similar to the survival rate observed in the general population. CONCLUSION: The use of anti-copper agents in patients with a clinical diagnosis of pre-symptomatic WD provides effective prevention of the clinically evident disease. However, compliance with treatment is extremely important.

138,Mowat-Wilson syndrome: deafness in first Egyptian case conceived with intracytoplasmic sperm injection,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic disease caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions of the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene. The syndrome is characterized by typical facial features, moderate-to-severe mental retardation, epilepsy and variable congenital malformations, including Hirschsprung's disease, genital anomalies, congenital heart disease, corpus callosum agenesis, and eye defects. The prevalence of Mowat-Wilson syndrome is currently unknown, but Mowat-Wilson syndrome appears to be underdiagnosed, particularly in patients without Hirschsprung disease. Here we present the first case of Egyptian Mowat-Wilson syndrome engineered with intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The patient showed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, a novel feature not previously reported in cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome. This report describes the first Egyptian patient of Mowat-Wilson syndrome conceived after intracytoplasmic sperm injection and provides new evidence that deafness is among the congenital defects of the syndrome.

139,Metal storage disorders: Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis,"Hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are autosomal recessive storage disorders of iron and copper overload, respectively. These metals are involved in multiple redox reactions, and their abnormal accumulation can cause significant injury to the liver and other organs. In the last few decades, clinicians have developed a much better understanding of these metals and their mechanisms of action. In addition, advanced molecular genetic testing techniques are now available that make diagnostic testing less invasive.

140,Evaluation of trace elements in the human brain using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.,"Recent brain studies reveal that trace elements play an important role in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Wilson's disease. Most published tissue concentrations date back decades and have been evaluated by a variety of methods. Little is known about hemisphere differences, the correlation of trace elements, or age-related changes in the human brain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine trace element concentrations in different human brain regions after whole brain formalin fixation. 549 samples from 13 brain regions were investigated in 11 dead subjects with no known history of brain pathology. Regional wet-to-dry mass ratios and concentrations of iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, calcium and zinc were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cortical gray matter revealed higher water content (wet-to-dry mass ratios 5.84-6.40) than white matter regions (wet-dry mass ratios 2.95-3.05). Element concentrations showed certain regional variations. Good linear correlation of concentrations between elements was found for iron/copper as well as for manganese/magnesium (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). Significant interhemispheric differences were found for copper in the occipital white matter, for magnesium and calcium in the putamen, and for iron and copper in the temporal white matter. Age-related increases were seen for calcium in cortical gray matter, magnesium in all regions except cortical gray matter, copper in the substantia nigra, and zinc in the occipital cortex. The presented trace element concentrations can serve as a fundamental basis for further brain research. Wet-to-dry mass ratios allow comparison with reference data from other studies.

141,Potent and prolonged inhibition of human P2X2 receptors by copper,"P2X receptors are ion channels gated by ATP. In rodents, these channels are modulated by zinc and copper. Zinc is co-released with the neurotransmitter at some synapses and may modulate neuronal activity, but the role of copper in the brain is unclear. Rat P2X2 receptors are potentiated by 2-100 µM zinc or copper in the presence of submaximal ATP concentration, but are inhibited by zinc or copper at concentrations above 100 µM. In contrast, human P2X2 (hP2X2) receptors show no potentiation and are strongly inhibited by zinc in the 2-100 µM range. The effect of copper on hP2X2 is of interest, as there are human brain disorders in which copper concentration varies. We found that hP2X2 receptors were strongly inhibited by copper (IC50 = 40 nM). The ATP response recovered extremely slowly after the copper wash and full recovery took more than 1 hour. ATP binding facilitated copper binding, but did not dissolve binding from this inhibitory site. A mutant receptor, C(1-6)S, in which the first six extracellular cysteines were deleted, showed normal copper inhibition, but the reducing agents dramatically accelerated recovery from copper inhibition in the wild-type hP2X2 and C(1-6)S mutant, with high levels of the last two disulfide bonds. indicates that it is necessary to protect the affinity copper binding site. The three histidine residues required for normal zinc inhibition were also required for normal copper inhibition. People with untreated Wilson's disease have excessive amounts of copper in their brains. The high copper sensitivity of hP2X2 receptors suggests that they are not functional in these patients.

The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months ago based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. The patient initially presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (sometimes grimacing), and mild dysarthria. The patient's symptoms subsided after d-penicillamine treatment was started. No further degradation was observed after copper chelation therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation were started; Complete regression of hand dystonia was observed.

145,Clinical efficacy and safety of chelation therapy with typical penicillamine in repeated cross-combination with DMPS for Wilson's disease,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of chelation therapy with penicillamine (PCA) in cross-combination with sodium 2, 3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS) repeatedly in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Thirty-five patients with WD were enrolled. Meanwhile, intravenous DMPS was administered in cross-combination with oral PCA, which was administered repeatedly, all with Zinc. During the treatment, clinical observations and 24-hour urinary copper excretion and side effects of drugs were recorded and analyzed. Although the incidence of adverse events after intravenous DMPS or oral PCA treatment was not significantly different, 24-hour urinary copper levels after short-term intravenous DMPS tended to be higher than those of oral PCA. Side effects in the course of intravenous DMPS were mainly neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reaction and bleeding tendency. Compared with oral PCA alone or intravenous DMPS alone, such repeated cross-over combination therapy can avoid continued drug side effects or poor curative effect as much as possible and have a lower chance of stopping treatment in WD patients. During a follow-up period of 6 months to 5 years after such combined chelation, improvement or improvement in liver function can be observed in 71% of patients, relief of neurological symptoms in 50% of patients, and resolution of hematuria in 70% of patients. diet. Recurrent chelation therapy with oral penicillamine in cross-combination with intravenous DMPS may alternately be more beneficial for patients with WD to alleviate symptoms, avoid ongoing drug side effects, and maintain lifelong therapy.",,"Xu, S.

147,"Wilson's disease, 100 years later","Texts published 100 years ago in 1912 by Sir K. Wilson on his eponymous disease in Brain, The Lancet, and La Revue Neurologique highlight the relevance of his explanations in the light of the available information. Wilson's invocation of an ""unknown toxin"" appears to be a prophetic intuition today, as the presence of excess copper in the liver was first mentioned a year later, since copper's role in this disease was not disclosed until 1929. Progress has been made. To better understand the physiology of Wilson's disease (WD). The ATP7B gene involved in WD is located on chromosome 13, and more than 500 mutations and 100 polymorphisms have been identified to date. Phenotypic expression is highly variable, even within a family. This can partly be explained by environmental factors such as diet. Modulator genes are also involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Many of the symptoms observed in WD were already described in detail by Wilson in 1912, but over the next 100 years, subsequent advances were made that helped the physician diagnose WD. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the most common manifestations of the disease. Other extrahepatic features include renal manifestations, osteoarticular disorders, myocardial abnormalities, endocrine disorders, a multisystemic disease. Diagnosis of the disease is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, biological, radiological and genetic data, and new tools (Brain MRI, relative modifiable copper...) reduce the delay in diagnosis. Therapeutic findings also changed the prognosis of the disease. Treatment relies on the use of copper chelators (D-penicillamine and Triethylenetetramine) to promote copper excretion from the body and zinc salts to reduce copper absorption. Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be a promising treatment. While significant progress has been made in this century, many physiological aspects of this disease remain unknown and more research is needed to find answers over the next 100 years.

152,Changes in cortical excitability and central motor conduction time in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) causes widespread structural changes in the central nervous system, and our aim was to identify changes in cortical excitability in WD using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirteen patients with WD diagnosed by Kayser-Fleischer ring and biochemical tests were analyzed. TMS was performed using an eight-figure coil connected to the Magstim 200 stimulator. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous at rest. Resting motor threshold (RMT) was determined by the 'F' wave method using standard techniques and central motor conduction time (CMCT). Comparisons were made with the control data of our laboratory. Dysarthria was the symptom of chorea, tremor, dystonia and abnormal gait in 5 patients (38.5%) and 2 patients (15.4%). RMT could be recorded in 10 patients and not in 3 patients. Compared with controls, the mean RMT (80.9 +/- 14.8 vs. 41.1 +/- 7, p<0.0001) and CMCT (6.7) were significantly higher in patients with recordable RMT. +/- 0.5 ms vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 ms; p<0.0001). MEP was achievable with active contraction in 2 of 3 patients with unrecordable RMT. CMCT was prolonged in these 2 patients. Patients with WD have decreased cortical excitability and prolonged CMCT, which may result from intracortical presynaptic motor dysfunction. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

153,Gastrointestinal side effects in children with Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the adverse effects of zinc sulfate therapy in a cohort of Polish pediatric patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 53 pediatric patients with Wilson's disease who were treated with zinc sulfate between 1996 and 2011 at the Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland. Patients were diagnosed with Wilson's disease according to Ferenci's scoring system and 49 cases were confirmed by mutation analysis. Data on the dosage schedule of zinc sulfate, side effects, and the efficacy and toxicity of treatment were collected and recorded in the patient's medical file at each visit to the hospital. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis for the entire cohort was 10 (range, 2.5-17 years). The duration of treatment with zinc sulfate was 83.3 weeks (range, 8-344 weeks). All gastrointestinal side effects were observed in 21 patients (40-9% male and 12 female), regardless of the duration of treatment. Thirteen of 21 patients were over the age of 10. The most common ATP7B mutation was p.H1069Q. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed in 7 patients (33.3%) with persistent and severe abdominal pain revealed gastrointestinal ulcerations or erosions with negative Helicobacter pylori tests in all subjects studied. The 7 patients mentioned above were treated with proton pump inhibitors. Three of these experienced resolution of symptoms, but proton pump inhibitors failed to alleviate the symptoms of the remaining four children and treatment had to be changed to D-penicillamine.

155,"Treatment of Wilson's disease, a rare copper metabolism disorder","Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper accumulation in the brain and liver; cornea and other organs. Copper overload inevitably leads to progressive liver and neurological dysfunction. Copper overload in patients with Wilson's disease results from disruption of the biliary tract for excretion of dietary copper. A combination of neurological, psychiatric, and hepatic symptoms can complicate the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Most symptoms appear in the second and third decades of life. The disease affects between 30,000 and 100,000 people and is fatal if left untreated. Five drugs are currently available to treat Wilson's disease: British Anti-Lewisite; D-penicillamine; trientine; zinc sulfate or acetate; and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Any drug can reduce copper levels and/or convert copper into a metabolically inert and inaccessible form in the patient.

Eight patients with WD referred to our institution for LT from 2000 to 2009 were included in this study. The mean patient age was 15.9 years (range, 7-37 years). LT could not be performed in four patients because there were no suitable donors. All four patients were treated with chelating agent medication. Three (two out of two patients with fulminant WD and one out of two patients with cirrhotic WD) who did not undergo LT are still alive and well with stable liver function tests. Only one of the patients with cirrhotic WD who did not receive LT died of liver failure. Even out of four patients who underwent LT, one with fulminant WD was cured of hepatic encephalopathy with apheresis therapy and a chelating agent. He later needed LT because of d-penicillamine-induced severe neutropenia. The other three patients who underwent LT recovered and are well. A proportion of patients with WD can recover with medical treatment and avoid LT. Even if WD is advanced cirrhosis and/or fulminant liver failure at the time of diagnosis, medical treatment should be attempted before LT is considered.

159,Update on zinc deficiency and excess in clinical pediatric practice,"The critical importance of adequate zinc status for human health, including normal growth and development, is indisputable. The high prevalence and public health importance of zinc deficiency on a global basis is well documented in large-scale randomized controlled trials of zinc supplementation. However, similar evidence in the clinical setting is much less widely available due to the nonspecific features of zinc deficiency and the lack of sensitive biomarkers to detect zinc deficiency, especially mild severity. Current understanding of zinc homeostasis indicates that the primary determinants of zinc absorption are zinc intake and dietary phytate, which have a major impact on zinc bioavailability. In normal and in many pathological conditions, the gastrointestinal tract is the main site of zinc losses from secretion of endogenous zinc into the lumen and subsequent excretion in the faeces. The amount excreted depends on the host condition, the amount reabsorbed and sometimes the presence of pathophysiological conditions including diarrhea and steatorrhea. Evaluation in a clinical setting requires the clinician to take a careful medical and dietary history, recognize clinical presentations in which zinc sufficiency may be compromised, and relate this risk to non-specific but reasonable signs of deficiency. Examples discussed in this article include primary zinc deficiency due to nutritional deficiencies (older infants who are breastfed or young children who do not receive zinc-rich complementary foods); genetically based deficiency (acrodermatitis enteropathica, acquired zinc deficiency of lactogenic origin) and secondary acquired deficiency in low birth weight and prematurity, gastrointestinal and hepatic disease, and cystic fibrosis. Evidence for the effectiveness of zinc therapy with pharmacological doses for the two conditions, Wilson's disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections is also discussed. Copyright © 2013 S.

160,Inborn errors of copper metabolism,"Two copper-bearing ATPases are required for mammalian copper homeostasis: ATP7A, which mediates copper uptake in the gastrointestinal tract and copper delivery to the brain, and ATP7B, which mediates copper excretion from the liver to the bile. Mutations in ATP7A can cause three different X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant limited to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three disorders show variable neurological signs and age of onset. Menkes disease manifests itself with growth retardation, growth retardation and seizures in the first few months of life. OSH includes more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities that begin in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy usually occurs later, but not until adolescence or early adulthood, and includes a neurological phenotype resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2. These disorders can be treated with copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause Wilson's disease, a single known phenotype, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric problems may present symptoms between 10 and 40 years of age. There are excellent treatment options for Wilson's disease based on copper chelation. In the last 2 years (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive states of copper metabolism have been recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter required for acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) SODI in the CCS-deficient copper chaperone MEDNIK syndrome, in which mutations in the sigma1A subunit of adapter protein complex 1 (AP-1) have deleterious effects on ATP7A and ATP7B trafficking.

Successful therapeutic uses of penicillamine have been hampered by its numerous side effects, both cutaneous and extracutaneous. (1) acute hypersensitivity reactions, (2) dermopathies characterized by elastic fiber abnormalities, including elastosis perforans serpiginosa and pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum, (3) pemphigus and penicillamine-induced lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, and (4) various dermatoses arising from unspecified mechanisms. These cutaneous side effects may be related to the disease being treated as well as the dose and duration of penicillamine therapy.",,"Ishak, R.;Abbas, O.",2013,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40257-013-0022-z,0,0,

Liver histology showed macrovesicular steatosis with fibrosis but no cirrhosis. The disease was successfully resected and treated with D-penicillamine for 3 years until acute discomfort in the right upper quadrant led to detection of multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. Histological examination confirmed the malignant nature of 4 lesions classified as poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma grade 3 according to Edmondson and Steiner.

163,Brain metal deposition in Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: Brain metal accumulation has been suggested in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders. Only copper has been studied in Wilson's disease (WD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the copper, iron, manganese and zinc concentrations in autopsy tissue samples taken from the brains of WD patients. METHODS: The study material consisted of 17 brains (12 WD patients, 5 controls) obtained at autopsy. Samples were taken from four different regions of each brain: frontal cortex, putamen, pons, and nucleus dentatus. Copper, manganese and zinc content was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and iron was evaluated using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results were analyzed according to selected clinical variables. RESULTS: Copper content increased homogeneously in all examined structures of WD brains compared to controls (41.0 +/- 18.6 cups/g vs. 5.4 +/- 1.8 cups/g; P<0.01). Mean iron, manganese, and zinc concentrations were similar in WD and controls, but iron levels in the nucleus dentatus were higher in WD compared to controls (56.8 +/- 14.1 mug/g vs. 32.6 +/- 6.0 mug/g; P<0.05). Gender, age, type and duration of WD treatment did not affect brain metals deposition, but some correlations were observed between disease duration and copper and iron deposition. CONCLUSION: During WD, copper accumulates equally in different parts of the brain. Zinc and manganese do not appear to be involved in WD pathology, but increased iron levels have been found in the core dentatus. Therefore, additional studies on brain iron deposition in WD are needed. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Litwin, T.;Gromadzka, G.;Szpak, G.

165,Trientine attenuates BACE1 activity and attenuates amyloidosis via the AGE/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that transition metal copper may play an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine), a selective chelator of CuII, is a commonly used treatment for Wilson's disease to reduce accumulated copper and therefore reduce oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 3-month treatment of trientine (Triene) on amyloidosis in 7-month beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic (Tg). ) AD model mice. RESULTS: We observed that Triene reduced the level of enhanced glycation end products (AGEs) and Abeta accumulation and synapse loss in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, we found that Triene blocks the AGEs (RAGE) receptor, downregulates beta domain APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), inhibits amyloidogenic APP cleavage, and subsequently lowers Abeta levels. In vitro, in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing Swedish mutant APP, Trien-mediated downregulation of BACE1 occurred through inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. INNOVATION: In this study, we show for the first time that Triene inhibits the amyloidogenic pathway, including targeting the downregulation of RAGE and NF-kappaB. CONCLUSION: Triene can alleviate amyloidosis in AD by inhibiting the RAGE/NF-kappaB/BACE1 pathway. Our study demonstrates that Trien may be a viable therapeutic strategy for the intervention and treatment of AD and other AD-like pathologies.",,"Wang, C. Y.;Xie, J. W.;Xu, Y.;Wang, T.;Cai, J.

166,Discovery of human zinc deficiency: impact on human health and disease.,"The importance of zinc in humans was established in 1963. Over the past 50 years, tremendous advances have been observed in both the clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans. The main contributing factor to zinc deficiency is high phytate grain protein intake in developing countries, and approximately 2 billion people may be zinc deficient. Conditional zinc deficiency has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, and other chronic diseases. The main clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs did not live beyond 25 years of age and died from intervening infections. In 1963 we knew only 3 enzymes that needed zinc for their activity, but now we know >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activity. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells and intracellular free zinc in these cells participates in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry-type macular degeneration and is very effective in reducing the incidence. infection in the elderly. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity, but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",,"Prasad, A. S.",2013,2001-03-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.112.003210,0,0,

168,ZEB2 zinc finger missense mutations lead to hypomorphic alleles and a mild Mowat-Wilson syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a severe intellectual disability (ID)-distinctive facial gestalt-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome commonly associated with microcephaly, epilepsy, agenesis of the corpus callosum, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital malformations, and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. Most mutations lead to haplo-deficiency via early stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of these are found in a known functional area of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. The patients' phenotype included facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but without microcephaly, heart defects, or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Leveraging zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutational, embryo rescue was observed in conjunction with the severity of the patients' phenotype. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause partial loss of function of ZEB2; this suggests that its role is not limited to the suppression of E-cadherin. Functional areas other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, suggesting that MWS should be considered in patients with lower ID grades and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformations.",,"Ghoumid, J.;Drevillon, L.;Alavi-Naini, S.

169,Effect of zinc and role of p53 in copper-induced cellular stress responses,"Metals can directly or indirectly increase the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, resulting in programmed cell death. A number of previous studies have shown that zinc (Zn) modulates mitogenic activity through various signaling pathways such as AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), AP-1 and p53. The precise role that Zn plays in regulating apoptosis remains unclear. Intracellular free Zn modulates p53 activity and stability, and excess Zn alters p53 protein structure and down-regulates p53 binding to DNA. Copper (Cu) accumulation causes DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis, which appears to be mediated by p53 activation. Cu can also remove Zn from its normal binding site on p53, resulting in abnormal protein folding and disruption of p53 function. Despite the induction of the tumor suppressor p53, hepatic Cu accumulation significantly increases the risk of cancerous neoplasms in both humans and rats, suggesting that p53 function may be impaired in these cells. It is generally understood that imbalances in Cu and Zn levels may lead to a higher prevalence of p53 mutations. An increased number of p53 mutations have been found in liver samples from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). High levels of p53 mutation most likely contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer in individuals with WD, but cause and effect are unclear. The p53 protein also plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of metallothionein, suggesting a novel regulatory role for p53. This review discusses the central role of p53 and the redox-inert metal Zn in cellular stress responses induced by the redox-active biometal Cu.

170,Trientine-induced neurological deterioration in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper chelating agent used to treat patients with Wilson's disease (WD). It was considered safe as it rarely causes neurological deterioration during initial treatment. We describe a patient diagnosed with WD who became neurologically disabled after treatment with trientine. In a fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence, the brain MRI showed increased areas of high signal intensity compared to the initial brain MRI. After discontinuation of trientine treatment, the patient's neurological findings partially improved. Our findings suggest that treatment with trientine is associated with a risk of neurological deterioration in patients with WD. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

171,Complex formation balance of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with triethylenetetramine and its mono- and di-acetyl metabolites,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA) dihydrochloride or trientine is a therapeutic molecule that has long been used as a copper chelating agent for the second-line treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. More recently, it has also been used as an experimental therapeutic molecule in diabetes, where it improves heart structure in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy. TETA is metabolized in humans and other mammals by acetylation leading to the formation of two major metabolites, monoacetyl-TETA (MAT) and diacetyl-TETA (DAT). These metabolites have been identified in plasma and urine of healthy and diabetic subjects treated with TETA and may themselves be involved in TETA-mediated copper chelation and restoration of physiological copper regulation in diabetes. In this context, a potentiometric and spectrophotometric study of the Cu(II)-complex formation equilibria of TETA, MAT and DAT is presented here to provide a comprehensive assessment of the stoichiometries of the complexes formed and their relative stability constants. A potentiometric study was also performed on the corresponding Zn(II) complexes to evaluate any possible interference with TETA-mediated Cu(II) binding by this second physiological transition metal ion, which is present at similar concentrations in human plasma. It also connects to TETA. An ESI-MS study of these systems both confirmed the complex formation mechanisms established from the potentiometric and spectrophotometric results, and provided direct information on the stoichiometry of the complexes formed in solution. Taken together, these data show that the 1:1 complexes formed with Cu(II) and Zn(II) have different degrees of protonation. The stability of Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with the three ligands evaluated by the parameters pCu and pZn is reduced by the addition of acetyl groups. However, the stability of Cu(II) complexes with MAT is high enough to warrant its participation in copper clearance from the patient. A speciation study of the behavior of TETA and MAT with Cu(II) in the presence of Zn(II) at peri-physiological plasma concentrations is also presented. Although Zn(II) does not inhibit copper binding, the possibility arises that long-term TETA treatment could possibly alter the homeostatic regulation of this essential metal ion. The lack of reliable literature stability constants regarding the interaction of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with the major transport proteins in plasma is also briefly discussed.",,"Nurchi, V.

172,A new HPLC-electrochemical detection approach for the determination of D-penicillamine in skin samples,"D-penicillamine is a thiol drug mainly used for Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cystinuria. Side effects are common during normal use of the drug and may include skin lesions. An original method based on high-performance liquid chromatography based on amperometric detection in a specific biological matrix such as skin was developed to evaluate its toxic effects in clinical cases. Chromatographic analysis of D-penicillamine was performed on a C18 column using a mixture of acid phosphate buffer and methanol as the mobile phase. Satisfactory sensitivity was obtained by oxidizing the molecule at +0.95 V relative to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Chemical reduction of D-penicillamine-protein disulfide bonds using dithioerythritol combined with microwaves was necessary to determine the total amount of D-penicillamine in skin samples. Another solid phase extraction procedure was performed on C18 cartridges for sample cleaning. The entire analytical procedure was validated: high extraction yield (>91.0%) and satisfactory precision (RSD<6.8%) values were obtained. It was successfully applied to skin samples from a patient who had previously undergone long-term, high-dose therapy with the drug and exhibited severe dermatoses associated with D-penicillamine. Therefore, the method appears to be suitable for the analysis of D-penicillamine in skin tissues. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Saracino, M.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 60 patients with WD treated with zinc and/or penicillamine. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and 40 patients underwent initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups: progressive (patients with worsening at least one unit of fibrosis) and nonprogressive (patients presenting stable or improved fibrosis scores). RESULTS: A total of 33/40 (83%) patients (not progressing) showed stable hepatic histology or recovery. Seven of the 40 patients (17%) (advanced) showed worsening of fibrosis. There was no significant relationship between histological findings and clinical parameters or initial presentation.

175,Do we need authorized orphan drugs when combined drugs are available?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Orphan drugs are used to diagnose, prevent or treat a rare disease. This Commentary aims to present a series of case studies that question the need to identify compounded drugs with a long history of effective use, well supported by published clinical evidence. COMMENT: Before the launch of orphan drugs, drugs were prepared in our hospital pharmacy for some rare diseases. Examples include amifampridine (Firdapse()) for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, ibuprofen (Pedea()) for the treatment of neonatal patent ductus arteriosus, and zinc acetate (Wilzin()) for the treatment of Wilson's disease. A few 'non-orphan' pharmaceuticals that have become orphan medicinal products used off-label for the treatment of rare diseases include Hydrea() for the treatment of sickle cell syndrome (Siklos()) and Viagra() for the treatment of diseases. pulmonary arterial hypertension (Revatio()). INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: As our examples show, a better balance should be struck between the development of orphan drugs along recent regulatory pathways and the pragmatic use of pharmacy compounded products and evidence-based unethical drugs.

177,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological copper accumulation in many organs and tissues. The hallmarks of the disease are liver disease, neurological symptoms, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings. The leading neurological symptoms in WD are dysatria, dyspraxia, ataxia, and Parkinson's-like extrapyramidal symptoms. Changes in the basal ganglia in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are characteristic features of the disease. In the presence of liver cirrhosis, some features may resemble hepatic encephalopathy. Symptoms and MRI abnormalities are completely reversible when treated with zinc or copper chelators. Improvement can be tracked by serial recording of brainstem evoked responses. The main defect is the disruption of copper trafficking in hepatocytes. ATP7B is the gene product of the WD gene located on chromosome 13 and is found in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, transporting copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and excretion in the bile. Although approximately 40% of patients are predisposed by neurological symptoms, little is known about the role of copper and ATP7B in the central nervous system. In some brain regions, such as in the pineal gland, ATP7B is expressed and functionally active. Increasing evidence supports the important role of metals in neurobiology. Two proteins involved in neurodegeneration are copper-binding proteins (1) amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, and (2) Prion protein associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The main source of free radical production in the brain comes from copper. To prevent metal-mediated oxidative stress, cells have developed complex metal transport systems. APP is the master regulator of neuronal copper homeostasis and has a copper binding domain (CuBD). The surface location of this region, the structural homology of CuBD to copper chaperones, and the role of APP in neuronal copper homeostasis are consistent with CuBD acting as a neuronal metal transporter. There are several copper-containing enzymes in the brain, such as dopamine beta hydroxylase or Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Its functions may change due to copper overload. WD appears to be associated with a dopaminergic deficiency. Mutations in the SOD1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Survival of transgenic mice with a mutant SOD1 that did not include Cu((2+)) in its active site was improved by copper depletion. Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease in which copper pathologically accumulates primarily in the liver and then in the neurological system and many other organs and tissues. Presence of liver disease, neurological symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings are the hallmarks of the disease.

178,Pathophysiology and clinical features of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological copper accumulation in many organs and tissues. ATP7B is the gene product of the Wilson disease gene located on chromosome 13 and is found in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, transporting copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and excretion in the bile. Mutations of the gene cause impaired transit of copper in and out of hepatocytes. More than 200 mutations have been found in the Wilson disease gene, with the most common being H1069Q (in Europe) and R778L (in Asia). Wilson's disease can occur under a variety of clinical conditions, usually liver and/or neuropsychiatric disease. The pathogenesis of hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease is a direct result of copper deposition. The presence of copper causes oxidative stress, which causes cell destruction. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease requires a combination of various clinical symptoms, biochemical testing, and detection of gene mutations, which is the basis for a score recommended by a group of international experts. Initial therapy for symptomatic patients should include a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine). Treatment or maintenance therapy of presymptomatic patients can also be carried out with zinc.

179,Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) inhibits copper-mediated free radical formation in vitro,"Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) is a low toxicity iron chelator with antioxidant activity and is useful in the experimental treatment of iron overload diseases. Previous studies on X-ray diffraction revealed that PIH also forms a complex with Cu(II). Since d-penicillamine, the main drug of choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease, causes a number of side effects, there is an urgent need to develop alternative copper chelating agents for clinical use. These chelators must also have antioxidant activity because oxidative stress is associated with brain and liver copper overload. In this study, we tested the ability of PIH to inhibit free radical formation in vitro mediated by Cu(II), ascorbate, and dissolved O. The degradation of 2-deoxyribose mediated by 10 microM Cu(II) and 3 mM ascorbate was completely inhibited by 10 microM PIH (150 = 6 microM) or 20 microM d-penicillamine (150 = 10 microM). The antioxidant activity of PIH remained unchanged with increasing concentrations (between 1 and 15 mM) of the hydroxyl radical detector molecule 2-deoxyribose, indicating that PIH does not act as a hydroxyl scavenger. On the other hand, the efficacy of PIH (versus copper-mediated 2-deoxyribose degradation and ascorbate oxidation) was inversely proportional to Cu(II) concentration, suggesting a competition between PIH and ascorbate for complexation with Cu(II). An almost complete inhibitory effect was observed by PIH when the PIH:copper ratio was 1:1. A similar result was obtained by measuring copper plus ascorbate-mediated O2 uptake. Moreover, spectral studies of copper and PIH interaction showed a peak at 455 nm and also showed the formation of a stable Cu(II) complex with PIH at a ratio of 1:1. These data do not participate in the Haber-Weiss reactions of PIH with Cu(II) ascorbate (the first step of the reactions leading to hydroxyl radical formation from Cu(II), ascorbate and O2).",,"Hermes-Lima, M.;Goncalves, M.

180,Structural and functional views of Wilson's disease copper-transporting ATPase.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The gene for this disorder has been cloned and identified to encode copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B), a member of a large family of cation transporters, P-type ATPases. In addition to the core elements common to all P-type ATPases, the Wilson copper-bearing ATPase has a large cytoplasmic N-terminal consisting of six heavy metal-linked (HMA) domains, each containing the copper-binding sequence motif GMT/HCXXC. . Extensive studies addressing the functional, regulatory and structural aspects of heavy metal transport by heavy metal transporters in general have provided great insight into copper transport by the Wilson copper transporting ATPase. Findings from these studies were used in conjunction with homology modeling of Wilson's disease copper-bearing ATPases based on the X-ray structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-ATPase and provided a hypothetical model of the copper transport mechanism. copper-bearing ATPases.

Statistically, the mean iron, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels of the celiac and Crohn groups were significantly lower than those of the normal and Wilson groups, while they were similar in the Wilson and control groups. Low serum copper (85 +/- 26 microg/dl, P < 0.158) and ceruloplasmin (219 +/- 83 U/l, P < 0.001) and high 24-hour urinary copper (415 +/- 346) microg/ day) is in the Wilson group. Increased urine loss may be another cause of copper deficiency besides malabsorption in female celiacs and this issue needs to be investigated further. Increased urinary copper levels in celiac patients should not always be considered a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.",,"Ince, A. T.;Kayadibi, H.;Soylu, A.;Ovunc, O.;Gultepe, M.;Toros, A.

182,Liver structures of a patient with idiopathic copper toxicosis,"This is the first report describing the liver structures of a Japanese patient with idiopathic copper toxicosis, which must be differentiated from hepatolenticular degeneration of Wilson's disease. An 11-year-old Japanese boy presented with a complaint of ascites associated with biochemical liver damage. Involvement of hepatitis virus was ruled out by laboratory tests. Wilson's disease was suspected because of increased urinary copper excretion, but serum ceruloplasmin level was normal and Kayser-Fleischer rings were not detected in slit lamp examination. Brain images were within normal limits. ATP7B analysis was negative for mutations. The liver sample showed cirrhosis associated with chronic active hepatitis. Almost all hepatocytes were positive for orcein-stained granules. Mallory bodies were found in some hepatocytes. Fatty change was minimal and the parenchyma had no nuclei with glycogen. Combined trientine and zinc regimens for 6 months improved the decompensated state of liver function. A second liver biopsy was performed after 2.5 years of treatment. After treatment, the liver showed complete disappearance of portal inflammation and a significant reduction in cuprothionein granules. Mallory bodies disappeared from the parenchyma. The abundance of hepatocellular Mallory bodies and heavy liver-limited copper overload may be specific to idiopathic copper toxicosis.",,"Hayashi, H.;Shinohara, T.;Goto, K.;Fujita, Y.;Murakami, Y.;Hattori, A.;Tatsumi, Y.;Shimizu, A.;Ichiki, T.",2012,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00795-011-0556-1,0,0,

Laboratory findings showed normal serum copper (104 microg/dl), high urinary copper (2370 microg/dl), and low serum ceruloplasmin (14.3 microg/dl). Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen in his cornea on slit lamp examination, and the patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration resolved the serious condition, followed by laparoscopic examination. Administration of D-penicillamine and restriction of dietary copper (<1 mg/day) were initiated, resulting in a normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level.

187,Wilson's disease: two treatment modalities. Correlations with pre-treatment and post-treatment brain MRI,"INTRODUCTION: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on Wilson's disease (WD) show that there is no correlation between neurological and neuroimaging features. There are few reports of long-term follow-up with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different treatment modalities. METHODS: Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent pre-treatment and post-treatment brain MRI scans to assess the range of abnormalities and evolution over these different periods. All patients underwent at least two MRI scans at different intervals up to 11 years after treatment initiation. MRI findings were associated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and two different drug treatments. Patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: D: -penicillamine (DP), zinc (Zn), and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to DP. RESULTS: Pre-treatment MRI scans showed bilateral and symmetrical hypersignal density lesions in the basal nucleus, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and cerebral white matter in all patients on T2 and proton density-weighted images. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disorders, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea, and athetosis. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologically, there was no evolutionary difference between the DP-only group and the Zn-treated group. Analysis of MRI scans at longer intervals after initiation of therapy revealed a trend for worsening neuroimaging without neurological correspondence in patients treated with Zn. The neuroimaging evolution model was more favorable for the DP-only group.",,"da Costa Mdo, D.;Spitz, M.;Bacheschi, L. A.;Leite, C. C.;Lucato, L. T.;Barbosa, E.

189,Copper transport and Alzheimer's disease,"This short review discusses copper transport in humans with emphasis on knowledge learned from yeast, one of the simplest model organisms. There is more focus on copper transport in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Copper homeostasis is essential for the well-being of all organisms, from bacteria to yeasts to humans: survival depends on copper for activity, ensuring that there is no excess free copper, while maintaining an essential copper supply for many enzymes. What toxicity does it cause? A virtual protein orchestra is required to maintain copper homeostasis. For copper uptake, Cu(II) is first reduced to Cu(I) via a membrane bound reductase. The reduced copper can then be internalized by a copper carrier, where it is transferred to copper chaperones for transport and specific delivery to various organelles. The important internal copper transporters are ATP7A and ATP7B, notable for their roles in copper deficiency and toxicity disorders, Menkes and Wilson's disease, respectively. Metallothioneins and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase can protect against excess copper in cells. It is also clear that increasing age, environmental and lifestyle factors affect brain copper. Studies on AD show that copper plays an important role in the brain, and some AD treatments focus on activating copper in AD brains. Transport of copper to the brain is complex and involves multiple players, including amyloid precursor protein, A beta peptide, and cholesterol. [References: 58]",,"Macreadie, I.

190,Clinical correlation of brain MRI and MRS abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: The progression of Wilson's disease (WD), a copper metabolism disorder, can be halted by chelation therapy. However, neurological deficits may persist despite adequate treatment. MRI is used to evaluate patients with WD, but previous attempts to link clinical progress with research findings have often been unsuccessful. OBJECTIVE: To identify MR-visible markers that can help classify disease severity and to clarify the mechanism of persistent neurological deficit after treatment. METHODS: MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were performed on 17 patients with WD. MRI was evaluated semi-quantitatively and used to locate volumes of interest (voxels) in the striatum for 1H-MRS. RESULTS: MRI showed abnormalities limited to patients with predominantly neurological features of WD. The 1H spectrum showed a reduction in N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (2.05 mM; p < 0.01) in patients with neurological features but no clinical neurological involvement (0.42 mM; p > 0.1). normal control subjects. Choline was decreased in both patient groups (0.08 mM; p < 0.01) compared to same-aged controls. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a biochemical correlate of tissue-specific dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease who develop neurological features. These changes appear to be present despite prior clinical improvement and may mean that additional treatment is needed.",,"Page, R. A.;Davie, C. A.;MacManus, D.;Miszkiel, K. A.;Walshe, J.

The presence of 64.3% delayed wave III and/or IPL III-V prolongation in patients with the neurological form makes pathological FAEP the most common form of the disorder, followed by MSEP, TSEP, MEP, and T-VEP disorders. Patients with the non-neurological form usually have normal values, but prolongation of the delay occurs in isolated cases.

203,Practical recommendations and new treatments for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation. The main defect is the inability to excrete excess copper in the bile by the liver for loss in the stool. The accumulated copper primarily damages the liver and brain. Patients typically present in the second to fourth decades of life with liver disease, a neurologic disease of the movement disorder type, or a wide variety of behavioral disorders. Because the symptoms of Wilson's disease are so variable and the disease is as well concealed as anything else, recognizing the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major challenge, leading to severely underdiagnosis of the disease. There are excellent treatments available for both prophylaxis and treatment of Wilson's disease. The longer recognition and diagnosis is delayed, the greater the risk of permanent damage to the liver and/or brain. The availability of effective treatment and the delay or risks in treatment make the earliest possible diagnosis critical. Given the disease, a series of diagnostic steps can almost always be undertaken to diagnose or rule out Wilson's disease. These include urine copper, blood ceruloplasmin, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and quantitative copper assay and liver biopsy. Currently, there are 4 drugs used as copper inhibitory agents in Wilson's disease. These are chelators that increase the urinary excretion of copper, copper, penicillamine and trientine, which prevents intestinal absorption of zinc, and tetrathiomolybdate, which forms a triple complex with copper and protein. blood copper non-toxic. In our opinion, zinc is clearly the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy, for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient from the outset, and for the treatment of the pregnant patient, due to its full efficacy and absence of toxicity. We empirically use a combination of trientine and zinc for the initial treatment of a patient who presents with mild hepatic impairment. Trientine provides a potent, rapid, negative copper balance, and zinc induces hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters hepatic copper. For the initial treatment of patients presenting with neurological disease, we use tetrathiomolybdate, an experimental drug that provides rapid and safe control of copper. These latter patients are at risk of severe permanent neurologic deterioration with penicillamine and, in our opinion, zinc is too slow acting to be optimal. [References: 46]",,"Brewer, G. J.",1995,Aug,,0,1,
204,Current treatment of chronic liver disease,"Studies of chronic liver disease have been hampered by insufficient knowledge of the pathogenesis of many forms of hepatitis. As a result, well-designed treatment strategies are often lacking. Wilson's disease is characterized by excessive copper deposition in the liver and other organs. While D-penicillamine is clearly effective, many patients may not be able to tolerate its many side effects. Trientine, oral zinc, and unithiol have shown promise as therapeutic alternatives. Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis responds well to prednisone and azathioprine. Cyclosporine has also produced clinical improvement in several case reports, but no comparison to current standard therapy has yet been made. Recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) has demonstrated the ability to inhibit hepatitis B viral replication, and the combination of IFN alpha followed by oral corticosteroids is more effective than either agent alone in abolishing viral replication in patients with chronic active hepatitis B. There is no standard medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), but corticosteroids and methotrexate may each have a role in the treatment in the future. Drug therapy for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been disappointing, and reports of early success with d-penicillamine have not been confirmed in large well-controlled studies. While some reports of improvement have been identified with several agents, larger studies are still needed. Alcoholic liver disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and numerous researchers have explored several different avenues of medical treatment. Reported success with androgens and the antithyroid agent propylthiouracil in alcoholic liver disease will need to be confirmed by further research before these agents can be recommended for routine use. Finally, colchicine may be effective in slowing the rate of fibrosis in cirrhosis, but this has not yet been conclusively proven. [References: 89]",,"Stavinoha, M. W.;Soloway, R. D.",1990,Jun,,0,0,

214,Ion flow systems in bacterial metal resistors,"Studying metal ion resistance gives us important information about environmental processes and provides an understanding of basic life processes. This review focuses on bacterial efflux systems for inorganic metal cations and anions, which are often found as resistance systems from bacteria isolated from metal-contaminated environments. The protein products of the genes of interest are sometimes prototypes of new protein families or important new branches of known families. Sometimes, a group of associated proteins (and possibly underlying physiological function) still needs to be identified. For example, the influx of inorganic metal anion arsenide is mediated by a membrane protein that functions alone in Gram-positive bacteria but requires an additional ATPase subunit in some Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance to Cd2+ and Zn2+ in Gram-positive bacteria is the result of a P-type efflux ATPase associated with copper transport P-type ATPases of bacteria and humans (defective in the human hereditary diseases Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease). In contrast, resistance to Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Cd2+ in Gram-negative bacteria relies on the action of proton-cation antiporters, which are members of a newly recognized family of proteins involved in various functions such as metal resistance/nodulation. legumes/cell division (hence the family is called RND). Another new family of proteins, designated CDF for the 'cation diffusion promoter', has as prototype the protein CzcD, a regulatory component of a cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance marker in the Gram-negative bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus. A family for the ChrA chromate resistance system in gram-negative bacteria has not yet been identified. [References: 102]",,"Nies, D. H.;Silver, S.",1995,Feb,,0,0,

Treatment with zinc has emerged as a viable alternative to penicillamine administration, and some shortcomings and/or dangers of both forms of treatment have emerged as modes of action have been more carefully studied. Tetrathymolybdate may be involved in the treatment, especially where rapid complexation of copper is important. Hepatic copper deposition occurs in many cholestatic diseases and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and can sometimes lead to neurological toxic effects. Copper overload in the neonatal period, when biliary copper excretion is insufficient, may produce a vicious cycle of copper accumulation and liver damage in infants in Indian childhood cirrhosis and, less frequently, in other countries.

CSF copper concentration measurements were made from the beginning of treatment in three patients and 16 months after the first treatment in the fourth patient.

The more copper was eliminated, the higher the basal ganglia glucose consumption was. On the other hand, a significant decrease in basal ganglia glucose consumption was observed in seven patients treated for more than 7 years, suggesting that the maintenance dose of DPA was too low.",,"Hefter, H.;Kuwert, T.;Herzog, H.;Arendt, G.;Stremmel, W.;Feinendegen, L.

Patients were screened using spin-echo (SE) sequences; The neurologist was looking for typical symptoms: dysarthria, tremor, ataxia, rigidity/bradykinesia, and chorea/dystonia. Pathological MRI findings believed to be secondary to this rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism were found in twenty-two subjects. Focal abnormalities were seen in the lenticular, thalamic, and caudate nuclei, as well as in the brainstem and white matter; these lesions were best shown on T2-weighted sequences as hyperintense areas. We found diffuse brain atrophy with sequential enlargement of the ventricular system in eight patients. Five subjects showed mild and nineteen severe neurological deficits. In general, there was no correlation between MR findings and clinical neurological symptoms; Disruption of cell metabolism, which causes functional changes in the brain, precedes morphological changes. During treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine, the disease appeared to have a gradual course. T1 relaxation was not shortened due to the paramagnetic effect of copper; one possible explanation would be intracellular accumulation - so a proton-electron-dipolar-dipolar-interaction would be impossible.",,"Prayer, L.;Wimberger, D.;Kramer, J.;Grimm, G.;Oder, W.;Imhof, H.",1990,,,0,0,

Serial examinations over 10 months following the initiation of D-penicillamine therapy revealed that EMG responses returned to normal. Pathophysiologically, the initial abnormal EMG responses likely resulted from reversible disruption of impulse propagation along the cortico-motor-neuronal pathways and/or decreased excitability of cortical cells due to impaired function of the basal ganglia.",,"Meyer, B.

In WD patients, cerebellar, striatal, and, to a lesser extent, cortical and thalamic rCMRGlc were significantly reduced compared to controls. Striatal rCMRGlc was significantly reduced in these 4 patients who had recently started copper removal therapy compared to striatal rCMRGlc measured in these 10 patients with longer drug duration. Caudate rCMRGlc was significantly associated with various manifestations of extrapyramidal dysfunction.

We present a case of Wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; In addition, 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in the frontal lobes, more prominently in the left frontal lobe, in our patient who presented with a high level of state anxiety even without depression. When lichenoid dermatitis was observed in the follow-up of our patient, penicillamine treatment was interrupted and the successful treatment of the patient was continued with zinc acetate without any side effects. In our case, treatment with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a Wilson's disease patient with penicillamine-related side effects. The safety of zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence for the drug's efficacy in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Since most patients for Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine do not develop this skin lesion, a specific genetic factor may be considered to play a role in the drug response.

WD presents with liver disease, neurological or psychiatric disorders, or less common clinical features. The diagnosis of WD is often difficult and can be formulated through clinical, biochemical, imaging, histochemical, and genetic evaluations. The pharmacological approach in WD consists of copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, trientine, dimercaprol and tetrathiomolybdate. In 1997, zinc was approved by the US FDA for the maintenance treatment of WD. Orthotopic Liver Transplantation is indicated in fulminant liver failure, progressive liver failure despite treatment, cirrhosis with complications of portal hypertension. However, the most appropriate treatment, including OLT, is controversial in WD, and further studies are needed to distinguish the possibility of specific treatments, especially for different WD phenotypes.

237,Zinc acetate therapy in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To briefly review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of Wilson's disease and to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical benefit, side effects, dosing regimens, and pharmacoeconomics of zinc acetate therapy in Wilson's disease. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the English literature (December 1966-December 1996) was conducted using the terms zinc and Wilson's disease to identify relevant clinical trials, review articles, and case reports. Additional articles were selected from bibliographies of the reviewed literature. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA WITHDRAWAL: Due to the rarity of the disease, all articles were considered for inclusion in this review. Single case reports are cited but not selected for evaluation. DATA SYNTHESIS: Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is fatal if left untreated. The chelating drugs penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of treatment; however, adverse reactions of chelators often interfere with successful treatment. Recently, zinc acetate has been approved in the US for maintenance therapy in patients initially treated with a chelating agent. Although studies evaluating large populations have been lacking in zinc therapy, it has demonstrated exceptional safety and efficacy over a 40-year period. Zinc acetate can be used during pregnancy and for the treatment of presymptomatic patients, but data do not support its use as monotherapy in patients with acute neurological or liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc acetate is an effective maintenance therapy in patients with Wilson's disease. Negligible toxicity compared to previously approved treatments is a major advantage.

Our aim was to describe the various patterns, treatments, and outcomes of this disease. DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENT: A retrospective study of over two decades on WD patients in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were analyzed from their charts, referral notes, and electronic records of our hospital. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation were 16.8 (10.7) years, and 56.5% were male. The main symptoms of WD were hepatic, neurologic and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%), and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) patients detected by family screening were asymptomatic. In 41 (57.7%) patients, WD was positive in the family, and in 26 (36.6%) patients, consanguinity was found between the parents. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 92.2 (72.9) (range, 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%) were followed up or out of follow-up, respectively. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 (12) (range, 4-62) years. Hepatoma was detected in 5 (7.0%) patients. Penicillamine treatment was given to 58 (81.7%) patients, and zinc and trientine (15.5%) to 32 (45.1%) patients.

A long-term follow-up study,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There are certain areas of uncertainty regarding the best therapeutic approach in patients diagnosed with Wilson's Disease (WD). Our aim was to evaluate the treatment response to different treatments in a cohort of WD patients followed at a single centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study reviewing clinical, laboratory, and imaging data in 20 WD patients with a median follow-up of 14 years. Presentation type, treatment used, biochemical and copper homeostasis parameters were revealed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most common presentation was hepatic (n = 10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). Initial treatment at diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was d-penicillamine in 90% and Zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Complete biochemical normalization was seen in patients treated with d-penicillamine throughout the entire period (baseline ALT: 220 IU/l; final follow-up 38 IU/l). In contrast, patients switched to d-penicillamine Zn, regardless of cause, did not show a complete biochemical remission (baseline ALT: 100 IU/l and 66 IU/l at final follow-up). CONCLUSION: The treatment was effective in most cases, regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in those treated with d-penicillamine agents and needed a switch to zinc. Treatment with zinc was well tolerated and appeared to have good efficacy. However, complete normalization of liver enzymes was never achieved in 33%.",,"Rodriguez, B.;Burguera, J.;Berenguer, M.",2012,Nov-Dec,,1,1,

246,new long-range enhancer regulates the postnatal expression of Zeb2: implications for Mowat-Wilson syndrome phenotypes.,"The zinc finger, E-box-binding homeobox-2 (Zeb2) gene encodes a SMAD-interacting transcription factor with diverse roles in development and disease. Mutations in the hZeb2 locus cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a genetic disorder associated with mental retardation and other case- and sex-related clinical features. Recent studies have demonstrated in detail the microRNA-mediated control of Zeb2, but little is known about the genomic context of this gene or the enhancer sequences that may direct its various functions. Here, we describe a novel transgenic rodent model in which the Zeb2 regulatory sequence is disrupted, resulting in a postnatal developmental phenotype that is autosomal dominant. The phenotype exhibits genotype interaction with respect to sex and manifests primarily as acute attenuation of postnatal kidney development in males. Other aspects of embryonic and neonatal development, including neuronal, are not affected. The transgene insertion site is associated with a 12 kb deletion, 1.2 Mb upstream of Zeb2 within a 4.1 Mb gene desert. A conserved sequence derived from the deleted region increased Zeb2 promoter activity in transcription experiments. Tissue and temporal limitation of this reinforcing activity may include postnatal changes in proteins that bind this sequence. A control human/mouse VISTA enhancer (62 kb upstream of Zeb2) also upregulated the Zeb2 promoter, providing evidence of a number of conserved distal enhancers. The phenotype resulting from deletion of one copy of the overly long-range enhancer indicates a critical role for this developer at a developmental stage. Haploinsufficiency of Zeb2 in this developmental context reflects the inheritance of MWS and may underlie some of the sex-related, non-neural features of this human-inherited disorder.",,"El-Kasti, M.

247,Copper imbalances in ruminants and humans: unexpected commonality,"Ruminants are more vulnerable to copper deficiency than humans because rumen sulfur formation reduces copper availability from feed, increasing the risk of conditions such as withdrawal in lambs. Molybdenum-rich pastures promote thiomolybdate (TM) synthesis and formation of non-absorbable Cu-TM complexes, making risk a clinical reality (hypocuprosis). Selection pressures have created ruminant species that are deficiency tolerant but vulnerable to copper toxicity in foreign environments such as specific pathogen-free units. In contrast, cases of copper imbalance in humans appeared to be limited to rare genetic abnormalities of copper metabolism. Recent explanations of human relapse and the exploratory use of TM in the treatment of Wilson's disease, tumor growth, inflammatory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease have created unexpected common ground. The incidence of pre-hemolytic copper poisoning in specific pathogen-free lambs was reduced with Mycobacterium avium infection, which leaves them more susceptible to treatment with TM but vulnerable to long-term copper depletion. Copper requirements in ruminants and humans may need an extra allowance for the ""copper cost"" of immunity to infection. Residual cuproenzyme inhibition and abnormalities in plasma copper composition in TM-treated lambs appear to be related to liver copper status, raising the question ""could the chelating capacity be used without causing copper deficiency in ruminant animals or humans?"" A balance model between exogenous (TM) and endogenous chelators (eg, albumin, metallothionein) is used to estimate exposure and risk of hypocuprosis; Although the natural risk of exposure in humans is remote, susceptibility to TM-induced copper deficiency may be high. Biomarkers of TM action are needed, and copper chaperones are prime candidates for inhibited cuproenzymes.",,"Suttle, N. F.",2012,2001-09-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.112.002220,0,0,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven WD patients (35 m/32 f; mean age 41 years) were reviewed retrospectively. All patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological and neurological examinations, brain RMN and ECD SPECT, detailed objective laboratory studies and liver histological examinations for analysis during diagnosis and follow-up. All patients received anti-copper therapy with d-Penicillamine as monotherapy or in combination with Zinc Salts. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, 27% of the patients had CF with an equal distribution in all age groups. Significant correlations were found between CF, neuropsychiatric symptoms and pathological features in brain RMN and brain ECD SPECT at diagnosis. A decrease or regression in CF was observed in 14% of the patients during follow-up. Anti-copper therapy leads to CF regression and prevents the appearance of CF. No significant association was observed between CF regression and clinical neurological or neuroimaging improvement, or between CF modifications and clinical hepatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the distinctive features of Sardinian WD patients: the underrepresentation of CF, its equal distribution across all age groups, the significant correlation between CF at diagnosis and clinical neurological manifestations, highlighted by our study of pathological brain RMN and brain ECD-SPECT. . Anti-copper therapy causes CF regression and prevents its onset. Thus, the CF ring appears to be a predictive factor in the neurological and hepatic evolution of WD.

250,D-Penicillamine targets metastatic melanoma cells by induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) and Noxa (PMAIP1)-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis,"D-Penicillamine (3,3-dimethyl-D-cysteine; DP) is an FDA-approved redox-active D-cysteine derivative with antioxidant, disulfide-reducing and metal-chelating properties, used therapeutically for the control of copper-related pathology. Reducing cystine-solubility in Wilson's disease and cystinuria. Based on the established sensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress, we tested the feasibility of using DP for chemotherapeutic intervention targeting human A375 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DP treatment induced caspase-dependent cell death in cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361) without compromising the viability of primary epidermal melanocytes; this is an effect not observed with the thiol-antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and dithiothreitol. Immunoblot detection following focused gene expression sequence analysis revealed that DP rapidly activates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; includes phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2alpha, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by p53 upregulation and modulation. put it. Bcl-2 family members (includes Noxa, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2). DP (but not NAC) induced oxidative stress with premature disruption of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SiRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked DP-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only effector Noxa and rescued melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis by preventing downregulation of the Noxa-antagonist Mcl-1. Intraperitoneal administration of DP exhibited significant antimelanoma activity in a murine A375 xenograft model. Whether the UPR and melanoma cell-directed induction of apoptosis using DP or enhanced DP-derivatives can be used for future chemotherapeutic intervention remains to be seen.",,"Qiao, S.;Cabello, C.

252,Endocrine symptoms as the first sign of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism. The variation in copper tissue deposition is responsible for the various clinical manifestations of this disorder. Left untreated, Wilson's disease progresses to liver failure, severe neurological impairment, and even death. Due to the complex clinical picture of Wilson's disease, its diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion. In our article, we present the endocrine symptoms suggestive of insulinoma and hyperprolactinemia as the first clinical manifestation of Wilson's disease in a young woman.

253,Good response to zinc acetate monotherapy in an adolescent afflicted with severe Wilson's disease,"We defined a 17-year-old girl with hemolytic anemia as Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was based on ceruloplasmin serum level <20 mg/dl, Kayser-Fleischer ring and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia findings. Genetic testing revealed the presence of the H1069Q heterozygous mutation. The patient was treated with zinc acetate monotherapy, responded well, and was maintained after 22 months. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the atypical clinical presentation of Wilson's disease, which should always be considered in patients with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. The good clinical response to zinc acetate monotherapy in our case may help to consider the use of zinc monotherapy as initial therapy in symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease under close clinical observation. Clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for the use of zinc monotherapy as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Marazzi, M.

254,Discovery of human zinc deficiency: 50 years later,"The necessity and deficiency of zinc for humans was understood in 1963. In the last 50 years, it has become clear that zinc deficiency is common in humans. Nutritional deficiency of zinc can affect approximately 2 billion people in the developing world. Consumption of cereal proteins with high phytate content reduces the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditional zinc deficiency is also very common. Growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, impaired immunity, neuro-sensory impairment and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. More than 300 enzymes require zinc for their activation and about 2000 transcription factors require zinc for gene expression. Zinc is essential for cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is also an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In therapeutic doses, zinc has been used for the prevention of blindness in infants and children with acute diarrhea, the common cold, Wilson's disease, sickle cell disease, and age-related macular degeneration.

256,Wilson's disease: analysis of 28 Brazilian children,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical-laboratory and evolutionary analysis of twenty-eight patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Twenty-eight children (twelve women and sixteen men) with Wilson's disease were retrospectively evaluated, with a follow-up of 72 months (1 to 240 months) between 1987 and 2009. At the end of the study, clinical, laboratory and histological features at the time of diagnosis were recorded. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (2 - 18 years). Twelve patients were asymptomatic, seven patients had hepatitis symptoms, five had elevated aminotransferase levels, three had hepatomegaly associated with neurological disorders, one had fulminant hepatitis with hemolytic anemia, and six patients had a Kayser-Fleischer ring. A histological analysis revealed that six children had chronic hepatitis, seven had cirrhosis, two had steatosis, one had portal fibrosis and one had massive necrosis. Treatment consisted of pyridoxine-associated D-penicillamine for 26 patients. Side effects were observed in the other two patients: one presented with uncontrollable vomiting and the other showed elastosis perforans serpiginosa. At the end of the study, all 26 treated patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-four of the patients were treated with D-penicillamine and pyridoxine, and two were treated with trientine and zinc sulfate. One patient with fulminant hepatitis underwent a liver transplant, but the last patient died 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Family screenings associated with early treatment are important in preventing Wilson's disease symptoms and potentially fatal disease progression. The study suggests that Wilson's disease should be ruled out in children older than two years of age presenting with abnormal hepatic enzyme levels because of the heterogeneity of symptoms and the encouraging treatment results so far.",,"Kleine, R.

257,Metals and liver,"Purpose of Review: Inherited liver diseases that cause copper and iron overload can cause significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated early. The purpose of this review is to highlight key publications over the past 18 months on the genetics, diagnosis, and management of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, few advances have been made in the genetic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. Uncommon HFE mutations resulting in phenotypic hemochromatosis among C282Y heterozygotes have been identified from HFE gene sequencing. A serum ferritin of less than 1000 µg/l was found to be associated with milder symptoms of hemochromatosis in C282Y homozygotes. Deferasirox has been shown to reduce iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis and may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy. Evidence of genotype and phenotype correlation was found in Wilson's disease, which can be diagnosed by genetic sequencing. A modified diagnostic guideline has been developed for children with Wilson's disease with mild liver disease, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis. In addition, treatment with copper chelating agents has fewer hepatic treatment failures compared to zinc monotherapy. SUMMARY: Advances in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, leading to a decrease in morbidity and mortality.",,"Maxwell, K. L.;Kowdley, K.

258,Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine and lupus erythematosus: related or different entities?,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been reported to be associated with Wilson's disease as a complication of penicillamine therapy. Although drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) has some common features with SLE, they are different entities. We present a case of a young girl who was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of five and started penicillamine therapy. Eight years after starting treatment, she developed proteinuria, which is thought to be related to penicillamine. Two years later, he developed arthritis, malar rash, and laboratory findings suggestive of lupus erythematosus. Initially, her symptoms were thought to be related to this treatment because of the known relationship between penicillamine and DILE. This hypothesis was referred to the Rheumatology Center; Zinc acetate was given instead of penicillamine and naproxen was started for arthritis treatment. Anyway, subsequent clinical course and laboratory findings led us to the diagnosis of idiopathic SLE. A kidney biopsy detected massive mesangiocapillary proliferation with subendothelial deposits (cable loops) and duplication of the glomerular basement membrane (active diffuse global proliferative lupus nephritis, class IV GA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the association between Wilson's disease and SLE.",,"Dell'era, L.;Boati, E.;Nebbia, G.;Corona, F.",2012,Feb,,0,0,
259,Chelation therapy in Wilson's disease: From D-penicillamine to the design of selective bio-inspired intracellular Cu(I) chelators,"Wilson's disease is an orphan disease due to disruption of copper homeostasis. Mutations of the ATP7B gene cause dysfunction of a Cu-ATPase, impaired Cu detoxification in the liver, and copper overload in the body. Indeed, although copper is an essential element used as a cofactor by many vital enzymes, in excess it becomes toxic as it promotes cytotoxic reactions that lead to oxidative stress. In this perspective, human copper homeostasis was first described to elucidate the mechanisms that promote copper overload in Wilson's disease. We will see that the liver is the main organ for copper distribution and detoxification in the body. Currently, this disease is treated for life with systemic chelation therapy, which in most cases is unsatisfactory. Therefore, the design of more selective and effective drugs is of great interest. A strategy to design more specific chelators to treat localized copper deposition in the liver will then be presented. Inspired specifically by biological copper cell carriers, we will show how bioinorganic chemistry can assist in the design of such new chelators.",,"Delangle, P.;Mintz, E.",2012,2007-06-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2dt12188c,0,0,
260,[Diagnosis and care of Wilson's disease with neurological revelation],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease that causes copper accumulation in many organs, especially the liver, progresses to liver cirrhosis and progresses with different neurological symptoms in the brain. Diagnosis is based on clinical, biochemical and genetic testing. Different treatments based on chelating agents can help reduce the spontaneous morbidity and mortality of the disease. We describe three patients who presented with Wilson's disease before the age of 18 years and had the first neurological symptoms between 1998 and 2010. After comparing with the literature reports, it allowed us to propose a treatment algorithm for clinical symptoms, progression, and care. Neurological symptoms such as dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, and psychiatric symptoms are present in 35% of patients with Wilson's disease. The time to diagnosis is very long and may explain the increase in the severity of the disease and the problems in the treatment of these patients. The first line of treatment should be triethylenetetramine, which causes fewer side effects of initial worsening of symptoms compared to D-penicillamine. In patients who are asymptomatic or on maintenance therapy, zinc therapy is the first line therapy. Finally, liver transplantation is a potential treatment even if the patient shows severe neurological impairment, as it may improve clinical symptoms. However, more research is needed on this subject. Copyright AÂ© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",,"Wagner, S.;Brunet, A.

261,Serum 'free' copper in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between serum 'free' copper and urinary copper has not been studied in patients with Wilson's disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a direct relationship between these two parameters. METHODS: Case notes of 320 patients with Wilson's disease between 1960 and 1987 were reviewed. Eighty of these patients had not received any treatment prior to referral and the results of serum 'free' copper and urine copper at admission and at one year of treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Except for patients with acute hemolysis, the ratio between 'free' serum copper and urinary copper was around 7:1 on average before treatment, but this ratio decreases to around 5:1 after treatment. However, the results show a wide distribution and there is no direct linear relationship. CONCLUSION: The term 'free' copper is misleading and should be replaced by the more cumbersome but accurate term 'ceruloplasmin unbound copper'. Most 'free' copper complexes with albumin and can only be used for excretion when there is significant protein loss by the kidneys.",,"Walshe, J.

262,Metal element excretion in 24-hour urine in patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine,"Wilson's disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disease that causes copper accumulation and consequent toxicity. D-Penicillamine, a powerful metal chelator, is an important treatment for Wilson's disease. To investigate the change of metal elements under D-penicillamine treatment, we determined the levels of Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Se, Mn, Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Tl and Al by ICP-MS. D: -In the 24-hour urine of 115 Wilson's disease patients treated for 1 month to 22 years at maintenance doses with penicillamine and 115 healthy controls of the same age. Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd and Mn levels in the 24-hour urine of the cases were significantly higher than the controls (P<0.05), and the observed increases were Mg, Ca and Zn levels, respectively, 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 ( Ca) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) of 0.313 (Zn) were directly related to duration of treatment (P<0.05). On the other hand, 24-hour urine Al and As levels were lower than those of controls (P<0.05) and negatively correlated with duration of treatment with R -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As). ), respectively (P<0.05).

263,"Hereditary copper transport disorders: biochemical mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment","Copper is an essential trace element necessary for all living organisms. However, excessive amounts of copper cause cellular damage. Disruptions in normal copper homeostasis are the hallmark of three genetic disorders: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and Wilson's disease. Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of Menkes disease are due to copper-induced low enzyme activity. Standard treatment includes parenteral administration of copper-histidine. While neurodegeneration can be prevented if treatment is started before 2 months of age, delayed treatment is completely ineffective. Therefore, neonatal mass screening should be performed. Meanwhile, connective tissue disorders cannot be cured by copper-histidine therapy. Combination therapy with copper-histidine injections and oral administration of disulfiram is under investigation. Occipital horn syndrome, characterized by connective tissue abnormalities, is the mildest form of Menkes disease. No treatment has been given for this syndrome. Wilson's disease is typically characterized by copper toxicity, which severely affects the hepatic and nervous systems. Various other symptoms are also observed, but early diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Chelation agents and zinc are effective treatments, but ineffective in most patients with fulminant liver failure. In addition, some patients with neurological Wilson's disease worsen or respond poorly to chelating agents. A screening system for Wilson's disease in infants should be implemented, as early treatment is critical. Patients with Wilson's disease may be at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the link between Wilson's disease and hepatocellular carcinoma will be helpful for disease treatment and prevention.",,"Kodama, H.;Fujisawa, C.;Bhadhprasit, W.",2012,Mar,,0,0,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genetic, biochemical, and pathological features, along with response to therapy and clinical evolution, were analyzed for this patient group. RESULTS: Genetically, the group was fairly homogeneous and had an extremely high prevalence of the L708P mutation (4 homozygous and 5 heterozygous). Although initially screened for asymptomatic hypertransaminemia, all patients presented with some degree of liver injury that was never accompanied by any neurological findings. Hepatic damage was most severe in a compound heterozygote with a novel mutation, G1266W, affecting a motif in the ATP7B polypeptide that is largely conserved in similar proteins among metazoans. Serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper were found to have great diagnostic value in conjunction with the determination of hepatic copper content, while urinary copper measurements were found to be much less precise. All patients responded well to D-penicillamine therapy without any documented side effects.

266,Neurological Wilson's disease in children: Three years' experience from Multan,"OBJECTIVE: To describe neurological manifestations, results of investigations and response to treatment in Wilson's disease in children with Multan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Multan Children's Hospital Department of Neurology and Child Health Institute between June 2005 and May 2008. 50 children were included in this study. Age of onset of symptoms, gender, duration of symptoms, complaints at presentation, consanguinity between parents, family history, and response to treatment were noted. Chi-square test was used to measure the relationship between variables and response to treatment. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 50 cases examined, 48 were index cases and two were diagnosed during screening. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 9.06 +/- 2.65. Dystonia, dysarthria and cognitive decline were observed in 92% of the children, drooling in 68%, tremor in 52%, chorea in 24% and seizures in 12%. After penicillamine loading, Kayser Fleischer rings and 24-hour urinary copper elevation were present in all 50 children, 1567 +/- 167.35 microg/day. Twenty-two (44%) children had an early response after one year of treatment, 24 (48%) had a late response, and 4 (8%) had no response. Statistically significant factors for early response to treatment were found to be late, older than 10 years of age at onset of symptoms, duration of symptoms less than 6 months, and urinary copper excretion of less than 1000 microg/day. CONCLUSION: Dystonia, dysarthria and cognitive decline were the most common presentations in the study population. Twenty-four hour urine copper aided the diagnosis.

267,Acute Gallbladder Hydrops and Arthritis: Unusual first signs of Wilson's Disease (WD): Case Report,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, cornea, and kidneys. The clinical picture is variable, with fully expressed disease manifested by cirrhosis, neurological damage, and Kayser-Fleischer (CF) ring in the cornea. A 24-year-old patient developed right upper quadrant pain with a palpable mass and swelling in the right talocrural joint. X-rays were uneventful, but routine examination of liver enzymes discovered a 6-8-fold increase in SGPT, SGOT, and AST. Hepatitis B, C antibodies as well as ANA, ANCA, antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies were normal. Abdominal ultrasound revealed extremely enlarged hepatic, cystic ducts, as well as the gallbladder. A large, edematous gallbladder with yellow-green bile was removed, the liver was found to be cirrhotic, but biopsy was not performed because of profuse surgical bleeding. Serum ceruloplasmin low [0.160 g/l (normal 0.204-0.407)], serum copper 12.7 micro mol/l (11.0-24.4), transaminase: always very high, normal/slightly elevated in recent months. Urine copper: 1.0 micromol/24 h (>9.44). As first seen, the proband had corneal tremor, dysarthria, dystonia, and a CF ring. After 10 months of treatment with penicillamine, her transaminases returned to normal, and tremor, dysarthria, dystonia initially worsened and later resolved.

269,A clinical trial of Wilson's disease: the experience of a single Egyptian Pediatric Hepatology Unit.,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVES: Most pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) present with hepatic manifestations, but some may have neurological or psychiatric features. Our aim was to describe the clinical, biochemical features and treatment outcomes of a group of Egyptian children diagnosed with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in the Pediatric Hepatology Unit of the Children's Hospital of Cairo University, Egypt; From 1996 to 2009, 54 patients were diagnosed with WD. Diagnosis was based on low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine loading, and/or the presence of Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. RESULTS: The clinical presentation was as follows: hepatic presentation in 33 patients (61%), hepato-neurologic in 3 (5.5%), neurological 5 (9.3%) and presymptomatic 13 patients (24%). Twelve couples had more than one affected sibling. Elevated urinary copper concentrations were found in all patients before or after D-penicillamine loading, low serum ceruloplasmin in 97%, and CF rings in 31.5%. All patients were treated with penicillamine and zinc sulfate, except for one presymptomatic case who was treated with zinc sulfate alone. After a mean treatment period of 6 months (1-36), three patients underwent liver transplantation and eight patients died. With treatment, hepatic symptoms improved, but neurological symptoms remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and biochemical testing remains the standard for the diagnosis of WD. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat WD with hepatic symptoms. Liver transplantation remains a life saver for those with fulminant and end-stage WD.

She gave birth to a healthy baby with normal copper levels. CONCLUSION: Changes in copper metabolism are rare, and their consequences can be devastating during pregnancy. Although isolated copper elevations during pregnancy are extremely rare, they are treated in the same way as Wilson's disease. The aim is to prevent fetal growth restriction and neurological sequelae in the newborn and preeclampsia in the mother. Counseling, along with treatment options and term delivery, can greatly improve newborn and maternal outcomes.",,"Walker, L.

272,Excess copper chelation therapy for Wilson's disease causes anemia and liver dysfunction,"37-year-old man was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 14. His first symptoms were neurological. He was treated with trientine for over 10 years and suffered from anemia and liver dysfunction. Wilson's disease is a genetic disease characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body. Excess copper is toxic, but copper is an essential trace element. The copper-binding ceruloplasmin is important for iron metabolism. Anemia due to excessive copper chelation therapy and iron accumulation in the liver were suspected. Appropriate monitoring of copper status is important for the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Harada, M.;Miyagawa, K.;Honma, Y.;Hiura, M.;Shibata, M.;Matsuhashi, T.;Abe, S.;Harada, R.;Tabaru, A.",2011,,,0,0,

274,Phenotypic and genetic characterization of a patient group with pediatric Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease appears to be underdiagnosed in Egypt and clinical data in large cohorts are limited. The aim of this study is to highlight the clinical, laboratory and genetic features of this disease in our pediatric population and to report our experience with both treatment options and outcomes. METHODS: The study included 77 patients from 50 unrelated families (62 followed for a mean of 58.9 +/- 6.4 months and 27 were asymptomatic siblings). Data were collected retrospectively through record analysis and patient interviews. The diagnosis was confirmed by sequencing of the ATP7B gene in 64 patients. RESULTS: Our patients had unique characteristics compared to other populations. Younger age of onset (median: 10 years), higher prevalence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (97.6% in symptomatic patients), lower ceruloplasmin (93.5%), higher parental consanguinity (78.9%), as well as more severe cruising. Of those using long-term D-penicillamine, 71.42% improved or remained stable during follow-up with serious adverse events occurring in only 11.5%. Preventive treatment with zinc monotherapy was an effective non-toxic alternative to D-penicillamine. Homozygous mutations were found in 85.7%, but were limited to the large number of mutations detected, making genotype-phenotype correlations difficult to find. While missense mutations were the most common, protein-cutting mutations resulted in a more severe course with a higher incidence of acute liver failure and neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Egyptian children with Wilson's disease present with early Kayser-Fleischer rings and early-onset liver and neurologic disease. The mutational spectrum described is different from that observed in other countries. A high homozygous mutation rate (reflecting high inbreeding) could potentially provide more information about the genotype-phenotype correlation.",,"Abdel Ghaffar, T. Y.;Elsayed, S.

275,Prognostic significance of neurological examination findings in Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease patients present with any of a variety of neurological phenotypes, and treatment outcomes vary widely. Our aim was to determine whether presenting the clinical features of neurological Wilson's disease (WD) predicts longer-term neurological outcomes in patients receiving anticancer therapy. METHODS: Patients participating in the four WD therapy studies underwent a standardized neurological examination during trial enrollment and thereafter at predetermined intervals following anticopper therapy, first with tetrathiomolybdate or trientine followed by zinc. The examination scored the patients' motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, dystonia, dyartria, and gait. These sub-scores are added together to obtain the Total Score. Eighty-six patients were included in our analysis with a mean follow-up of 34.7 months. Retrospectively, the analysis compared Scaled and unscaled sign subscores with change in Total Score at enrollment and follow-up, using a generalized estimation equations approach. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, improvement in Total Score was best in tremor (beta -0.7, p = 0.006), gait abnormalities (beta -3.7, p < 0.001) and speech (beta = -1.3, p = 0.05). Dystonia (beta = 1.8, p < 0.001) and facial expression (beta = 1.9, p = 0.03) were associated with worsening of the Total Score. Of the individually monitored motor symptoms, dystonia proved to be the most resistant to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective large-scale study to evaluate the prognostic significance of specific neurological signs in WD. Our data support the historical observations that tremor is a favorable prognostic marker, while dystonia is relatively resistant to treatment in WD. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

276,Pattern of urinary copper excretion and response to therapy in patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: It is generally accepted that patients with Wilson's disease excrete excess copper in the urine. However, no studies have been conducted on a large series of patients to determine whether there are differences in the rate of clearance at different stages of the disease or what changes can be expected after treatment. DESIGN: This study comes from an analysis of the results of urinary copper excretion of 192 patients with Wilson's disease between 1955 and 2000. These patients were divided into three groups as pre-symptomatic, hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. Patients were studied for 6 hours after baseline pretreatment, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and a test dose of 500 mg penicillamine. The tests were repeated after approximately 1 and 2 years of chelation therapy with penicillamine or, in a small minority of cases, trientine. RESULTS: Baseline, pretreatment copper excretion was lowest in non-symptomatic patients (207.93 microg/24 hours) and highest in liver patients (465.75 microg/24 hours). Those with neurological Wilson's disease gave a moderate figure (305.58 microg/24 hours). Penicillamine response was highest in neurological patients and lowest in the non-symptomatic group. After 1 and 2 years of treatment, all groups showed significant reductions in both basal and post-penicillamine copper excretion rate. The small subgroup treated with trientine instead of penicillamine showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of copper excretion varies greatly from patient to patient in patients with Wilson's disease, but generally secrete less copper than patients with symptomatic disease. All groups show a large increase when challenged with penicillamine. There is a marked reduction in copper excretion after both basal and penicillamine loading after 1 and 2 years of treatment. This likely indicates a reduction in the body burden of copper.",,"Walshe, J. M.",2011,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcr073,0,0,

278,Changes in lipid metabolism in Wilson's disease,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain, leading to serious liver and neurological diseases. Interesting findings in animal models of WD (Atp7b-/- and LEC rats) showed altered lipid metabolism with a reduction in serum triglyceride and cholesterol. However, to date, the serum lipid profile has not been investigated in large cohorts of human WD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 251 patients examined at University Hospitals in Heidelberg and Dresden (Germany) were included in this cohort study. Patients were analyzed at routine follow-up exams for serum lipid profile, including triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Data on these parameters at diagnosis were obtained by chart review where possible. For statistical testing, patients were subgrouped by sex, manifestation (liver, neurologic, mixed, and asymptomatic), and treatment (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or combination). RESULTS: A significant difference in total serum cholesterol was found in patients with hepatic symptoms that decreased under treatment. No changes were observed for HDL, LDL and triglycerides. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous reports using WD animal models (Atp7b-/- and LEC rats), the most prominent change in our cohort was a lower serum cholesterol level in liver-affected patients, which may be associated with liver injury. Our data suggested intact cholesterol metabolism in treated Wilson's disease, regardless of medical therapy administered.",,"Seessle, J.;Gohdes, A.;Gotthardt, D.

279,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data on the clinical follow-up and treatment efficacy of Wilson's disease are limited due to the low disease frequency. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of Wilson's disease patients from southern Brazil over a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six Wilson's disease patients diagnosed from 1971 to 2010 were retrospectively evaluated in terms of their clinical presentations, epidemiological and social characteristics, response to treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: When the continental origins of the patients were examined, it was seen that 74.5% of them were of European origin. The mean age at first symptom presentation was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months to definitive diagnosis. At admission, hepatic symptoms were dominant (38.9%), followed by mixed symptoms (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected with a higher frequency in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%) and in 55.6% of patients. Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was detected in 68% of patients with liver symptoms. 94.2% of all patients were treated with D-penicillamine for a mean duration of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combined therapy, and liver transplant. After initiating treatment, 78.8% of patients achieved a stable or improved outcome, with an overall survival rate of 90.1%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a patient population living in Southern Brazil with Wilson's disease mainly of European continental origin. Wilson's disease, when diagnosed correctly, can be treated and an adequate quality of life can be achieved, resulting in a long overall survival.",,"Bem, R. S.;Muzzillo, D. A.;Deguti, M.

280,D-penicillamine elastosis perforans serpiginosa: description of two cases and review of the literature,"Long-term D-penicillamine (DPA) therapy to treat Wilson's disease can induce elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS), a very rare degenerative skin disease characterized by transepidermal elimination of elastic fiber clusters. Iatrogenic disease is dependent on DPA's capacity to chelate copper and cause its depletion. Lysyl-oxidase is a copper-dependent enzyme crucial for dermal elastic fiber crosslinking, which is strongly affected by DPA copper depletion. Direct binding of the drug to collagen precursors also affects elastic fiber aggregation and maturation. Abnormal elastin accumulates in the middle dermis and produces a characteristic blackberry brush or ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance. In this way, it behaves like a foreign body and is gradually expelled from the epidermis. Clinically, the disease presents with numerous firm keratotic papules and nodules arranged in annular plaques on the neck, axilla, antecubital fossa, and forearms. The rarity of the disease often leads to misdiagnosis and the process continues unabated, raising concerns about systemic elastopathy.",,"Atzori, L.;Pinna, A.

284,The risks and benefits of copper in light of new understandings of copper homeostasis,"Copper is an essential micronutrient involved in various biological processes that are indispensable for sustaining life. It can also be toxic when present in excess, the most obvious chronic effect being liver damage. Powerful, effective regulatory mechanisms control gastrointestinal copper absorption and copper biliary excretion; Absorption varies between 12% and 60% in humans, depending on Cu intake, the presence of other factors that may increase or inhibit its absorption in the diet, and the individual's copper status. Current evidence suggests that copper deficiency may be more common than previously thought, while copper toxicity is not common in traditional daily living conditions. Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease are genetic conditions associated with severe copper deficiency and severe copper toxicity, respectively. The effects of milder degrees of copper deficiency and excessive copper exposure are not well defined, mainly due to the lack of sensitive and specific indicators; Serum copper concentration and ceruloplasmin are the most commonly used indicators, but they only detect highly intense changes in copper status. Of the many proteins considered as potential markers of copper status, the chaperone of Zn-Cu superoxide dismutase (CCS1) showed promising results; Data on its performance under different conditions are needed to confirm its use as an indicator of early copper deficiency. Defining copper requirements and upper safe limits for consumption (UL) is a complex process, as there are adverse health consequences from both copper deficiency and copper excess (U-shape curve). The regulatory framework for risk assessment of essential trace elements introduced by the International Program for Chemical Safety (IPCS) has proposed a homeostatic model to determine the Adequate Oral Intake Range (AROI) of essential trace elements; The lowest point of the resulting U-shape curve serves to define the AROI. Physiological mechanisms allow for normal homeostasis in this uptake range and there are basically no detectable adverse effects. Currently, Recommended Dietary Intakes (DRIs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs) are used to recommend copper intake for different ages and life situations. Evidence from humans and non-human primates presented here indicates that the existing copper UL needs to be reassessed. Developing the scientific basis for a copper UL and assessing the relevance of copper deficiency globally are major future challenges for copper researchers. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome who also developed histopathological features consistent with cholestasis and biliary atresia, suggesting that mutations involving zfhz1b may lead to abnormalities of biliary development or damage to the biliary tract. We used the zebrafish model system to determine whether Zfhx1b has a role in vertebrate gall development. RESULTS: Using zebrafish, we determined that zfhx1b is expressed during biliary growth and remodeling in the developing liver and that morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-mediated zfhx1b degradation leads to defects in biliary development. These findings were associated with reduced expression of vhnf1, a transcription factor known to be important in biliary development in zebrafish and mammals.

It can also be seen in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and 4) EPS induced by long-term treatment with D-penicillamine is observed in patients suffering from Wilson's disease. Long-term D-penicillamine therapy causes a change in dermal elastic tissue. EPS from D-penicillamine has a distinctive histopathological feature - the jagged appearance of the elastic fibers due to vertical budding from their surface gives a ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance.

287,Hepatocyte targeting and intracellular copper chelation with a thiol-containing glycocyclopeptide,"Metal overload plays an important role in various diseases or poisonings, such as in Wilson's disease, a major genetic disorder of copper metabolism in humans. In order to efficiently and selectively reduce the concentration of highly damaged copper in the liver, chelators must target hepatocytes. In this study, we synthesized a molecule that combines a chelating unit and a carbohydrate recognition element in the same structure, which can both lower intracellular copper, namely Cu(I) and target hepatocytes. A cyclodecapeptide scaffold exhibiting a controlled conformation with two independent faces was chosen to incorporate both units. One face shows a cluster of carbohydrates to enable efficient recognition of asialoglycoprotein receptors expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. The second face is dedicated to the metal ion complex by the thiolate functions of the two cysteine side chains. To obtain a chelator that is active only once inside the cells, the two thiol functions were oxidized in a disulfide bridge to yield glycopeptide P(3). Two simple cyclodecapeptides, modeling the reduced and complexing form of P(3) in cells, demonstrated a high affinity for Cu(I) and a high selectivity for Zn(II). As expected, P(3) becomes an effective Cu(I) chelator in the presence of glutathione, which mimics the intracellular reducing environment. Finally, cellular uptake and the ability to lower intracellular copper were demonstrated in hepatic cell lines, particularly WIF-B9, making P(3) a good candidate to combat copper overload in the liver.",,"Pujol, A.

The effects of different ratios on the properties of the powders and tablets obtained by changing the metolose and bicarbonate ratios were determined. The water uptake of the different powder mixtures was initially evaluated. These tests showed the interaction of the active and effervescent agent, this phenomenon led to an unpredictable increase in the amount of fluid intake. This interaction was evaluated in relation to the degradation of the hydrophilic matrix system. Disintegration of tablets of different compositions revealed that this interaction increases the time required for these systems to disintegrate. The study showed that the interaction of the components caused significant changes in the parameters of this new precision delivery system. In the final steps, the flotation and dissolution properties of tablets that seemed suitable for the formulation of a controlled drug delivery system were investigated.

When treated, the outcome can be excellent, although long-term survival is not yet well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcomes of a cohort of patients with WD and to evaluate the factors influencing the phenotypic manifestation of WD. METHODS: The presence of mutations in the ATP7B gene, clinical manifestations, treatments, and long-term outcomes were analyzed retrospectively in 117 patients (59 men and 58 women, age at assessment 38.5 +/- 11, range 16-63) with WD. year). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with neurological presentation, 51 patients with hepatic presentation, and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed for a mean of 15.1 +/- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most common genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with hepatic or neurologic presentation (P = 0.099). D-penicillamine or zinc salts (81% and 17%, respectively) were used for treatment, and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic patients became asymptomatic or improved during follow-up (82% patients with liver presentation, 69% patients with neurologic presentation). Long-term survival of patients with WD was not different from the general Czech population (P = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up demonstrates a satisfactory response in the vast majority of adequately treated patients with WD, and survival overlaps with that of the general population.

291,Exceptional stability of copper(I)-tetrathiomolybdate complexes: possible implications for aquatic ecosystems,"The outstanding affinity of MoS42 for Cu explains the Mo-induced Cu deficiency in ruminant animals (molybdenose) and provides an approach to the treatment of Wilson's disease in humans. Evidence of thiomolybdates, even as metastable traces in sulphurous native waters and possibly oxic natural waters, raises the question of how Cu-Mo affinity may affect Cu availability or toxicity in aquatic ecosystems. The stability of inorganic Cu-MoS42- complexes was characterized and quantified here for the first time. Two highly stable Cu(I) dissolved complexes have been identified (T=23degC +/- 2degree): Cu2(HS)2MoS42- and Cu2S2MoS44-. In addition, the solubility constant for a precipitate (NH4CuMoS4) was measured. Under extremely reducing conditions in rumen fluids, these complexes would greatly suppress Cu(+) activity and support previous conclusions about the molybdenose mechanism. In sulphurous natural waters, they help prevent complete Cu depletion, which would otherwise occur by sulfide mineral precipitation. On the other hand, the complexes discovered here are HS dependent and cannot be significant in oxic natural waters (HS- concentrations < 10–9 M) even if metastable, biogenic MoS42- is indeed present as previously predicted.

293,"Effects of long-term zinc therapy in Japanese patients with Wilson's disease: efficacy, stability, and copper metabolism.","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease with copper metabolism. The standard treatment in Japan is the application of copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine. In this study, the authors used zinc acetate to treat Japanese patients with Wilson's disease and investigated its effectiveness. Wilson's disease was detected using clinical and biochemical tests in 37 patients who made up this study, and zinc acetate was given for 48 weeks. The authors tracked clinical symptoms and laboratory findings by evaluating patients' complete blood counts, biochemical findings, as well as urinalysis results and specific laboratory tests for copper and zinc metabolism. We also examined the side effects of treatment. Zinc acetate did not aggravate hepatic or neurological symptoms in any of the patients. Blood biochemical analysis also did not show elevations in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels. Zinc treatment did not worsen the clinical and/or laboratory findings of the patients. However, it did improve some clinical symptoms of patients with Wilson's disease. Although this agent had some side effects, none of them were severe. The authors measured spot urinary copper excretion, which gives an indication of treatment efficacy and adequate zinc dosage. We recommend keeping the spot urinary copper excretion below 0.075-mug/mg creatinine.

Early diagnosis is desirable to prevent dramatic progression of the disease. The aim of our study is to reevaluate the conventional diagnostic criteria and the WD scoring system recommended by an international consensus in 2001 in children with WD with mild liver disease. Forty children with WD (26 boys and 14 girls, age range = 1.1-) 20.9 years) and 58 age- and sex-matched patients with liver disease other than WD were evaluated. Both groups were asymptomatic and had elevated aminotransferases as the predominant manifestations of liver disease. In all WD patients, the diagnosis was supported by molecular analysis, liver copper content, or both. Recipient working characteristic (ROC) analysis of ceruloplasmin at a cutoff of 20 mg/dL showed 95% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI) = 83%–99.4%] and 84.5% specificity (95% CI). = 72.6% - 92.6%). The optimal basal urinary copper diagnostic threshold was found to be 40 cups/24 hours (sensitivity = 78.9%, 95% CI = 62.7%-90.4%; specificity = 87.9%, 95% CI = 76.7-95%). Urine copper values after penicillamine challenge did not differ significantly between WD patients and control subjects, and ROC analysis showed only a 12% sensitivity. The WD scoring system has been proven to have positive and negative predictive values of 93% and 91.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Urinary copper excretion of more than 40 cups/24 hours suggests WD in asymptomatic children, whereas penicillamine challenge test has no diagnostic role in this patient group. The WD scoring system provides good diagnostic accuracy.

296,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive copper balance disorder that causes liver damage and varying degrees of neurological impairment. The defective gene, ATP7B, encodes a hepatic copper-transporting protein that plays an important role in human copper metabolism. Our knowledge of the genetic basis of Wilson's disease has increased dramatically; however, understanding the multifaceted effects of genotype-phenotype correlation and copper toxicity as the basis for targeted and individualized treatment strategies is still poor. Clinical manifestations are predominantly related to copper deposition in the liver and brain and include liver diseases ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders. Mixed presentations often occur. In cases of acute and chronic liver failure, early diagnosis by clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and initiation of treatment with copper chelators, zinc salts and even liver transplantation are essential for a favorable outcome.

We present a patient presenting with partial status epilepticus, receiving strict low-copper diet and chelation therapy for WD. Despite other rare causes of seizures such as penicillin-induced pyridoxine deficiency, cerebral copper deposition and metabolic encephalopathy in WD, the most likely cause of refractory status epilepticus in this patient was found to be hypocupresemia due to overtreatment. This case exemplifies that hypocupremic states should be kept in mind as a risk factor for resistant seizures. Copyright Â© 2010 British Epilepsy Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

299,Synthesis and biological characterization of analogues of novel burden-deficient sperm,"The biogenic polyamines spermidine and spermine are positively charged at physiological pH. They are found in all cells and are essential for their growth and viability. Here we synthesized three new derivatives of 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (SpmTrien, 5a) N(1)-Ac-SpmTrien (5c), N(12), the isosteric charge deficient sperm analogue. -Ac-SpmTriene (5b) and N(1),N(12)-diethyl-1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (N(1),N(12)-Et(2)- SpmTriene , 5 d). 5a and 5d readily accumulated in DU145 cells in the same concentration range as native polyamines and competed moderately for uptake with putrescine (1) but not spermine (4a) or spermidine (2). 5a efficiently downregulated ornithine decarboxylase and reduced polyamine levels, while 5d proved inefficient compared to N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine (6). None of the analogues tested were substrates for human recombinant spermine oxidase, but those with free amino terminals, including 1,8-diamino-3,6-diazaoctane (Triene, 3a), were acetylated with mouse recombinant spermidine/spermine N(1)-. acetyltransferase. 5a was acetylated to 5c and 5b, and the latter was metabolized by acetylpolyamine oxidase to 3a, a drug used to treat Wilson's disease. Therefore, 5a is a bioactive precursor of 3a with improved bioavailability.",,"Weisell, J.;Hyvonen, M. T.;Hakkinen, M. R.;Grigorenko, N. A.;Pietila, M.;Lampinen, A.;Kochetkov, S.

300,Triethylenetetramine pharmacology and clinical applications,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a Cu(II)-selective chelator, is widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Recently, it has been shown that TETA can be used in cancer treatment due to its telomerase inhibitory and anti-angiogenesis properties. Although TETA has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease for decades, a comprehensive review of TETA pharmacology is not available. TETA is poorly absorbed with a bioavailability of 8% to 30%. It is widely distributed in tissues with relatively high concentrations measured in the liver, heart and kidney. It is metabolized mainly by acetylation and two major acetylated metabolites are found in human serum and urine. It is excreted in the urine mainly as unchanged parent drug and two acetylated metabolites. It has a relatively short half-life (2 to 4 hours) in humans. Recent discoveries in TETA pharmacology show that the main pharmacokinetic parameters are not related to the acetylation phenotype of the traditionally accepted drug acetylation enzyme, N-acetyltransferase 2, and that the TETA-metabolizing enzyme is actually spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase. This review also covers the current preclinical and clinical application of TETA. It provides a much-needed overview and updated information on TETA pharmacology for clinicians or cancer researchers planning to begin cancer clinical trials using TETA or its close structural analogues.",,"Lu, J.",2010,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0523,0,0,
301,Persistence of treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease is a genetically induced copper metabolism deficiency. If left untreated, it can lead to death within a few years of the onset of symptoms. Therefore, drug use should continue throughout the patient's life after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson's disease often discontinue treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate how adherence to medication (defined as persistence in medication use) translates into the overall well-being of patients with Wilson's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease and followed up in our outpatient clinics were asked to fill out a self-administered questionnaire. The questions were about demographic data, characteristics of the disease, treatment modalities and persistence in treatment, subjective assessment of health status, and treatment effectiveness. The EQ-5D questionnaire with a visual analog well-being scale was also used. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires could be further processed. Our analysis did not reveal differences in persistence with the use of d-penicillamine and zinc sulfate or the efficacy of prescription drugs. However, we found that regardless of the drug used, persistence in treatment resulted in significantly better self-assessment outcomes (total improvement 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the non-persistent group, p = 0.003; partial improvement 53.8%). 30.8% vs. p = 0.045 and deterioration: absent in the permanent group and 42.3% in the non-permanent group, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Lack of insistence on prescription drug use is quite common in patients with Wilson's disease. Lack of compliance reduces the chances of recovery and may be the cause of clinical deterioration.",,"Maselbas, W.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2010,May-Jun,,0,0,

Most of the cases reported so far were sporadic events; however, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been referred to. The facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark that warrants ZEB2 mutation analysis even in the absence of Hirschsprung's disease.

306,Effect of glutathione depletion on copper removal by tetrathiomolybdate from LEC rat livers.,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent and selective copper (Cu) chelator used as a therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease. TTM is the only agent that can remove metallothioneine (MT)-bound Cu in the livers of Long-Evans rats (LEC rats) with a cinnamon-like coat color. However, excessive TTM administration causes Cu and molybdenum (Mo) accumulation in the liver. In this study, the effect of hepatic glutathione (GSH) depletion on Cu removal from the livers of LEC rats was evaluated to establish an effective treatment with TTM. Pretreatment with l-butionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH depletion in vivo, reduced the amounts of Cu and Mo excreted both into the bile and the bloodstream, and increased the amounts of Cu and Mo accumulated in the livers of LEC rats. An insoluble complex form 4 hours after TTM injection. The results show that GSH depletion creates an oxidative environment in the livers of LEC rats and the oxidative environment facilitates the insolubility of Cu and Mo in the livers of LEC rats after TTM injection. Therefore, the effect of TTM in the oxidized state on the removal of Cu from the liver was reduced. Wilson's disease patients and LEC rats develop liver damage caused by oxidative damage. From a clinical point of view, an increase in GSH concentration would be expected to increase the effect of TTM. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

308,Clinical features and therapeutic response in Taiwanese children with Wilson's disease: 12 years of experience in a single centre.,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive defect of cellular copper export. Early diagnosis in children is difficult because of their unclear clinical presentation. The efficacy of zinc salts is well documented, although there is limited data on the use of zinc in pediatric patients with WD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical features, laboratory results, and treatment responses in children with WD diagnosed at Taichung Veterans General Hospital between 1996 and 2008. The diagnosis was made by low serum ceruloplasmin, high 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and the presence of Kayser. -Fleischer rings and mutation analysis. RESULTS: 11 children were included in this study. The main initial presentations were impaired liver function tests (6/11) and hemolytic anemia (2/11). Gene studies in seven children showed six different mutations (G934D, R778Q, C490X, 304insC, IVS4-1 G > C, P992I) and one possible new mutation (L1181P). After treatment with D-penicillamine, trientine and zinc supplementation, liver function tests and hemoglobin levels improved in all patients. Over a mean period of 3.4 +/- 2.1 years with zinc therapy, six patients had serum zinc levels above the normal range and seven patients had serum copper levels below the normal range. CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper studies can be used to rule out WD in children with chronic hepatitis and hemolytic anemia. Gene analysis aids in rapid diagnosis of asymptomatic siblings and patients with atypical features. Zinc therapy is generally safe in pediatric patients with WD. However, its adverse effects should be monitored. Copyright 2010 Taiwan Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Wang, L. C.;Wang, J. D.;Tsai, C. R.;Cheng, S.

309,Oral complications associated with D-penicillamine therapy for Wilson's disease: a clinicopathological report.,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disease that inhibits the release of copper from the liver. Multi-organ manifestations include the liver, nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart, and skin. Elastic fiber damage is a complication of the drug most commonly used in the treatment of WD D-penicillamine (D-PCA). These changes have been described very rarely in the oral cavity. The article describes the oral complications associated with WD and its treatment with D-PCA. METHODS: Clinical, radiographic, and microscopic evaluation was performed in two WD female patients (aged 28 and 53 years) treated with D-PCA, with clinical and pathological evidence for oral drug-related complications. RESULTS: Lesions included multiple small red papules on the lips, gingival enlargement, early-onset periodontitis, and recurrent oral candidiasis. Oral mucosal biopsies (gingival, cheek) exhibited granulomatous inflammation in one case and thick irregular clusters of abnormal elastic fibers with crimped, red staining in both cases. Red lip papules are similar to elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS). Similar lesions have been described on the skin, but not previously associated with oral or perioral tissue. In addition to the oral lesions, one of the patients developed a general intolerance to the drug and was switched to trientine hydrochloride. CONCLUSIONS: WD patients and others treated with D-PCA may develop oral and perioral complications that in some cases exhibit properties of damaged elastic fibers in the mucosa and periodontal apparatus. It is possible that this damage is one of the factors responsible for poor periodontal health in WD patients. Recognition of lesions may lead to modification of the influencing therapeutic agent.",,"Tovaru, S.;Parlatescu, I.;Dumitriu, A.

310,Preparation of polyamine functional copper-specific adsorbents for selective adsorption of copper,"In Wilson's disease, the serum free copper level is greatly elevated. Liver transplantation is the only life-saving treatment for patients with acute Wilson's disease. Plasma exchange or albumin dialysis is often used as a bridge to liver transplantation to maintain a stable clinical condition for patients. Hemoperfusion is another effective treatment for removing toxins from plasma. However, due to the lack of copper-specific adsorbent, hemoperfusion has not been reported to remove copper. In this study, copper chelating agents, triethylenetetramine and tetraethylenepentamine, were covalently immobilized on macroporous poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) microspheres to prepare copper-specific adsorbents. The resulting adsorbents showed good adsorption capacities for Cu2+ ion of 63.44 and 58.48 mg/g, respectively. In addition, copper adsorbents prepared by the interference of other metal ions such as Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+ still showed good specificity towards Cu2+ ion. These results suggest that adsorbents are promising adsorbents in hemoperfusion therapy for selective removal of copper in patients with severe Wilson's disease.

311,Wilson's disease: histopathological correlations with treatment in follow-up liver biopsies,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the progression of hepatic histopathology in serial liver biopsies from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). METHODS: We present a cohort of 12 WD patients treated with zinc and/or penicillamine and undergoing multiple follow-up liver biopsy. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and all patients underwent an initial biopsy and at least one repeat biopsy. RESULTS: The recurrence time of biopsy ranged from 2 to 12 years. Six patients (not progressing) showed stable hepatic histology or recovery. In one case, we observed improvement in stage 2 to 0 fibrosis. Worsening of (progressive) fibrosis was seen in six patients. There was no significant relationship between histological findings and serum aminotransferases or copper metabolism parameters. Hepatic copper concentration reached normal levels in only two patients: one from the nonprogressive and one from the progressive group. The estimated rate of progression of hepatic fibrosis in the whole group was 0 units per year in the time frame between the first and second liver biopsy (4 years) and 0.25 in the time frame between the second and third (3 years). In the advancing group, the rate of progression of liver fibrosis was estimated as 0.11 fibrosis units per year between the first and second biopsy and 0.6 fibrosis units between the second and third biopsy. CONCLUSION: The inability of clinical tools to detect fibrosis progression in WD suggests that liver biopsy should be considered with hepatic copper measurement every 3 years.",,"Cope-Yokoyama, S.;Finegold, M.

312,Liver myelopathy of the liver,"Acquired copper deficiency has been recognized as a rare cause of anemia and neutropenia for more than half a century. Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) has only been described in the last decade and represents a treatable cause of noncompressive myelopathy that closely mimics subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Here, 55 case reports from the literature were reviewed in terms of demographic characteristics, etiology, hematological and biochemical parameters, spinal imaging, treatment and outcomes. The pathophysiology of copper metabolism disorders is discussed. CDM occurred most frequently in the fifth and sixth decades and was more common in women (F:M = 3.6:1). Risk factors included previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, zinc overload, and malabsorption syndromes, all of which impair copper absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Etiology was not found in 20% of the cases. Elevated zinc levels were detected in some cases that were not considered primary zinc overload, in which case the contribution of zinc to the copper deficiency state remained unclear. Cytopenia, particularly anemia, was found in 78% and a myelodysplastic syndrome may have been misdiagnosed in the past. Spinal MRI was abnormal in 47% and showed a high T2 signal, usually in the posterior cervical and thoracic cords. In a clinically compatible case, the presence of one or more risk factors and/or cytopenia may suggest CDM. Low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels confirmed the diagnosis, and urinary copper levels were typically low in contrast to Wilson's disease. Treatment included copper supplementation and modification of any risk factors, leading to hematological normalization and neurological improvement or stabilization. Clinical vigilance will continue to be the key to minimizing neurological sequelae, as any neurological recovery is partial and CDM case numbers will continue to increase with the increasing use of bariatric gastrointestinal surgery. Recommendations are made for treatment and prevention. [References: 91]",,"Jaiser, S. R.;Winston, G. P.",2010,Jun,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5511-x,0,0,
313,Evaluation of Cuprimine and Syprine for incorporation of (60)Co and (210)Po,"The accepted risk of deliberate radionuclide release into local environments by terrorist activities has led to an impulse to develop new materials and methods for removing internally deposited radionuclides. These incorporation transactions will also benefit workers in the nuclear industry should an exposure occur. Cuprimine and Syprine are oral therapeutics based on the active ingredients D-penicillamine and N,N'-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine dihydrochloride, respectively. These therapeutic drugs have been used for decades to treat Wilson's disease, a genetic defect that causes copper overload, through chelation and accelerated excretion of internally accumulated copper. Studies were conducted to evaluate these FDA-approved drugs for in vivo decoration of radioactive cobalt (Co) and polonium (Po) using male Wistar-Han rats. In these studies, animals were administered Co or Po by IV injection, followed by oral gavage doses of Cuprimine or Syprine. Control animals received only the radionuclide. For Co studies, animals were given a single dose of Cuprimine or Syprine, while for Po studies, animals were dosed repeatedly at 24-hour intervals for a total of 5 doses. The results show that Syprine significantly increases urinary excretion and skeletal Co concentrations compared to controls. Cuprimine had little effect on the total excretion of Co, while skeletal, kidney, liver, muscle and stomach tissues had significantly lower radioactivity compared to control animals. The low total excretion of Po made it difficult to reliably measure urinary or fecal radioactivity and draw any firm conclusions about the effect of Cuprimine or Syprine treatment on excretion. However, Cuprimine treatment was effective in lowering spleen Po levels compared to controls. Similarly, Syprine treatment produced statistically significant reductions in Po in spleen and skeletal tissues compared to control animals. Based on these promising findings, further studies are warranted to evaluate dose-response pharmacokinetic profiles for decoration.",,"Levitskaia, T. G.;Creim, J. A.;Curry, T.

314,Urinary copper/zinc ratio: a promising parameter for modifying 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children.,"BACKGROUND: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, accurate and timely collection poses practical difficulties. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of morning urine copper/creatinine or copper/zinc ratio as a substitution parameter in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Five random urine samples collected over 24 hours from two inpatients were used to estimate the consistency of urinary copper/creatinine and copper/zinc ratios. Correlation of rates with 24-hour urinary copper excretion was studied in 15 patients with liver disease. The diagnostic value of the morning urine copper/zinc ratio was further studied in 9 children with Wilson's disease and 22 children with other liver diseases. RESULTS: The coefficients of variation of urine copper/creatinine and copper/zinc ratios within 24 hours were 12.5% and 9.3%, respectively. There was good correlation between morning urine copper/creatinine ratio, copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The area under the recipient-operation characteristic curve was comparable between morning urine copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (0.983 versus 0.977). CONCLUSION: Morning urine copper/zinc ratio seems to be a promising parameter instead of 24-hour urinary copper excretion in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.",,"Wang, J. S.;Lu, Y.;Wang, X.

315,Wilson's disease: long-term follow-up of a cohort of 24 patients treated with D-penicillamine.,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVES: There are no detailed data on the long-term efficacy of various drug treatments in Wilson's disease (WD). Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed our cohort of patients treated with D-penicillamine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study provides information on the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and disease course in 24 WD patients treated with D-penicillamine for a long time (15+/-12 years, 1969 to 2009). RESULTS: Overall survival in our cohort was 91.6%. At admission, 22 of 24 patients had liver disease, 17 (71%) of 24 patients had cirrhosis, and 11 had cirrhosis complications. Six out of 11 of these patients showed hepatologic improvement (five out of six) or stabilization (one out of six), three out of 11 were transplanted, one in 11 died, one in 11 discontinued follow-up. Improvement (four-sixth) or stabilization (two-sixths) occurred in six of 17 uncomplicated cirrhosis patients. Of all the other patients (seven of 24 patients), improvement (three-fifths) or stabilization (two-fifths) was seen in five out of seven, hepatologic deterioration was terminated in only one patient due to poor treatment adherence, and follow-up was terminated in one of seven patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in 13 of 24 patients at presentation and improved in one of 13 patients, decreased in seven of 13 patients, stabilized in four of 13 patients, and worsened in one of 13 patients (due to poor compliance). Overall, we observed a favorable hepatological and neurological evolution with D-penicillamine. CONCLUSION: Despite the presence of liver disease or neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline in all but one of the patients, we report beneficial results on liver and neurologic disease after very long-term treatment with D-penicillamine, thereby increasing its reputation as 'first-in'.

316,Tetrathiomolybdate inhibits copper trafficking proteins through metal cluster formation,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is an orally active agent for the treatment of copper metabolism disorders. Here we describe how TM inhibits proteins that regulate copper physiology. The crystallographic results reveal that the surprising stability of the drug complex with metallocaperone Atx1 is due to the formation of a sulfur-bridged copper-molybdenum cluster reminiscent of those found in molybdenum and iron sulfur proteins. Spectroscopic studies show that this cluster is stable in solution and corresponds to physiological clusters isolated from animal models of Wilson's disease treated with TM. Finally, mechanistic studies show that the drug-metallocaperone inhibits metal transfer functions between copper-smuggling proteins. The results are consistent with a model in which TM can directly and reversibly down-regulate copper transport to secreted metalloenzymes and suggest that proteins involved in metal regulation can be efficient drug targets.",,"Alvarez, H.

318,Zinc and tetrathiomolybdate for the treatment of Wilson's disease and potential efficacy of anticancer therapy in a wide variety of diseases,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disease consisting mainly of copper accumulation and copper toxicity in the liver and brain, has been the engine driving the development of anticancer drugs. Here we will first briefly review Wilson's disease, then review four anticopper drugs used to treat Wilson's disease. Next, we will discuss the results of treatment with anticancer drugs in Wilson's disease, with a particular emphasis on newer and better drugs, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate. We will then discuss new areas of anticancer therapy that reduce copper availability with tetrathiomolybdate as a treatment in fibrotic, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Many of the cytokines that promote these disorders are copper dependent, and reducing copper availability reduces the activity of these cytokines and positively influences various disease processes. Copper in the blood can be thought of as in two pools. A pool is covalently bound in ceruloplasmin, a six copper-containing protein synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. Ceruloplasmin copper accounts for approximately 85% to 90% of the copper in the blood in normal humans. This copper is tightly bound and not readily available for cellular uptake and copper toxicity. The other 10-15% of copper is more loosely bound to albumin and other small molecules in the blood and can be used easily and freely by cells, and if this copper pool is increased, it can cause copper toxicity. We refer to this second pool of copper as ""free"" copper because of its greater availability. However, it should be understood that it is not completely free, but always bound to albumin and other molecules. It is this pool of free copper that is greatly expanded in untreated Wilson patients suffering from copper toxicity.",,"Brewer, G. J.",2009,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b901614g,0,0,
319,Health impact of discovery of human zinc deficiency,"The necessity of zinc was recognized 46 years ago. Zinc deficiency, which results in growth retardation, hypogonadism, immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment, affects approximately 2 billion people in the developing world. The high phytate content of cereal proteins consumed in developing countries results in reduced availability of zinc for absorption. Zinc therapy has been a very successful and life-saving measure in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and Wilson's disease. Beneficial therapeutic responses to zinc supplementation have been observed in children with acute diarrhea, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, and the common cold. Zinc supplementation was effective in reducing the incidence of infections in the elderly and patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc supplementation was effective in preventing blindness in 25% of the elderly with dry age-related macular degeneration. In the elderly, zinc supplementation reduced oxidative stress and reduced the formation of inflammatory cytokines. Zinc is an intracellular signaling molecule in monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages and plays an important role in cell-mediated immune functions and oxidative stress. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory agent. These unique properties of zinc may have important therapeutic benefits in a variety of human diseases. In many diseases, zinc deficiency can complicate clinical features, adversely affect the immunological status, increase oxidative stress, and increase the formation of inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causal roles in many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, various malignancies, neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the zinc status and correct the zinc deficiency in these chronic diseases. A controlled clinical trial of zinc supplementation in these disorders is warranted to document the preventive and therapeutic effects of zinc. [References: 43]",,"Prasad, A. S.",2009,Jun,,0,0,112.0
320,Zinc: an essential micronutrient,"Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism that catalyzes more than 100 enzymes, facilitates protein folding, and helps regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease and malabsorption syndromes are at increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, such as growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective in preventing upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhea, and as adjunctive therapy for diarrhea in malnourished children. In combination with antioxidants, zinc may be moderately effective in slowing the progression of moderate to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson's disease. Available data do not support the effectiveness of zinc supplementation for upper respiratory tract infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated at recommended doses. Adverse effects of long-term use of high-dose zinc include immunosuppression, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible genitourinary complications.

322,Reduced expression of ATP7B affected by Wilson's disease-causing mutations is rescued by the pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin.,"UNLABELED: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is primarily caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7B, a protein localized in the trans-Golgi network that facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment involves reducing circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients have neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of ameliorating defects caused by some WD mutations by drug therapy aimed at improving protein folding and restoring protein function. This required systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of different WD-associated ATP7B missense mutations. Except for p.S1363F, all tested mutations (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V, and p.S1363F) resulted in decreased ATP7B protein expression, while reporter RNA abundance was unaffected. Retention of mutant ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression, and normalization of localization and homology modeling after culturing the cells at 30 degrees C indicated that these proteins were misfolded. Four different mutations exhibited residual copper export capacity, while other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression of most ATP7B mutants. CONCLUSION: These findings may enable new treatment strategies in WD by directly increasing the protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity. 1795.).",,"van den Berghe, P.

323,Wilson's disease: an Indian perspective,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease involving a defect in copper transport by hepatic lysosomes. It causes excessive copper deposition in the liver, brain, kidneys and skeletal system, most commonly affects children or young adults, and is always fatal if not adequately treated with copper removal therapy. The last century has witnessed several changes, notable among them: increased awareness, improved diagnostic possibilities allowing earlier recognition even at the pre-symptomatic stage, a clear distinction from facial expressions, aggressive therapeutic approaches due to the availability of effective treatment, and an overall reduction in morbidity and mortality. It is widely accepted that the disease is not as rare as once believed. Sir SAK Wilson published his landmark article in 1912, but it was only in 1968 that the first WD patient was reported from our country. Publications on WD from India have focused on phenotypic characterization, lesser-recognized aspects of the disease, such as seizures, behavioral abnormalities, speech and cognitive impairment, subclinical involvement of the visual pathway, cardiac and autonomic function, and pre-symptomatic detection. Attempts have been made to understand the clinical heterogeneity of the disease through the identification of biochemical and immunological markers, magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological study, and genetic analysis for new and/or known mutations. The impact of various therapeutic interventions, such as zinc sulfate, on long-term outcome and quality of life, and assessment of impairment and severity were also examined. However, clinicians often face challenges in the long-term care of these patients. Diagnostic errors are common, leading to delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment, even in patients with a positive family history. There is no consensus on therapeutic protocols as the use of penicillamine, once the 'gold standard' for treatment, is debated by experts. The mortality and morbidity of this potentially treatable disease and the inability to provide medication to poor patients remain a major area of concern.",,"Taly, A. B.;Prashanth, L.

Molecular diagnostics enhances and complements existing biochemical and clinical methods for Wilson's disease screening. Screening for Wilson's disease in newborns is available and has been tested in limited populations, but is not yet widely practiced. Identification of patients with Wilson's disease as the cause of acute liver failure is possible using standard biochemical tests. Treatments for Wilson's disease include chelating agents and zinc salts, and liver transplantation. Future treatments may include hepatocyte transplantation and gene therapy, both of which have been tested and shown to work in animal models of Wilson's disease. Future human studies await advances in these areas. [References: 27]",,"Schilsky, M. L.",2009,Oct,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2009.07.012,0,0,

328,Treatment of Wilson's disease with tetrathiomolybdate: V. Control of free copper with tetrathiomolybdate and comparison with trientine,"Serum ""free"" copper (copper not bound to ceruloplasmin in the blood) has been found to be the copper that causes copper toxicity in Wilson's disease. However, until now, free copper has not been closely monitored at the beginning of anticopper therapy in neurologically presenting patients. At this time of initial therapy, the future fate of these patients is at stake – if they worsen neurologically, as is often the case with penicillamine or trientine therapy, most will never improve. We hypothesize that free copper levels are a biological marker of clinical outcome in these patients. In this article, we evaluate free copper control in 3 studies for initial anticopper therapy in neurologically presenting Wilson patients. The first (study 1) is a 55-patient open-label trial of tetrathiomolybdate, the second (study 2) is a 48-patient double-blind trial comparing tetrathiomolybdate and trientine, and the third (study 3) is a 40-patient trial. Double-blind comparison of 2 disease tetrathiomolybdate regimens. Free copper levels were determined by subtracting ceruloplasmin and tetrathiomolybdate bound copper from total serum copper. Tetrathiomolybdate showed very strong control of free copper levels during 8 weeks of treatment in the 55-patient open-label study (study 1), reducing this to a mean value of approximately one-quarter or less from baseline. In the tetrathiomolybdate/trientine double-blind (study 2), tetrathiomolybdate again showed good control of free copper levels over 8 weeks of treatment, significantly better than trientine. In the trientine arm of Study 2, mean free copper levels did indeed rise during trientine treatment. After 8 weeks of treatment, 5 patients who had neurologically worsened on trientine therapy showed significant increases in serum-free copper levels over time with their neurological worsening. Patients who did not worsen neurologically generally did not show significant increases in free copper. In the tetrathiomolybdate-controlled copper dosing regimen study (study 3), compared to the 2 previous studies of tetrathiomolybdate therapy, possibly due to a change in the way tetrathiomolybdate is given ""away from food"".",,"Brewer, G.

330,Wilson hastalığında Status epileptikus,"RATIONALE: Seizures are seen in Wilson's disease (WD), prevalence rates up to 4-6% in specialized academic centers, but status epilepticus is rare. We present a patient with WD who developed non-convulsive status epilepticus (SE) while on tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) therapy and review the last 20 years of relevant literature. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old right-handed male patient with WD, who had Parkinson's features and liver cirrhosis, presented with seizures. Seizures began at week 4 of treatment with TTM (Phase III Study of the Tetrathiomolybdate Dose Regimen in Neurological Wilson's Disease). Seizures were characterized by obligate clonic eye, head deviation towards right and right arm posture, followed by unresponsiveness, bilateral blinking, and right-hand automatisms. EEG confirmed frequent left frontal seizures. He developed non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) with electrographic seizures lasting 1-2 minutes every 5-10 minutes. Seizures were controlled within 24 hours with fosphenytoin, midazolam and levetiracetam. Brain MRI showed diffuse atrophy, mineralization in the basal ganglia, and patchy FLAIR increase signal in the left frontal lobe. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE: We found reports of 6 WD patients with SE, two treated at presentation and before copper removal therapy and four treated months to years later with D-penicillamine. CONCLUSION: SE is rarely seen in WD and our case is the only case reported to have developed SE during TTM treatment. Since the literature has documented two WD patients who developed SE prior to copper deposition therapy, our hypothesis is that seizures in WD may be the result of disease progression or a combination of factors, but not necessarily due to treatment alone.",,"Pestana Knight, E.

335,Improved resolution of liver fibrosis with tetrathiomolybdate in an animal model,"The background to this study is that we observed some improvement in cirrhosis in Wilson's disease patients treated with the anti-copper drug, zinc, and another copper-inhibiting drug, tetrathiomolybdate, carbon tetrachloride completely prevented hepatic fibrosis in the mouse model. We hypothesize that in present cirrhosis there may be a fine balance between fibrosis formation and fibrosis resolution that can be pushed in the direction of resolution by anticancer drugs. Therefore, in this study, we produced hepatic fibrosis in mice by treatment with carbon tetrachloride, followed by giving tetrathiomolybdate to half of the fibrotic mice for 3 months, while the other half of the fibrotic mice received nothing for 3 months and served as a control. Tetrathiomolybdate caused a dramatic and significant reduction in fibrosis as measured by hydroxyproline (the main amino acid component of collagen) levels, returning to near-baseline levels compared to controls who had only a slight and insignificant reduction. It is clear from this animal study that dissolution of pre-existing fibrosis can be strongly catalyzed by lowering copper levels with tetrathiomolybdate.

METHODS: Eleven unrelated Lithuanian families were tested, including 13 WD patients. The clinical diagnosis of WD was made according to the Leipzig scoring system. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole venous blood using a salt precipitation method. First, the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation. Patients not homozygous for the c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) mutation were also analyzed. Exons 21 of the WD gene were amplified in a thermal cycler (Biometra T3 Thermocycler, Göttingen, Germany). Direct sequencing of amplified PCR products was performed by loop sequencing using fluorescent dye terminators on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). RESULTS: A total of 13 WD patients (mean age 26.4; range 17-40; male/female 3/10) presenting with liver disease and their 16 first-degree relatives (including 12 siblings) were analyzed.

Three women with WD have successfully given birth to healthy babies. CONCLUSION: The c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q) missense mutation is the most characteristic mutation for Lithuanian patients with WD. Even 92.3% of WD patients with hepatic presentation of the disease are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for the p.H1069Q mutation.",,"Kucinskas, L.;Jeroch, J.;Vitkauskiene, A.;Sakalauskas, R.;Petrenkiene, V.;Kucinskas, V.;Naginiene, R.;Schmidt, H.;Kupcinskas, L.",2008,2014-10-01 00:00:00,,0,1,
343,The risks of free copper in the body and the development of beneficial anticancer drugs,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the toxicity and risks of free copper in Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegeneration diseases, and cognitive loss in the general population. We will also review anti-copper medications and how lowering free copper levels with an anti-copper medication inhibits fibrosis, inflammation, and autoimmunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Some exciting recent studies show that free copper levels are increased in Alzheimer's disease and that copper may play a role in disease pathogenesis and pave the way for possible treatment of Alzheimer's disease with anticopper drugs. Copper may also play a role in other neurodegeneration diseases. A very exciting recent study claims high copper intake, mostly from copper supplements, associated with a high-fat diet in faster cognitive decline in the general population. Other data suggest that even low levels of copper in drinking water, perhaps similar to copper supplements, bypass the liver, enter the circulation, increase copper's blood-brain penetration and cause damage. SUMMARY: Some implications are that Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegeneration diseases and fibrotic, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases can be treated by reducing the availability of free copper. People in the general population may want to take steps to lower their free copper levels and specifically avoid taking copper supplements and getting significant amounts of copper in their drinking water.

345,Wilson's disease in Taiwan,"Wilson's disease (WH) has been studied in Taiwan since the 1960s. Study can be divided into three periods: (1) The first period, US Navy Medical Research Unit No. 2 (NAMRU-2) Dr. It was the 1960s, represented by the work of JB Tu; (2) The second semester, also working in NAMRU-2, Dr. It was the 1970s, represented by the work of ML Leu. During these two periods, d-penicillamine was introduced to Taiwan via NAMRU-2, primarily as a study drug; and (3) The third period is the 1980s and later. Tu and Leu reported the clinical manifestations of copper, tissue concentrations and therapeutic effects of d-penicillamine, including cupriuresis, reduction of copper content in tissues and prognosis. Our studies since the 1980s included clinical manifestations, evoked potentials to detect the extent of CNS involvement, the effect of overlapping hepatitis B infection on clinical signs and prognosis, and WD with cerebral white matter involvement. The current review highlights the above research. [References: 54]",,"Chu, N. S.;Huang, C. C.",2008,Jun,,0,0,
346,"Tetrathiomolybdate, a copper chelator for the treatment of Wilson's disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and other indications","Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a copper chelator that has also shown antiangiogenic, antifibrogenic and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical studies. From the University of Michigan the drug was licensed to Pipex Pharmaceuticals Inc for development for various indications; development of the drug for cancer was later licensed to Attenuon LLC. In a phase III clinical trial, TTM stabilized neurological function in patients with Wilson's disease and resulted in significant improvement in 81% of patients 3 years after initiation of treatment; A second phase III trial was in progress at the time of publication. A phase I/II clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of TTM in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, leading the FDA to grant TTM Orphan Drug status for this disease. Several phase II clinical trials have also been completed and mixed efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with various cancers. TTM was also evaluated in a phase I clinical trial for age-related macular degeneration, but reported results from the trial were negative; There were no further developments for this indication. TTM has been evaluated for the treatment of psoriasis in a phase II clinical trial, but no data have been reported. At the time of publication, phase II and phase III clinical trials were ongoing in patients with Alzheimer's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. The most common clinical adverse events observed for TTM over the range of indications are anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and transaminase elevations. These side effects generally resolved with either a dose adjustment or temporary suspension of the dosing regimen. It is predicted that TTM will most likely find a niche in the treatment of Wilson's disease where available treatment options are limited. [References: 83]",,"Medici, V.;Sturniolo, G.

347,Analysis of kidney failure in children with Wilson's disease,"Background: Misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis is not uncommon, as various manifestations of kidney failure occur at different stages of Wilson's disease. This study was conducted to find the clinical features of kidney failure in children with Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). METHODS: Eighty-five children with HLD treated in our department between January 1991 and June 2006 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data of 25 patients with renal failure were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 85 HLD patients, 34 had renal failure. Nine of 34 patients who received D-penicillamine treatment were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 25 patients, 7 started with symptoms of renal failure, 5 with edema, 1 with gross hematuria, and 1 with acute hemolysis and acute renal failure. Of 25 patients, 12 had proteinuria, 14 had hematuria, and 5 had both proteinuria and hematuria. Urine glucose was positive in 4 patients, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was elevated in 5 patients, and urinary beta2-microglobulin was elevated in 6 patients. Urine erythrocyte phase, including glomerular, was detected in 7 patients. Hematuria in 5 patients and non-glomerular hematuria in the 2nd patient. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine increased in 1 patient. B-ultrasound showed bilaterally enlarged kidneys in 3 patients. Renal biopsy showed extensive mesangial proliferation and IgA deposition in the mesangial region in 1 patient. All 25 patients had corneal CF ring and ceruloplasmin level decreased. Six patients had a family history of HLD. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of HLD and renal failure are varied. HLD should be excluded from patients with unexplained kidney failure, while those with HLD should have a kidney exam to determine kidney failure. We recommend that renal function and urinalysis be checked regularly in patients receiving D-penicillamine therapy.",,"Zhuang, X. H.;Mo, Y.;Jiang, X. Y.;Chen, S.

349,Diagnosing Wilson's disease: a comprehensive review,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The culprit gene is ATP7B. Worldwide prevalence is approximately 1 in 30,000, which can vary with population. Higher prevalence rates have been reported using more sensitive screening techniques and pilot population screening. Typical presentations include neuropsychiatric and liver dysfunction, while atypical presentations are variable. Diagnosis is based on high clinical suspicion, typical neurological symptoms, the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and low serum ceruloplasmin concentration. The conventional value < 0.20 g/l is not a universal diagnostic value. The age of the subjects and analytical variations should be considered when interpreting these levels. Patients with uncertain findings need further investigations such as 24-hour urine free copper excretion, penicillamine loading test, liver copper measurement and detection of gene mutations. Direct molecular diagnosis remains the most decisive tool. Other tests, such as copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, are unreliable. The possible pitfalls and limitations of these diagnostic markers are critically reviewed in this article. The mainstays of treatment are trientine, penicillamine and/or zinc. For those with advanced disease, liver transplantation is life-saving. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and serum free copper concentration should be monitored in patients receiving long-term copper removal therapy to prevent iatrogenic copper deficiency.

Voxels were located in the globus pallidus (right, left). We followed 17 newly diagnosed WD cases for 1 year. During this observation period, 6 neurological and 9 hepatic patients improved, while 2 neurological patients worsened. Pretreatment (1)H-MRS analysis showed statistically significantly lower mI/Cr, NAA/Cr, and higher Lip/Cr in all WD patients who showed improvement compared to controls. In patients with hepatic manifestations, a statistically significant increase in mI/Cr and Glx/Cr was observed on the second (1 year post-treatment) (1)H-MRS. A statistically significant increase in NAA/Cr was noted at follow-up in patients with neurologic improvement after (1)H-MRS treatment. During the neurological deterioration, a decrease in Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr was seen, unlike the patient with another neurological disorder with liver failure exacerbation, who had a decrease in mI/Cr and an increase in Glx/Cr. Changes in the NAA/Cr ratio in patients with neurological impairment and between mI/Cr and Glx/Cr in patients with hepatic impairment may be sensitive markers of clinical improvement or worsening in these WD patients.

352,Benefit of penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion in the diagnosis of adult Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) depends on liver biopsy (LB) and hepatic copper measurement. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion (PS-UCE), a non-invasive diagnostic test, for the diagnosis of WD in adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study conducted in patients with suspected WD, total serum copper, ceruloplasmin, baseline 24-hour UCE and PS-UCE levels were measured. LB was performed with copper determination in patients with persistent hypertransaminasemia and low ceruloplasmin or baseline UCE > 40 microg/24 hours. If the ceruloplasmin level is < 20 mg/dl and hepatic copper is > 250 microg/g, the diagnosis is made. Results. A total of 115 patients were examined; 43 of them were diagnosed with LB and 6 (13.9%) of them with WD. with WH for basal UCE (WD: median 134.3 microg/24 h and non-WD: median 19.0 microg/24 h (p < 0.05)) and PS-UCE (WD: median 1284.0 microg) and Significant differences were found among patients without WD. /24 h versus non-WD: median 776.0 microg/24 h; p < 0.01). In the ROC (recipient-operated curve) analysis, PS-UCE was the best distinction between WD and non-WD (AUC = 0.911, best cut-off point 1057 μg/24 h, 100% sensitivity, 82.3% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: PS-UCE is a useful non-invasive test in the diagnosis of WD, possibly improving patient selection for diagnostic liver biopsy.

No data on the bone mineral density (BMD) of children with Wilson's disease (WD) have been published so far. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis in childhood WD and to observe the possible positive effects of penicillamine and zinc therapy on osteoporosis. METHODS: 31 children with newly diagnosed WD and 16 healthy children matched for sex and age were included. The mean age was 9.0+/-3.2 years (2 to 16 years). Bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were measured at admission and reassessed after 1 year of treatment with penicillamine and zinc in 13 cases. RESULTS: Patients' mean BMD, BMC, and Z scores were significantly lower than those of healthy children: 0.52+/-0.09 vs. 0.72+/-0.09 (P=0.001), 19.27+/-13.01 vs. 29.67+/-14.23 (P). =0.009) and -2.33+/-1.28 versus -0.12+/-0.31 (P=0.001), respectively. The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in children with WD was 22.6% and 67.7%, respectively. BMD and BMC levels were higher in children with neurological involvement. The severity of the disease did not have any effect on the indicated parameters. One year treated with penicillamine and zinc did not significantly change the indicated parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study investigating the prevalence of osteoporosis in children with WD, we found a very high prevalence.

360,Predominant psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge!,"INTRODUCTION: Recognition of the psychiatric symptoms of Wilson's disease (WD) has diagnostic and therapeutic implications. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features and psychopathology of patients with WD with initial or predominant psychiatric symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS: The records of 15 patients with WD (M:F: 11:4) from a large cohort of 350 patients with predominant psychiatric symptoms at baseline were reviewed. Initial diagnoses, demographic profiles, family histories, pre-disease personalities, clinical signs, treatments, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 19.8+/-5.8. Six patients were born to consanguineous families, and each of the two patients had a family history of WD and a previous psychiatric illness. The diagnosis of WD was suspected by the detection of CF rings (all), sensitivity to neuroleptics (n=2), a history of jaundice (n=2), and a family history suggestive of WD (n=9). Psychiatric symptoms can be classified as affective disorder spectrum (n=11) and schizophreniform-disease (n=3). Psychiatric symptoms improved in five patients who underwent copper removal therapy, and symptomatic treatment was required in seven patients. Three out of four patients who responded to copper removal therapy were sensitive to neuroleptics. Variable improvement was seen in the long-term follow-up of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: A young patient with psychiatric findings and clues such as a history of jaundice, a family history of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sensitivity to neuroleptics should be evaluated for WD in order to prevent delay in diagnosis and related morbidity.

Zinc sulfate has emerged as an effective, safe and inexpensive alternative for the treatment of free copper toxicosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of discontinuing penicillamine from maintenance therapy with penicillamine and zinc sulfate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five WD patients (M:F: 28:17; age at diagnosis: 13.5+/-63 years) using both penicillamine (P) and zinc sulfate (Zn) could not continue penicillamine due to financial reasons. limitations. Clinical data, disability and disability scores (Schwab and England (S&E) score, Neurological Symptom Score (NSS) and Chu staging) and follow-up data of patients who received only zinc sulfate therapy were recorded. RESULTS: Most of the patients (84.4%) had neuropsychiatric symptoms. The mean duration of treatment with penicillamine (P) and zinc sulfate (P+Zn) before penicillamine was stopped was 107.4 ± 67.3 months. Forty patients improved variably, while the rest did not. They received zinc sulfate alone for 27.2+/-8.5 months (range: 12 to 34), and 44 patients (97.7%) remained in the status quo or marginally improved. Only one patient reported worsening of dysarthria.

362,Effect of penicillamine and zinc on iron metabolism in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown and there is little data on the actual presence and progression of iron accumulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate parameters of iron metabolism, including hepatic iron concentration and urinary pro-hepcidine in follow-up liver biopsies and serum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 23 patients with Wilson's disease who received long-term treatment were included in the study. RESULTS: Hepatic iron content was significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared to zinc-treated patients. Despite the normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism, serum and urinary pro-hepcidine concentrations were significantly higher in Wilson's disease patients than in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term penicillamine treatment appears to be responsible for a more pronounced accumulation of iron in the liver. This observation may justify a revision of long-term Wilson's disease treatment modalities with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary pro-hepcidin is significantly increased in patients with Wilson's disease compared with healthy volunteers suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, although this needs to be confirmed by a study of hepatic hepcidin expression in these patients.",,"Medici, V.;Di Leo, V.;Lamboglia, F.;Bowlus, C.

The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It seems likely that MWS will be underdiagnosed, especially in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene ZEB2, formerly designated ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, more than 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; these are often complete gene deletions or truncated mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Genotype-phenotype analysis studies show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor development are fixed clinical features, while frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations may lead to an atypical phenotype. Facial phenotype is particularly important for initial clinical diagnosis and provides the distinguishing feature that warrants ZEB2 mutation analysis even in the absence of HSCR. Most cases of MWS reported so far are sporadic, so the risk of recurrence is low. However, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require early advanced clinical investigation with the intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, so rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be started as soon as possible.

Therefore, the role of d-penicillamine therapy has not been determined. We report the first case of antimyeloperoxidase antibody-associated vasculitis in a patient treated with d-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. As Wilson's disease has never been associated with ANCA-associated nephritis, this case strongly supports that d-penicillamine can induce ANCA-vasculitis.

The aim was to examine the MRI characteristics of CPM-like changes in WD and serial changes. METHODS: Twenty of the 121 WD patients (M:F:9:11, age of onset: 14.2 +/- 4.6 years) had features similar to CPM. All had the progressive neuropsychiatric form of WD. All but five were undergoing decoupling treatment. None of them had acute deterioration or liver failure. Ten patients were re-studied. RESULTS: Twenty patients with CPM-like changes manifested by the characteristic WD phenotype. Three distinct patterns of CPM-like changes were observed: (a) characteristic round shape -7, (b) ""bisected"" -9, and (c) ""tripartite"" -4. Only one had signal changes suggestive of extrapontine myelinolysis. All patients had contiguous midbrain involvement. Serial MRI evaluations in 10 patients at mean intervals of 17.4 +/- 13.2 months showed complete recovery in one, partial recovery in five, and no change in three. Clinical and MRI improvement were equally good except for one. CONCLUSIONS: CPM-like changes in WD are perhaps under-recognized and different from the commonly known 'osmotic demyelination'.

366,Importance of copper determination in late onset of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from dysfunction of a copper-bearing P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. When the hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, excess copper manifests itself as a toxic effect.

Intoxication with lead, mercury, cadmium, thallium, zinc, chromium, manganese and arsenic compounds is excluded. High copper levels were found in blood and urine (AAS method) (blood: 3.90 microg/ml, urine: 8.10 microg/ml, 12,140 microg/24 hours; normal - blood: 0.88 microg/ml, urine: 0.051 microg/ml , < 51 microg/24 hours). Symptomatic treatment for multi-organ failure was immediately administered. Despite intensive care, the patient died. Autopsy findings indicated anasacra and ascites, hydropericardium, cerebral edema, orange-like coloration of internal organs and the presence of cirrhotic liver. Histopathological examination of liver sections revealed complete micro and medionodular cirrhotic changes, focal central necrosis of hepatocytes, and cholestasis. The copper content in the liver was 89.8 cups/g (normal: 3.58 +/- 1.71 microg/g). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of tissue copper content is essential for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in vivo or postmortem (it can assist in the correct diagnosis while alive and allows to determine the cause of sudden death after death). The copper level in the liver in Wilson's disease is about 25 times higher than in the healthy liver.",,"Lech, T.;Hydzik, P.;Kosowski, B.",2007,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15563650701502535,0,0,
367,Cause of death in Wilson's disease,"Before 1948, all patients with Wilson's disease died shortly after diagnosis. In 1948, BAL (dimercaprol) was introduced as a possible effective therapy, followed by penicillamine (1955), zinc salts (1961), trientine (1969), liver transplantation (1982), and tetrathiomolybdate (1984). Despite this wide range of treatment options, patients still die. This article examines the cause of death of 67 (33 men, 34 women) out of 300 patients seen between 1948-2000. The patients were classified according to their presentation as neurological, 32 patients, liver 11, mixed liver/neurological 10. , hemolytic, 6, and 'sibling biopsy' 8. Diagnostic failure was the main cause of death, but there were many other causes, the main cause of which was poor compliance and development of malignant disease after 10 years of follow-up.

368,Consecutive MRI changes in Wilson's disease with copper removal therapy: a study of 50 patients.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a clinically and radiologically dynamic disease. However, studies involving sequential MRI changes with or without treatment in this disease are few. It is based on the change in signal intensity of focal lesions and atrophy. Details of clinical symptoms, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (MSEADL) score, Neurological Symptom Score (NSS), and Chu staging were recorded. Clinical severity and disability scores were correlated with MRI scores using SPSS v10. The mean age at disease and diagnosis onset were 12.8+/-5.6 years and 14.4+/-6.0 years, respectively. During the first MRI, patients were treated for 49.0+/-77.3 months. At a follow-up of 24.2+/-12.2 months, 36 patients improved clinically, 9 remained the same and 5 worsened. Serial imaging revealed an improvement in MRI parameters in 35 patients, no significant changes in 10, worsening in 4, and a mix of resolved and improved changes in 1. Overall MRI score improved from 8.2+/-5.7 to 5.9+/-6.6. All had an improvement in measures of disability and impairment: Chu stage, 11.5+/-0.7 to 1.3+/-0.6; MSEADL score (%), 79.7+/-27.6 to 88.0+/-25.4; NSS, 10.6+/-11.2 to 8.0+/-11.6, with good clinical-radiological correlation.

369,"Validated, stability-indicating quantitative purity test for triethylenetetramine tetrachlorhydrate with automated multiplex enhancement","There is a monograph of Triethylenetetramine dichlorhydrate (Trientine) in the United States Pharmacopoeia. However, neither the base nor the di- or tetra-chlorhydrate salts are in the European Pharmacopoeia. Triethylene tetramine tetrachlorhydrate, now used maturely by AGEPS, is more soluble than triethylene tetramine dichlorhydrate. It is administered to patients with Wilson's disease caused by congenital copper metabolism deficiency. A quantitative purity test of this drug was developed and validated by automated multiplex enhancement high performance thin layer chromatography. The tested confirmation parameters are characterized, in particular, by the retention factor, linearity, detection and quantification limits of a few nanograms, reliability and accuracy. To identify impurities, the American Pharmacopoeia triethylenetetramine dichlorhydrate monograph is tested. This method in the classical development tank requires two mobile phases and is not quantitative. Experiments in high performance liquid chromatography with a different column and mobile phase did not give good results for separation of impurities. Therefore, it is not possible to make a comparative verification of the separation of impurities.

371,"Hereditary iron and copper deposition: diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment","It is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease characterized by hereditary deposition of iron (primary hemochromatosis) or copper (Wilson's disease), progressive liver pathology, and subsequent involvement of various other organs. The prevalence of primary hemochromatosis is approximately 0.5%, approximately 200 times higher than the prevalence of Wilson's disease. The two diseases are characterized by homozygous occurrences of mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6 (primary hemochromatosis) and the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13 (Wilson's disease). Unlike most other inherited conditions, these diseases can be treated successfully, emphasizing the importance of early detection. Serum ferritin values, transferrin saturation and genetic analysis are used in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the use of urine copper values, serum ceruloplasmin, and liver biopsy. Left untreated, both of these genetic diseases cause rapidly progressive multiple organ damage and premature death. The key treatment for hemochromatosis is Wilson's disease chelation or phlebotomy for Zn therapy. Although current treatments can significantly improve patients' prognosis, they may be insufficient in patients diagnosed late enough to develop dense metal deposits in the body. Fundamental research needs in this area are to further clarify the molecular mechanisms of disease progression and to develop new chelators that are more effective and less toxic than currently available ones.

372,Wilson's disease in children: serum aminotransferases and urinary copper in the treatment of triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine),"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and adherence of trientine and/or zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease (WD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of all children with WD in the pediatric liver/liver transplant program in our institution between 1998 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 22 children with WD were evaluated and treated. Seven patients with fulminant disease required liver transplantation and 15 were treated with trientine and/or zinc. Of these 15 people, 10 were followed for 12 to 60 months, and 6 of the last 10 were followed for 12 to 18 months. A trientine treatment regimen was initiated in all 10 patients. Average alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ranged from 183 +/- 103 IU at admission (n = 10) to 80 +/- 46 IU at 12 months (n = 10) and 66 +/- 40 IU at 18 months (n = 10). ) fell 7). Average 24-hour urinary copper levels increased from 156 microg at presentation to 494 microg at 1 to 2 months, then decreased to 71 microg after 21 to 24 months of treatment. ALT levels returned to normal in three of 10 patients, and 1 patient with cirrhosis has maintained normal ALT levels since admission. Four out of 10 patients were documented to be nonadherent, as manifested by increased ALT levels (99 +/- 31 IU); 1 patient had previously normalized ALT levels. In 3 of 10 patients, ALT decreased but remained abnormal (93 +/- 53 IU). CONCLUSIONS: Trientine and/or zinc therapy is effective in children with WD.

We have reevaluated this test. Ninety-eight topics were studied during the presentation. METHODS: Thirty-eight (19 girls, 19 boys; median age 10.3 years; range 5-16 years) were diagnosed with final WD. Sixty (24 girls, 36 boys; median age 10.1 years, 2.3-15 years) had other liver disorders. Urinary Cu was estimated for 24 hours before (basal Cu) and 24 hours when giving 500 mg of penicillamine orally for 12 hours x 2 (Cu after penicillamine). RESULTS: Both basal Cu and post-penicillamine Cu differed significantly between WD patients and controls (basal Cu: median 6.5 micromoles/24 hours, range 0.9-109 micromoles/24 hours, median: 0.8 micromoles /24 hours, range 0.1-19.5 , p<0.0001; post-penicillamine Cu: median 36.9 micromol/24 hours, range 1.98-219 micromole/24 hours, median 12.35 micromole/24 hours, range 0.5-49.8 micromole/ 24 hours, p<0.0001.

We conducted this study to present the phenotypic characteristics and follow-up of a large cohort of patients with WD. We reviewed the medical records of 282 cases of WD (male:female ratio, 196:86) for clinical characteristics, studies, treatment, and outcome data. Clinical presentations were as follows: hepatic, 42 (14.9%); hepato-neurological, 10 (3.5%); neurological, 195 (69.1%); pure psychiatric, 7 (2.4%); osseomuscular, 6 (2.1%); and ""presymptomatic"", 15 (5.3%). The mean age was 15.9 years. Presymptomatic patients and those with hepatic form of WD were younger than neurological patients, and patients with osseomuscular and psychiatric forms were older. The mean disease duration at the time of diagnosis was 28 months. The predominant neurological features were as follows: parkinsonism, 62.3%; dystonia, 35.4%; cerebellar, 28%; pyramidal signs, 16%; chorea, 9%; athetosis, 2.2%; myoclonus, 3.4%; and behavioral abnormalities, 16%. Kayser-Fleischer (CF) rings were seen as: neurological patients, 100%; liver patients, 86%; and presymptomatic patients, 59%. Positive family history was found in 47% and consanguinity in 54%. Patients born to consanguineous parents had an earlier age of onset and shorter duration of illness before admission. Serum ceruloplasmin decreased in 93% of patients and increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion in 70% of patients. Neuroimaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) and electrophysiological abnormalities were seen in many patients.

376,Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in childhood,"The diagnosis of Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation in childhood using clinical and general laboratory parameters is still difficult and is often overlooked or delayed. The aim of the study was to document the clinical and laboratory parameters of liver presentation of Wilson's disease in children. The study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in a developing country. Clinical and common laboratory parameters were recorded in 32 children with Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation. Diagnosis was based on positive family history, Kayser-Fleischer ring, low serum ceruloplasmin level, high basal urinary copper excretion, and favorable response to D-penicillamine therapy. The mean age at diagnosis was +/-SD 9+/-2.97, and 21 (65.6%) were male. Chronic liver disease (21; 65.6%) followed by fulminant liver failure 1(6; 18.8%) was the most common presentation. In the whole group, 21 (65.6%) Kayser-Fleischer ring, 16 (50%) low serum ceruloplasmin, and high baseline urinary copper excretion were found in all 32 (100%) children. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease i) Kayser-Fleischer ring, low serum ceruloplasmin, high basal urinary copper excretion and 11 (34.4%) based on positive response to D-penicillamine therapy, ii) Kayser-Fleischer ring, high basal urinary copper excretion in 10 and positive response to D-penicillamine treatment (31.2%), iii) high basal urinary copper excretion and positive response to D-penicillamine treatment in 6 (18.8%) and iv) low ceruloplasmin, high basal urine copper excretion in 5 (15.6%) children and positive response to D-penicillamine therapy.

377,Penicillamine withdrawal in the absence of alternative orphan drugs (trientine-zinc): A case of decompensated liver cirrhosis in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of early decompensated liver cirrhosis secondary to discontinuation of penicillamine therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old Chinese female patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease for which she was prescribed 250 mg po penicillamine once daily. However, the patient developed intolerance and penicillamine was discontinued without alternative treatment. Five months later he developed decompensated liver cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Eventually, the patient died from complications of sepsis and decompensated liver failure. CONCLUSION: In Wilson's disease, which is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism, chelating agents are the mainstay of treatment. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment should begin and continue for life. Interruption of treatment can be fatal or cause irreversible relapse. Orally administered penicillamine is the first choice chelating agent. However, its adverse side-effect profile causes discontinuation of treatment in 20-30% of patients. In most case reports, discontinuation of penicillamine without replacement therapy results in rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis, which is fatal if liver transplantation is not performed. CONCLUSION: Here we highlight a case of discontinuation of penicillamine therapy without substitution with an alternative regimen in a patient with Wilson's disease. This was caused by the absence of alternative agents such as trientine in our country. As a result, the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy and eventually died within 5 months. A recent study supports the combination of trientine and zinc in the treatment of patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis. This combination can reverse liver failure and eliminate the need for liver transplant. Both trientine and zinc are not registered in Malaysia. Therefore, liver transplantation was probably the only treatment option for this patient. Therefore, the lack of orphan drugs in clinical practice is certainly a matter of serious concern. Systems for better management of patients with rare diseases should be established by all relevant institutions.",,"Ping, C. C.;Hassan, Y.;Aziz, N.

The diagnosis is easily missed, but if discovered early, effective treatments are available that will prevent or reverse many of the symptoms of this disorder. Studies have identified the role of copper in disease pathogenesis and clinical, biochemical and genetic markers that may be useful in diagnosis. There are various chelating agents and zinc salts for medical treatment. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and may be lifesaving.

Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low disease frequency. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 163 patients with Wilson's disease examined at the University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, to determine the clinical presentation, diagnostic course, and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: The diagnostic criteria for serum copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, liver copper content, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and histological signs of chronic liver injury were 86.6%, 88.2%, 87.1%. reached in. %, 92.7%, 66.3% and 73% of patients, respectively.

No mutation was detected in 15% of patients with Wilson's disease. There were no significant differences in clinical parameters or first presentation among patients grouped according to their mutations. Patients with neurological symptoms were significantly older (20.2 v 15.5 years, p<0.05) at symptom onset than patients with hepatitis symptoms, and neurological symptoms were associated with a significantly longer time from baseline to diagnosis than hepatic symptoms (44.4 vs. 14.4 months, p<0.05). After starting treatment, 76.1% of patients had a stable or improved disease course. Disease progression under treatment was more likely for neuropsychiatric rather than hepatic symptoms. Side effects of the treatment occurred in 74.4% of the patients.

383,Optimizing seizure therapy in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction,"Patients with epilepsy may suffer from kidney or liver disease that interferes with antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Also, such diseases themselves can cause seizures. Decreased renal function and hypoalbuminemia lead to accumulation of renally excreted AEDs such as gabapentin, vigabatrin, topiramate, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproate, lamotrigine and benzodiazepines are less affected. Low protein-bound AEDs are extensively removed by hemodialysis and additional doses are required for dialysis patients. Uremia and related conditions, including intracranial hemorrhage, glucose and electrolyte imbalances, and concomitant drug use, may cause seizures in kidney transplant recipients, such as dialysis encephalopathy, primary cerebral lymphoma, fungal infections, and immunosuppressant toxicity. Hepatic dysfunction reduces the enzymatic metabolism of AEDs and causes hypoalbuminemia. In these circumstances, gabapentin, topiramate, and levetiracetam are preferred, while valproate and felbamate are potentially hepatotoxic and should be avoided. Seizures related to hepatic encephalopathy are controlled with oral lactulose or neomycin. Porphyria patients may benefit from gabapentin, oxcarbazepine or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may result from d-penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency. Effective treatment of seizures in kidney and liver diseases requires attention to changes in AED pharmacokinetics and adequate care for underlying diseases. Monitoring free drug concentrations is a valuable adjunct to therapy. [References: 41]",,"Lacerda, G.;Krummel, T.;Sabourdy, C.;Ryvlin, P.;Hirsch, E.",2006,2026-12-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

385,Diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease: results of a single center experience,"OBJECTIVES: To report diagnostic features, management, and clinical outcomes after different treatments of Wilson's disease patients followed for a mean period of 15 years. PATIENTS: Thirty-five Wilson's disease patients who applied to the Padova University Gastroenterology Department for diagnosis or treatment were observed for an average of 15 years. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urinary and hepatic copper concentrations), and uptake of the radiostable isotope Cu into the plasma protein pool. Hepatic Cu content was measured by regular follow-up biopsies. Neurological outcome after treatment was assessed using a newly developed scoring system. RESULTS: Twenty-three (65.7%) patients presented with liver disease; 12 (34.3%) had mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement. All patients were initially treated with either penicillamine (23) or zinc sulfate (12). Neurological symptoms worsened or remained stable in 75% of those treated with penicillamine, whereas zinc treatment improved these symptoms in 90% of treated cases. Both treatments were effective in improving liver symptoms. No difference in hepatic Cu content emerged between follow-up biopsies in either treatment group. Six patients (26%) had to discontinue penicillamine treatment due to side effects. A total of 4 patients underwent liver transplantation, which was successful in 3 patients, with a median post-transplant survival of 4.6 years; The fourth, with severe neurological impairment, died of central pontine myelinolysis.

390,Wilson's disease: an update,"Wilson's disease (WH) is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the copper-carrying gene ATP7B. The disease has an autosomal recessive form of inheritance and is characterized by excessive copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain. Diagnosis of the condition primarily depends on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along all 21 exons, making gene defects particularly difficult to identify. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase chain reaction-based marker analysis. Conventional treatment for WD relies on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but the use of this drug has been questioned due to reported side effects. Although the results of long-term trials are awaited, the use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is advocated. In selected cases, orthotropic liver transplantation can reverse the underlying metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both liver and neurological symptoms. Studies of underlying defects in ATP7B and its suspected modifiers ATOX1 and COMMD1 are expected to unravel the genotype-phenotype correlation of the disease and lead to the design of improved drugs to alleviate patients' suffering.

391,Resolving decompensated cirrhosis from Wilson's disease with zinc monotherapy: a potential treatment option?,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease is a genetic, autosomal recessive copper deposition disorder that often presents with neurological or hepatic symptoms. In cases of hepatic presentation, treatment is usually initiated with potentially toxic copper chelators such as D-penicillamine or trientine. Although numerous studies have promoted zinc as a low-toxicity and low-cost Wilson's disease treatment, its use has been limited to add-on or single-agent maintenance options. In this report, we describe the use of zinc monotherapy in a patient with severe hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Zinc has not been evaluated as a single-agent treatment option for active hepatic Wilson's disease. A single patient with fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease was started on zinc monotherapy while awaiting liver transplantation. RESULTS: Normalization of hepatic synthesis function and improvement in hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy were seen in this patient over a 1-year period with zinc monotherapy. Clinical stabilization of varicose hemorrhages, ascites, and lower extremity edema were also observed. As a result of clinical improvement and improvement of the End Stage Liver Disease Model and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores, the patient is no longer a transplant candidate. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the potential use of zinc as a low-toxicity and cost-effective single-agent therapy in severe decompensated hepatic Wilson's disease. Despite the promising results in this case, further clinical evaluation will be necessary to fully evaluate the clinical efficacy of zinc monotherapy.",,"Lee, V. D.;Northup, P. G.;Berg, C.

392,MRI of the brain in childhood Wilson's disease: clinical correlation and pre- and post-treatment findings,"Background and Aim: Although brain MRI findings in adult Wilson's disease have been described in great detail, there is currently little information available regarding brain MRI findings in pediatric Wilson's disease. The aim of this study is to analyze brain MRI findings at baseline and post-treatment follow-up in childhood Wilson's disease and to correlate these observations with clinical response. METHODS: We evaluated 50 patients with pediatric Wilson's disease. 50 baseline and 20 follow-up MR images from 15 patients following penicillamine treatment were retrospectively analyzed and the data correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS: The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the initial MR imaging findings. Group I (n = 23) showed normal MR imaging findings. Group II (n = 15) was characterized by T1-weighted images with increased signal intensity in the globus pallidus (n = 15, 100%), followed by the putamen, midbrain, and caudate nucleus. Group III (n = 12) showed T2-weighted images with increased signal intensity in the putamen (n = 10, 83%), followed by the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, and pons. There was a significant difference in mean age, presence of neurological symptoms, and Child-Pugh classification between the 3 groups (P < .001). Following copper chelation therapy, changes in follow-up MR imaging were strongly associated with clinical response to therapy (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Brain MRI imaging in children with Wilson's disease can be divided into different groups and can show a significant correlation with clinical findings. Spacing changes on follow-up MR imaging were also closely related to clinical findings and were helpful in assessing clinical response.",,"Kim, T. J.;Kim, I. O.;Kim, W. S.;Cheon, J. E.;Moon, S.

393,"A novel hepatocytic PLZF isoform lacking the BTB domain interacts with the Wilson's disease protein, ATP7B, and positively regulates ERK signaling.","Promylocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein has been identified as a transcriptional repressor of the BTB domain/zinc finger family and has been shown to regulate the expression of Hox genes during embryogenesis and the expression of cyclin A during cell cycle progression. Here, a 45 kDa PLZF isoform without BTB domain was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal region of ATP7B as bait in our determination of the biological roles of the Wilson's disease protein outside of its copper-binding domain. . Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the hepatocytic isoform of PLZF can specifically interact with the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Immunostaining of HepG2 cells revealed that the ATP7B and PLZF proteins apparently co-localized within the trans-Golgi complexes. It was also determined that disruption of PLZF expression in HepG2 cells affected attenuation of ERK activity in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatocytic activities of ERK kinase were found to be increased as a result of PLZF or ATP7B expression, but this enhancement was abolished by deletion of the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Furthermore, a transgenic strain of Drosophila ectopically expressing hepatocytic deltaBTB-PLZF exhibited phenotypic changes in eye and wing development, and these changes were fully recovered as a result of ATP7B expression indicating obvious in vivo interaction between the two proteins. These PLZF-induced abnormalities were attributed to enhancement of ERK signaling, as demonstrated by phenotypic reversions with loss-of-function mutations in ERK signal transduction in Drosophila. These data suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates ERK signaling via the C-terminus of ATP7B and hepatocytic PLZF interacting with ATP7B. Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Ko, J.

394,Erythrocyte metabolism and antioxidant status in patients with Wilson's disease with hemolytic anemia,"Wilson's disease (WH) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive hepatic damage with excessive accumulation of copper in the liver due to a defect in the ATP7B gene and its subsequent redistribution to various extrahepatic tissues, including the brain, kidneys, and cornea. The total serum copper concentration in WD is always low, although the non-ceruloplasmin copper level is still expected to be high. To evaluate the role of free radical reactions catalyzed by non-ceruloplasmin copper, we investigated erythrocyte metabolism and oxidative stress as a mechanism for hemolysis in eight WD patients during episodes of acute hemolysis and compared them with eight WD follow-up cases in d. penicillamine therapy and eight healthy, same-aged children. High levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper were found in all WD patients during the episode of hemolytic anemia. Significant inhibition of erythrocyte enzymes, namely hexokinase, total adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) from WD patients, compared with penicillamine-treated patients and healthy children, indicates altered erythrocyte metabolism during treatment. hemolytic crisis; Antioxidant status has also been found to be compromised, as evident from low glutathione (GSH) levels, decreased antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase), increased lipid peroxidation, and unregulated plasma antioxidants. Uric acid showed maximum reduction, followed by ascorbic acid. These findings suggest that increased free radical production by non-ceruloplasmin copper through transition metal-catalyzed reactions leads to oxidative damage resulting in altered erythrocyte metabolism and severely compromised antioxidant status of WD patients during hemolytic anemia.",,"Attri, S.;Sharma, N.;Jahagirdar, S.;Thapa, B.

397,A paradigm shift in the treatment of Wilson's disease: zinc therapy now the treatment of choice,"Zinc therapy has replaced penicillamine as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease. The new guidelines reflect the paradigm shift in therapy that has occurred in recent years. In the old paradigm, Wilson's disease was viewed as a genetic disorder associated with copper accumulation in the liver and other organs after the liver was overloaded with copper. Left untreated, the disease was considered fatal in one form. Older treatment guidelines recommended 'decompression' with penicillamine because this chelating agent was thought to be effective in restoring most patients to health. Before starting treatment, patients were warned that their symptoms could worsen during the first weeks or months of treatment to prevent them from despairing of penicillamine therapy. In the new paradigm, Wilson's disease is seen as an inherited disease associated with copper intoxication. The essence of symptomatic Wilson's disease is the poisoning of free copper in the blood, that is, copper not bound to ceruloplasmin. While this form of copper is toxic, accumulated copper and copper bound to ceruloplasmin or metallothionein are not. Treatment of symptomatic Wilson's disease is no longer aimed at 'decopper' the removal of accumulated copper to reverse copper poisoning, but at normalizing the concentration of free copper in the blood. This can be achieved safely and effectively with zinc therapy. Zinc induces metallothionein, a highly effective detoxification protein that binds copper. Oral zinc therapy results in metallothioneine-bound copper being deposited in the intestinal mucosa and excretion of copper through faeces. Recent treatment guidelines advise against the use of chelating agents as initial therapy, as they may exacerbate copper intoxication and cause iatrogenic deterioration.",,"Hoogenraad, T.

This article systematically reviews the various types and stages of Wilson's disease presentation and provides insight into the appropriate treatment for each. The use of tetrathiomolybdate is optimal for patients presenting with neurological disease; A combination of trientine (Syprine, Merck) and zinc is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, while liver transplantation is required for patients with severe impairment; Zinc therapy alone or trientine alone is recommended as a second-line treatment for patients presenting with hepatitis or cirrhosis without hepatic failure, for maintenance therapy, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients, and for the treatment of pediatric and pregnant patients.

Lab tests revealed markedly increased serum bilirubin, while aminotransferases were only slightly elevated and alkaline phosphatase was unexpectedly low. Prothrombin and antithrombin III levels were low. He had Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Ceruloplasmin was lower than normal. Based on these findings, acute Wilson's disease was suspected. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was immediately transferred to a hepatology center with transplantation facilities. There it was found that urinary copper excretion and copper concentration in liver tissue were elevated. Liver histology showed fibrosis but no cirrhosis.

In this study, we investigated variations in enteric neural plexus abnormalities in MWS using morphometry-based histopathological analysis. METHODS: Seven patients with MWS (3 with mutations in exon 8 of ZFHX1B and 4 with deletions) who underwent modified Duhamel operations for Hirschsprung's disease were studied. Surgically resected rectosigmoid specimens were analyzed morphometrically. RESULTS: Aganglionic segment length was longer than 3 cm in all patients with deletion. No aganglionic region was detected in surgically resected specimens in 3 patients with mutations; however, the parameters of the ganglion and plexus were significantly smaller than those of the controls (cloaca and aproctia), indicative of a transition zone.

412,Phase 2 trial of copper depletion and penicillamine as antiangiogenesis therapy of glioblastoma,"Penicillamine is an oral agent used to treat intracerebral copper overload in Wilson's disease. Copper is a known regulator of angiogenesis; copper reduction inhibits experimental glioma growth and invasiveness. This study examined the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of inducing copper deficiency in human glioblastoma multiforme. Forty eligible patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme began radiation therapy (6000 cGy in 30 fractions) combined with a low copper diet and increasing doses of penicillamine. Serum copper was measured at baseline and monthly. The primary endpoint of this study was overall survival compared to historical controls in the NABTT CNS Consortium database. The median age of 25 men and 15 women enrolled was 54 years and the median Karnofsky performance status was 90. Surgical resection was performed in 83% of these patients. Normal serum copper levels at baseline (median, 130 µg/dl; range, 50-227 µg/dl) fell to the target range of <50 µg/dl (median, 42 µg/dl; range, 12-118 µg/dl) by two months later. Penicillamine-induced hypocupresemia was well tolerated for months. The drug-associated myelosuppression, elevated liver function tests, and skin rash resolved rapidly with copper replacement. Median survival was 11.3 months and progression-free survival was 7.1 months. The success of hypocupresemia did not significantly increase survival.

413,Inhibition kinetics of fungal tyrosinase by the copper chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate,"Several copper-specific chelators were applied in this study with the strategy of chelating coppers at the tyrosinase active site to detect an effective inhibitor. Among them, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM), known as a drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease, turned out to be an important tyrosinase inhibitor. Treatment with ATTM on fungal tyrosinase completely inactivated enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. The propagation reaction kinetics of the substrate using the two-step kinetic pathway and dilution of ATTM revealed that ATTM is a tight-binding inhibitor and that at high dose ATTM is irreversibly inactivated tyrosinase. Substrate progression reaction kinetics and activity restoration by dilution of ATTM showed that the copper chelator ATTM could bind slowly but reversibly to the active site without competition with the substrate, and the enzyme-ATTM complex subsequently undergoes reversible conformational change. To complete the inactivation of tyrosinase activity. Therefore, inhibition on tyrosinase by ATTM can be categorized as a complex type of inhibition with a slow and reversible binding. Detailed analysis of the inhibition kinetics yielded an IC50 at steady state and inhibitor binding constant (K(I)) for ATTM of 1.0+/-0.2 microM and 10.65 microM, respectively.

414,Abnormal collagen deposition around hepatocytes in Wilson's disease is associated with hepatocyte-specific expression of lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase-like protein-2.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lysyl-oxidases support their polymerization by catalyzing the oxidation of lysine residues in collagen and elastin. Here, we examined the expression of four lysyl-oxidases in normal and diseased human liver. METHODS: The expression of different lysyl-oxidases in paraffin-embedded liver sections was studied using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Enzymatic activity of lysyl-oxidase-like protein-2 (Loxl2 or LOR-1) using a previously described lysyl-oxidase assay. RESULTS: We found that the four lysyl-oxidases we examined were not significantly expressed in normal liver. In contrast, patients with Wilson's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) express lysyl-oxidase (Lox) and lysyl-oxidase-like protein-2 (Loxl2 or LOR-1) in hepatocytes, and expression is accompanied by collagen deposition around hepatocytes. Lysyl-oxidases are also expressed in additional fibrotic liver diseases such as hepatitis B and C, but in these diseases expression is limited to fibrotic lesions and collagen does not accumulate around hepatocytes. We found that Loxl2 can oxidize lysine residues of collagen and behaves similarly to Lox in this respect. The copper chelator D-penicillamine inhibits Loxl2-induced collagen oxidation, but the Lox inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile did not inhibit oxidation using a BAPN concentration at which Lox activity was completely inhibited. Loxl2 also catalyzed the oxidation of cell surface proteins on HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells and inhibited their proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of Lox and Loxl2 in hepatocytes of patients with Wilson's disease and PBC may contribute to liver injury by various mechanisms. Upregulation of Lox and Loxl2 in Wilson's disease may perhaps be used for diagnostic purposes, as their expression is upregulated in hepatocytes even before the onset of fibrosis.",,"Vadasz, Z.;Kessler, O.;Akiri, G.;Gengrinovitch, S.;Kagan, H.

Twenty-nine (18 men, 11 women) had severe disease as defined by the Modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Score (MSEADL) < or =. 50% or Chu stage 3. We examined clinical, laboratory and MRI features for prognosis. RESULTS: For the severe form, the mean age at symptom onset was 11.5 +/- 6.4 years and 13.3 +/- 7.0 years at diagnosis. The mean Neurological Symptom Score (NSS), Chu stage, and MSEADL were 26.5 +/- 8.2, 2.7 +/- 0.5, and 24.8 +/- 17.4, respectively. Twenty-one patients underwent MRI; 14 had repeat MRI. Following treatment, 14 (group A) had progressive worsening, including death, in two, while 15 (group B) had sustained clinical improvement. Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics and MRI scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, diffuse white matter abnormalities were more common in group A. Full-dose initial penicillamine therapy may have contributed to worsening in four patients. Medication adherence was poor in both groups, but restarting treatment did not benefit patients in group A. Serial MRI showed regression of lesions only in patients with clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Severe WD remains a therapeutic challenge, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Specific MRI observations, a 'low-start slow' regimen for penicillamine, and compliance may have prognostic significance.

417,Genitourinary abnormalities in Mowat-Wilson syndrome with deletion/mutation in the zinc finger homeo box 1B gene (ZFHX1B). Report and review of three Italian cases of hypospadias,"Hypospadias is a common malformation with the opening of the urethra on the ventral side of the penis, occurring in about 3 out of every 1000 male births. It is a complex disease associated with genetic and environmental factors and may be part of genetic syndromes. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a prominent facial phenotype, Hirschsprung's disease, microcephaly, and mental retardation. The zinc finger homeobox 1B gene is caused by mutations in ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, 68 deletion/mutation positive cases have been reported. Genitourinary anomalies are common in MWS. Here we report that hypospadias is common in men with this syndrome. Of the 39 patients for whom this information was available, 46% (18/39) of patients had hypospadias. Hypospadias was always present in the 3 Italian male cases reported here. MWS should be considered by endocrinologists in patients with hypospadias associated with developmental delays/mental retardation, especially in the presence of a prominent facial phenotype.

418,Copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate as an antiangiogenic strategy in cancer,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a new anticancer agent under development for use in Wilson's disease. It acts by forming a stable ternary complex with serum albumin and copper, making the complex copper unavailable for cellular uptake. TM is a very potent anti-copper agent and has an excellent safety profile. Normal copper levels have been shown to be necessary for optimal angiogenesis. Based on this background, we decided to consider TM as an anticancer agent. TM treatment of Her/2neu mice genetically programmed to develop breast cancer completely prevented the development of visible breast cancers, although avascular microscopic cancer cell clusters were found in the breasts of TM-treated animals. Controls developed largely visible tumors. TM was able to potently inhibit tumor growth in six other rodent models. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial of advanced and metastatic cancers, no progression averaged 11 months, and some individual results were quite striking. Eight phase 2 studies of specific cancers were initiated. The putative mechanism of action of TM is inhibition of angiogenic cytokines. We hypothesize that, unlike other antiangiogenic therapy approaches targeting single agents, TM inhibits multiple angiogenic cytokines. Part of this effect appears to be due to inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF(K)B), which controls the transcription of many angiogenic and other cytokines. However, there are likely multiple mechanisms by which some angiogenic cytokines appear to have separate mechanisms of copper dependence. Inhibition of multiple angiogenic cytokines gives TM the potential to be a more global inhibitor of angiogenesis. [References: 67]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2005,May,,0,0,
419,Genes and metals: a deadly combination,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism with an estimated prevalence of 1:0000. The most common presentations of WD are liver disease and neurological disorder. For many years the diagnosis was based on the results of various clinical and biochemical tests, with few limitations reported. The development of new techniques in genetics and molecular biology in recent years has provided useful tools in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. However, the presence of a few mutations and the fact that most patients are compound heterozygous means that the problem is not fully resolved. Chelators and zinc salts have been used extensively in the treatment of WD patients with a positive outcome, but controversy remains regarding first-choice agents. Liver transplantation is a treatment for patients with decompensated liver disease, but its impact on neurological outcomes is still unclear.

422,"Neurologically manifested Wilson's disease: epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment","Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation and copper toxicity, resulting in failure of biliary copper excretion due to mutations in the ATP7B gene. It presents clinically primarily as liver disease, psychiatric disease, neurological disease, or a combination of these. Neurological disease is a movement disorder with common features of speech abnormalities, tremor, incoordination, and dystonia. The diagnosis of neurologically presenting patients is usually straightforward, as Kayser-Fleischer rings and urinary copper over 100 microg/day are almost always present. Penicillamine should always be avoided in the treatment of neurologically presenting patients because of the high risk of permanent, drug-induced, additional neurological deterioration. Tetrathiomolybdate, a new drug we have developed, in combination with zinc is our first choice to treat these patients for 8-16 weeks. Zinc or trientine is the next best choice when tetrathiomolybdate is not available. [References: 31]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2005,,,0,0,
423,Wilson's disease in seventy-year-old siblings: Raising the diagnostic bar,"Wilson's Disease (WD) usually occurs in the first decade of life, but in rare patients it occurs later. We report the clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment outcomes of two seventy-year-old siblings who were evaluated as part of a research study for the treatment of neurological WD. The index case was a 72-year-old woman with progressive neurological disability who subsequently developed sub-fulminant liver failure. His brother was a 70-year-old man with minimal neurological symptoms and mild depressive disorder. Liver biopsy revealed only adiposity and minimal fibrosis and high hepatic copper content (671 cups/g dry weight liver). Molecular studies demonstrated compound heterozygosity for the disease-specific ATP7B mutations E1064A and H1069Q in both patients. Both individuals were treated with trientine and Zn, followed by Zn maintenance therapy. In the last 5 years, the clinical course has stabilized and improved, although the index case recently died of bronchopneumonia. In conclusion, the advanced age and different clinical presentations of these two subjects with the same ATP7B mutations raise the question of the degree of penetration of these and other ATP7B mutations. Environmental and extragenic factors are the main determinants of the disease phenotype. We suggest that WD should be considered at any age in patients with liver disease, neurological disease, or psychiatric symptoms.",,"Ala, A.;Borjigin, J.;Rochwarger, A.;Schilsky, M.",2005,Mar,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.20601,0,0,

425,Novel D-penicillamine carrying nanoparticles for metal chelation therapy in Alzheimer's and other CNS diseases,"With aging, metal ions accumulate in the brain and various neurodegenerative diseases. Alongside Wilson's disease, a copper storage disease, recent attention has focused on zinc, copper, and iron deposition in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and iron deposition in Parkinson's disease. In particular, it has been suggested that parenchymal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and its interaction with metal ions play a role in the progression of AD. Therefore, the strategy of lowering brain metal ions and targeting the interaction of Abeta peptide with metal ions through the administration of chelators is valuable. Our recent finding that nanoparticle delivery systems can cross the blood-brain barrier led us to investigate whether chelators delivered conjugated to nanoparticles could reverse metal ion-induced protein precipitation. In current studies, the Cu(I) chelator D-penicillamine has been covalently conjugated to nanoparticles via a disulfide bond or a thioether bond. The nanoparticle-chelator conjugates were stable in aqueous suspension at pH 6-8 when stored at 4 degrees C and did not aggregate when challenged with salts and serum. Release of D-penicillamine from nanoparticles was achieved using reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (as a model for glutathione). Nanoparticles processed under reducing conditions that released only conjugated D-penicillamine were able to effectively re-dissolve copper-Abeta (1-42) aggregates. These results suggest that nanoparticles have the potential to deliver D-penicillamine to the brain to prevent Abeta (1-42) accumulation and also to reduce metal ion accumulation in other CNS diseases.",,"Cui, Z.;Lockman, P.

426,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa associated with pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum during treatment of Wilson's disease with penicillamine,"OBJECTIVE: Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a reactive perforating dermatosis characterized by the elimination of abnormal elastic fibers from the upper dermis through the epidermis. In a few cases, it occurs as a side effect of D-penicillamine (DPA) therapy. The first case of EPS induced by DPA was described in 1972 in a patient treated for Wilson's disease. Skin changes resembling pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) were observed in patients subsequently treated with DPA and reported as pseudo-PXE. CASE REPORT: Here we present the clinical, pathological, and ultrastructural study of 2 new cases of DPA-induced EPS and pseudo-PXE. These patients had been treated for Wilson's disease for 14 and 16 years, respectively. Histopathological examination of both EPS and pseudo-PXE skin found characteristic abnormal elastic fibers and was confirmed by an ultrastructural study. There was no ABCC6 mutation. CONCLUSION: Penicillamine can induce diffuse, cutaneous and systemic elastic fiber damage. Our patients present typical features of DPA-induced elastosis, manifesting as EPS and pseudo-PXE. The ABCC6 mutation is associated with PXE and was absent in our pseudo-PXE cases, as expected. This elastopathy has been associated with morphological changes in elastic fibers, in most cases secondary to long-term therapy. DPA may interfere with elastin crosslinking through inhibition of the enzyme lysyl oxidase or the formation of complexes with crosslinked precursors that impair normal maturation of elastic fibers. However, no fatal complication of DPA-induced elastopathy has been reported so far. Improvement in cutaneous lesions is expected after discontinuation of the drug.",,"Becuwe, C.;Dalle, S.;Ronger-Savle, S.;Skowron, F.;Balme, B.;Kanitakis, J.;Thomas, L.",2005,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000081487,0,0,
427,"Protection from spontaneous hepatocellular injury by N-benzyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease.","The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant strain that accumulates excess tissue copper (Cu) and models the clinical symptoms and biological features of Wilson's disease in humans. We compared the effects of three metal chelating agents, N-benzyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (BGD), d-penicillamine (D-PEN) and triethylenetetramine (TETA), on biliary and urinary excretion of Cu using LEC rats. Animals were treated ip with each chelating agent (1 mmol/kg body weight) and then bile and urine samples were collected for 3 hours. Since single treatment with BGD markedly stimulated the biliary excretion of Cu, the protective effect of repeated injection of BGD on spontaneous hepatocellular damage was further studied. Separate groups received two weekly injections of BGD starting at 11 weeks of age and were compared to saline-injected controls. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and bilirubin level were significantly increased at 19 weeks of age in control LEC rats, and histopathological analysis showed extensive liver damage in these rats. However, repeated BGD injections blocked serum ALT and bilirubin elevations and blocked histopathological changes in the liver. Moreover, although Cu accumulated rapidly in the liver, kidney, spleen, and serum of control LEC rats during the test period, repeated BGD injection largely prevented these increases. These results suggest that BGD treatment is effective in blocking excessive Cu accumulation in LEC rats, which provides protection from spontaneous liver injury.",,"Shimada, H.;Takahashi, M.;Shimada, A.;Okawara, T.;Yasutake, A.;Imamura, Y.;Kiyozumi, M.",2005,2001-01-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2004.06.005,0,0,
428,Recent clinical features of Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation,"Background: We performed this study to evaluate the recent clinical features of Wilson's disease (WD) with hepatic presentation, particularly in terms of age, degree of liver damage, and association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Between 1976-2003, 16 patients with liver findings were diagnosed with WD. We divided this period into two periods as “past” and “near period”. Diagnosis was based on the presence of Kayser-Fleisher rings, low serum copper levels, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper concentrations before or after D-penicillamine loading, and increased hepatic copper concentrations. This retrospective study was conducted at Ehime University Hospital. RESULTS: Four patients, including a couple of siblings, had a family history of WD. Four patients had parental consanguinity. While there were 6 patients over the age of 40 in the recent period, there were no patients over the age of 40 in the past. Four patients had neurological findings. Ten patients had cirrhosis of the liver and 5 patients had chronic hepatitis. Two had fatty liver without obesity. All patients in the past had cirrhosis of the liver. HCC was detected during follow-up in three patients with liver cirrhosis. All patients were treated with D-penicillamine or trientine chloride or both. However, four patients had to discontinue these drugs due to side effects. CONCLUSION: Recently, the number of patients diagnosed with WD has been increasing, not only for those with classical type WD, but also for elderly patients or patients with non-cirrhotic liver damage such as fatty liver and chronic hepatitis. The various clinical features of WD should be recognized and particular attention should be focused on HCC as a complication.",,"Kumagi, T.;Horiike, N.;Michitaka, K.;Hasebe, A.;Kawai, K.;Tokumoto, Y.;Nakanishi, S.;Furukawa, S.;Hiasa, Y.;Matsui, H.;Kurose, K.;Matsuura, B.;Onji, M.",2004,Dec,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-004-1466-y,1,1,
429,Value of an enzymatic assay for determination of serum ceruloplasmin,"The serum concentration of the copper protein ceruloplasmin has been an important diagnostic indicator of Wilson's disease (WD). It is widely said that 95% of people with WD have low serum ceruloplasmin concentrations. Available evidence suggests that normal serum ceruloplasmin concentration is more common in patients with WD, particularly those with liver disease, perhaps in part because of the routine use of an immunological test. This assay may show a normal ceruloplasmin level when the enzymatic activity is lower. Enzymatic activity is a biologically relevant parameter. We compared enzymatic evaluation of oxidase activity with immunological measurement in patients with hepatic or neurological symptoms of unknown origin in whom WD is considered in the differential diagnosis. Although a strong correlation was observed between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity in controls, this was not the case in these patients. Twelve patients presenting with various types of liver disease showed a weak correlation between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity. Ten percent (n = 41) of patients with neurological symptoms had low ceruloplasmin concentrations and oxidase activity, and the other 8% had normal ceruloplasmin concentrations associated with low oxidase activity. Although the enzymatic method is preferred due to its biological importance, ceruloplasmin analysis is not a reliable diagnostic parameter for the diagnosis of WD in patients with liver disease. An important use of the ceruloplasmin oxidase test is in the follow-up of patients with WD. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity could not be detected in sera from WD patients receiving long-term chelation therapy, suggesting that an early sign of copper depletion and subsequent copper deficiency symptoms should be monitored.",,"Macintyre, G.;Gutfreund, K.

431,Copper inhibits water and glycerol permeability of aquaporin-3.,"Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is an aquaglyceroporin expressed in erythrocytes and some other tissues. Erythrocytes, along with the kidney and liver, are the main targets of copper toxicity. Here we report that both water and glycerol permeability of human AQP3 are inhibited by copper. Inhibition is rapid, dose-dependent and reversible. If copper was dissolved in the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer, the natural buffer system in our body caused significant inhibition at doses in the range of those observed in Wilson's disease and copper poisoning. Another aquaglyceroporin, AQP7, was insensitive to copper. Three extracellular amino acid residues, Trp128, Ser152 and His241, were identified as responsible for copper's effect on AQP3. We have previously shown that Ser152 is involved in the pH regulation of AQP3. The fact that Ser152 mediates the regulation of AQP3 by copper may explain the phenomenon of sensitization of human erythrocytes to copper at acidic pH. When AQP3 was co-expressed with another AQP, only glycerol, not water permeability, was inhibited by copper. Our results provide a better understanding of the processes that occur in severe copper metabolism disorders such as Wilson's disease and copper poisoning.",,"Zelenina, M.;Tritto, S.;Bondar, A.

We hypothesized that the mitochondria are the main target of copper-induced cytotoxicity in Wilson's disease. We used the human hepatoma array Hep G2 to examine copper-mediated cytotoxicity, and three different methods to assess organelle damage: MTT assay (mitochondria), neutral red (NR; lysosomes), and Trypan blue exclusion assay (TB; plasma membrane). For all experiments, cells at approximately 60% confluent in microtiter plates were incubated with CuCl(2) (concentration range: 50-100-150-200 microM) for 24 or 48 hours. Results were expressed as a percentage of untreated control.

439,Molecular screening of the ZFHX1B gene in prenatally diagnosed isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum,"AIM: Corpus callosum (ACC) agenesis is the most common malformation of the central nervous system and may be associated with mental retardation. ACC is found in 40% of cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a polytopic embryonic defect with a marked facial gestalt, severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and postnatal microcephaly as fixed features. Other symptoms include Hirschsprung's disease, heart defects, kidney abnormalities, and hypospadias. Among this broad spectrum of malformations recently associated with haploinsufficiency of the zinc finger homeobox 1B gene (ZFHX1B), ACC may therefore be the only feature to be detected prenatally. Therefore, we examined a group of 18 fetuses terminated for ACC and performed mutational analysis of the ZFHX1B gene in six selected cases. METHODS: Diagnosis of ACC agenesis was made by prenatal echography screening. Screening for ZFHX1B deletions was performed by studies of poly(CA) microsatellite markers and real-time semi-quantitative PCR. Mutation analysis was performed by single chain conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). RESULTS: No deletion or mutation involving the ZFHX1B locus was detected in any of the six fetuses analyzed. CONCLUSION: ZFHX1B is not a major gene in isolated ACC.

440,Evaluation of plasma D-penicillamine redox status by laser-induced fluorescence and capillary electrophoresis,"D-Penicillamine (D-Pen) is a thiol drug used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, metal intoxication and cystinuria. We recently described a new capillary electrophoresis (CE) method to quantify physiological thiols in which separation of total plasma homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, glutathione is achieved using the organic base N-methyl-D-glucamine in working buffer. In this paper, we present an improvement of our method that provides a fundamental separation of total plasma D-Pen from physiological thiols. Also, reduced, free, and protein-bound forms of the drug are measured by changing the order of disulfide reduction with tributylphosphine and the order of protein precipitation with 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). After derivatization with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF), samples are separated and quantified by laser-induced fluorescence by capillary electrophoresis in an uncoated fused silica capillary (57 x 75 micromid) using a phosphate/borate run buffer pH 11.4. The migration time of the D-Pen in these conditions is approximately 7 minutes and the time required for each analysis is roughly 10 minutes. The proposed method was used to measure various forms of the drug in a Wilson's disease patient administered the D-Pen.",,"Zinellu, A.;Carru, C.;Sotgia, S.;Deiana, L.",2004,2025-04-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.01.002,0,0,
441,"Zinc for prostate disease and other conditions: little evidence, a lot of excitement and a major potential issue","Dietary and supplemental zinc, especially in excess, has received a lot of attention in numerous alternative medicine sources. There is little medical evidence that zinc can alleviate some mostly rare medical conditions (such as Wilson's disease). However, in prostate conditions such as BPH, high concentrations of zinc are found in the prostate gland. Excessive zinc intake, particularly with individual supplements, has the potential to promote the growth of prostate conditions from BPH to cancer. In fact, one large study found that men who consumed large amounts of these supplements had a significantly higher risk of advanced prostate cancer. In large doses, zinc can block the benefits of bisphosphonate medications, increase testosterone levels, increase cholesterol, reduce ""good cholesterol"" or HDL levels, and promote immune dysfunction. More research is needed in this area, but in the meantime, the time seems ripe for most individuals to discourage or immediately stop the intake of higher concentrations of zinc until adequate research resolves this controversial issue.

443,Atypical childhood Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with a hepatic or neurological presentation. Hepatic presentation is more common in young children. Neurological Wilson's disease often presents as a movement disorder with dystonia, tremor, and dysarthria. Psychiatric or behavioral symptoms may also be a feature of Wilson's disease. We describe an atypical neurologic presentation in a prepubertal child with minimal hepatic involvement; Transient hemiparesis and encephalopathy were predominant in her first neurological presentation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive cortical and subcortical signal changes in addition to the classic basal ganglia signal abnormality observed in Wilson's disease. He was treated with oral tetrathiomolybdate anticancer therapy followed by zinc maintenance. His clinical condition and brain imaging improved significantly 1 year after the start of treatment. Neurological Wilson's disease may have different presentations and should be considered in children presenting with cortical features and signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging.",,"Carlson, M.

444,Review article: Diagnosis and current treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that results in liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric disease. Neurological disease is easy to diagnose if the following symptoms are present: Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms, and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. The diagnosis is more complicated in patients presenting with liver diseases. None of the commonly used parameters alone allow for a definitive diagnosis. A combination of several laboratory parameters is necessary to definitively establish the diagnosis. In the future, limited mutation analysis may play an important diagnostic role. Recently, a group of international experts has proposed a score based on various tests and clinical symptoms. The validity of this score should be evaluated prospectively. Treatment requires life-long administration of copper chelators (d-penicillamine, trientine). A frequently used alternative is zinc. None of these treatments have been tested in prospective randomized controlled trials. Liver transplantation is reserved for severe or treatment-refractory cases with advanced liver disease, whereas experience with resistant neuropsychiatric disease is limited.

The authors of this study discuss various aspects of fertility in 16 women with WD. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from a large cohort of WD followed in a tertiary care center. RESULTS: Sixteen patients became pregnant in 59 cases with 30 successful pregnancies, 24 spontaneous abortions, 2 medical abortions, and 3 stillbirths. Six patients were already on treatment, while 10 presymptomatic patients were diagnosed with WD after conception. Of these 16 patients, 9 had a history of spontaneous abortion and 12 had successful pregnancies. None of the clinical features of WD changed with or without treatment during pregnancy. All 30 babies were born on time and born healthy. CONCLUSION: Recurrent miscarriages are common, especially in women with untreated Wilson's disease. However, successful pregnancies and uneventful full-term delivery can occur in treated mothers with WD and in undiagnosed, undetected presymptomatic patients. Pregnancy does not appear to have an adverse effect on the clinical course of Wilson's disease.

446,The nucleotide-binding domain of the Zn2+-bearing P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli carries a glycine motif that may be involved in ATP binding.,"In P-type ATPases, the nucleotide binding (N) domain is located in the middle of the sequence that folds into the phosphorylation (P) domain. The N domain of ZntA, a Zn2+ translocated P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli, is approx. 13% identical to the N domain of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. None of the Ca2+-ATPase residues involved in binding ATP are found in ZntA. However, the G503SGIEAQV sequence in the N domain of ZntA is similar to the GxGxxG motif, which forms part of the ATP binding site in protein kinases. This motif is also found in the Wilson disease protein, in which several disease mutations cluster. In the current study, we made a series of disease mutation analogues of ZntA, including mutants of G503S (Gly503-->Ser), G505R and A508F. At low [ATP], these mutant ATPases are weakly phosphorylated. However, the phosphorylation defect of G503S and G505R mutants can be partially (G503S) or fully (G505R) compensated using a higher [ATP]; this suggests that these mutations reduce affinity for ATP. In all three mutant ATPases, phosphorylation by P(i) became less sensitive to the presence of ATP, consistent with the suggestion that the Gly503 motif plays a role in ATP binding. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the N domain of ZntA using the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase structure as a template. In the model, residues Glu470 and His475, as well as the Gly503 motif, are located near the ATP-binding site. In conclusion, the mutagenesis data and molecular model are consistent with the idea that two loops carrying residues Glu470, His475, Gly503 and Gly505 are involved in ATP binding and activation.",,"Okkeri, J.;Laakkonen, L.;Haltia, T.",2004,2001-01-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BJ20030740,0,0,
447,Results of treatment for Wilson's disease – our own observations,"BACKGROUND: Causal treatment of genetically determined Wilson's disease (WD) has so far been impossible, but gene therapy may become a reality in the future. Today, the principle of treatment is the elimination of excess copper, which is easily mobilized and bound by chelating agents, the most important of which is d-penicillamine, via the kidneys. In addition, it is possible to block intestinal absorption of copper by administration of zinc preparations that induce hepatic metallothionein synthesis. The purpose of our study was to present our own observations and treatment results of Wilson's disease. MATERIALS/METHODS: We observed 33 patients aged 13-60 years (mean age 27 years) with various forms of WD over the past 16 years. The study group consisted of 11 women and 21 men who applied to the hospital with various diagnoses or applied to the Hepatology Private Polyclinic. In addition to standard laboratory tests, ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper levels, and activities of some liver enzymes, proteins and HBV/HCV infection markers were determined. The patients were also examined by a neurologist and an ophthalmologist and, if necessary, a psychiatric consultation was made. Considering the general clinical picture, the patients were divided into the following groups according to the form of the disease: fulminant, acute, hepatic, with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, hepatic, neuropsychiatric, asymptomatic. RESULTS: All patients were initially treated with d-penicillamine. No side effects were observed in most of them. The treatment was continued according to the level of copper excreted in the urine (maximum 10 years). After achieving clinical improvement with reduced 24-hour urinary copper excretion, we reduced d-penicillamine doses by administering zinc preparations and even discontinued the drug. Zinc preparations were used during the treatment in asymptomatic carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of chelation therapy is associated with good prognosis in both hepatic and neurologic forms of WD. Zinc preparations are effective and safe in neurological and oligosymptomatic forms of the disease.",,"Jablonska-Kaszewska, I.;Drobinska-Jurowiecka, A.;Dabrowska, E.;Trocha, H.",2003,Aug,,0,1,
448,Treatment of Wilson's disease,"Based on the literature review and our own experience, we presented the treatment modality of Wilson's disease. While gene therapy may become a reality in the future, causal cure has been impossible until now. The current treatment principle is to remove excess copper, which is easily mobilized, by chelating agents or by blocking the intestinal absorption of copper. The most important is chelation therapy, which aims to mobilize copper from the affected organs and promote its excretion with urine or feces. The main chelating agent is d-penicillamine, which is quite effective but without some side effects. Alternative chelating agents such as trientine and tetrathiomolybdate have also been used successfully. Zinc salts also have therapeutic value. They promote copper excretion by inducing metallothionein synthesis in the gut, thereby blocking copper absorption from the gut. Zinc salts have almost no side effects. They cannot be used as initial therapy, but are very effective for maintenance therapy. Chelation therapy is ineffective in patients with encephalopathy and hemolysis, as well as acute liver failure. In these cases, a liver transplant is the only hope for survival. Liver transplantation in patients with predominant psychoneurological symptoms is open to discussion.",,"Jablonska-Kaszewska, I.;Dabrowska, E.;Drobinska Jurowiecka, A.;Falkiewicz, B.",2003,Aug,,0,0,
449,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVIII. Initial treatment of presentation of hepatic decompensation with trientine and zinc,"We treated 9 patients presenting with hepatic decompensation due to Wilson's disease with a combination of trientine and zinc for at least 4 months, and then switched to zinc maintenance therapy. All of these patients had hypoalbuminemia, all but 1 had hyperbilirubinemia, and 7 had ascites. All of these patients could be candidates for liver transplantation based on their initial Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. The minimum listing criterion for transplant candidates is a score greater than 7. Eight of the 9 patients had a CTP score of 10 or higher. Another scoring system used to determine the need for transplantation in Wilson's disease is Nazer's prognostic index; where a score above 6 indicates that the patient is unlikely to survive without a transplant if treated with penicillamine. Nazer scores of our two patients were above 6. With our medical treatment, 9 of these patients regained their normal liver functions as their CTP scores were normalized to 5. One of our 9 patients was started due to concomitant neurological disease. were randomized to receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and zinc in a neurological protocol and after 2 weeks of trientine/zinc treatment incidentally. This patient's liver function improved much faster than that of the other 8 patients, all treated with trientine/zinc, suggesting that TM therapy offers another advantage. In summary, we were able to recruit 9 patients presenting with hepatic failure—8 patients with CTP scores indicating potential liver transplant need and 2 with Nazer prognostic scores indicating that they are unlikely to survive when treated with penicillamine alone. - and treat them all medically, 9. With improvement in all, we believe that trientine/zinc combination therapy should be the standard for initial treatment of liver failure in Wilson's disease because its efficacy is equal to or slightly superior to that of penicillamine and the incidence of a side effects is much lower. In addition, TM warrants work to determine whether treatment for hepatic Wilson's disease can be further developed.",,"Askari, F. K.;Greenson, J.;Dick, R. D.;Johnson, V. D.;Brewer, G.

Clinical trials of orally administered iron chelators, both as monotherapy and in combination with deferoxamine, are ongoing worldwide. Several new chelators are being introduced in clinical trials. Future treatments for iron overload may consist of oral iron-binding agents that can prevent the absorption of dietary iron from the diet. Characterization of specific iron transporters, such as the divalent metallic transporter and ferroportin, may hold promise for the development of 'smart' compounds that can block iron transport. Several new agents are currently available for the treatment of Wilson's disease, including trientine, zinc, and tetrathiomolybdate.

The mean (SD) delay to diagnosis was 5.9 (+/-5.7) years. Five patients diagnosed in the advanced stage of the disease died before starting treatment. Eighteen patients were followed up and treated with D-penicillamine alone or in combination with zinc sulfate. Treatment improved most of the neurological symptoms. Dystonic postures, behavioral disturbances, and dysarthria were the most resistant neurological manifestations. 'Pseudo-sclerotic' neurologic involvement predicted a good outcome, whereas hepatic-onset and 'classic' neurologic involvement was associated with a worse prognosis.

In patients with Wilson's disease, the reduced glutathione concentration was lower than in patients with viral hepatitis and as high as in subjects with alcoholic liver injury. The cysteine level was significantly lower than in the control groups, and the percentage of oxidized glutathione/total glutathione was higher than in viral or alcoholic disease. Malondialdehyde levels were low, but when patients treated with zinc and penicillamine were taken separately, only the former had low malondialdehyde levels. Zinc-treated patients had higher concentrations of reduced glutathione and a lower percentage of oxidized glutathione. In summary, patients with Wilson's disease have glutathione depression associated with low levels of reduced glutathione and cysteine and high concentrations of oxidized glutathione: this is prevented by the administration of zinc, which inhibits lipid peroxidation and increases glutathione availability.",,"Farinati, F.;Cardin, R.;D'Inca, R.;Naccarato, R.;Sturniolo, G.

463,Antiangiogenic therapy via copper chelation,"When evaluating new compounds for use in clinical trials involving antiangiogenic therapies, two important factors must be considered. Regardless of clinical efficacy, the potential drug should be cost-effective and have reasonable ease of manufacture. Compound endostatin (Entrmed, Inc.) has recently completed two Phase I trials with minimal toxicity for treated patients [1,2]. However, due to the difficulty and expense of producing large quantities of recombinant protein, Entrmed Inc. ran into financial difficulties [3]. As the fate of this company shows, a drug must not only be clinically effective, but also have a reasonable economy of manufacture. Another interesting component of compound development is selectivity. Highly selective antiangiogenic compounds, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU-5416, are being replaced by less selective compounds such as SU-6668, which act on a broader spectrum of tyrosine kinase receptors [4]. This move to use less selective antiangiogenic compounds is based on preclinical models that exhibit both better clinical efficacy when using less specific molecules and lower response rates from more selective compounds. To further examine broad-acting antiangiogenic agents, the authors are currently evaluating new classes of agents that preferentially bind copper and inhibit angiogenesis. Copper has been known to be an important target for antiangiogenic therapy for several years [5]. Recently, target enzymes using copper as cofactor have been elucidated using molecular techniques. This review will describe the historical use of anticancer therapy for the treatment of Wilson's disease and evaluate some of the newer anticancer compounds currently being evaluated for use in antiangiogenic therapy.

Because of its rapid action, potency and safety, TM proves to be a very effective drug for the initial treatment of acutely ill Wilson's disease patients. Beyond that, TM has antiangiogenic effects because many proangiogenic cytokines require normal copper levels. This has led to the use of TM in cancer, where it is generally effective in animal tumor models and has shown efficacy in preliminary clinical studies.

In presymptomatic patients, the diagnosis was made by a combination of direct mutation analysis and haplotype analysis with 3 short tandem repeat markers. Presymptomatic patients were treated with 50 mg elemental zinc sulfate twice daily from the moment of molecular diagnosis and followed for 3 to 5 years. RESULTS: 17 of 78 siblings were diagnosed as presymptomatic patients. Of the 17 presymptomatic patients, 7 had no Kayser-Fleischer rings and 4 were pale. The gradual increase in serum ceruloplasmin values and the gradual decrease in 24-hour urine copper values during zinc therapy indicate effective control of copper metabolism.

Copper-containing serum ceruloplasmin is best determined by measuring oxidase activity, since the immunonephelometric method measures both ceruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo-form. The diagnosis can be confirmed by increased urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient should be screened, and where suspicion persists, a search for the Wilson gene on chromosome 13q14.3 can be used. Life-long follow-up studies are best conducted in a specialist centre. Compliance with chelating therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by determining serum 'free' copper that should be maintained at or near 1.6 micromol/L (10 microg/100 mL). The side effects of treatment are detected by estimation of urinary total protein, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, coagulation factors and liver function tests.

469,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate: III. Initial therapy and follow-up with zinc therapy in a total of 55 neurologically affected patients.,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear which anticopper drug to use in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms, because penicillamine often worsens them neurologically and zinc acts slowly. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of neurological deterioration and drug side effects with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. DESIGN: Open-label study of 55 untreated (22 recent) patients with neurological Wilson's disease treated with tetrathiomolybdate ranging from 120 to 410 mg/day for 8 weeks, followed by 3 years. Neurological function was assessed with scored neurological and speech tests. SETTING: A university hospital referral setting. PATIENTS: All patients with untreated, newly diagnosed neurological Wilson's disease. INTERVENTION: Treatment with tetrathiomolybdate. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by neurological and speech examinations. Drug side effects were evaluated by complete blood cell count and biochemical measurements. RESULTS: Only 2 (4%) of 55 patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate showed neurologic deterioration, an estimated 50% of patients treated with penicillamine. Five of the 22 new patients had bone marrow suppression and 3 had elevations of aminotransferases. These numbers are higher than the original 33 patients and appear to be mainly due to the faster dose escalation. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate shows excellent efficacy in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms. With rapid escalation of the dose, adverse effects from bone marrow suppression or elevations of aminotransferases may occur.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hedera, P.;Kluin, K. J.;Carlson, M.;Askari, F.;Dick, R.

If left untreated, hepatitis results in neurological complications and death. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats have a mutation homologous to Wilson's disease and thus provide an animal model. Liver lysosomes from LEC rats treated with tetrathiomolybdate were isolated and analyzed by Cu and Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The lysosomes contained a Cu-Mo-S cluster in which Mo was coordinated with four sulfur at 2.24 A and about three copper neighbors at 2.70 A. Each Cu was coordinated with 3-4 sulfur at 2.28 A and approximately one Mo neighbor A at 2.70.

No gender differences or correlations were found between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results in patients with Wilson's disease. It is suggested that the significantly elevated plasma nociceptin level is due to inhibition of Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, endopeptidase 24.15) that inactivates nociceptin by toxic copper levels, since replacement of the central Zn atom to Cu is known to result in an approximate outcome. 50% inhibition in the activity of these enzymes.

472,"Transport and detoxification systems for transition metals, heavy metals and metalloids in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes.","Transition metals, heavy metals and metalloids are often toxic in excess, but some transition metals are essential trace elements. All cells have mechanisms for metal ion homeostasis that often involve a balance between uptake and outflow systems. This review will briefly describe ATP-coupled resistance pumps. ZntA and CadA are bacterial P-type ATPases that confer resistance to Zn(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II). Homologous copper pumps include Menkes and Wilson disease proteins and CopA, an Escherichia coli pump that confers resistance to Cu(I). There are several different families of carriers for resistance to arsenic and antimony. In E. coli, ArsAB ATPase is a new system that confers resistance to As(III) and Sb(III). Eukaryotic arsenic resistance carriers include Acr3p and Ycf1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These systems provide resistance to arsenite [As(III)]. Arsenate [As(V)] detoxification involves the reduction of As(V) to As(III), a process catalyzed by arsenate reductase enzymes. There are three families of arsenate reductases, two are found in bacterial systems and the third is identified in S. cerevisiae. [References: 43]",,"Rosen, B. P.",2002,Nov,,0,0,
473,Molecular mechanism of copper transport in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a putative copper-bearing P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose dysfunction causes toxic copper accumulation in the liver and brain, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms accompanying this disease. The cytosolic N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kDa) of this ATPase contains six heavy metal-associated domains, each containing the conserved metal binding motif GMTCXXC. The N-terminal domain (Wilson disease copper binding domain [WCBD]) has been expressed, purified and characterized using a variety of techniques. WCBD binds six copper atoms in the +1 oxidation state competitively and with greater affinity than any other metal. The copper atom is coordinated by two cysteines in a warped linear geometry. Copper cooperatively binds WCBD and causes secondary and tertiary conformational changes. Binding of zinc to WCBD has also been characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and shown to produce conformational changes completely different from those induced by copper. The phosphorylation/nucleotide binding domain of ATP7B has also been expressed and characterized and shown to be able to bind ATP but lack ATPase activity. A peptide corresponding to the sixth transmembrane domain of ATP7B was constructed and shown to undergo secondary conformational changes upon attachment of a single copper atom. Finally, a chimeric protein composed of truncated ZntA, a zinc-carrying ATPase lacking WCBD and N-terminal domain, was constructed and analyzed for metal ion selectivity. These results suggest that the nucleus determines the metal ion specificity of P-type ATPases and that the N-terminal metal binding domain may play a regulatory role.

474,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD), an inborn error of copper (Cu) metabolism, is currently one of the leading liver diseases in children in India. The clinical presentation can be extremely diverse, ie all forms of acute and chronic liver disease, minimal to severe neurological disease, psychiatric problems, bone deformities, hemolytic anemia, and endocrine manifestations. A high index of suspicion combined with a reasonable array of investigations is required for diagnosis. Hepatic copper estimation is the most reliable test but not readily available in India. Liver biopsy may not be possible due to bleeding problems, and histologic features are often not diagnostic for WD. In the absence of hepatic Cu, low ceruloplasmin, high 24-hour urinary copper, and the presence of CF rings help the diagnosis. The mainstay of initial therapy is Cu-chelators such as D-Penicillamine and Trientine to reduce body copper to sub-toxic levels. Subsequent maintenance therapy is necessarily lifelong with D-Penicillamine, Trientine or Zinc. Children receiving treatment should be monitored regularly for response, side effects, compliance and rehabilitation. The response to treatment may be unpredictable, but acute and early admissions such as fulminant hepatic failure have poor outcomes. All siblings should be screened for WD because early diagnosis and treatment give good results. The identification of the WD gene on the 13th chromosome has led to the possible use of molecular genetics (haplotype and mutation analysis) in the diagnosis of WD. Parent groups/associations should take an active role in the holistic management of WD. [References: 35]",,"Pandit, A.;Bavdekar, A.;Bhave, S.",2002,Sep,,0,0,

477,Zinc inhibits nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and protects cultured human neurons from copper-induced neurotoxicity.,"It has been previously shown that high concentrations of the trace metal zinc (Zn) provide temporary protection of cells from apoptotic death. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this protection are unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the ability of Zn to protect human neurons in culture (NT2-N) from Cu-mediated death and tested the hypotheses that the tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a role in and is part of Cu-induced neuron death. Zn protection mechanism. Copper toxicity (100 microM) resulted in significant apoptotic neuron death at 12 hours. Addition of 100 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells increased neuronal death. However, the addition of 700 μM Zn to Cu-treated cells resulted in neuronal viability that was not different from untreated controls for 24 h. While the abundance of p53 mRNA increased with the addition of Cu and 100 μM Zn, it was reduced to 50% of the control with the addition of 500 μM Zn and to 10% of the control with 700 μM Zn in Cu-treated cells. Consistent with its role as a transcription factor, both Western analysis and immunocytochemistry showed significant increases in nuclear p53 protein levels in Cu toxicity. The role of p53 in Cu-mediated apoptosis was further confirmed by abolishing apoptosis in Cu-treated cells transfected with a dominant-negative p53 construct to prevent p53 expression. Furthermore, the addition of 500-700 μM Zn inhibited the movement of p53 to the nucleus; This suggests that Zn protects neurons from Cu toxicity by regulating p53 mRNA abundance, while simultaneously preventing p53 translocation to the nucleus.",,"VanLandingham, J.

Specifically, the relative roles of penicillamine, trientene and tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of the symptomatic patient with WD remain to be defined. Zinc monotherapy for maintenance and treatment of asymptomatic patients with WD is still controversial.

The NH(2)-terminal domain (about 70 kDa) containing six copies of the heavy metal-associated repeat GMT/HCXXC can also bind zinc. We used circular dichroism (CD) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize zinc binding to the NH(2)-terminal metal binding site. These studies revealed that zinc can bind to this domain with a stoichiometry of 6:1 and causes conformational changes in the NH(2)-terminal domain upon binding. These conformational changes are completely different from those previously observed for copper binding to the domain and lead to the overall loss of secondary structure in the domain. XAS spectra show that zinc is mainly bound by nitrogen atoms and therefore has low affinity for the heavy metal-associated repeats shown to bind to copper.

Clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease (WD) include chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, or neuropsychiatric disorders. Early detection is crucial, as powerful medical treatments are now available to prevent symptoms from becoming ineffective. To illustrate the clinical course and genetic findings, a male patient with a novel mutation in the ATP7B gene, a 10 base pair insertion in exon 6 (1927ins 10) and a second missense mutation in exon 13 (P992L) is reported. The patient was admitted at the age of 10 with symptoms of chronic liver disease. Clinical findings included hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. A combination therapy with the copper chelating agent D-penicillamine and zinc acetate was initiated and resulted in normalization of liver function and absence of neurological signs or Kayser-Fleischer ring after 7 years of follow-up. Trimming mutations (additions, deletions, nonsense mutations) of the ATP7B gene leading to substantial loss of the C-terminal portions of the protein, thus possibly completely destroying protein function, may be associated with a hepatic phenotype and early onset as seen in the presented patient. .",,"Seidel, J.;Caca, K.;Schwab, S.

491,Quercetin cumulatively enhances copper induction of metallothionein in intestinal cells.,"Wilson's disease, a genetic condition of copper overload, is currently treated with zinc because of zinc's ability to induce metallothionein. We are interested in nonmetal chemicals that may alter intestinal copper metabolism and thus help alleviate copper toxicity. We have previously shown that quercetin, a dietary flavonoid, can chelate copper. This study also examined the interaction of quercetin and copper in intestinal epithelial cells. We found that quercetin increased the induction of metallothoine by copper and the effect was dose dependent. Quercetin also showed a cumulative effect after repeated exposure. Repeated low-dose (3-10 microM) treatment of cells with quercetin can produce the same effect on metallothoinein as a higher concentration treatment (100 microM). This property of quercetin differs from its chemical interaction with copper, but both can contribute to the reduction of copper toxicity. Among the other flavonoids tested, two other copper chelators, catechin and rutin, did not increase copper induction of metallothionein, while genistein, an isoflavone that did not chemically interact with copper, increased copper induction of metallothionein. Quercetin's effect on copper metabolism is unique. Quercetin reduced zinc-induced metallothionein expression and metallothionein had no effect on cadmium induction. The clinical application of our observation should be explored.",,"Kuo, S. M.;Huang, C. T.;Blum, P.;Chang, C.",2001,Winter,https://dx.doi.org/10.1385/BTER:84:1-3:001,0,0,

493,Iron accumulation in the liver of male patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: There is accumulating evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. The genetic defect, aceruloplasminemia, can lead to tissue deposition of iron, as in hemochromatosis.

METHODS: Four male patients with Wilson's disease were included in this study, in which iron metabolism was examined before and after treatment. RESULTS: All four male patients examined for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease had elevated hepatic copper content before treatment. Genetic analysis supported the clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease without a history of hemochromatosis. Pre-treatment serum ceruloplasmin levels were <20 mg/dl in all four patients. A standard treatment of 3-8.5 years of penicillamine further reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels. Post-treatment serum ferroxidase activity was as low as serum ceruloplasmin protein. The copper content in the liver decreased in all subjects after treatment. In contrast, non-heme iron in the liver increased during treatment. Pre-treatment liver samples were positive for histochemical iron in two patients and post-treatment samples were positive in all four patients. In two patients, serum aminotransferase levels returned with elevation of serum ferritin concentration during the treatment period. Subsequently, iron reduction by phlebotomy ameliorated biochemical liver injuries. CONCLUSION: Iron overload due to hypoceruloplasminemia may be clinically important, especially in male patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Shiono, Y.;Wakusawa, S.;Hayashi, H.;Takikawa, T.;Yano, M.;Okada, T.;Mabuchi, H.;Kono, S.;Miyajima, H.",2001,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.05269.x,0,0,

Dithiomolybdate and trithiomolybdate, which extensively contaminate the TTM, inhibited copper ATPases with similar potency. Inhibition is reversible with copper or silver, suggesting inhibition by substrate binding. These findings allowed for the first time an estimate of the high affinity of CopB for copper and silver.

495,Personality traits determined by Karolinska Personality Scales (CSP) in treated Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to elucidate the personality traits of treated patients with Wilson's disease (WD) compared to healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-five WD patients, ten women and 15 men, with a mean age of 35.2 +/- 8.3 years completed the Karolinska Personality Scales (CSP), a self-report inventory consisting of 15 separate scales. Results were compared with a control series of 200 men and 200 women from the general population. RESULTS: Patients with treated WD scored significantly lower on aggression-hostility-related scales and on the scale measuring Psychic Anxiety than healthy controls. Patients with predominantly hepatic symptoms had the lowest aggression-related scores, and patients with predominantly neurological symptoms had the lowest Irritability, Guilt, and Disengagement scores and the highest Impulsivity and Muscle Tension scores. Both groups scored low on the Somatic Anxiety scale. CONCLUSION: The present results show that treated WD patients have significant deviations in personality traits, particularly in aggression-hostility scales and Psychic Anxiety, when investigated through a self-report inventory, CSP, compared to healthy controls. The deviations were not related to age, age of onset, or duration of disease.",,"Portala, K.;Westermark, K.;Ekselius, L.;von Knorring, L.",2001,Sep,,0,0,
496,Zinc acetate for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Zinc acetate (Galzin, Gate Pharmaceutical Co.) was developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease, an inherited disease of copper accumulation and copper toxicity in the brain and liver. Zinc acetate is approved by the US FDA for the maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Wilson's disease, but is also effective from the outset in the treatment of pregnant patients and presymptomatic patients. It also has value as adjunctive therapy for the initial treatment of symptomatic patients. Zinc's mechanism of action includes the induction of intestinal cell metallothionein (Mt), which inhibits copper absorption from the intestinal tract. A negative copper balance is caused not only by inhibition of the absorption of food copper, but also by inhibition of the reabsorption of significant amounts of endogenously secreted copper in saliva, gastric juice and intestinal secretions. Zinc, like other copper inhibitors, is completely effective in controlling copper levels and toxicity in Wilson's disease. Zinc's biggest advantage over other copper inhibitors is its extremely low toxicity level. The only side effect is some degree of initial stomach irritation in about 10% of patients, which usually subsides and becomes insignificant over time. As with all long-term therapy, compliance is a problem in some patients and requires regular monitoring with 24-hour urinary copper and zinc measurements. As with all anticancer treatments, over-treatment and induction of copper deficiency can occur over a long period of time. Since copper is necessary for growth, it should be avoided, especially in children. [References: 30]",,"Brewer, G. J.",2001,Sep,https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/14656566.2.9.1473,0,0,

498,"Functional analysis of chimeric proteins of Wilson Cu(I)-ATPase (ATP7B) and ZntA, a Pb(II)/Zn(II)/Cd(II)-ATPase from Escherichia coli","ATP7B, the Wilson disease-associated Cu(I) transporter and ZntA from Escherichia coli are soft metal P1-type ATPases with mutually exclusive metal ion substrates. P1-type ATPases have a distinctive amino-terminal domain containing the conserved metal-binding motif GXXCXXC. ZntA has one copy of this motif, while ATP7B has six copies. The effect of substitution of amino-terminal domains of ATP7B and ZntA was investigated. Chimeric proteins were constructed in which the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B or just the sixth metal-binding motif replaced the amino-terminal domain of ZntA. Both chimeras showed resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts but not to copper salts. The purified chimeras exhibited activity with the substrates of ZntA, lead, cadmium, zinc and mercury. There was no activity with copper or silver, which are substrates of ATP7B. Chimeras were 2-3 times less active than ZntA. Therefore, the amino-terminal domain of P1-type ATPases cannot change the metal specificity determined by the transmembrane segment. Furthermore, these results show that this domain interacts with the rest of the carrier in a metal ion-specific manner; The amino-terminal domain of ATP7B cannot replace that of ZntA in restoring full catalytic activity.",,"Hou, Z.

500,Ultrastructural identification of iron and copper deposition in the liver of a male patient with Wilson's disease.,"There is accumulating evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. Decreased ferroxidase activity due to ceruloplasmin deficiency may cause iron accumulation in various organs as a result of impaired iron transport. A 37-year-old male patient presented with intention tremors in his right hand. Liver function tests were almost normal, but the parameters of trace elements were abnormal: hypocupremia, hypoceruloplaminemia, and hyperferritinemia. Abdominal imaging showed an increased density cirrhotic liver. The diagnosis of the neurological form of Wilson's disease was confirmed by copper deposits in the liver taken by a blind biopsy, and the patient was diagnosed as compound heterozygous for the ATP7B mutations. He was treated with 2500 mg/day trientine hydrochloride per os. The second examination was performed after 20 months of treatment. Treatment also reduced the serum ceruloplasmin level from 8.9 to less than 4.0 mg/dl. During treatment, serum ferroxidase activity was as low as 70 U/l. Post-treatment liver histology was negative for copper but remained positive for iron. Copper X-rays from hepatocyte lysosomes were no longer detected, but iron was still very high after X-ray treatment. Thus, microanalysis confirmed compound overload of copper and iron in this male patient with Wilson's disease.",,"Shiono, Y.;Hayashi, H.;Wakusawa, S.;Yano, M.",2001,Mar,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0079510340054,0,0,

First, it highlights the importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentations of potentially lethal recessive features for which therapy is available. Second, it demonstrates that even in a monogenic disorder such as WD, the phenotype cannot be simply predicted from the mutated genotype; this patient had a relatively late-onset form of WD despite being homozygous for a genetic lesion that resulted in a marked complete loss of function of the WD copper transporter.",,"Prella, M.;Baccala, R.;Horisberger, J.

503,Copper control as antiangiogenic anticancer therapy: lessons learned from the treatment of Wilson's disease,"The search for new anticopper drugs for Wilson's disease results in two excellent new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for initial therapy. Both are effective and non-toxic. TM is a very powerful, fast-acting new anticancer drug, and its properties may be beneficial beyond Wilson's disease. Angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth) is required for tumor growth, and adequate levels of copper appear to be required for angiogenesis. We hypothesize that there is a ""window"" in which the level of copper can be reduced, which inhibits angiogenesis in tumors but does not interfere with the vital cellular functions of copper. This approach using TM therapy has worked to slow or stabilize tumor growth in various animal tumor models, and preliminary results are also very encouraging in human patients with various advanced and metastatic malignancies. It has been hypothesized that copper availability plays a fundamental role in growth regulation throughout evolution and that this is why so many angiogenic promoters appear to be dependent on copper levels.

504,Is Parkinson's disease a heterozygous form of Wilson's disease: PD = 1/2 WD?,"Wilson's disease (WD) patients often present with Parkinson's disease (PD). Also, most patients with PD have decreased ceruloplasmin, a hallmark of Wilson's disease. WD is an autosomal recessive disease that affects 1 in 1000 people (requires two faulty copies of a gene to produce a homozygous individual). However, the number of people with one wrong copy (heterozygous) is much higher, probably about 2% of the population. I assume that many heterozygotes for WD are at greatly increased risk for idiopathic PD, because these people accumulate free copper in the basal ganglia at a slower rate than homozygotes, which explains the fact that PD usually develops after age 40. . In WD, ceruloplasmin deficiency occurs in the liver, brain, kidneys, etc. results in the accumulation of free Cu. Excess Cu results in impaired Zn absorption, which would explain the low Zn levels in the brains of PD patients. Moreover, the high Fe levels found in the key nigras of PD patients may be explained by free Cu binding to iron-binding protein-1 (IBP-1), which causes its dysfunction and prevents it from dissociating itself from the transferrin receptor (TfR) inhibition gene in the cell. Causes TfR expression even in the presence of abundant Fe. The gradual accumulation of Fe and Cu would explain the damage to the substantia nigra by free radicals catalyzed by these two metals and exacerbated by the low levels of CuZnSOD due to the aforementioned Zn deficiency. Also, if this hypothesis is correct, then PD can be used to aid in the discovery of the gene (or genes) responsible for WD, and vice versa. Moreover, idiopathic PD can be prevented by identifying heterozygous individuals and providing them with Zn supplementation, Cu chelation therapy, and phlebotomy to eliminate Fe.",,"Johnson, S.",2001,Feb,https://dx.doi.org/10.1054/mehy.2000.1134,0,0,

506,Essential role for mammalian copper transporter Ctr1 in copper homeostasis and embryonic development,"Trace metal copper (Cu) plays an important role in biology as a cofactor for many enzymes such as Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase, cytochrome oxidase, ceruloplasmin, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Consequently, Cu transport at the cell surface and delivery of Cu to intracellular compartments are critical events for a wide variety of biological processes. The components that regulate intracellular Cu trafficking and their role in Cu homeostasis have been elucidated by studies of model microorganisms and characterizations of the molecular basis of Cu-related genetic diseases, including Menkes disease and Wilson's disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms of Cu uptake in the plasma membrane and the consequences of defects in this process in mammals. Here, we show that the mouse Ctr1 gene encodes a component of the Cu transport machinery and that mice heterozygous for Ctr1 exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice completely deficient for Ctr1 exhibit profound growth and developmental defects and die in the womb mid-pregnancy. These results suggest a crucial role for Cu acquisition via the Ctr1 transporter for mammalian Cu homeostasis and embryonic development.",,"Lee, J.;Prohaska, J. R.;Thiele, D.

507,"Micronutrient accumulation and depletion in schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, and Parkinson's disease?","Zinc has crucial functions in brain development and maintenance: it binds to p53, prevents it from binding to supercoiled DNA, and enables p53 to cause expression of several important genes, such as those that encode type I receptors for pituitary adenine silase. - of the cerebral cortex, adrenal glands, etc. activator peptide (PACAP), which governs embryonic development; necessary for the production of CuZnSOD and Zn-thionein, which are necessary to prevent oxidative damage; Some are Zn-fingered, essential for many proteins, most of which are enzymes necessary for growth and homeostasis. For example, serotonin synthesis involves Zn enzymes, and since serotonin is required for melatonin synthesis, Zn deficiency can cause low levels of both hormones. Unfortunately, Zn levels tend to be low when there is excess Cu and Cd. Also, high estrogen levels tend to cause increased absorption of Cu and Cd, and smoking and eating Cd-contaminated foods cause high levels of Cd. Also, ethanol intake increases the elimination of Zn and Mg (which acts as a cofactor for CuZnSOD). People with Wilson's disease, which is a very rare disease, may also have increased Cu levels. However, the heterozygous form (only one faulty copy of the chromosome) is not so rare. Therefore, the developing fetus of a pregnant woman who is low in Zn and high in Cu may experience major difficulties in early brain development and later manifest as schizophrenia, autism or epilepsy. Similarly, a person who gradually accumulates Cu will tend to experience a gradual depletion of Zn, with a corresponding increase in oxidative damage, eventually leading to Parkinson's disease. The important roles of histidine, histamine, vitamin D, essential fatty acids, vitamin E, peroxynitrate, etc. in the possible oxidative damage involved in these mental illnesses are also discussed.

509,Wilson's disease with severe hepatic impairment: beneficial effects of early D-penicillamine administration.,"Background: Wilson's disease, a precursor of severe liver failure, is a rare disease in which emergency liver transplantation is considered the only effective treatment. OBJECTIVES: To report the features of Wilson's disease with severe hepatic impairment in a series of 17 patients and to evaluate the efficacy of a policy of early administration of D-penicillamine in the second phase of the study. PATIENTS: Seventeen consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were studied. During the first period of the study (up to 1979), none of the patients received D-penicillamine. In the second period (after 1979), all patients without encephalopathy at presentation were given D-penicillamine. RESULTS: Four patients who were observed in the first period, who did not have encephalopathy at presentation and who did not receive D-penicillamine, progressed to encephalopathy and died. Of the 13 consecutive patients observed in the second period, two patients with encephalopathy at presentation did not receive D-penicillamine and were transplanted. All the remaining 11 patients received D-penicillamine. Of these patients, 10 survived without the need for transplantation and reverted to compensated liver disease without liver failure. One patient had advanced hepatic failure and required transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of D-penicillamine was associated with survival without transplantation in most patients with Wilson's disease who did not have encephalopathy at admission and were heralded with severe hepatic failure. These results underscore the importance of early diagnosis of this form of Wilson's disease before the onset of encephalopathy and support the early administration of D-penicillamine, which in most cases may obviate the need for transplantation.",,"Durand, F.;Bernuau, J.;Giostra, E.;Mentha, G.;Shouval, D.;Degott, C.;Benhamou, J.

Pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years were given 25 mg of zinc twice daily; Patients aged 6 to 15 years were given 25 mg of zinc three times a day if their body weight was less than 125 pounds; and patients aged 16 years and older were given 50 mg of zinc three times daily. Patients were followed for efficacy (or overtreatment) up to 19 years of age by measuring urine and plasma copper, urine and plasma zinc levels, and by liver function tests and quantitative speech and neurological scores. The patients were followed up for toxicity with blood count, blood biochemistry, urinalysis and clinical follow-up measurements. Thirty-four patients aged between 3.2 and 17.7 were included in the study. All doses met efficacy targets such as copper control, zinc levels, neurological recovery, and preservation of liver function, except for episodes of poor compliance. No cases of overtreatment were encountered. Four patients exhibited mild and transient stomach discomfort from zinc. Zinc therapy appears to have a slight adverse effect on the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio in pediatric patients; this is in contrast to the results of an earlier large study that was mainly aimed at adults. In conclusion, zinc is effective and safe for the maintenance management of pediatric cases of Wilson's disease. Our data is strongest in children over the age of 10.

513,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by the absence or dysfunction of a copper-bearing P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. This ATPase is expressed in hepatocytes where it is localized in the trans-Golgi network and transports copper into the cell. secretory pathway for association with ceruloplasmin and excretion into the biliary tract. Under physiological conditions, biliary excretion represents the only mechanism for copper excretion, and therefore, there is progressive accumulation of copper in the liver in affected individuals. When the hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, cell death occurs with copper release into the plasma, hemolysis and tissue deposition. Childhood presentation may include chronic hepatitis, asymptomatic cirrhosis, or acute liver failure. In young adults, neuropsychiatric symptoms predominate and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairment due to copper deposition in the central nervous system. Laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by a decrease in serum ceruloplasmin, an increase in urinary copper content, and an increase in hepatic copper concentration. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 100 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are compound heterozygous. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective treatment in most patients, and liver transplantation is curative in individuals presenting with irreversible liver failure. The elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of Wilson's disease has allowed new insights into the mechanisms of cellular copper homeostasis. [References: 106]",,"Loudianos, G.;Gitlin, J.

It has been hypothesized that enhanced LDL peroxidation caused by high copper levels may contribute to injury to the liver and other tissues. The study group consisted of 45 people with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine or zinc salts, and a control group of 36 healthy people.

RESULTS: One in 10 untreated women had difficulty conceiving. The number and type of pathology (imminent miscarriages, gestosis, stillbirth, preterm births) were similar in treated and untreated patients. The most common pathology in both mentioned groups was spontaneous abortions, found in 26% of untreated women and 26.6% of treated women. This rate is higher than the general population. Most deliveries in patients with WD have been spontaneous. Neither developmental disorder nor serious disorders were noticed in the children of our treated patients, and 3 children of the untreated patients were born with congenital heart disease.

The treatments received by the patients were noted. The clinical profile during the follow-up was recorded either from the records or by calling the patient for follow-up, if possible, whether the patient improved, worsened or remained the same according to the side effects of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of 25 children with Wilson's disease, consisting of 19 index cases and 6 siblings identified in family screening, revealed that the mean age of onset for hepatic presentation was 6.8 years, and 8 years for the neurological patient. A quarter of index cases have a strongly suspected family history of Wilson's disease, which was previously overlooked. The clinical presentation was hepatic in 5 patients, completely neurological in 5, mixed hepatic and neurologic in 9, hemolytic anemia in 1, and polyarthritis in 1 patient. Patients were treated with D penicillamine, zinc, pyridoxine, and a low copper diet. Subsequently, 18 patients showed improvement in the majority, residual dysarthria in seven, long-term persistence of CF rings in 15, and complications such as renal tubular acidosis with osteopenia in one. CONCLUSION: Early onset of symptoms, persistence of long-term CF rings, and progression of symptoms among siblings despite treatment are interesting as they may be due to high copper intake, which may be due to the use of brass or copper utensils. cooking Because many children have a history of jaundice or sibling deaths from jaundice or cirrhosis, the high index of suspicion and screening for CF rings is highlighted as a simple and cost-effective way to detect a treatable disease early. Stage and family screening of all index cases is mandatory.

Comparison of pre- and post-treatment visual electrophysiological studies revealed a significant reduction in the latency of PRVEP and flash ERG A wave (P<0.05), with an increase in the amplitudes of PRVEP's P100 (P<0.05), flash ERG's A and B waves ( P <0.01). These findings confirm the reported PRVEP changes in WD and further demonstrate the reversibility of retinal dysfunction that partially contributes to PRVEP abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first ERG study in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. In addition, there is no previous report in the literature evaluating the effect of specific therapy on PRVEP and ERG in Wilson's disease.",,"Satishchandra, P.;Ravishankar Naik, K.",2000,2001-05-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
521,Inhibition of carboxypeptidase A by D-penicillamine: mechanism and implications for drug design,"Zinc metalloprotease inhibitors are generally designed to inactivate the enzyme by forming a stable ternary complex with the enzyme and active site zinc. D-Cysteine forms such a complex with a K(i) of 2.3 microM, inhibiting the carboxypeptidase, ZnCPD. In contrast, the antiarthritis drug D-penicillamine, D-PEN, which differs from D-Cys only by the presence of two methyl groups on the beta-carbon, inhibits ZnCPD by promoting the release of active site zinc. We have named such inhibitors catalytic chelators. Inhibition is a two-step process characterized by the formation of a complex with the enzyme (K(i(initial)) = 1.2 mM) followed by the release of active site zinc up to 420 times faster than spontaneous release. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis at completion of the second step is also dependent on the D-PEN concentration (K(i(final)) = 0.25 mM), reflecting the establishment of a thermodynamic equilibrium governed by the chelator for zinc and the stability constants of the apocarboxypeptidase. The interaction of D-PEN and D-Cys with the active site metal was studied by replacing the active site zinc with a chromophoric cobalt atom. Both inhibitors disrupt the dd transitions of CoCPD in the 500-600 nm region within milliseconds of mixing, but only the CoCPD.D-Cys complex exhibits a strong S --> Co(II) charge transfer band at 340 nm, indicative of a metal. . -sulphur bond. While the D-Cys complex is stable, the CoCPD.D-PEN complex degrades to apoenzyme and Co(D-PEN)(2) with a half-life of 0.5 s. D-PEN is the first drug found to inhibit a metalloprotease by increasing the dissociation rate constant of the active site metal. The ability of D-PEN to catalyze metal removal from carboxypeptidase A and other zinc proteases suggests a possible mechanism of action in arthritis and Wilson's disease, and may also underlie complications associated with its clinical use.",,"Chong, C.

522,Wilson's disease with overlapping autoimmune features: two case reports and review,"We describe two women aged 15 and 23 years, respectively, who presented with the classic features of Wilson's disease (WD) and various features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The first patient was initially diagnosed as AIH and was treated with prednisolone, which resulted in clinical improvement by increasing serum albumin from 22 to 30 g/L and reducing aspartate aminotransferase from 103 to 47 U/L. Subsequent diagnosis of WD and administration of penicillamine resulted in excellent improvement and complete normalization of liver function tests. The second patient, initially also diagnosed as AIH, was treated with steroids and azathioprine, with initial improvement but later worsening. Since the patient had end-stage liver disease and required transplantation, the diagnosis of WD was made 2 years after the initial diagnosis of AIH. Therefore, d-penicillamine treatment was not tried. We concluded that a comprehensive screening for WD is necessary in patients with AIH, especially when the response to steroid therapy is poor. Conversely, in patients suffering from WD with the overlapping properties of AIH, a combination of steroids and penicillamine may be beneficial.

523,Copper transport and defect in Wilson's disease: characterization of the copper-binding domain of the Wilson's disease ATPase.,"Copper is an essential trace element that forms an integral component of many enzymes. While trace amounts of copper are required to sustain life, excess copper is extremely toxic. Here, an attempt is made to present the current understanding of the normal transport of copper in relation to absorption, intracellular transport, and toxicity. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport that results in copper deposition in organs such as the liver and brain, leading to progressive hepatic and neurological damage. The gene responsible for Wilson's disease (ATP7B) is predicted to encode a putative copper-bearing P-type ATPase. An important feature of this ATPase is the presence of a large N-terminal domain containing six repeats of a copper binding motif thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the membrane. We cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kD) of Wilson's disease ATPase. The metal-binding properties of the domain showed that the protein binds several metals in addition to copper; however, copper has a higher affinity for the domain. Copper binds to the domain in the form of Cu(I) with a copper:protein ratio of 6.5:1. X-ray absorption studies strongly suggest that Cu(I) atoms bind to cysteine residues. Circular dichroism spectral analyzes suggest both secondary and tertiary structural changes upon copper domain binding. Copper bonding studies show some degree of cooperation in copper bonding. Along with detailed structural information of the copper binding domain, these studies will be crucial in determining the specific role played by the copper-transporting ATPase in the homeostatic control of copper in the body and how copper transport is disrupted by mutations in the body.

524,"CSF copper concentrations, blood-brain barrier function, and coeruloplasmin synthesis during treatment of Wilson's disease","During treatment of four patients with cerebral manifestations of Wilson's disease, we measured copper concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, serum coeruloplasmin concentration, free copper concentration in serum, and CSF/serum albumin ratio (AR). ). These measurements were considered indicators of copper-related toxic effects on the brain and blood-brain barrier (BBB). The half-life of the decrease in CSF copper concentration during treatment was 23.5 +/-5.78 months (mean +/- SEM). The therapeutic target copper concentration (mean normal concentration) in CSF is below 20 microg/l. The mean treatment time required to normalize CSF-copper values in our patients with a mean baseline value of 76.25 microg/L was 47 months. During the first 10 months of treatment, there was an increase in all cases of measured impairment of the blood-brain barrier (the ratio of albumin in CSF to albumin in serum, measured as AR). All patients showed an initial worsening of neurological status after a mean of 1.75 +/-0.25 months. The maximum increase in AR averaged 18.4 +/- 5.08% from baseline; this maximum was reached after an average of 6.9 +/- 1.5 months. AR normalized during treatment and showed a reduction in toxicity at the blood-brain barrier region. The extent of AR increases in individual patients did not significantly correlate with the CSF copper half-life, serum copper half-life, first half-life of reduction in the (coeruloplasmin in serum)/(coeruloplasmin in serum) ratio. Initial copper concentration in CSF or serum, initial free copper concentration in serum, or starting dose of penicillamine (within the first 2 months). We conclude that normalization of CSF copper concentration in patients with cerebral manifestations of Wilson's disease is a slow process, even if treatment is adequate. The often-reported initial worsening of neurological status may be reflected in the deterioration of blood-brain barrier function, which we measured here for the first time (using the CSF/serum parameter of albumin ratio). Based on repeated measurements of AR during treatment, it appears that brain toxicity of mobilized copper can be assessed and therapy adjusted.",,"Stuerenburg, H.

Design: Retrospective study with a median follow-up of 9 years. SETTING: University medical center. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four children aged three to fifteen years with hepatic involvement were diagnosed with Wilson's disease over a period of eighteen years. METHODS: The diagnosis was based on family history and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary and hepatic copper concentrations. RESULTS: Four patients also had neurological symptoms. Eight patients were diagnosed with fulminant liver failure, which resulted in death within a few days. The most common symptoms were abdominal bloating and abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly was the predominant physical finding, and most patients had elevated serum transaminases. Histopathologically, twenty patients had cirrhosis and six patients had chronic hepatitis. All patients with fulminant hepatic failure had hyperbilirubinemia with normal alkaline phosphatase and higher aspartate aminotransferase than alanine aminotransferase. Patients were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate. Liver transplantation was performed in three patients. In addition to patients with fulminant liver failure, four more patients died of end-stage liver disease. Twenty-two patients were followed for a median of 9 years.

529,"Treatment of metastatic cancer with tetrathiomolybdate, an anticopper, antiangiogenic agent: a phase I study.","Preclinical and in vitro studies have determined that copper is an important cofactor for angiogenesis. Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) was developed as an effective copper inhibitor therapy for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disease that causes abnormal copper accumulation. Given the potency and uniqueness of the copper-inhibiting effect of TM and its lack of toxicity, we hypothesized that TM would be a suitable agent to achieve and maintain mild copper deficiency to impair neovascularization in metastatic solid tumors. Following the preclinical study demonstrating efficacy for this anticancer approach in mouse tumor models, we conducted a Phase I clinical trial in 18 patients with registered metastatic cancer with three doses of oral TM (90, 105 and 120 mg/day). It is administered in six divided doses with and between meals. Serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) was used as a surrogate marker for total body copper. As anemia was the first clinical manifestation of copper deficiency, the aim of the study was to reduce Cp to 20% of baseline without lowering hematocrit below 80% of baseline. Cp is a reliable and sensitive measure of copper status, and TM was non-toxic when Cp was reduced to 15-20% of its initial value. The level III dose of TM (120 mg/day) was effective in achieving target Cp without additional toxicity. Mild copper deficiency induced by TM provided stable disease in five of six patients with copper deficiency in the target range for at least 90 days.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R. D.;Grover, D.

The most serious sequela is progressive central nervous system involvement. The use of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients with neurological symptoms attributed to Wilson's disease is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of OLT in patients with Wilson's disease, including those with neurological involvement attributed to copper deposition in the central nervous system. OLT was administered to 45 patients (19 men [42.2%], 26 women [57.8%]) with Wilson's disease followed for at least 4 years between 1971 and 1993. The age at diagnosis of Wilson's disease ranged from 3 to 41 years (mean 17.7 +/- 7.4 years). The age at OLT was between 8 and 52 (mean 22.3 +/- 9.4 years). Nineteen patients (42.2%) were younger than 18 years of age in OLT. OLT indications included chronic liver failure in 15 patients (33.3%) and fulminant (FHF) or subfulminant liver failure in 30 patients (66.6%). All but 1 (94.7%) of 19 pediatric patients were in the second group. Twenty-five patients (55.5%) received D-penicillamine, 9 patients were more than 1 year; None of the patients on long-term treatment developed as AHF. Thirty-three patients (73.3%) survived more than 5 years after OLT. Fourteen patients (31%) died in the post-transplant period; 7 (50%) of 14 patients were younger than 18 years of age. In the first 3 months after OLT, twelve patients, 10 of whom were transplanted for FHF, died from disease and surgical complications. The other 2 patients died 6 and 9 years after transplant of infection problems. Eleven patients (24.4%) required retransplantation due to primary dysfunctional graft (n = 6), chronic rejection (n = 4), and hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 1). Seventeen patients (37.7%) presented with neurological abnormalities; 14 patients with Wilsonian neurological signs and 3 patients with components of increased intracranial pressure.

Our experience demonstrates that OLT is a life-saving procedure in patients with end-stage Wilson disease and is associated with excellent long-term survival.

539,"Expression and mutagenesis of ZntA, a zinc-transporting P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli","Cation-bearing P-type ATPases comprise a large family of membrane proteins whose members are found in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaea. A phylogenetically ancient branch of the P-type ATPase family is involved in the transport of heavy metal ions such as copper, silver, cadmium and zinc. In humans, two homologous P-type ATPases carry copper. Mutations in human proteins cause disorders of copper metabolism known as Wilson and Menkes diseases. E. coli has two genes for heavy metal-switching P-type ATPases. For one of them, we constructed an expression system for ZntA, which encodes a 732 amino acid residue protein capable of carrying Zn(2+). The membrane fraction of our expression strain has vanadata-sensitive, Zn(2+)-dependent ATPase activity. In addition to Zn(2+), heavy metal ions Cd(2+), Pb(2+) and Ag(+) activate ATPase. Incubation of membranes of the expression strain with [gamma-(33)P]ATP in the presence of Zn(2+), Cd(2+) or Pb(2+) results in phosphorylation of two membrane proteins with molecular masses as follows. about 90 and 190 kDa, most likely representing ZntA monomer and dimer, respectively. Although Cu(2+) can induce phosphorylation by [gamma-(33)P]ATP, it does not activate ATPase. Cu(2+) also prevents Zn(2+) activation of the ATPase when present in 2-fold excess on Zn(2+). Ag(+) and Cu(+) do not seem to support phosphorylation of the enzyme. To examine the effects of Wilson's disease mutations, we generated two site-directed mutants of their human counterparts, Wilson's disease-causing ZntA, His475Gln and Glu470Ala. Both mutants show a reduced metal ion-stimulated ATPase activity (about 30-40% of wild-type activity) and are phosphorylated much less efficiently by [gamma-(33)P]ATP than the wild-type. Compared to the wild type, the Glu470Ala mutant is more strongly phosphorylated by [(33)P]P(i), while the His475Gln mutant is more weakly phosphorylated. These results indicate that the His475Gln mutation affects the reaction with ATP and P(i) and stabilizes the enzyme in a phosphorylated state. The Glu470Ala mutant appears to favor the E2 state. We conclude that His475 and Glu470 both play important roles in the transport cycles of Wilson's disease ATPase and ZntA.",,"Okkeri, J.;Haltia, T.",1999,2019-10-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
540,Characterization of the interaction between Wilson and Menkes disease proteins and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1p,"Wilson's disease (WD) and Menkes' disease (MNK) are inherited disorders of copper metabolism. The genes that are mutated to cause these disorders encode highly homologous copper-bearing ATPases. We use yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems in conjunction with an in vitro assay to demonstrate a specific, copper-dependent interaction between the six metal binding domains of the WD and MNK ATPase and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1. We showed that several metal-binding domains interact independently or in combination with HAH1p, despite the absence of domains five and six of WDp specifically. Changing the Met or Thr residue of the HAH1p MTCXXC motif has no observable effect on the copper-dependent interaction, whereas replacing either of the two Cys residues abolishes the interaction. Mutation of any of the HAH1p C-terminal Lys residues (Lys(56), Lys(57) or Lys(60)) to Gly does not affect the interaction, but deletion of the 15 C-terminal residues abolishes the interaction. We showed that apo-HAH1p can bind to copper-loaded WDp in vitro, suggesting that copper transfer from HAH1p to WD/MNKp can be reversed. The in vitro HAH1/WDp interaction is metallospecific; HAH1 was pre-incubated with Cu(2+) or Hg(+), but not Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(3+), Fe(3+), or Cr (not with 3) +) Interacted with WDp. Finally, we model the protein-protein interaction and provide a theoretical representation of the HAH1p.Cu.WD/MNKp complex.",,"Larin, D.;Mekios, C.;Das, K.;Ross, B.;Yang, A. S.;Gilliam, T.

However, an occasional side effect such as hepatotoxicity has been observed in its clinical practice. The mechanism underlying the adverse effect of TTM was examined in comparison with dithiomolybdate (DTM) and a safer and more effective treatment with TTM was proposed based on the mechanism. It was shown that the activity of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) in serum was significantly increased upon treatment of Wistar rats with sulfide produced via hydrolytic degradation of TTM and DTM, DTM was more easily degraded. The hydrolytic degradation of TTM is enhanced under acidic conditions. Cu in Cu-containing enzymes such as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in plasma is decreased by excess thiomolybdates, Cu is found in plasma as Cu/thiomolybdate/albumin complex. The reduced amounts of Cu in SOD and Cp were explained by the sequestration of Cu from its chaperones by thiomolybdates, rather than the direct removal of Cu from the enzymes. Although both TTM and DTM remove Cu from MT, DTM is not suitable as a therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease due to its easy hydrolysis and sulfur production.",,"Ogra, Y.;Komada, Y.;Suzuki, K.

543,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder that results in pathological copper accumulation in many organs and tissues. The Wilson disease gene is localized on human chromosome 13 and encodes the copper-bearing P-type ATPase, -ATP7B. Nearly one hundred mutations occurring across the entire gene have been documented so far. The most common is the His1069Gln point mutation. Wilson's disease can occur under a variety of clinical conditions, the most common being liver disease (ranging from acute hepatitis, fulminant liver failure, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis), hemolytic anemia, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is usually made on the basis of clinical findings (Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms) and laboratory abnormalities (low serum ceruloplasmin, increased hepatic copper content). Molecular genetic testing is now the standard for testing asymptomatic siblings. Diagnosis in patients presenting with liver diseases is difficult and requires a combination of various laboratory parameters. Life-long treatment with chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) or zinc is usually sufficient to stabilize the patient and achieve clinical remission in most. Patients with advanced liver disease benefit from orthotopic liver transplantation. [References: 55]",,"Ferenci, P.",1999,Jun-Jul,,0,0,
544,Treatment and management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease related to copper metabolism. Clinical symptoms are due to copper deposition in various tissues, including the liver, brain, kidney, cornea, and others. The main strategy of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering both copper chelating agents and a low copper diet. D-Penicillamine is considered the first choice as a copper chelating agent. In the early stages of treatment, patients require 15-25 mg/kg per day and this drug should be given 2 hours before meals. Some undesirable or serious side effects such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and nephrotic syndrome occur in 20-25% of all patients. In such cases, trientylene tetramine (trientine) appears to be as effective as penicillamine. This drug is usually used when D-penicillamine needs to be discontinued. It is also sometimes given as the first choice drug to patients with neurological symptoms. It is given in doses of 40-50 mg/kg per day in the same way as D-penicillamine. Zinc salt administration has also emerged as an interesting supportive treatment for both treatments. A daily dose of 5-7.5 mg/kg is given before meals. The copper content of the diet should be less than 1 mg/day in the early stages of treatment. It can then be increased to 1.0-1.5 mg/day in well-controlled periods. Liver transplantation is now practiced in many countries for patients with fulminant or chronic progressive types of Wilson's disease.

545,1H NMR studies of the reactions of copper(I) and copper(II) with D-penicillamine and glutathione,"Reactions of copper ions with D-penicillamine (PSH) were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy in the presence and absence of glutathione (GSH) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the DO solution at pD = 7.4, PSH coordinates with Cu+ to form PS(-)-Cu+ under an argon atmosphere, as arises from the amplification of each signal. In the presence of dioxygen, the complex was transformed into well-characterized purple cluster species consisting of Cu+, Cu2+ and PS2-. Addition of GSH to this solution rapidly disrupted the cluster by reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. However, the cluster species regenerated after a few hours due to oxidation of Cu+ back to Cu2+. The solution containing both PSH and GSH formed three possible disulfides, PSSP, GSSG and PSSG under aerobic conditions. Addition of Cu+ to this solution again produced the purple cluster via several redox reactions. Based on these results, it was concluded that the co-existence of PSH and/or PSSP with Cu+ and/or Cu2+ leads to the formation of stable cluster species regardless of the presence or absence of other thiols such as GSH. This must be one of the reasons why PSH works as an effective medicine for Wilson's disease in living cells.",,"Kato, N.;Nakamura, M.;Uchiyama, T.",1999,2015-06-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

549,Treatment of copper-related liver disease in childhood,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Copper-related liver disease is accompanied by elevated liver copper concentrations and progressive liver disease in infancy or childhood. The disease is thought to be due to dietary copper overload (a source of copper-enriched water) and also to a genetic predisposition. In Indian childhood disease, which probably has the same etiology, penicillamine therapy is effective when started early enough, as in Wilson's disease. We aimed to describe the clinical features of copper-related liver disease in German children and to report our experience with different treatment options. METHODS/RESULTS: Two 6- and 10-month-old boys presented with abdominal distension due to hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis of copper-related liver disease was made based on nutritional history, standard liver function parameters, liver biopsy, and evaluation of dry weight copper concentration and urinary copper excretion. Both had micronodular cirrhosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory bodies. An improvement in liver function was observed in the child after initiation of penicillamine therapy and a copper-reduced diet. Treatment was stopped after 18 months, when normalization of copper concentration in the liver occurred. Child B developed acute liver failure despite starting treatment. The child was successfully transplanted. Both children are currently healthy 10 years after transplant and 4 years after initiation of chelating therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that early chelation therapy with penicillamine may be successful in children with copper-related liver disease. Liver transplantation is necessary in case of delayed diagnosis and acute liver failure. Our case reports highlight the urgent need for a diagnosis of copper-associated liver disease to initiate early chelating therapy. Copper-associated liver disease should be clearly considered in liver disease of unknown origin. Possible causes of excessive dietary copper intake should be investigated.",,"Rodeck, B.;Kardoff, R.;Melter, M.",1999,2028-06-01 00:00:00,,0,0,
550,Molybdenum,"Molybdenum does not occur naturally in pure metallic form and out of the 5 oxidation states (2-6) the dominant species are Mo(IV) and Mo(VI). Molybdenum rapidly polymerizes in solution into a wide variety of complex polymolybdate compounds. The vast majority of molybdenum is used in metallurgical applications (stainless steel, cast iron alloys). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is an experimental chelating agent for Wilson's disease. For the general population, diet is the most important source of molybdenum, and concentrations in water and air are generally negligible. The average daily dietary intake is about 0.1-0.5 mg of molybdenum, an essential element with relatively low toxicity. Molybdenum-containing enzymes catalyze essential metabolic reactions in the carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Molybdenum elimination occurs via the kidney and is usually complete within a few weeks. Molybdenum (tears) is a form of molybdenum toxicity that produces a disease similar to copper deficiency in ruminants. Few data are available on the human toxicity of molybdenum. A gout-like syndrome and pneumoconiosis have been associated with excessive molybdenum concentrations, but the poor design of studies precludes adequate determination of the etiology of these effects.

551,Copper,"Copper is an essential trace element that is an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. After zinc and iron, copper is the third most abundant trace element in the body. Copper is a noble metal like silver and gold. Useful industrial properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloying ability and malleability. Most metallic copper occurs in electrical applications. Copper is a component of intrauterine contraceptive devices and the release of copper is required for its contraceptive effects. The average daily copper intake in the US is approximately 1 mg Cu, with the primary source being dietary. Dietary bioavailability of copper is approximately 65-70%, depending on various factors such as chemical form, interaction with other metals, and dietary components. The biological half-life of dietary copper is 13-33 days, and the main route of elimination is biliary excretion. Copper sulfate is a stomach irritant that causes abrasions on the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic copper toxicity is rare and primarily affects the liver. Wilson's disease and Indian childhood cirrhosis are examples of severe chronic liver disease resulting from a genetic predisposition to hepatic copper deposition. In healthy individuals, the serum copper concentration ranges up to about 1.5 mg/L. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur at whole blood concentrations close to 3 mg Cu/L. Chelating agents (CaNa2EDTA, BAL) are recommended in severe poisoning, but there is little pharmacokinetic data to evaluate the efficacy of these agents. [References: 118]",,"Barceloux, D.

552,"Metal ion transporters in mammals: structure, function and pathological implications","Despite the importance of metal ions in various catalytic functions, little molecular information was available until recently about the mechanisms by which metal ions are actively taken up by mammalian cells. The classical concept for iron uptake into mammalian cells has been the endocytosis of transferrin-bound Fe3+ by the transferrin receptor. Studies with hypotransferrinaemic mice revealed that in the intestine mucosal transferrin is derived from plasma and its presence in the intestinal lumen is not required for dietary iron absorption. This indicates that other non-receptor-mediated uptake systems exist, at least in the gut. The molecular identification of metal ion transporters is particularly evident in an increasing number of human diseases, metal ion overload and deficiency disorders (eg disease) and neurodegenerative diseases (eg Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia and Parkinson's diseases). Also, susceptibility to mycobacterial infections is caused by metal ion transporter defects. The pathological consequences of impaired metal ion homeostasis confirm the vital roles these metal ions play in the catalytic function of many enzymes, gene regulation (zinc-finger proteins), and free radical homeostasis. Recent information has significantly improved our knowledge of how metal ions are taken up or released by mammalian cells. The purpose of this review is to summarize these developments and provide an overview of the growing number of mammalian metal ion carriers. [References: 109]",,"Rolfs, A.;Hediger, M.

In this study, trientine and ascorbate, known to have a beneficial effect in an animal model of Wilson's disease, were administered to transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated human SOD1 (G93A). The onset of neurological signs was significantly delayed in the treated group compared to the control group, and the time to complete paralysis was also delayed in the treated group. Since the agents used in this study caused low toxicity in animals and humans, this treatment may be a good candidate for clinical application.",,"Nagano, S.;Ogawa, Y.;Yanagihara, T.;Sakoda, S.",1999,2023-04-01 00:00:00,,0,0,

555,Zinc therapy increases duodenal metallothionein and iron concentrations in patients with Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease is effectively treated with the administration of zinc, which increases metallothionein concentrations in vitro. To determine whether the latter also occurs in humans, we measured metallothionein and trace element concentrations in the duodenal mucosa of 15 Wilson's disease patients, 12 of whom were treated with zinc sulfate, two treated with penicillamine, and one not yet treated. The control group consisted of 17 patients with dyspepsia who underwent the same study protocol. METHODS: Metallothionein and trace element concentrations were measured in duodenal mucosa biopsies by silver saturation hemolysate method and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. RESULTS: In patients with Wilson's disease, metallothionein concentrations increased by 1500% after zinc and by 150% after penicillamine compared to endoscopy-negative controls and untreated Wilson patients. A significant correlation was found between metallothionein and duodenal zinc concentrations. Patients with Wilson's disease had increased mucosal iron concentrations even if they were treated with zinc or penicillamine. Duodenum with duodenitis also had significantly increased iron levels compared to normal duodenum. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc administration increases intestinal metallothionein in Wilson's patients. Blocking of copper absorption and excretion in feces upon descaling of intestinal cells probably explains one of the mechanisms underlying the effect of zinc therapy. Despite normal endoscopy, patients with Wilson's disease have increased mucosal iron concentrations similar to those in controls with duodenitis. Metallothionein can therefore prevent oxidative damage caused by metal toxicity.",,"Sturniolo, G.

557,A high index of suspicion: the key to early detection of Wilson's disease in childhood,"BACKGROUND: To examine the childhood clinical features of Wilson's disease. METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory and histological features and prognosis of Wilson's disease in 26 Spanish children. RESULTS: First medical visit at 9.8+/-3.4 years (range, 4-16 years) was ordered by incidentally detected liver dysfunction (61%), liver disease symptoms (27%), family screening (8%). ) and extrapyramidal symptoms and personality changes (4%). 27% had laboratory data of liver failure. All copper metabolism test results (total serum copper, 24-hour urinary excretion, serum ceruloplasmin) were abnormal in 62%, two in 27%, and one in 11%. All patients with extrahepatic involvement at the time of diagnosis had severe liver disease. Histological findings were portal fibrosis with steatosis (29%), cirrhosis (21%), portal fibrosis (17%), chronic active hepatitis (17%), and minimal change or normality (17%). Penicillamine was administered to all but one patient. Four children received liver transplants, three of whom received penicillamine for 12, 45 and 70 days. After 1 year of treatment with penicillamine, the other three patients recovered from liver failure. All children survived after 4.5+/-3.3 years of follow-up. Penicillamine caused severe toxicity in one patient.

558,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal, recessive disorder in which biliary copper excretion is impaired, resulting in copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver, cornea, and brain. The Wilson disease gene on chromosome 13 encodes the copper-bearing P-type ATPase-ATP7B. More than 60 mutations of this gene have been identified. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease is based on clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities and can be made if two of the following symptoms are present: Kayser-Fleischer rings; topical neurological symptoms; and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. In less typical cases, diagnosis requires various other tests of copper metabolism. Effective medical treatment with copper chelators (D-penicillamine, trientine) or zinc results in symptomatic improvement and normal life expectancy.

Most of the more than 80 mutations are present at a low frequency, and the mutations differ between ethnic groups. At least two mutations are common enough to aid rapid diagnosis in European and Asian populations, respectively. Molecular analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis for asymptomatic siblings.

These abnormalities have mainly been described in patients with primary immunological disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. To clarify whether the immune disorders caused by d-PA are limited to patients genetically predisposed to develop autoimmune diseases or to a direct drug effect, we tested the presence of various autoantibodies and molecular HLA typing in 17 patients treated with Wilson's disease. this medicine. Low titer (10 JDFU) circulating islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) were detected in 2/17 patients, while the presence of insulin autoantibodies was positive in another patient. None of the tested sera showed reactivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase or ICA512. Five of the twelve patients were positive for anti-single-stranded DNA autoantibody. Molecular HLA typing of autoantibody positive subjects showed that they carried HLA haplotypes not associated with insulin-dependent diabetes. Insulin response to intravenous glucose tolerance test was normal in two patients with autoantibodies. A second blood test performed 5 months after the initial assessment in autoantibody positive patients showed that all three had turned negative.

563,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XV long-term follow-up studies,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disease of copper accumulation caused by failure in the biliary excretion of excess copper. The accumulated copper causes liver disease in these patients and causes brain damage leading to clinical neurological or psychiatric dysfunction in perhaps two-thirds of patients. Maintenance therapy includes reversing the positive copper balance. Early approaches used chelators such as penicillamine or trientine that increase urinary copper excretion. A more recent approach has used zinc, which inhibits the absorption of copper and increases copper excretion in the stool. Zinc plays a role in removing the accumulated copper from the body and preventing its re-accumulation, due to the high level of copper that is endogenously secreted in digestive secretions and whose reabsorption is partially blocked by zinc treatment. In this article, we present data on long-term (up to 10 years) follow-up of zinc maintenance therapy in 141 patients with Wilson's disease. The presented data document that zinc is effective as a sole therapy in the long-term maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease and has low toxicity. The results demonstrate the efficacy of zinc therapy in treating the presymptomatic patient from the start of therapy. We also present limited data on the use of zinc in the treatment of pregnant patients and children with Wilson's disease; these data also indicate efficacy and low toxicity.

570,Wilson's disease and canine copper toxicosis,"In this article, we review the current clinical and research status of Wilson's disease and canine copper toxicosis. One of the main clinical challenges in Wilson's disease is that clinicians recognize the possibility of Wilson's disease when young patients present with liver disease, psychiatric disease, or a movement disorder-type neurological disease. There are many copper-related tests available that are fairly accurate in diagnosing or ruling out the disease, once the probability of disease has been determined. It is important to remember that this is an inherited disease and at-risk family members, especially siblings, should be screened. Cloning of the Wilson disease gene opened up the possibility that a direct DNA test could be developed that would allow appropriate screening of certain patients and family members. However, the large number of mutations already present hindered this approach, without a small set of mutations dominating the picture. After diagnosis, various treatments are available. We use zinc for maintenance therapy, treatment of presymptomatic patients and treatment of pregnant patients. We use a combination of zinc and trientine for the initial treatment of patients with liver disease. We use tetrathiomolybdate for the initial treatment of patients with neurological disease. Canine copper toxicosis in Bedlington Terriers is caused by a different gene than the Wilson disease gene. However, the disease can be treated with the same range of anticancer treatments that work in humans. We recently linked the copper toxicosis gene to a microsatellite marker that provides a linkage test for breeders of Bedlington Terriers. [References: 36]",,"Brewer, G. J.",1998,May,,0,0,

OBJECTIVE: The clinical aspects and parameters of copper metabolism in a large number of pediatric cases are evaluated to establish specific criteria for diagnosis and correct treatment, even in difficult cases. METHODS: Clinical aspects, histological features, laboratory parameters, and copper metabolism data were studied in 44 children with Wilson's disease. Forty patients treated with penicillamine were followed (mean 77 months). RESULTS: 44 cases were classified as follows: asymptomatic forms (nine cases, siblings of six affected subjects), chronic hepatitis (23 cases), hepatocerebral manifestations (4 cases), decompensated cirrhosis (6 cases), fulminant hepatic failure anemia with hemolytic anemia (two cases). ). Ceruloplasmin levels were abnormal in 37 of 43 subjects tested, but normal in six (14%) who showed increased urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper content after high basal and penicillamine loading. Urine copper concentration was pathological in 35 (83%) of the 42 cases tested, but normal in seven patients under six years of age. Hepatic copper levels were very high in all 20 patients tested. Under treatment, 27 children had positive results. No disease evolution was seen in one patient, seven patients worsened due to treatment nonadherence (one had a successful liver transplant) or serious adverse events. Five patients who failed died.

METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients with HLD were given oral DMSA for 4 weeks. Adult dose was 1.5 g/day and pediatric dose was 1.0 g/day. Bile, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine samples were collected via duodenal drainage and lumbar puncture before and after treatment with DMSA. Bile samples were collected by drainage tube from 22 non-HLD controls after surgery. Hitachi-208 atom absorption spectrophotometer was used to analyze the copper, zinc and iron content of each sample. CONCLUSIONS: DMSA can effectively improve symptoms such as dysphasia, salivation, dysphagia and darkening of the skin; limb tremor and myotonia came second; however, it showed no significant effect on dysstasis, limb contracture and deformity, and hepatosplenomegaly. It was effective in younger patients without significant liver damage. No serious side effects were observed during the treatment. The laboratory study showed that the bile copper content of HLD patients was significantly lower than that of non-HLD controls (P < 0.01); In addition to clearly increasing urinary copper excretion, DMSA could clearly improve biliary copper excretion (P < 0.01) and had nothing to do with biliary zinc excretion (P > 0.05).

579,Penicillamine-associated neurological syndrome in a child afflicted with Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of penicillamine-induced neurological symptoms in a 9-year-old boy affected by asymptomatic Wilson's disease with hepatic presentation; to compare this case with similar cases in adults; and to discuss the role of zinc therapy as an alternative therapy for patients with adverse reaction to penicillamine therapy. SETTING: Referral hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The emergence of a neurological syndrome that severely impairs the child's usual daily activities and health-related quality of life after initiation of penicillamine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Initial penicillamine therapy was chronologically associated with the development of progressive neurological deterioration in the absence of other causes of the neurological syndrome. Withdrawal of penicillamine therapy and initiation of zinc therapy was followed by rapid resolution of neurological symptoms and a return to neurological baseline. CONCLUSION: Penicillamine therapy can induce neurological symptoms, even in children affected by Wilson's disease, alone with hepatic presentation and without neurological disease at the start of treatment.

580,Metabolism of triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride administered in humans,"Triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (triene 2HCl) has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, which is characterized by copper deposition in various organs. We previously developed an HPLC system to analyze triene and found a triene metabolite in the urine when humans were given triene orally. In this study, the metabolite was identified as 1-N-acetyltriethylene tetramine (acetyltriene) by FAB-MS and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Triene and acetyltriene had the ability to combine with copper, iron and zinc. However, the chelating activity of acetyltriene was significantly lower than triene. When triene was administered to healthy adults, the amount of triene excreted in the urine was approximately 1% of the administered triene, while the amount of acetyltriene was approximately 8%. Most triene was excreted within the first 6 hours after administration, while acetyltriene was excreted over 26 hours. Urinary copper, iron, and zinc levels all increased in parallel with triene excretion.",,"Kodama, H.;Murata, Y.;Iitsuka, T.;Abe, T.",1997,,,0,0,
581,Degenerative dermatoses caused by penicillamine: a case report and a brief review of such dermatoses,"We present a case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa with additional signs of degenerative skin changes. A 20-year-old man with hepatolenticular degeneration under long-term treatment with D-penicillamine presented with an arrangement of circular or serpiginous nuchal papules. Histopathologically, the transepidermal ducts were accompanied by granulomatous reactions with a few giant cells surrounding the elastic fibers. In addition to these findings of a typical elastosis perforans serpiginosa, we observed scar-like skin changes in the circular arrangement of papules. In scar-like tissue, we found electron microscopic evidence of randomly aggregated fine collagen fibers without a propensity to systemic fused bundle formation, which is a characteristic feature of normal collagen fiber formation. Pseudoxanthoma-elasticum-like changes were observed in his neck. Mild skin thickening and wrinkling were detected in the armpit and groin. The diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa does not represent all the symptoms or pathological background described above. The skin manifestations described here represent not only an elastosis, but also a total degenerative dermatosis with overhealed collagenosis. Therefore, these dermatoses should be summarized as a single entity, penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatosis. After evaluating the pathogenic background and clinical similarities, we propose to simplify penicillamine-induced skin manifestations into three categories: acute sensitivity reactions, bullous dermatoses, and degenerative dermatoses.

The main purpose of this report is to emphasize that Wilson's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of fulminant liver failure in children. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for patients presenting with fulminant liver failure, but this procedure is difficult to perform in Taiwan due to insufficient organ donation.

We investigated creatinine clearance as well as total protein, albumin, low (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) proteins, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and calcium excretion in 24-hour urine. Samples of 41 patients with WD aged 6-37 (mean 17) years treated with D-penicillamine (900 mg/day) for 0-15 (mean 4.5) years. The amount of all protein excreted increased significantly compared with controls, with 39% of patients presenting with total proteinuria more than two standard deviations from the mean of controls. Changes in protein excretion depended on treatment duration. LMW proteinuria was almost exclusively elevated in the first 2 years after initiation of therapy, indicating early tubular injury. This is initially supported by an elevated excretion of beta 2-microglobulin, NAG, and calcium. The increased excretion of HMW proteins, including albumin, persisted over longer periods, suggesting glomerular injury in some patients, possibly due to D-penicillamine use. Creatinine clearance remained roughly within normal limits. We recommend regular monitoring of renal function in patients with WD.",,"Sozeri, E.;Feist, D.;Ruder, H.;Scharer, K.",1997,Jun,,0,0,
586,Liver transplantation: treatment of choice for hepatic and neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease,"Liver transplantation (LTX) is an approved method to treat patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis and acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease. Initially, there were some considerations about the indication for LTX in Wilson's disease with severe neurological impairment but normal liver function. From 1988 to 1995, 13 (1.9%) of 700 LTX were administered for Wilson's disease. Indications for LTX are (I) persistent neurologic impairment with normal liver function (n = 4; including one patient with Child A cirrhosis), (II) fulminant liver failure (n = 3), and (III) end-stage liver cirrhosis (n = 6). ) (Child B, n = 1; Child C, n = 5). There were 8 women and 5 men with a mean age of 27 (range 15-34 years). All patients of group I required continued nursing care prior to LTX despite pretreatment with d-penicillamine and zinc. The most common symptoms in these patients were dysphagia (n = 4), dysarthria (n = 4), tremor (n = 4), sialorrhea (n = 3), ataxia (n = 3), dystonia (n = 3), and handwriting. difficulties (n = 3). All patients of Group II presented with hemolytic anemia. The survival rate was 100% and all patients were well after a mean follow-up of 32.8 months (range 8-68 months). The postoperative course passed without serious infectious and other complications. All patients of group I showed the first signs of improvement for all types of neurological symptoms 4-6 weeks after LTX. One patient did not experience any symptoms from 18 months to 5.5 years after LTX. Both patients with short-term follow-up had a noticeable improvement in neurological impairment, but residual symptoms are still present. One patient showed only slight improvement. We conclude that Wilson's disease may be a good indicator for LTX, both for neurological manifestation with stable liver function and for hepatic manifestation with cirrhosis or acute liver failure.",,"Schumacher, G.;Platz, K.

Investigation of the effect of zinc on lymphocyte function,"Although administration of zinc to human subjects has been reported to interfere with lymphocyte function, this single report has never been confirmed or denied. We developed zinc as a lifelong treatment for patients with Wilson's disease. Intervention in lymphocyte function, which occurs as a side effect of zinc therapy, may cause serious problems in our patients. We evaluated the lymphocyte mitogenic response and natural killer cell activity in patients with Wilson's disease treated with zinc for 5 years or longer compared to normal controls and found no differences. In a second study, we evaluated the same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after 1 year of zinc therapy and again found no significant difference. Currently, we have not seen signs of immunosuppression or increased susceptibility to infections in our patients treated with zinc for up to 15 years. We concluded that any adverse effects resulting from impaired lymphocyte function caused by zinc administration are not of interest to patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Brewer, G.

There were also signs of liver failure characterized by significantly reduced synthetic capacity of the liver, but low serum aminotransferase levels and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia was unlikely with a negative Coombs test. Therefore, diagnostic procedures were aimed at the cause of liver damage. Increased urinary copper excretion, a strong elevation of liver tissue copper, and the detection of a Kayser-Fleischer ring by slit lamp examination confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which clinically presents only as severe hemolysis.

Three patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Two of the symptomatic patients presented with new unidentified symptoms: one with blurred vision and the other with stony cholecystitis. At the time of diagnosis, 6 patients had Kayser Fleischer ring and 5 patients had hemolytic anemia. Three patients with fulminant liver failure had hemolysis with relatively low serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, possibly helpful findings for the rapid diagnosis of Wilson's disease in such a presentation. Ten patients were treated with penicillamine. Liver transplantation was performed in 4 patients, 2 of whom were admitted with fulminant liver failure. One patient died while waiting for a liver transplant, while the remaining patients are symptom-free.

Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring size decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) over the 5-year study period. Although neurological examination, speech pathology examination, and 24-hour urine copper analysis results in symptomatic Wilson patients improved over the study period, CF ring regression was not correlated with improvement in these clinical parameters (p > 0.05). However, there was a correlation between MRI scores and CF ring regression (p=0.02). Zinc maintenance therapy following anticancer therapy with TM is a safe and effective treatment for patients with neurologically symptomatic Wilson's disease. This treatment leads to a reduction in CF ring size; however, CF ring reduction is not a good predictor of clinical improvement in patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations of Wilson's disease.",,"Esmaeli, B.;Burnstine, M.

592,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. II. Initial therapy and follow-up with zinc therapy in 33 neurologically affected patients,"OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and toxic effects of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of a relatively large series of patients with neurological signs and symptoms caused by Wilson's disease. The two key aspects of efficacy are preserving existing neurological function at the start of treatment and maximizing the opportunity for long-term recovery. DESIGN: An open study of 33 patients, each treated for 8 weeks, including further follow-up data from the original 17 patients. Neurological function was evaluated with frequent quantitative neurological and speech pathology examinations. Various copper-related variables were studied to assess the drug's effect on copper, and various biochemical and clinical variables were studied to assess potential toxic effects. Patients were then followed at annual intervals, with follow-up periods of 1 to 8 years reported. SETTING: A university hospital referral setting. INTERVENTION: Patients were usually treated with tetrathiomolybdate for 8 weeks, followed by zinc maintenance therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by quantitative neurological and motor speech examinations and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain. RESULTS: During 8 weeks of administration of tetrathiomolybdate, only 1 of 33 patients had impaired neurological function. Copper availability and other potential toxic effects were generally well controlled quickly. Evaluation of data from individual patients revealed evidence of a toxic adverse event in only 1 patient who exhibited reversible anemia. During the follow-up period of 1 to 6 years, most patients had good to excellent neurologic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent initial treatment for Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms and signs. In contrast to penicillamine therapy, initial therapy with tetrathiomolybdate rarely allows for further, usually irreversible neurological deterioration.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Johnson, V.;Dick, R.

596,Wilson's disease: genetic basis and natural history of copper toxicity,"The discovery that the Wilson disease gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase has greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder and copper metabolism in humans. The abundance of disease-specific mutations and their location at multiple sites throughout the genome have limited molecular genetic diagnosis to known similar patients and confirm the necessity of de novo screening with proven clinical and biochemical methods. It is unclear whether the diversity of specific mutations will explain the wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, and environmental and extragenic factors are likely to be important contributing factors. Chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine remains effective treatment for most symptomatic hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. In some asymptomatic patients, zinc salts, fulminant hepatitis, and OLT can be used in patients in whom pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate is under investigation for the treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. Gene therapy is the new horizon in the treatment of Wilson's disease. However, the ability to effectively treat this disorder in this way awaits further characterization of the gene product and more efficient methods for gene delivery to all hepatocytes in the liver.

600,Current interpretation of the role of copper in Indian childhood cirrhosis,"Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), a once common fatal disease that became preventable and treatable in the early 1990s, is now rare. ICC should be clearly differentiated from other chronic liver disorders including Wilson's disease in Indian children. Greatly increased hepatic, urinary and serum copper concentrations are characteristic of ICC. These increased concentrations are easily demonstrated histologically by orcein-rhodanin staining. Environmental ingestion of copper seems to be the most plausible explanation for ICC, as shown in their nutritional history, prevention of ICC is siblings and a change in feeding vessels in Pune region and dramatic reduction in incidence of ICC in India. Although an inherited defect in copper metabolism is strongly suspected, the nature and role of a second factor in the causation of ICC remains unclear. However, ICC does not appear to be a simple early onset of Wilson's disease because ceruloplasmin is consistently normal and long-term clinical and histological improvement is maintained despite discontinuation of D-penicillamine therapy. Descriptions of an ICC-like disease in the West suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic, or both) may lead to the same end-stage liver disease: copper-associated childhood cirrhosis. ICC likely represents a specific form of copper-associated childhood cirrhosis that requires high environmental copper intake for its full expression.

At autopsy, three livers were divided into multiple samples for a detailed study of the distribution of Fe and Cu, whose accumulation characterizes the two diseases. In the same samples, Ca, Mg, P, S and Zn concentrations were also determined to examine important variations or abnormal trends that could help identify these diseases. Our results generally show good agreement with literature data within the limits of sample variability. Based on Factor Analysis and Regression Analysis, there is evidence of a high correlation between Fe and P contents in beta-thalassemia. The latter finding led us to propose a temporary accumulation of Fe as a complex with P-containing molecules.",,"Aragoni, M. C.;Crisponi, G.;Nurchi, V.

603,Neurological Wilson's disease was studied by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography using dopaminergic markers.,"Four patients with neurological Wilson's disease were investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). All patients had dystonia as the major clinical finding, but also had dysarthria and choreoathetoid movements in at least one limb at the onset of the disease. A multi-track approach with PET was used to visualize various aspects of dopaminergic function; [11C]-(+)-nomiphensine (NMF), [11C]raclopride (RAC), and [11C]-L-DOPA (one patient). Correlation analysis of RAC and NMF binding, as well as putamen/caudate uptake ratios, showed corresponding reductions. The patient examined with [11C]-L-DOPA had a normal striatal involvement. Overall, the structural changes, as demonstrated by MRI, corresponded to reductions in both NMF and RAC binding. There was no significant correlation between PET findings and the severity of clinical symptoms in each patient. In two patients with separate neurological disorders during the study, PET showed severe presynaptic dopaminergic lesions in the putamen. Our data suggest that the striatal degeneration seen in Wilson's disease involves a complex pathology involving both afferent and efferent projections. The discrete neurologic impairment seen in some patients with gross striatal pathology may be due to concomitant lesions in functionally opposed basal ganglia circuits.",,"Westermark, K.;Tedroff, J.;Thuomas, K.

607,Hydroxyl radical formation from copper ion and hydrogen peroxide: a spin capture study.,"It has been hypothesized that copper toxicity involves the formation of the catalytic hydroxyl radical (.OH) from hydrogen peroxide. Addition of Cu1+ to a solution containing ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and the spin-retaining agent alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitron (4-POBN) results in the formation of the alpha-hydroxyethyl radical or 4-POBN, respectively. It is the methyl radical attachment of . Attachment formation was prevented by the addition of catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. The inclusion of exogenous H2O2 in the reaction mixture increased the yield of the ethanol or Me2SO-derived radical adduct, and also enhanced the formation of secondary radical adducts, including the methyl radical adduct of 4-POBN/.H and 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. . The alpha-hydroxyethyl adduct of 4-POBN decomposes rapidly in the presence of copper, but the methyl radical adduct, not iron salts, is relatively stable in the presence of inorganic copper. The total radical adduct concentration determined from the reaction between Cu1+ and H2O2, determined by comparing the integrated spectral density with that of the stable 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy free radical, was only 1-5%. the maximum amount estimated assuming radical adduct formation from all added copper. Various copper chelators inhibit the formation of carbon-centered radical adducts of 4-POBN, including penicillamine and triethylenetetramine, the primary drugs used to treat the copper metabolism disorder of Wilson's disease. The results provide clear evidence for hydroxyl radical formation from Cu1+ and H2O2 (added or formed during autooxidation of reduced copper).",,"Gunther, M. R.;Hanna, P. M.;Mason, R. P.;Cohen, M.

However, due to a difficult family history, growth hormone (GH) treatment could not be started. The boy did not reappear until age 7.7 (height SDS -4.77) when GHD was reconfirmed and GH therapy could be initiated (dose 0.6 IU/kg/week). At that time, elevated liver enzymes (GPT 128 U/l, GOT 67 U/l, gamma-GT 28 U/l) confused diagnostic procedures. Growth rate SDS in GH increased from -1.86 to +4.50 in the first year, +3.87 in the second year, and height SDS to -4.26 and -3.59 in the second year. However, serum IGF-I levels did not return to normal (max. 67 ng/ml) and liver enzymes were still elevated. At the age of 10, he was diagnosed with Wilson's disease due to low serum ceruloplasmin concentration, high urinary copper excretion, and high copper content in a liver biopsy sample. Under combined treatment with D-penicillamine and GH, serum liver enzymes decreased and IGF-I levels rose to normal. Height SDS for chronological age has consistently improved.",,"Koch, A.;Dorr, H.

616,Long-term treatment of Wilson's disease with triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine),"Long-term treatment with triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine, TETA) was evaluated in 19 patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Two people were given the drug as first choice and 17 were given after penicillamine treatment. The change was made because of side effects, lack of improvement, or worsening of neurological symptoms. All the side effects caused by penicillamine returned. Thirteen patients are currently receiving trientine, with a mean total observation time of 8.5 years/patient on this treatment. Seven out of 13 people are free of WD-related symptoms, and five have mild to moderate neurological symptoms, primarily dysarthria. A patient with neurological symptoms who took trientine from the start of treatment rapidly deteriorated and is now severely dystonic. In one patient, symptoms worsened initially and later improved. All other patients improved during trientine therapy. Three patients died: two from a multifocal cancer, including the liver, and one from non-compliance due to rupture of the spleen. Two patients underwent liver transplantation for progressive liver failure: one with cirrhosis of the liver whose liver function worsened despite treatment; both are now symptom free. Unexpectedly, two patients developed severe colitis, one with duodenitis, which resolved after drug discontinuation. No other adverse effects of trientine were noted.",,"Dahlman, T.;Hartvig, P.;Lofholm, M.;Nordlinder, H.;Loof, L.;Westermark, K.",1995,Sep,,0,0,
617,Wilson's disease: a new gene and an animal model for an old disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive, inherited disorder of copper metabolism. In normal individuals, copper homeostasis is controlled by the balance between intestinal absorption of dietary copper and hepatic excretion of excess copper in bile. In Wilson's disease, hepatic copper is neither excreted in the bile nor incorporated into ceruloplasmin, and copper accumulates to toxic levels. The Wilson disease gene (WND) encodes a putative copper transport protein that is expressed almost exclusively in the liver. The predicted structure of the protein product, the structure of a P-type ATPase with striking homology to bacterial copper transporters, and the gene product of Menkes disease, another inherited copper metabolism disorder. A rat model of Wilson's disease has recently been described. The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat shows elevated hepatic copper, defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, and decreased biliary excretion of copper. The rat homologue of WND is abnormal in LEC rats. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease occur after copper-induced hepatocyte damage (liver presentation) or damage to the brain (neuropsychiatric presentation) and other organs indirectly after copper is released from the liver. Genetic heterogeneity (different mutations in a single gene) may explain some of the variability in Wilson presentations. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease relies on demonstration of dysregulated copper metabolism, manifested by high urinary and hepatic copper and low ceruloplasmin levels. However, none of the abnormal findings in Wilson's disease are pathognomonic. Genetic diagnosis can be difficult in the absence of family studies, as many different mutations cause the disease. Treatment for Wilson's disease includes reducing excess copper levels that build up in the liver, brain, and other organs. Copper chelation therapy is the mainstay of treatment to increase urinary excretion of copper. In addition, oral zinc therapy may be beneficial in reducing the absorption of dietary copper and rendering tissue copper non-toxic by increasing complex formation with copper-binding proteins. People with acute liver failure or complications of cirrhosis may need a liver transplant. Gene therapy may develop in the future; however, medical treatment is effective in most patients.

618,Diagnosis of Wilson's disease in an asymptomatic sibling by DNA linkage analysis,"molecular genetic diagnosis of Wilson's disease was reported in the 5-year-old sister of a patient with Wilson's disease. The girl was clinically free of disease and had no traditional biochemical markers of Wilson's disease (ie, normal ceruloplasmin, normal serum copper, normal 24-hour urine copper excretion). Diagnosis by restriction fragment length polymorphisms and an analysis based on microsatellite markers and non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction showed that it was homozygous for disease-associated markers. Liver biopsy was performed and a 20-fold increased liver copper content confirmed the diagnosis. Chelation therapy with D-penicillamine was applied to the child. The report of this study clearly demonstrates the advantage of DNA linkage analysis (especially polymerase chain reaction) over traditional laboratory methods for the presymptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease before irreparable liver and neurological damage occurs. The only limitation of this DNA-based diagnosis is that it can only be applied to siblings of index patients diagnosed according to phenotypic criteria.",,"Maier-Dobersberger, T.;Mannhalter, C.;Rack, S.;Granditsch, G.;Kaserer, K.;Korninger, L.;Steindl, P.;Gangl, A.;Ferenci, P.",1995,Dec,,0,0,

Prior to treatment, specific 11C-racloprid binding (patient 1 only) was significantly reduced with putamen cerebellum ratio 1.99 (controls: 3.99 +/- 0.55, n = 15) and caudate cerebellum ratio 2.52 (controls: 3.65). +/- 0.59, n = 15). Specific 123I-IBZM binding was decreased in both patients with basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratio 1.25 (patient 1) and 1.41 (patient 2) controls: 1.57 +/-0.04, n = 5). After 4 months of treatment, the 11C-raclopride-PET ratio increased to 2.52 and the caudate to cerebellum ratio to 3.06 (patient 1). 123I-IBZM-SPECT revealed an increase in the ratios of the basal ganglia to the frontal cortex of 1.34 (patient 1) and 1.55 (patient 2). In heavy T2-weighted MRI sequences, the hyperintense signal changes before treatment in the putamen (both patients), brainstem (patient 1 only), and caudate (patient 2 only) were greatly reduced after treatment. The reduced striatal dopamine D2-receptor binding in these Wilson disease patients improved under treatment, suggesting a partially reversible defect of striatal neurons.",,"Schwarz, J.;Antonini, A.;Kraft, E.;Tatsch, K.;Vogl, T.;Kirsch, C.

Psychiatric symptoms may be clinical picture,"It is important to consider Wilson's disease in patients with psychiatric signs and symptoms, abnormal liver function test results or neurological findings, or both. Comprehensive assessment of emotionally disturbed individuals, including complete history taking, careful physical examination, and appropriate laboratory profile, often excludes or raises suspicions for Wilson's disease during routine screening. Laboratory abnormalities require repeated studies and additional family and personal histories with emphasis on possible Wilson's disease. More work can be specified later. Rapid recognition and strong, consistent treatment can minimize symptoms and tissue damage. It is gratifying to identify a case of Wilson's disease and to see clinical aspects improve with appropriate treatment. [References: 14]",,"Jackson, G. H.;Meyer, A.;Lippmann, S.",1994,Jun,,0,0,
623,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XIII: Treatment with zinc in presymptomatic patients from the time of diagnosis,"Siblings of patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease each have a 25% risk of having this autosomal recessive disease. Screening these siblings allows them to be identified and to begin prophylactic treatment before they become clinically ill. Here we present the successful treatment of 13 presymptomatic patients with zinc acetate. These patients receiving zinc were followed for 3 to 9 years. In well-adjusted patients, 24-hour urinary copper and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper levels decreased over years of follow-up, consistent with elimination of the body's easily mobilized excess copper (potentially toxic copper). The effect of treatment and adherence are easily monitored by monitoring 24-hour urinary zinc and copper levels. Urine copper level is a good reflection of the body's easily mobilizable copper load. It will increase if control is insufficient. A decrease in urinary zinc is an early sign that the patient's compliance is not optimal. Hepatic copper levels may remain the same, fall, or temporarily increase in response to several years of zinc therapy. This is a reflection of the zinc induction of hepatic metallothionein, which keeps copper in a non-toxic pool. Hepatic copper levels should not be used to manage therapy. Liver function is well preserved with zinc therapy, and zinc toxicity was not observed in these 13 patients. None of the patients developed symptoms related to Wilson's disease. We conclude that zinc acetate is a completely effective and non-toxic treatment for the prophylactic treatment of patients with presymptomatic Wilson's disease.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R.

624,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. I. Initial treatment in 17 neurologically affected patients,"OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and toxicity of a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, as initial therapy in a relatively large series of patients presenting with neurological signs and symptoms caused by Wilson's disease. The key aspect of efficacy was to preserve the neurological function present at the start of treatment. DESIGN: An open study of 17 patients, each treated for 8 weeks. Neurological function was assessed by frequent quantitative neurological and speech examinations. Several copper-related variables were studied to assess the drug's effect on copper, and numerous biochemical and clinical variables were studied to assess potential toxicity. Patients were then followed at annual intervals, with 1 to 5 years of follow-up reported. SETTING: A university hospital referral setting INTERVENTION: Patients were usually treated with tetrathiomolybdate for 8 weeks, followed by zinc maintenance therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by quantitative neurological and speech examinations. RESULTS: There was no loss of neurological function in any patient. Copper availability and other potential toxic effects were generally well controlled quickly. There are no toxic effects resulting from the administration of tetrathiomolybdate. During follow-up of 1 to 5 years, most patients had good to excellent neurologic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent initial treatment for Wilson's disease presenting with neurological signs and symptoms. Unlike penicillamine therapy, initial therapy with tetrathiomolybdate does not cause further, usually irreversible neurological deterioration.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Dick, R.

627,Wilson's disease: various liver presentations,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Previous Indian studies have highlighted the neurological manifestations of this disorder. Eleven patients with Wilson's disease with different hepatic manifestations have been reported. METHODS: Patients referred to the gastroenterology department of a tertiary referral center were investigated for Wilson's disease on the basis of clinical suspicion by slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urine copper estimate. Liver biopsy was performed whenever possible. RESULTS: Patients with Wilson's disease were presented as acute viral hepatitis (n = 5), fulminant liver failure (n = 2), subacute liver failure (n = 2), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2). Penicillamine/trientene and zinc sulfate treatment was started in 9 patients; 5 responded well to treatment, one had to switch to trientene due to penicillamine toxicity, two died and one was out of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease has various liver presentations and should be suspected in all patients with unexplained liver disease. Any young adult presenting with acute hepatitis or fulminant liver failure and with evidence of underlying chronic liver disease or associated hemolytic anemia should be investigated for Wilson's disease. Treatment with penicillamine or trientene combined with zinc sulfate shows improvement in the majority of patients.",,"Gill, H. H.;Shankaran, K.;Desai, H. G.",1994,Jul,,0,1,

The following ESs were recorded: acoustically evoked event-related (ERPs), somato-sensory (SSEPs), visually (VEPs), and brainstem evoked potentials (BSEPs). The results were compared with data from an age- and sex-matched control group. 89% of patients developed clinical signs of basal ganglia dysfunction and 11% had oculomotor or cerebellar symptoms, but none of the individuals had any clinical clues for visual pathway involvement. Psychometrically, 100% had mood disorders without definite intellectual decline. EP records showed 100% ERP, 58.0% SSEP, and 53% VEP and BSEP abnormalities. VEP and BSEP measurements were not correlated with clinical score. There was only a weak correlation between clinical total score and SSEP (right side) and ERP-amplitude reduction. A single significant relationship was found between clinical total score and time-dependent psychometric tests. Thus, Wilson patients with long-term disease detectable by ERP recordings have a fairly high percentage of subclinical cerebral disorders, but not correlated with the clinical status of these patients.",,"Arendt, G.;Hefter, H.;Stremmel, W.;Strohmeyer, G.",1994,Apr-May,,0,0,

Dose-response studies have shown that the 50 mg elemental zinc (50 mg x 3), 25 mg x 3 and 50 mg x 2 regimens 3 times daily are effective, but the 25 mg x 2 and 50 mg x 1 regimens are not. effective enough. These studies suggest that 75 mg per day is close to the minimum effective dose, but does not address the issue of required dosing frequency. In the current study, the authors used the minimum effective daily dose of 75 mg and studied this daily dose in the treatment of four patients with Wilson's disease at the 25 mg x 3, 37.5 mg x 2 and 75 mg x 1 regimens. These data are supported by additional data from 11 patients treated with 25 mg 3 times daily and 2 patients treated with 75 mg once daily. Efficacy was assessed by 10 days of copper balance and absorption of 64 orally administered copper.

642,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XI. Interaction with other anticancer agents,"Zinc (Zn) is increasingly used for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Some doctors prescribe Zn in combination with other copper inhibitors such as penicillamine or triene, but theoretically these drugs can be antagonistic in their effects. In addition, Wilson's disease patients often take high doses of vitamin C in conjunction with Zn therapy, and there are indications of possible interactions between vitamin C, Zn, and copper (Cu). The interactions of penicillamine, triene, and vitamin C with Zn have not been previously studied for the potential effects of these agents on Zn activity in Wilson's disease. Here, we examined these interactions during the maintenance phase of treatment, using Cu balance and orally administered 64Cu absorption as endpoints. We found evidence for possible interactions of both penicillamine and triene with Zn; however, the final result on the Cu equilibrium is approximately the same with Zn alone as with Zn plus one of the other agents. Therefore, simultaneous application seems to have no advantage. We found no detectable interaction of Zn and vitamin C on Cu balance when vitamin C was taken in doses of 1000 mg daily.",,"Brewer, G.

644,Geographical differences in Wilson's disease,"Some features of Wilson's disease (WD) in Asia have been found to differ from those in other continents. The higher prevalence rate in Japan is probably due to a higher inbreeding rate. In Chinese, there is a tight link between WD and esterase D on the long arm of chromosome 13 and the two gene loci for retinoblastoma. The high proportion of patients with hepatic presentation is responsible for the early onset of WD in the Japanese and Chinese series. Skeletal involvement, leg hyperpigmentation, dark complexion, amenorrhea, epileptic seizures, and cerebral white matter degeneration are relatively common in Asian WD patients. Excess copper in the liver appears to have a protective effect against hepatocellular carcinoma and type B hepatitis. Electrophysiological studies show common functional disorders of the CNS in WD. The side effects of penicillamine are quite common and often lead to discontinuation of treatment. Triene has been found to be effective without adverse reactions. Oral zinc therapy may be a viable alternative for the long-term treatment of WD patients in developing Asian countries. [References: 77]",,"Chu, N. S.;Hung, T. P.",1993,Jul,,0,1,

648,Does a vegetarian diet control Wilson's disease?,"The literature shows that copper (Cu) is less bioavailable from vegetarians compared to a mixed diet. Also, many groups, including ours, find average Cu intakes in the typical American diet quite marginal. For example, our data show that Wilson's disease patients in a typical American diet receive only about 25% more Cu than required. This suggests that a vegetarian diet would be an adequate maintenance therapy for Wilson's disease if it reduces bioavailability by approximately 25% or more. The observations of our two patients, preferably on a lactovegetarian diet and almost completely non-compliant with anti-Cu therapy, support this view. These observations suggest that vegetarian diets may be a management tool for Wilson's disease. They further emphasize the marginal Cu intake in American diets and suggest that some apparently healthy people, particularly vegetarians, may be at risk of mild Cu deficiency.",,"Brewer, G.

651,Wilson's disease: diagnosis made in two individuals older than 40 years,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism that is widely recognized as a clinically occurring disease in children, adolescents, and young adults. Unrecognized and therefore untreated Wilson's disease in patients over the age of 40 is thought to occur rarely or not at all. Two cases of Wilson's disease older than 40 years of age are presented. The first is a 42-year-old Israeli woman presenting with fulminant liver failure. Serological and biochemical investigations during fulminant liver failure included copper studies suggesting a diagnosis of Wilson's disease confirmed by examination of the native liver following successful orthotopic liver transplantation. The second case is a 56-year-old Caucasian male admitted to the hospital with a three-year history of neurological dysfunction, pancytopenia, and mild splenomegaly. A number of serological and biochemical studies have suggested the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by quantitative hepatic copper estimation and demonstration of Wilson's disease in three siblings who were diagnosed after the proband case was identified. This man and his brothers were treated with d-penicillamine and had a remarkable improvement in neurological and liver function. The proband is currently doing well 11 years after being diagnosed. These two cases demonstrate that the diagnosis of Wilson's disease should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of individuals presenting with unexplained liver disease in the fourth and fifth decades of life.",,"Bellary, S.

652,Fate of orally administered triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride: a therapeutic drug for Wilson's disease.,"Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TETA) is a therapeutic drug for Wilson's disease. We developed a simple fluorometric method for TETA detection in biological fluids using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and examined TETA concentrations in the serum and urine of two healthy adults given oral TETA. No TETA peak was detected in the serum. The amount of TETA in the urine of the two adults was only 1.6% and 1.7% of the administered dose. However, a large unidentified peak appeared in the urine after oral administration. This peak was not observed in the mixture of TETA and control urine or in the urine before TETA administration. When the urine after TETA administration was analyzed after hydrolysis with HCl, the TETA peak increased while the unidentified peak disappeared. These findings indicate that the substance giving the unidentified peak is a metabolite of TETA and most of the administered TETA is metabolized and subsequently excreted in the urine.",,"Kodama, H.;Meguro, Y.;Tsunakawa, A.;Nakazato, Y.;Abe, T.;Murakita, H.",1993,Jan,,0,0,

In family screening, three other asymptomatic patients were found to be affected. Five of the symptomatic patients had clinical features of liver disease at first presentation and were preceded by renal dysfunction in another patient. The remaining patient presented with neurological features. Six patients had a Kayser-Fleisher ring. Abnormal liver function tests were detected in half of the patients. Ceruloplasmin was decreased in 7 of 10 patients. Serum copper and urine copper estimates were the most useful diagnostic laboratory tests. Morphological changes were found in all 9 patients who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy. All patients were initially treated with D-penicillamine, and clinical response was noted in seven patients, one of whom developed neurological signs while receiving treatment. D-penicillamine was replaced with zinc sulfate in 3 patients who developed thrombocytopenia. The data suggest that Wilson's disease may not be uncommon in Saudi Arabia. For early diagnosis and rapid treatment, the disease should be suspected in appropriate clinical conditions, especially in young patients with liver disease. Close relatives of such index patients should be routinely screened.",,"al Mofleh, I. A.;al Rashed, R. S.;Ayoola, E. A.;Sabah, D. M.;Hafeez, M. A.",1993,Jul-Sep,,0,0,

Four patients were asymptomatic, 4 had mild neurological signs, 2 were moderately affected, and the remaining 6 had the severe form of the disease. All patients were receiving D-penicillamine at the time of study. The most symptomatic patients showed five or more areas of abnormality on MRI. All symptomatic individuals had putamen affected and one asymptomatic and 11 had dystonia on neurological examination. A striking feature was the peripheral localization of putaminal hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images. In eight cases, striatum or ""substantia nigra"" lesions explained parkinsonism seen on neurological examination. MRI appears to be an effective method for examining the neurological involvement of Wilson's disease, allowing for some interesting anatomical-clinical correlations.",,"Barbosa, E.

657,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Progress has been made in locating the gene on the long arm of chromosome 13 and finding nearby probes that can be used to identify affected siblings of newly diagnosed patients. However, the gene has not been cloned and the molecular nature of the defect is unknown. The cause of the disease is the inability to excrete unnecessary and excess copper in the bile for loss in the stool. This may be because the copper packed in ceruloplasmin cannot be excreted into the bile. Clinically, patients usually present with liver, neurological, or psychiatric diseases in the second to fourth decades of life, but diagnosis is often missed or delayed. Reliable studies of copper variables can be done when considering the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Once diagnosed, patients should receive anticopper therapy for the rest of their lives to reduce copper levels and prevent copper re-accumulation. For life-long maintenance therapy, we recommend zinc acetate because of its full efficacy and lack of toxicity; It acts by inhibiting the absorption of copper. No currently available therapy has proven to be ideal for the initial treatment of the patient with acute illness. A chelator-type drug such as penicillamine or triene can be used for initial treatment of patients with liver disease; The switch to zinc acetate can be made after a few months. For the initial treatment of acute patients with neurological disease, chelation should be avoided as neurological deterioration often occurs, possibly due to redistribution of copper that temporarily elevates copper levels in the brain. Zinc therapy is also not ideal for initial treatment because it is relatively slow acting. A new experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, shows promise in the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. The biggest challenges ahead include closing the remaining therapeutic gaps, cloning and expressing the gene to understand its function, and improving clinical diagnosis so that treatment can be initiated as soon as possible.

659,Strategies for the development of new antiarthritic agents,"Therapeutic advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have largely focused on the development of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with improved properties compared to aspirin [Brooks & Day, New Engl. J. Med., 324, 1716-1725 (1991)]. For example, greater efficacy, safety, improved tolerance and reduced dose frequency have been achieved in the elderly. However, these agents are generally considered palliative treatment of the symptoms of the disease. The development of disease-modifying drugs (DMD), also known as second-line drugs for RA, has not been very successful. Most of the agents currently used in this category were originally used to treat other diseases such as malignancy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), Wilson's disease (d-penicillamine), and tuberculosis (gold salts) [Pullar, Br. J clinic. Pharmac., 30, 501-510 (1990)]. Unfortunately, none of the agents are ideal and each has potentially serious side effects. Several attempts have been made to develop agents with novel mechanisms of action that we hope will greatly improve these existing treatments. [References: 47]",,"Lewis, A. J.;Glaser, K. B.;Sturm, R.

660,Wilson's disease: current situation,"OBJECTIVE: To review current concepts related to the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment of Wilson's disease with an emphasis on recent developments. DATA DESCRIPTION: Published information was identified using MEDLINE and through extensive manual scanning of bibliographies from identified sources. CONCLUSIONS: The main biochemical change responsible for impaired hepatobiliary copper homeostasis in Wilson's disease has not yet been identified. The Wilson disease gene has been mapped to chromosome 13, but the function of the gene product has yet to be determined. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease are diverse and often nonspecific, and include a range of hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric manifestations. Penicillamine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease, but recent experience suggests that trientine and zinc may be safe and effective alternatives. All three drugs are likely safe for use in pregnant patients with Wilson's disease. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for Wilsonian fulminant liver failure and corrects the underlying metabolic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Wilson's disease is a hepatobiliary copper excretion disorder, predominantly manifested by hepatic and neurological copper toxicosis and inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Although the specific underlying biochemical defect remains to be identified, specific treatment is available and is usually successful. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is crucial in diagnosing this easily treatable inherited disease. [References: 167]",,"Yarze, J. C.;Martin, P.;Munoz, S. J.;Friedman, L. S.",1992,Jun,,0,0,

663,In vivo interactions of penicillamine with copper and its effect on hepatic metallothionein levels and copper/zinc distribution: implications for the treatment of Wilson's disease and arthritis.,"D-penicillamine does not remove copper from metallothionein, but it has been suggested that it may increase hepatic metallothionein levels. D-penicillamine has been shown to increase rat hepatic metallothionein levels; however, the effect was due to interaction with copper. The drug accelerated the excretion of exogenous copper, but increased the amount retained on metallothionein. This interaction of penicillamine and copper also caused changes in zinc distribution and especially an increase in the heat-stable cytosol zinc fraction. In contrast, thiomolybdates were much more effective at eliminating exogenous copper and even removing copper already bound to metallothioneine; thus, the copper level in the heat-stable cytosol fraction decreased. The observations support the view that although patients with Wilson's disease may not be truly ""decomposed"", treatment with d-penicillamine is effective because the copper accumulated in the liver is non-toxicly bound by increased metallothionein. The results explain why discontinuing treatment is dangerous. The results may also partially explain the efficacy of D-penicillamine copper chelates as anti-inflammatory drugs.",,"McQuaid, A.;Lamand, M.;Mason, J.",1992,Jun,,0,0,

These changes are seen primarily in patients with Wilson's disease or cystinuria receiving long-term therapy. This is the report of a patient with cystinuria using long-term, high-dose penicillamine who developed pseudoxanthoma-elasticum-like lesions. While yellow papules merged with the appearance of 'torn chicken skin' were observed on the armpits and neck, excess skin folds were noted on the anterior armpit line and lower hip. By light and electron microscopy, the involved and unaffected skin showed 'lumpy-bumpy' dermal elastic fibers without calcium deposition.

665,The value of urinary copper excretion after penicillamine loading in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"To investigate the diagnostic value of 24-hour urinary copper excretion test after penicillamine loading in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, 75 consecutive children who presented with various liver problems and whose copper metabolism parameters were investigated were retrospectively analyzed. Seventeen had Wilson's disease, 22 had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 6 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, 12 had chronic liver disease of various etiologies, 4 had cryptogenic acute liver failure, 6 had acute hepatitis and 8 had normal liver. There were several disorders with histological features. appearance. Patients with Wilson's disease had significantly lower serum ceruloplasmin and total copper levels compared to all other groups, but three children with Wilson's disease had normal ceruloplasmin levels and seven had normal total copper levels. There was no significant difference between patients with Wilson's disease and the other groups in terms of free serum copper levels and liver copper content. Baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion was significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease compared with other patients, but levels in six children with Wilson's disease were just above the upper limit of normal, overlapping with values obtained in three children with hepatic failure, two with acute hepatitis, two with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and three with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge proved to be the most accurate single diagnostic test; Levels above 25 mumol/24 hours were present in 15 of 17 patients with Wilson's disease, but 58 with hepatic failure had only 1 child with other disorders.",,"Martins da Costa, C.;Baldwin, D.;Portmann, B.;Lolin, Y.;Mowat, A.

666,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: X. Intestinal metallothionein induction,"Oral zinc therapy is effective in controlling copper balance in patients with Wilson's disease and blocks intestinal absorption of copper, as demonstrated by measurements of copper intake64 and copper balance. In this study, 64Cu uptake measurements were performed with intestinal biopsies to investigate the association of decreased copper absorption with intestinal metallothionein levels in patients with Wilson's disease at different stages of zinc therapy. A significant increase in intestinal metallothionein levels and a sharp decrease in 64Cu absorption were found 4 to 5 days after the start of zinc therapy. Conversely, metallothionein levels decreased and 64Cu uptake increased upon discontinuation of zinc treatment. The data show that 64Cu absorption varies as a function of intestinal metallothionein level. Intestinal metallothionein levels were found to correlate linearly with urinary zinc levels, which reflect body zinc status. These findings support our hypothesis that the reduced copper absorption observed during zinc treatment mediates the induction of intestinal metallothionein. The suppressive effect of zinc on copper absorption appears to have a half-life of approximately 11 days.",,"Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Grider, A.;Nostrant, T.;Cousins, R. J.;Brewer, G. J.",1992,Sep,,0,0,

At 53, her neurological condition worsens after a year of no treatment. DP was re-administered, but after a few weeks the renal laboratory parameters were severely affected. DP was discontinued and zinc sulfate (220 mg three times daily) was given. In this therapeutic regimen, renal laboratory parameters returned to normal after one month. Neurological symptoms improved within one year of this therapeutic regimen. After 31 months of zinc therapy, he remains neurologically asymptomatic and renal function is satisfactory. Patient 2, a 41-year-old female patient, was diagnosed with HLD at the age of 20.

673,Evaluation of portal hypertension: understanding will improve treatment,"The persistence of many uncertainties regarding the evaluation of PHT can be disappointing for many people. Only a few findings, such as increased WHVPG and varicose veins, prove PHT. However, we have gained an important knowledge base. PHT is the result of a series of changes involving the intrahepatic and extrahepatic circulation. Alcohol, viruses, and drugs can disrupt the parenchymal structure and cause cellular swelling, collagen and fibrin deposition, and invasion by inflammatory cells. These processes can eventually develop into cirrhosis. Although parenchymal disorder in its initial stages explains PHT on its own, increased liver function causes metabolic changes that lead to impaired hemodynamics. Advanced PHT in parenchymal liver disease is the result of a complex interaction between local and systemic changes. Current techniques for the assessment of PHT are useful for qualitative aspects: the increase in pressure can be assessed directly or indirectly; the portal venous system can be visualized even without arteriography. Gastroscopy remains a standard procedure for diagnosing PHT. Ultrasound-endoscopy is particularly useful for confirming fundic varices and evaluating changes after sclerotherapy. Increasingly, non-invasive methods such as the Duplex scanner have become available to measure PHT. However, limitations and pitfalls must be realized. Quantitative assessment remains a technique for (yet?) research centers. It is clear that in general practice the clinician can do without many of the more complex techniques discussed here. Currently, PHT and especially varicose bleeding are mostly treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy. For this reason, very detailed studies are needed in very few of the cases. However, increasing knowledge opens new perspectives for the treatment and prevention of PHT at various levels. This can be a highly specific treatment for parenchymal liver disease (antivirals, d-penicillamine for Wilson's disease or veins for hemochromatosis), drugs that can reduce local tissue damage via more general pathways (colchicine, steroids), and drugs that affect flow. Undoubtedly, a more selective portal venous pressure blocker will be available in one of these years. Optimal consideration for this type of therapy requires mastering at least a few advanced techniques. Precautions can be taken for non-cirrhotic PHT with causes ranging from congenital or acquired coagulation abnormalities to anatomical malformations (esophageal mesh) and 'natural healthy herbal tea'. Before treating any of the rarer causes, it is clear that a proper diagnostic workup is necessary.",,"van Leeuwen, D. J.",1991,,,0,0,

Wilson's disease was diagnosed 8 years after the onset of severe liver disease, and D-penicillamine therapy was promptly started in 19 patients. One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received either D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention with the addition of salt restriction and diuretics to penicillamine or trientine disappeared in all but 1 of the patients thus affected. Symptomatic improvement and nearly normal serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels were observed within 1 year in most subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. After 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological therapy, two patients who did not comply with the therapeutic regimen required liver transplantation.

Previous reports have shown that zinc intake reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in normal male subjects. This finding raises the possibility that lifetime zinc therapy may be atherogenic. This study evaluated the effects of zinc therapy on serum lipids over the years in patients with Wilson's disease. Zinc therapy reduces total cholesterol levels by approximately 10% in both sexes and reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by approximately 20% in male patients. The mechanisms of these interesting effects of zinc on cholesterol metabolism are unknown.

Design: Retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up of 14.2 years. LOCATION: A university medical center and a community hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with Wilson's disease were evaluated between 1957 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with D-penicillamine (600 to 1800 mg/day). Liver transplantation was performed in two patients with end-stage liver disease. MAIN RESULTS: First symptoms appeared at a mean age of 15.5 years. The most common neurological findings at the time of diagnosis were dysarthria, tremor, writing difficulties and ataxia, followed by hypersalivation and headache. Somatic symptoms include abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia. The mean serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin and copper were 44 mg/L and 4.7 mumol/L, respectively. Mean basal urinary copper excretion was 5.5 mumol/day and mean hepatic copper concentration was 19.6 mumol/g dry weight. Free serum copper concentration (mean 2.7 mumol/L) was a reliable indicator of disease and was useful in evaluating treatment efficacy (values less than 1.6 mumol/L). D-penicillamine treatment ameliorated most hematological and neurological abnormalities, but had little effect on hepatomegaly and splenomegaly and did not reverse cirrhosis. Two patients died of fulminant liver failure during the observation period, while the other two patients with end-stage liver disease underwent successful liver transplantation and remained asymptomatic.

687,Pathophysiology and treatment of Wilson's disease,"The pathophysiology, symptomatology and treatment of Wilson's disease are reviewed and new approaches to drug management are discussed. Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease that occurs between the ages of 6 and 60 years. Disorders in copper metabolism can cause excess copper to accumulate in the liver, basal ganglia of the brain (lenticular degeneration), kidneys, cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings), and other tissues. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is often overlooked; Nonspecific symptoms and multisystem involvement may mimic other disease states such as neurological and psychiatric disorders and hemolytic anemia. Screening tests for Wilson's disease include 24-hour urine copper levels, serum ceruloplasmin and copper assays, radioactive uptake of 64Cu, and liver biopsy. Current methods of therapy involve the use of a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine) for initial rapid copper removal. Penicillamine treatment has been associated with many adverse reactions, including worsening of the patient's neurological symptoms. Zinc is a useful agent for maintenance therapy. Research studies investigating the use of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for initial rapid copper removal have shown promising results. Left undiagnosed and untreated, Wilson's disease can cause severe symptoms and eventually death. Initial rapid copper removal with chelating agents such as penicillamine and trientine followed by lifelong maintenance therapy with zinc is the current treatment. [References: 85]",,"Tankanow, R.

704,Use of zinc-copper metabolic interactions in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Zinc acetate is becoming a well-established treatment for Wilson's disease. It is excellent for maintenance therapy and for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient. Current evidence indicates that it would also be excellent for the treatment of the pregnant patient. Zinc acts by inducing intestinal cell metallothionein, which binds copper with high affinity, inhibiting its absorption and causing fecal excretion. We have shown that zinc adversely affects copper balance, even at doses as low as 25 mg per day. Zinc in doses of 50 mg three times daily, all doses apart from food, controls abnormal positive copper balance, blocks orally administered 64Cu uptake, controls urinary and plasma copper, prevents hepatic copper re-accumulation, and inhibits its development or progression. Evaluation of copper toxicosis symptoms in patients with Wilson's disease. Zinc acetate will likely be licensed for the treatment of Wilson's disease in the near future. We recommend that physicians use urine and plasma copper and urinary zinc as primary monitoring tools. Contrary to the comfort provided by maintenance therapy, initial treatment of Wilson's patients with acute illness did not turn out well. Patients with neurological disease often initially worsen on penicillamine, and zinc acts more slowly than ideal. For this purpose, we started tetrathiomolybdate studies. Studies of bile secretions from normal subjects show that they secrete regulatory (excess) copper packaged in a protease-resistant ceruloplasmin fragment. This piece is absent in Wilson's disease bile. The gene for Wilson's disease is on chromosome 13, close to the retinoblastoma locus.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Lee, D. Y.",1990,Oct,,0,0,

706,Liver copper concentration in Wilson's disease: effect of treatment with 'anti-copper' agents,"Serial copper determinations were made in the livers of 10 patients with Wilson's disease. To assess the effect (if any) on metal concentration, two were studied before initiation of treatment and eight after. Copper level increased in two patients who did not receive treatment and in one patient who was discontinued. In the second patient, resumption of therapy resulted in a decrease in the copper level in the liver. A similar decrease was seen in seven patients who received continuous treatment. In one patient with very poor compliance, there was a trend for liver copper concentration to rise over a 5-year period. All three treatments studied – penicillamine, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate – appear to be effective at lowering liver copper levels when taken regularly. Sixty-nine single liver copper determinations were plotted against time during treatment. This indicates that the copper concentration decreases rapidly in the first year. There is no linear relationship between subsequent treatment time and liver copper. Poor matchers have higher liver copper concentrations than well-matched ones. Determinations from different parts of the liver showed an overlap between the near-normal and abnormal range in only one of the 19 samples. The main mechanism of action of 'anti-copper' agents in Wilson's disease appears to be the mobilization of copper from the tissues, but then a secondary detoxifying effect may come into play.",,"Gibbs, K.;Walshe, J.

Nine patients experienced toxic reactions to penicillamine and were subsequently treated with trientine. In 22 patients, the diagnosis was made after the appearance of neurological symptoms; In 20 of them, the signs of liver damage disappeared without treatment, but in two, the hepatic manifestations persisted until the central nervous system was affected.

715,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. VI. Initial treatment studies,"Eleven patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease were treated with zinc acetate as the sole anticopper therapy. The duration of treatment ranged from 8 to 37 months. Three of the patients had symptoms; Eight patients who were presymptomatic were diagnosed because of affected siblings with symptoms. All patients were in good clinical condition. Copper absorption was suppressed, as reflected by blocking the absorption of orally administered copper64. 24-hour urinary copper and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper (freely available copper) values were decreased. Liver-derived serum enzymes were also generally decreased in patients with pre-treatment elevations. Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed at baseline and repeated in seven of the patients after 12 to 35 months of zinc therapy. Five of these patients had higher copper levels in the second biopsy sample than the first. In three of these five subjects, a third biopsy, performed 6 to 23 months after the second, revealed liver copper values that were either lower or returning to baseline. One patient's first biopsy specimen showed active inflammation that subsided with therapy. All of the biopsies revealed cirrhosis-specific histological scarring and this did not change over the course of treatment. We conclude that hepatic copper may increase transiently during early zinc therapy, but that accumulated copper is retained in a non-toxic form. On the basis of animal studies, we hypothesize that this sequestered copper is primarily due to the high hepatic metallothionein levels induced by zinc. Zinc appears to be a reasonable option for the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease, particularly those with presymptomatic disease.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V.;Lee, D.

Ceruloplasmin concentrations in the CSF of all patients were almost the same but lower than those of the controls. CSF copper concentrations in patients without neurological signs were within the normal range of 22 +/-6 ng/ml. In contrast, CSF copper concentrations in patients with neurologic manifestations (69-98 ng/ml) were significantly higher than normal levels before and at baseline of D-penicillamine therapy; gradually decreased in response to treatment. These results show that the occurrence of neurological signs in Wilson's disease is not related to CSF ceruloplasmin concentration. CSF copper concentration in this disease appears to reflect copper deposition in the brain and may be useful as a marker to monitor therapy.",,"Kodama, H.;Okabe, I.;Yanagisawa, M.;Nomiyama, H.;Nomiyama, K.;Nose, O.;Kamoshita, S.",1988,Jan-Feb,,0,0,

730,Wilson's disease associated with pancreatitis,"12-year-old boy presented with complaints of abdominal pain and bloating for 2 months. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and D-penicillamine treatment was started. A diagnosis of associated pancreatitis was made at admission, based on elevated serum amylase and an ultrasonically enlarged pancreas. Then, at an 18-month follow-up, there was no abdominal pain with repeated normal serum amylase level and a normal pancreas on ultrasonography. Since abdominal pain is a common symptom at presentation in Wilson's disease, this possibility should be considered in untreated patients. It was concluded that pancreatitis may be associated with Wilson's disease, possibly due to copper deposition in the pancreas and possibly responding to copper chelation therapy.",,"Weizman, Z.;Picard, E.;Barki, Y.;Moses, S.",1988,Nov-Dec,,0,0,

Treatment consisted of antibiotics, decongestants, irrigation, and surgical closure. Complications of treatment did not directly involve the disease, but instead were related to the therapeutic agent penicillamine. Penicillamine causes interference between the cross-links of tropocollagen molecules and breaks down newly formed molecules. Dosage reduction is recommended when surgery is planned to increase collagen formation and therefore healing. In this case, such a precaution was taken. The patient recovered uneventfully.

Twenty-seven patients were treated with zinc sulfate for a total of 142 patient-years. The drug was administered at doses ranging from 300 to 1200 mg/day. Of the 9 patients treated with zinc from the start, 8 recovered and one died of severe cirrhosis. All 8 patients who received zinc after penicillamine intolerance were successful in zinc treatment. Ten patients were switched to zinc after initial treatment with penicillamine without developing signs of intolerance. Eight patients from this group were placed on long-term zinc therapy, and 2 returned to penicillamine due to personal preference. No signs of zinc intolerance were observed. All patients followed a diet containing approximately 1.2 mg of copper per day. Our experience supports the idea that zinc sulfate is a good choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease: the drug is effective, safe and inexpensive.",,"Hoogenraad, T.

CSF copper was elevated in all cases, particularly in four examined prior to treatment. Two patients were followed up for 3 years while being treated with chelating agents. In Case 1, the data and clinical course are presented in detail: daily urinary copper excretion was elevated prior to treatment and increased during this initial treatment phase. The serum copper concentration, which was already low, decreased rapidly during the early stages of treatment and remained at a low level during subsequent treatment. In contrast to its serum level, the copper level in the CSF increased up to 3 times the normal range and decreased very slowly as clinical symptoms resolved. These findings suggest the transport of copper from the CNS to the CSF. Copper concentration in CSF appears to be a valuable parameter for monitoring diagnosis and treatment in patients with cerebral manifestations of Wilson's disease.",,"Weisner, B.;Hartard, C.;Dieu, C.",1987,Jun,,0,0,

However, the clinical consequences of abrupt and permanent discontinuation of penicillamine have not been studied. We studied 11 patients who discontinued their own treatment after successful treatment with penicillamine (1 to 2 g daily) for periods of 3 to 19 years. Eight died of hepatic decompensation or fulminant hepatitis after a median survival of just 2.6 years. In the other 13 patients, penicillamine was discontinued by the physician due to serious adverse events. In these patients, penicillamine was replaced with a newer chelating agent, trientine (1 to 1.5 g per day). Except for one of these patients (who was killed accidentally), 2 to 15 years later alive at this writing. Our observations show that discontinuation of penicillamine therapy in patients with Wilson's disease results in rapid clinical deterioration, often fatal.

Repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging studies after six weeks and 11 months of penicillamine therapy had documented the development of new brain lesions during this period, while liver biopsy specimen data revealed perfect hepatic detachment. To develop knowledge about the relative rarity or frequency of neurological deterioration upon initiation of penicillamine therapy, we conducted a retrospective study of 25 additional patients with Wilson's disease who met the admission criteria with neurological disease and were treated with penicillamine. The answers suggest that this syndrome often occurs, at least from the patient's point of view.

744,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: III. Prevention of hepatic copper re-accumulation,"Twelve patients with Wilson's disease, most of whom were treated intensively with penicillamine, were given zinc therapy as the sole drug for copper control. Serial liver biopsies were performed over a 12- to 20-month follow-up period to determine whether hepatic copper was re-accumulated during zinc therapy. The mean baseline liver copper concentration was 255 micrograms/gm dry weight, while the mean after treatment was 239 micrograms. No patient showed hepatic copper deposition during zinc therapy. Copper balance, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration showed good copper control during zinc treatment. Hepatic zinc concentration increased two to three times from baseline values, but no toxicity was seen. Hepatic zinc concentrations appeared to reach a plateau after 12 to 18 months of zinc treatment. We conclude that oral zinc as the only maintenance therapy in patients with Wilson's disease prevents hepatic copper accumulation.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G. M.;Dick, R. D.;Nostrant, T. T.;Sams, J.

We use oral zinc as another approach to Wilson's disease treatment and copper balance studies as the initial assessment of the adequacy of a particular zinc therapy dose or regimen. We have previously reported that an intensive regimen of zinc (zinc taken every 4 hours) is effective in controlling copper balance. We have now demonstrated with balance studies that a simplified zinc therapy regimen of 50 mg of zinc taken 3 times daily is effective in controlling copper balance. Preliminary studies presented here with other simplified regimens also demonstrate their effectiveness. These studies increase the database of copper balance for the zinc treatment of Wilson's disease and expand the zinc dose range and regimens that have been shown to control copper balance.",,"Hill, G.

751,Hepatic copper and metallothionein distribution in Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism characterized by accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and cornea. In this study, metallothionein (MT), Cu and zinc (Zn) levels in the livers of two Wilson's disease patients were analyzed. In both patients (160 and 298 micrograms/g wet tissue), an approximately 50-fold increase in Cu levels over normal controls was observed. About 73% of subcellular Cu was present in the cytoplasmic fraction and most of it was associated with MT. Analysis of hepatic MT levels showed a 3-fold increase (863 micrograms/g wet tissue) over control human levels (321 micrograms/g wet tissue). Two forms of MT (MT-I and MT-II) were isolated from a liver sample. Both forms contained high amounts of Cu (11 to 12 g atoms/mol), indicating saturation of MT with only 2 to 3 g of zinc atoms. The distribution of MT in hepatocytes was investigated using an immunohistochemical method. In tissue sections with minimal tissue damage, hepatocytes had intense cytoplasmic staining for MT, while tissue sections with extensive necrosis and fibrosis had both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. These results indicate that MT is the major hepatic Cu-binding protein in Wilson's disease, is present in a saturated form with Cu, and is found only in degenerating hepatocytes in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.",,"Nartey, N.

The compounds are novel enzyme inhibitors in vitro and have also apparently been used successfully therapeutically in the treatment of Wilson's disease. While the changes that occur in vivo are complex, they can best be understood as a change in the copper affinities of some competing ligands, including albumin, resulting in a change in the distribution of copper among different systemic pools and an overall depletion.

774,Synergistic neurotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride/carbon disulfide (80/20 fumigant) and other pesticides in grain storage workers,"Neurophysiological, neurobehavioral, and neuropsychological profiles were described in 17 grain storage workers, 1 grain inspector, and 4 malt laboratory workers. The effects of CS2 toxicity, as seen in viscose rayon workers and experimental animals, are very similar to the clinical profile of our grain storage workers. The use of CS2 explains altered behavior and cognition changes as well as dysfunction of peripheral axons, auditory nerve, optic nerve and extrapyramidal system. The signs and symptoms in these workers appear to be dose-related, and we note that workers leaving areas where fumigation occurred reported improvement not seen by other workers who continued a fumigant treatment routine. Likewise, malt lab workers who were exposed only to grain dust for 3 to 7 years showed only minimal symptoms. While a number of mechanisms have been proposed for altering neuropsychological function, the chelating ability of CS2-derived DDC and its ability to markedly increase copper and zinc within the central nervous system suggest a mechanism of toxicity similar to copper poisoning as in Wilson's Disease. and may explain the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms in these patients. Chelation of copper can be therapeutic in CS2 poisoning. It is clear that both basic and clinical research will be required to resolve the questions posed. We applaud the EPA's decision to ban the use of 80/20 fumigants, as well as methyl bromide, and rely on careful scrutiny of similar toxicants before they are selected to replace these previous toxic agents. We further condemn the technique of reintroducing grain dust into the food chain instead of destroying it, because the dust contains a very high percentage of fumigant residues. We speculate about the possible role of CS2 and other pesticides in the food chain and the incidence of Parkinson's symptoms in these patients and the general public.",,"Peters, H. A.;Levine, R.

775,"Mice and humans, metals and mutations","Several mutations that affect copper and zinc transport have been discovered in humans and mice over the past 15 years, adding to the long-known defect of copper transport in Wilson's disease. Menkes disease (classic and mild variant forms) and X-linked Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IX, X-linked cutis laxa) share features in common with each other and with mottled (Mobr) and mottled (Moblo) mouse mutants, respectively. Each species may have a series of allelic mutants, or each may have two loci. The mouse toxic milk mutant (tx) may be homologous to human Wilson's disease. The intestinal malabsorption defect of zinc in Acrodermatitis enteropathica does not yet have a homolog in the mouse. However, the lethal milk (lm) mutant in the mouse may be homologous to the zinc deficiency state described in several breastfed low birth weight infants. Many more genetic defects related to the transport of copper and zinc remain to be discovered. Conversely, these mutants are valuable in elucidating the normal processes of copper and zinc transport.

776,Genetic diseases of copper metabolism,"There are several known examples of mutations affecting copper homeostasis in humans and animals. Pleiotropic effects are observed when the mutant gene disrupts copper flux. In some cases, the mutation changes the level of a particular copper ligand (enzyme), and the clinical results are unique. The two most studied genetic diseases in humans are Menkes and Wilson diseases. Menkes disease is an X-linked fatal disease in which copper accumulates in some organs (bowel and kidney) and is low in others (liver and brain). Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease in which, if left untreated, copper accumulates in the liver and subsequently in the brain and kidney. The pathophysiological consequences of copper deficiency and toxicity characterize these two disorders. Specific mutations of human cuproenzymes include excessive production of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in Down syndrome, absence of tyrosinase in albinism, hereditary mitochondrial myopathy due to decreased cytochrome c oxidase, and altered lysyl oxidase in the X-linked forms of cutis laxa and Ehlers-D. Syndrome. Mutations that alter copper metabolism are also known in animals. Several murine mutants have been studied. The most extensively studied mutants are speckled mice, particularly speckled mice, which have a mutation similar to Menkes' disease. Another recently identified murine mutation is toxic milk (tx), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper accumulation in the liver. Two other mutants, wrinkled and trembling, were once thought to exhibit abnormal copper metabolism. Recent data did not confirm this. A mutation very similar to Wilson's disease has been described in Bedlington Terriers.",,"Prohaska, J. R.",1986,,,0,0,

In this case, the effective dose was found to be above 1650 mg/day. Mental state as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was clearly associated with penicillamine dose.

Zinc deficiency is seen in premature infants born to zinc-deficient lactating women, as is seen in acrodermatitis enteropathica and fatal milk rats.

797,"Clinical, endocrinological and biochemical effects of zinc deficiency","The necessity of zinc for humans was recognized in the early 1960s. Causes of zinc deficiency include malnutrition, alcoholism, malabsorption, extensive burns, chronic debilitating disorders, chronic kidney disease, certain diuretics, use of chelating agents such as penicillamine for Wilson's disease, and genetic disorders such as acrodermatitis enteropathica and sickle cell disease. The need for zinc increases during pregnancy and growing up. Clinical manifestations in severe cases of zinc deficiency include bullous-pustular dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhoea, emotional disturbance, weight loss, intermittent infections, hypogonadism in males, and are fatal if left untreated. It is characterized by moderate zinc deficiency, growth retardation and delayed puberty in adolescents, hypogonadism in boys, rough skin, anorexia, mental lethargy, delayed wound healing, taste abnormalities, and abnormal dark adaptation. In mild cases of zinc deficiency in human subjects, we observed oligospermia, mild weight loss and hyperammonemia. Zinc is a growth factor. As a result of its deficiency, growth is adversely affected in many animal species and humans. Since zinc is needed for protein and DNA synthesis and cell division, the growth effect of zinc is believed to be related to its effect on protein synthesis. Testicular functions are adversely affected as a result of zinc deficiency in both humans and experimental animals. This effect of zinc is at the end-organ level and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is intact in people with zinc deficiency. Since zinc is closely related to cell division, its deficiency can negatively affect testicular size and thus function. The incidence of degenerated oocytes in mice, hypohaploidy and hyperhaploidy in metaphase II oocytes increased due to zinc deficiency. At physiological concentrations, zinc reduced prolactin secretion from the pituitary in vitro and it has been suggested that this trace element may have a role in the regulation of prolactin secretion in vivo. Thymopoietin, a hormone required for T cell maturation, has also been shown to be zinc dependent. It is clear that zinc may have many roles in the biochemical and hormonal functions of various endocrine organs. Future research in this area is much needed. [References: 78]",,"Prasad, A.

800,Interactions of trace elements: clinical significance,"We studied the interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. The usual situation in sickle cell anemia is mild to moderate zinc deficiency due to kidney loss of zinc. Zinc deficiency appears to produce a slight excess of copper and an increased level of ceruloplasmin, possibly by increasing copper absorption. With zinc treatment, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc will often lead to copper deficiency when administered (without food) in a manner to achieve efficacy. We took advantage of the copper-depleting effect of zinc to design a new treatment for Wilson's disease. Zinc inhibits the absorption of copper from food by inducing intestinal metallothionein and inhibits the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, thus creating a negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are confident that zinc blocks the accumulation of copper in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, zinc therapy will be available as an approach to treating this deadly disease. The animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity, undoubtedly via the intestinal metallothionein mechanism, when both elements are administered orally. In preliminary experiments in rats, we were unable to demonstrate that toxicity from non-oral lead ingestion is affected by oral zinc supplements. [References: 22]",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G.

806,[Myasthenia gravis induced by D-penicillamine in a patient with progressive systemic sclerosis],"The development of autoimmune diseases in some patients treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) suggests the occurrence of a conduction disorder at the reported neuromuscular junction and a reversible development of myasthenia gravis in rheumatoid disease, progressive systemic sclerosis, or Wilson's disease after use. It is part of a general predisposition for autoimmune disease associated with DPA therapy. The reported case is an example. DPA-induced myasthenia gravis (MG) is clinically and electrophysiologically similar to spontaneous MG, but ocular manifestations predominate in the former. Antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor have been demonstrated and also thymic hyperplasia has occurred. Regarding the onset of myasthenic manifestations, the duration of treatment with DPA ranges from 6 to 10 months. The effect of DPA on the neuromuscular junction is different from that occurring in spontaneous MG. The pathogenesis of DPA-induced MG is still unclear. The chemical properties of DPA allow it to react with many proteins, and some changes in proteins may appear, along with structural changes in the composition and antigenicity of collagen fibers. In vitro, DPA causes degradation of acetylcholine receptor bridges to alpha, beta, and gamma subunits by reduction of SS bridges in the gamma subunit. This reduces the high affinity coupling and reduces the SS coupling at the alpha unit near the acetylcholine coupling, eliminating the positive cooperation system. The interaction between DPA and the receptor can induce the antigenic change in this latter by initiating the autoimmune phenomenon. The other possibility is that stimulation of prostaglandin E-1 synthesis by DPA interferes with the neuromuscular junction by filling the allosteric site of the ACh receptor.",,"Marchiori, P.

824,Biological roles of ionic zinc,"From our study, we conclude that intracellular calcium acts as a second messenger to influence membrane function through calmodulin activation. This activation, if too large, leads to pathological erythrocyte adhesion and aggregation phenomenon. We have shown that calmodulin inhibitors can prevent some of these calcium-induced abnormalities. As some of this work involved a very specific antimodulin antibody, it seems very likely that calmodulin is involved in producing membrane effects. Zinc appears to act on the membrane, at least in part, through inhibition of calmodulin action. Our study leads us to believe that zinc regulates copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract in a somewhat complex way. That is, direct zinc-copper antagonism in the gastrointestinal tract lumen is not sufficient to explain the effects of zinc on inhibiting copper absorption in humans. From our study, it appears that tissues must be loaded with zinc before an effect on copper absorption can be observed. This creates a lagging effect where zinc application does not produce a negative copper balance. However, after this delay effect, zinc produced a negative to neutral copper balance in 5 of the 5 Wilson disease patients studied. Therefore, we believe that at present, zinc therapy can be offered as an alternative to penicillamine therapy in previously decompensated patients or in patients who are not yet symptomatic. However, we recommend that this therapy be used only in accordance with the only zinc therapy regimen we have tested at this time. [References: 35]",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G. M.;Prasad, A.

To determine the extent of myocardial degeneration in newly diagnosed or chronically treated Wilson's disease, we reviewed the autopsy findings of 9 cases with this condition. We compared our observations with 3 control subjects with liver disease selected for comparable age and with no known association with cardiac degeneration. Our results revealed cardiac hypertrophy in 5 of 9 Wilson's disease cases. All cases had varying degrees of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, intramyocardial small vessel sclerosis, and evidence of focal inflammatory cell inflammation. One case had AV nodal degeneration and a 15-year-old boy had severe atherosclerosis of the left main coronary artery. Two patients died suddenly, possibly secondary to an arrhythmia; one of these patients had the most prominent myocardial changes. We could not specifically associate these changes with tissue copper levels, D-penicillamine therapy, or the presence of cirrhosis. We conclude that patients with Wilson's disease have definite morphological abnormalities in their hearts consistent with cardiomyopathy. Although myocardial changes are not specific, the fact that 2 patients died suddenly suggests the need for a prospective study of cardiac function in these patients in the future.",,"Factor, S.

834,"Zinc, brain and behavior","The total zinc content in the adult human body averages 2 g. This is about half the total iron content and 10 to 15 times the total body copper. In the brain, zinc is associated with the most dense metal, iron. The highest levels of zinc are found in the hippocampus, synaptic vesicles, boutonniere, and mossy fibers. Zinc is also found in large concentrations in the choroid layer of the retina, an extension of the brain. Zinc plays an important role in axonal and synaptic transmission and is required for nucleic acid metabolism and brain tubulin growth and phosphorylation. Zinc deficiency has been associated with impaired DNA, RNA and protein synthesis during brain development. For these reasons, zinc deficiency during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to be associated with many congenital abnormalities of the nervous system in offspring. In addition, insufficient zinc levels in children have been associated with low learning ability, apathy, lethargy and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc and vitamin B-6, and have excess lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease, and Pick's disease are brain disorders that are dynamically related to zinc levels.

The most common abnormalities were ventricular enlargement, 73 percent; cortical atrophy, 63 percent; brainstem atrophy, 55 percent. Characteristic hypodense areas in the basal ganglia regions were present in 45 percent and were almost always accompanied by one or more CT abnormalities. This combination of findings is considered specific to Wilson's disease in the appropriate clinical context. CT abnormalities were most common and most pronounced in patients with a neurological presentation, only 2 out of 40 patients with normal scans. Similar changes were shown in three-quarters of patients with hepatic presentation and in about half of presymptomatic patients. Nineteen patients were screened on multiple occasions to evaluate the effect of treatment with penicillamine or triethylene tetramine on the abnormalities noted at baseline. Fourteen showed basal ganglia hypodensities on the initial scan, and ten of these had a moderate to significant improvement in this abnormality in response to treatment. In response, there was a significant clinical improvement. Despite the rather severe signs of CT abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease.

It has been suggested that copper uptake in PBC is hepatotoxic, analogous to Wilson's disease, and this has been the rationale for the use of D-penicillamine in this disease. The hypothesis that copper is hepatotoxic in PBC has not been tested, and in this study we evaluated the role of liver copper retention in the pathogenesis of PBC. Sixty-four patients with PBC were studied. Fifty-four had increased liver copper concentrations. Liver cell synthetic function is well preserved. All patients had normal prothrombin times and only two had subnormal serum albumin concentrations. There was no correlation between liver copper concentrations and the degree of liver cell damage assessed biochemically (aspartate transaminase) and histologically. Electron microscopy was performed on liver biopsies of five patients with markedly increased liver copper concentrations. Liver cell fine structure was compatible with cholestasis. Liver cells contained electron-dense lysosomes that were shown by x-ray probe microanalysis to contain copper and sulfur. Characteristic organelle changes associated with copper toxicity were not observed in Wilson's disease. The biochemical, histological and histochemical differences between PBC complicated by liver copper retention and Wilson's disease indicate differences in copper processing in this disease. We found no evidence in this study to suggest that copper plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction in PBC.",,"Epstein, O.;Arborgh, B.;Sagiv, M.;Wroblewski, R.;Scheuer, P.

Chromatographic and uv/vis and electron spin resonance (esr) spectroscopic methods were used. The main species formed at neutral pH and 0.15 mol dm-3 NaCl is the violet species, which has been shown to have the same stoichiometry as the recently reported solid-state complex, namely [Cu8I Cu6II(Pen)12 Cl] 5-. The rate of formation (MVC) of this species has been shown to depend on Cu concentration, Cu:Pen ratio, relative Clion concentration, pH, and temperature. Formation is inhibited by the presence of O2 and biological chelates. At the concentration levels found in blood plasma, the MVC ion is unlikely to have any significance in the therapeutic effect of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Re-examination of the aqueous Cu-albumin-pen system reinforces previous findings that the pen is unable to mobilize albumin-bound Cu. While significant binding of the pen to the protein was observed, it was not related to any protein-bound copper ions. Evidence is presented that amino acid-Cu-Pen-type ternary complexes can form in blood plasma. However, these are unlikely to be physiologically significant and in cases of Wilson's disease Pen-induced copper depletion must occur elsewhere than in the blood plasma compartment.",,"Laurie, S.

The role of copper toxicity in the progression of PBC is supported by the observation that the highest values occur in conjunction with advanced hepatic failure. Corticosteroid therapy appears to reduce hepatic copper levels in PBC. While this treatment does not always lower hepatic Cu content in patients with PBC, it does in many individuals. Therapeutic trials with D-penicillamine are ongoing. Once the results are available, they will guide us in the management of individual patients with PBC. Meanwhile, dietary copper should be restricted, as in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Benson, G. D.",1979,Jan-Feb,,0,0,

In chronic active liver disease, chronic persistent hepatitis, cirrhosis and transitional cases of aggressive chronic hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, the mean copper excretion before penicillamine ranged from 29 gamma to 48 gamma/24 hours; however, in some cases the daily copper excretion exceeds 100 gamma in people with liver disease as well as in normal people. After 900 mg of DL-Penicillamine was taken, the mean cupuriuresis values ranged from 500 gamma to 600 gamma/24 hours.

Serum ceruloplasmin levels were decreased in five patients (25%) with chronic active hepatitis and normal at the time of diagnosis in seven patients (28%) with Wilson's disease. It failed to provide an accurate distinction between the two groups, as 24-hour urinary copper excretion was elevated in all patients with Wilson's disease and in five of eight patients with chronic active hepatitis studied. Hepatic copper levels were higher than 400 micrograms/gm dry weight in all patients with Wilson's disease, while those with chronic active hepatitis had levels less than 300 micrograms/gm dry weight. The discriminative value of hepatic copper concentration makes it the most reliable test to distinguish chronic active hepatitis and Wilson's disease in children and adolescents. Serum ceruloplasmin level may not be significantly accurate for definitive diagnosis in this age group.",,"Perman, J. A.;Werlin, S. L.;Grand, R. J.;Watkins, J. B.",1979,Apr,,0,0,

Until now, many clinicians felt that deficiency states are unlikely to develop except in very extreme conditions, as the presence of trace elements is so common in nature. The increasing use of total parenteral nutrition seems to have made this perspective untenable. Recognition of additional genetic diseases of trace element metabolism, such as Menkes' kinky hair syndrome and acrodermatitis enteropathica, has also served to focus clinical attention on trace elements. As time goes by, additional diseases of trace element metabolism will undoubtedly be noticed. [References: 57]",,"Burch, R. E.;Hahn, H. K.",1979,Sep,,0,0,

Urine was collected for three periods of 0 to 8 hours, 8 to 24 hours after injection, during which a test dose of penicillamine was administered and from 24 to 30 hours. Stable (endogenous) copper was also predicted on these samples and specific activity was determined. This was multiplied by a correction factor to allow for changes in dose and body weight. Findings of stable copper in the urine were largely predictable. Controls and heterozygotes had the least copper excretion, with amounts peaking in symptomatic patients in presymptomatic patients. The institution of treatment was associated with a decrease in copper excretion proportional to time. The most important radiochemical findings are as follows. Heterozygotes secreted less injected copper than controls, both under basal conditions and after penicillamine. Presymptomatic patients excreted less radiocopper than heterozygotes after penicillamine, although excretion was much greater during the baseline 24-hour period. Patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease had by far the highest radiocopper excretion in all three time periods, which decreased after treatment proportionally over time as for stable copper. These results were subjected to computer analysis. There was no overlap between the various groups, except for a single control subject who combined pyramidal and extrapyramidal system degeneration of uncertain etiology. This patient was classified as 'heterozygous' by computer study. These findings further support the hypothesis that loss of a single gene for copper balance can be detected with a high degree of accuracy, and that presymptomatic patients can also be selected from a sibling for prophylactic treatment without the risk of unnecessary exposure to healthy heterozygotes. and potentially dangerous long-term treatment.",,"Gibbs, K.;Hanka, R.;Walshe, J.

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have sometimes been attributed to treatment with D-penicillamine and its toxicity; however, we found that cytopenia is a common finding in presented laboratory data from patients with Wilson's disease. Twenty-eight patients (52%) had thrombocytopenia, and 16 of these patients (30% of the total) also had leukopenia. Severe, acute, intermittent hemolytic attacks were the first and only complaint of one patient. Splenectomy was performed in six of the patients with significant cytopenia, and peripheral blood counts returned to normal values in all cases. Long-term treatment with D-penicillamine improved hepatic and neurological dysfunction in most patients; however, cytopenias remained unchanged except for three patients (treated for 2, 5 and 10 years).",,"Hogland, H.

893,Failure of L-dopa to relieve active stiffness in Parkinson's disease,"Stiffness in Parkinson's patients can be easily measured by determining the net work required to passively flex and extend the forearm through an arc of 100 degrees. The stiffness measured in this way can be divided into two very different types, resting and activated. Resting rigidity, measured when the patient is relaxed, responds to all effective therapeutic agents and is closely related to the degree of clinical improvement. Active rigidity measured during voluntary activity is not relieved by any currently available medical treatment. Pre-treatment levels remain unchanged even in patients with transient dramatic improvement in clinical symptomatology. Longitudinal measurements in hundreds of Parkinson's patients at intervals ranging from 5 to 15 years show consistently high levels of activated stiffness over the entire study period. In marked contrast to our extensive experience with Parkinson's patients, there is a single, well-documented case of Wilson's disease who appears to have recovered completely, both by clinical examination and by all machine measurements. This patient had a high level of extrapyramidal deficiency that was measured repeatedly over a four-month period while penicillamine therapy was being investigated. He then suddenly returned to normal and returned to full-time work. High values of resting rigidity, activated rigidity, akinesia, and resting tremor all returned to normal and remained normal in the last 6 years. The meaning of this study is that L-dopa and related treatments only mask the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and do not delay the underlying pathological process. On the other hand, penicillamine probably relieves the destructive process in Wilson's disease and in early cases may permanently relieve extrapyramidal dysfunction.",,"Webster, D. D.;Mortimer, J.

Two main types of chronic or primary hypomagnesemia are known, resulting either from impaired intestinal absorption or from improper use of magnesium by the kidneys. In acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal recessive disease that causes characteristic skin lesions, alopecia and dystrophy, low zinc concentrations in serum, urine and hair are measured. Intestinal absorption of zinc is reduced. Two inherited disorders of copper metabolism are known, with low serum and usually caerulosplasmin concentrations.

This was accompanied by acute renal failure. Studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential of hemodialysis as alternative excretion pathways for peritoneal dialysis, ultrafiltration-reinfusion deacidification, and copper in the absence of adequate renal function for urinary excretion of penicillamine. The largest amount of copper, assessed against increasing bath concentrations, appeared to be eliminated by hemodialysis. However, this was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum copper concentrations with rapid clinical and biochemical deterioration leading to death within 48 hours. A small amount of copper was lost by acid removal. Significant amounts of copper were removed during peritoneal dialysis (36 mumol/day (2287 micrograms/day)), but a clinical response was not evident prior to hemodialysis. Oral, intravenous, or intraperitoneal administration of penicillamine did not cause a measurable increase in copper excretion into the peritoneal dialysate. Therefore, peritoneal dialysis alone appears to offer the greatest potential benefit both in eliminating copper and in altering the course of this fulminant form of Wilson's disease.",,"Hamlyn, A.

Of the 35 symptomatic patients initially seen and treated at the Mayo Clinic, 34 (97%) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 6 (17%) sunflower cataracts at diagnosis. In patients followed for one year or longer, penicillamine treatment resulted in improvement of Kayser-Fleischer rings in 18 (90%) of 20 patients and complete clearance of sunflower cataracts in 4 of 5 patients. The specific pattern of copper deposition in Kayser-Fleischer rings and treatment remediation occurred in four reproducible steps. None of the five asymptomatic siblings of patients with known Wilson's disease had Kayer-Fleischer rings at the time of the initial study. One in five (untreated) Kayser-Fleischer rings developed 20 months after the first normal slit lamp examination. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and the absence of other ophthalmological signs (such as nystagmus, cranial nerve palsies, and other movement disorders) can be of great help in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Once the condition is diagnosed, specific medical treatment with penicillamine and a low copper diet dramatically improves what would otherwise be inevitably fatal.",,"Wiebers, D. O.;Hollenhorst, R.

These mothers had 15 pregnancies among them, 13 of them full term, but two terminated early at 26 and 30 weeks. In only one, pregnancy had an adverse effect on Wilson's disease; this mother had been on penicillamine for only two and a half years at a suboptimal dose due to drug-induced thrombocytopenia. There were also diffuse esophageal varices and pregnancy was complicated by toxemia. The other nine patients remained well, and two had three pregnancies each. Penicillamine was taken six times throughout pregnancy, but was discontinued in seven from week six to week twelve. All 15 babies were normal, but one died of extreme prematurity (26 weeks gestation).

906,Peroxisomes of human hepatocytes,"In an ultrastructural study of human liver biopsy specimens, we found that peroxisomes are regularly found in normal human hepatocytes. Their relationship with the endoplasmic reticulum observed in other species and other organs is also proven in this material. Some normal peroxisomes were found to show marginal plates or peripheral crystalline inclusions, which are also present in pathological specimens. In some inherited metabolic disorders (Menkes' hair disease like steely hair, analbuminemia) the volume of individual peroxisomes has been shown to be significantly reduced. However, most pathological processes affecting hepatocytes appear to produce any or more of the following: increased volume or numbers per cell, changes in shape, changes in matrix consistency, appearance of dense numbers per cell, changes in shape, changes in consistency. The appearance of the matrix in parts of the cytoplasm, the appearance of dense inclusions or clustering of peroxisomes. Some of these abnormalities are reversible based on observations in three patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. The mean +/- standard deviation of peroxisome diameters in four normal subjects was 0.618 +/- 0.143 mm. Significant decreases or increases in the mean diameter of peroxisomes were noted in all but two of the 16 pathological samples. Other morphological abnormalities were present in the remaining two specimens. We conclude that various pathological processes involving hepatocytic cytoplasm exert differential effects on peroxisomes. Although no specific pattern of morphological changes emerged from this exploratory study, a possible involvement of peroxisomes should be considered when metabolic or pathological processes affect the liver.",,"Sternlieb, I.;Quintana, N.",1977,Feb,,0,0,

915,Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration),"Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that usually affects young people. Excess copper accumulates in tissues, especially in the liver, brain and cornea. This copper deposition results in a wide variety of hepatic and neurological symptoms and can cause psychiatric illness. Liver involvement often occurs in childhood, while neurological deficits are usually detected at a later age. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Ocular findings are particularly important because corneal copper deposition forming the Kayser-Fleischer ring is the only pathognomonic manifestation of the disease. The structure of the ring and the presence of copper have been well established. Anterior capsular copper deposition in the lens causes a characteristic sunflower cataract in some of these patients. Other ocular abnormalities have been described but are much less common. The pathogenesis of the disease and the underlying genetic defect remain unclear. It is clear that there is excess copper in the tissues, but the mechanism of its accumulation is unknown. It is somehow related to its inability to normally synthesize the serum copper protein ceruloplasmin. Another theory proposes that an abnormal protein with a high affinity for copper may bind the metal in tissues. Diagnosis can be suggested by clinical signs and confirmed by the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring. In the absence of these findings, biochemical determinations are necessary. The most important of these are serum ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, and hepatic copper concentration in biopsy. Treatment consists of administering a copper chelating agent, penicillamine, and avoiding high copper intake. This usually results in significant clinical improvement if irreversible tissue damage has not occurred. Lifelong maintenance therapy is required to maintain negative copper balance. The detection and prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic individuals with the disease is particularly important. Seven cases of Wilson's disease are presented to illustrate many of the features discussed with emphasis on ocular findings.",,"Herron, B. E.",1976,,,0,0,

Normalization of hepatic copper concentration markedly lags behind the clinical situation. Significant improvement in clinical status was achieved after half to one year of treatment.

It results from heterozygous function mutations or deletions in ZEB2. While no skin manifestations of MOWS have been documented, we have found for the first time that MOWS patients have hyperextensibility and fragility of the skin, similar to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy analysis of skin from a MOWS patient revealed dermal collagen fibrils with markedly reduced diameters. To examine the role of ZEB2 in collagenogenesis, ZEB2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were generated by crossing ZEB2<sup>flox</sup>/<sup>flox</sup> mice with Cre mice under the control of the prx 1 promoter, to target the mesoderm. Newborn ZEB2 cKO mice were small and showed abnormalities in teeth and scalp bone. Notably, the skin of ZEB2 cKO mice appeared loose and extremely supple, and histological examination revealed hypoplasia of the dermis. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that dermal fibroblasts (DFs) from ZEB2 cKO mice had decreased collagen 1 and 3 genes but increased MMP13 gene. Electron micrograph of ZEB2 cKO mice showed abnormally small diameter collagen fibrils similar to those in a MOWS patient. Finally, ZEB2 cKO mice showed impaired fibrogenesis by subcutaneous injection of bleomycin. These results suggest that ZEB2 contributes to de novo and induced collagen formation and, more importantly, that MOWS is relevant to a new subtype of EDS.",,"Teraishi, M.;Takaishi, M.;Nakajima, K.;Mizuno, S.;Hiraki, Y.;Fukada, T.;Shimoda, S.;Asada, Y.;Wakamatsu, N.;Furukawa, T.;Sano, S.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.08.416,0,0,
1108,Psychosis in Wilson's disease: an unusual presentation of bipolar affective disorder.,"Psychosis is a rare but recognized symptom of the neurological effects of Wilson's Disease [1]. We report the applicant's presentation after C, a 55-year-old woman, showed a regression in her mental state. On initial assessment in the ER, he was restrained by security and police and was aggressive in his behavior. He was speaking quietly, voicing paranoid persecuting hallucinations, euthymic and ambivalent affect, oscillating between anger and crying, and showing boundless love in a frontal manner. He was completely devoid of insight. He was detained for an evaluation period under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 2007. C. had multiple prior admissions under the MHA. Past primary diagnoses have included Wilson's Disease and Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD). He developed Cirrhosis of the Liver, abdominal varices, portal and pulmonary hypertension (WHO functional class II), and massive splenomegaly secondary to Wilson's Disease. Has a history of behavioral outbursts; obtaining a forensic history for assault and drunken and disorderly behavior against staff, police and family members. She had stopped taking all her medications, including penicillamine, in the weeks leading up to her admission to the hospital. A. neurologic examination revealed broad-based gait and minor bradykinesia and ataxia. C did not have flapping tremor, dystonia or myoclonus. All other findings on neurological examination were normal. The patient's copper level was 1.7 imol/L, ceruloplasmin value was 0.04 g/L, and bilirubin was 50 imol/L. Complete blood count showed pancytopenia and long blood scan highlighted vitamin D deficiency and low calcium. CT of his head showed hypodensity in the putamen, worse on the left. There was no mass, infarction or infectious process to explain the lesions. This was consistent with an MRI brain performed several months prior to admission that showed hyperintensity in both putamines. Such changes are considered to be associated with Wilson's Disease [2]. These findings, together with C's behavior suggesting frontal lobe involvement, suggested to the management team a diagnosis of psychosis secondary to neurological Wilson's Disease. He was effectively treated with Paliperidone depot (100 mg monthly), 4 mg Risperidone ON, and Penicillamine (750 mg BD) along with the usual medication he used for liver cirrhosis. So far, his condition is stable and he has not been re-admitted. MRI and CT brain findings with C's longstanding Wilson's Disease questioned the diagnosis of BPAD. His previous presentations on the Casenote review included behavioral and neurological examination findings consistent with neurological sequelae of Wilson's Disease. Psychiatric symptoms are common in Wilson's Disease, with one study finding that 20% of WD patients see a psychiatrist [3]. Mainly personality change and depression are typical features, psychosis is a rare but recognized feature. Psychiatric symptoms are a known side effect of Penicillamine, clouding the diagnostic clarity [1]. Literature reviews suggest that Wilson's Disease may present with only psychiatric symptoms many years before neurological or hepatic symptoms develop. Therefore, Wilson's Disease should not be ignored in unusual presentations of psychosis, such as case C.",,"Black, L. F.;Underwood, J. F. G.",2017,October,,0,0,
1109,Optical coherence tomography as a marker of neurodegeneration in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disease that causes pathological copper accumulation in different organs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is recommended as a marker of neurodegeneration in many neurological diseases. Thinning of the total retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness (Mth) examined by OCT was detected especially in patients with WD with brain magnetic resonance imaging changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between OCT parameters and the progression of neurological symptoms measured by the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) in patients with WD. OCT was performed to evaluate macular thickness and total RNFL in consecutive patients with WD admitted to the Neurology Department. Patients also had neurological assessments according to UWDRS part III. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (UWDRS+) and absence (UWDRS-) of neurological symptoms. Fifty-eight patients (34 women, 24 men) were recruited. The mean duration of treatment was 9 years (standard deviation [SD], +/-10.8). The mean UWDRS score during the study was 8.4 (range 1-52; SD +/-13.9). Total RNFL and macular thickness were significantly reduced in the UWDRS+ group compared to the UWDRS- group. A significant negative correlation was found between OCT parameters (RNFL and Mth measurements) and neurological impairment according to the UWDRS scale. This study confirms that OCT may be a useful tool to measure the degree of neurodegeneration in patients with WD and may play a role in monitoring disease progression.

1110,Diagnosis and treatment of fulminant Wilson's disease: a single center's experience,"Background: Medical therapy is rarely effective in patients with fulminant Wilson's disease (FWD). Liver transplantation is limited at diagnosis in most patients with FWD due to lack of donor liver. The new Wilson index, end-stage liver disease (MELD) model, and Child-Pugh score are useful tools in deciding liver transplantation; however, neither of these is a stand-alone determinant tool. It is worth exploring a more effective and practical therapeutic strategy for patients with FWD and re-evaluating their prediction systems. Methods: Nine patients with FWD associated with hemolytic crisis and fulminant liver failure (FHF) were studied. The clinical presentations, prognostic scores and medical treatments of the patients were examined. Results: Of the 9 patients with FWD who received extensive corticosteroid, copper chelating agent (dimercaptopropanesulfonate sodium), and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), 6 patients recovered from FHF. The remaining patient recovered with extensive treatment, but died 51 days later of septicemia. Two patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) died of liver failure within three or five hospital days without plasma exchange or chelating therapy. All 9 patients with FWD presented with acute liver failure, severe jaundice, and mild to severe hemolytic anemia. There was no significant difference in the incidence of severe hemolytic anemia between the surviving and deceased groups. However, the incidence and degree of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was higher in the non-survivor group than in the survivor group. Unlike the deceased group, no complications caused by bacterial infection were observed in the surviving group. The variation of prothrombin activity (PTA) between the surviving and deceased groups was more pronounced when compared with the new Wilson index, Child-Pugh score, and MELD score. Conclusion: Severe hepatic encephalopathy and/or spontaneous episodes of bacterial peritonitis show a worse prognosis for patients with FWD, and PTA is a recommendable predictor. Immediate liver transplantation should be considered in patients with PTA less than 20% or with severe HE and/or SBP. Comprehensive corticosteroid, copper chelating agent, and TPE therapy are effective in patients without SBP and PTA greater than 20%.

1111,Dystonic dysarthria in Wilson's disease: efficacy of zolpidem,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disease characterized by copper overload in the liver and brain. Neurological manifestations are mainly related to copper deposition in the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. Dysarthria is a common symptom with dystonic, spastic or parkinsonian components and is often resistant to medical or voice rehabilitation treatments. Here, we present a 12-year-old patient diagnosed with WD, who presented with severe and persistent dysarthria of dystonic origin, unresponsive to benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs. At the age of 25, he tried zolpidem at bedtime due to sleep difficulties and reported that this drug had a paradoxical effect on his voice. To confirm the effect of zolpidem on dystonic dysarthria, we performed a full evaluation of dysarthria with 10 mg twice daily without zolpidem at baseline and after 4 days of treatment. Lexical reach was assessed by semantic fluency; with dysarthria, Intelligibility Score, spontaneous speech and reading rates, maximum phonation time over long vowel [a], and a perceptual assessment. Two hours after ingestion of zolpidem, improvement was observed in all parameters tested, except for the maximum phonation time. Semantic fluency increased by 59%, spontaneous speaking rate increased by 88% and reading speed increased by 76%. General dystonia remained unchanged and tolerance to zolpidem was satisfactory. Since then, the patient takes zolpidem 5 mg five times a day and after 4 years shows persistent improvement in oral communication and good drug tolerance. In this single case study, we show that regular daily intake of zolpidem can have a lasting effect on complex dystonic dysarthria that is resistant to usual medical treatments.

1112,Oromandibular Dystonia in Wilson's Disease,"Background: Movement disorder is common in Wilson's disease (WD), but there are no reports of oromandibular dystonia (OMD). We report on the frequency, severity and MRI correlation of OMD with neurological manifestations (WDNM) and response to treatment in Wilson's disease. Methods: Consecutive WDNM patients were included and clinical, haematological, serum chemistry, and MRI findings were noted. Neurological severity of WD and OMD was evaluated. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score for dystonia was recorded. Patients were treated with penicillamine, zinc and multiple antidystonic drugs. Clinical improvement was noted at 3 and 6 months. Results: Overall, 61 (91%) of 67 WDNM patients had OMD and the median age was 13.5 years. The median severity of OMD was 2.5 (range, 1-4). Thirteen patients were anarthric and 12 patients could not eat. The severity of OMD included drooling (r = 0.29; P = 0.02), BFM score (r = 0.63; P < 0.001), pancytopenia (r = -0.26; P = 0.04), and serum ceruloplasmin (r = 0.33; P = 0.01), but not by the location and number of MRI lesions. Compared to baseline, the severity of OMD improved at 6 months (P < 0.001) but not at 3 months. None of them were asymptomatic. Improvement in OMD paralleled improvement in severity of WDNM (r = 0.26; P = 0.04) and BFM score (r = 0.31; P = 0.02). Conclusion: OMD was a common manifestation of WDNM, occurring in 91% of patients, and OMD partially resolved during the study period.

1114,Wilson's disease: what has been confirmed in diagnosis and treatment? [German],"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by abnormal copper accumulation. Various clinical symptoms of WD, which presents a wide variety of phenotypes and is therefore a chameleon within the group of metabolic diseases, may include hepatological, neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Early-onset presentations in infancy and late-onset symptoms in adults older than 70 years have been described. If typical laboratory blood test values are missing, WD can be difficult to diagnose and often involves a combination of different parameters. New test methods, such as the identification of relative exchangeable copper, have not yet been validated in an adequate cohort of WD patients and therefore do not currently play a crucial role in the clinical setting. In conclusion, any patient with a reasonably suspected diagnosis of WD should be referred to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist and/or (pediatric) neurologist. Different medical treatments including drugs such as copper chelating agents are widely used in the clinical setting. There may be an ultima rate in liver transplant selected patients. Dietary changes that include a low copper diet play only a minor role. Because the use of tetrathiomolybdate remains unapproved, the treatment of advanced and progressive neurological symptoms remains a major challenge. In any case, lifelong medical supervision and treatment led by a specialist is absolutely necessary. Early diagnosis and early and lifelong treatment provide a better prognosis and do not adversely affect overall life expectancy. Copyright © 2017 Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH",,"Pfister, E.

1115,"Evolving Perspectives in Wilson's Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment and Monitoring","Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessively inherited copper overload disorder, remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Over the past decade, direct sequencing of the affected gene ATP7B has become commercially available, but interpretation of results still requires careful attention. Therefore, a combination of tests reflecting impaired copper metabolism is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. Due to the low disease frequency, current treatment concepts are not based on controlled pathways. Here, recent outcome reports from larger cohort studies challenge recommended treatments and require individualized treatment strategies. The notion that some medical regimens may be insufficient to maintain copper homeostasis or lead to clinically significant overtreatment requires continued monitoring of patients, even after decades of treatment.

1117,Significant heterogeneity in the diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease (WD): results from a large Spanish registry,"There are uncertainties about diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in patients diagnosed with WD, which is one of the few rare diseases in hepatology. Our aim was to evaluate whether the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of WD in a large multicenter Spanish Registry was homogeneous across centers. METHODS: Observational, descriptive study of GEMHEP (Spanish Group of Female Hepatologists) collecting clinical and laboratory data from 126 WD patients followed in 28 Spanish hospitals. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 20 (range: 1-74) years, 60% were male. Median follow-up (FU) was 16 years (1-44). The most common presentation was hepatic (70%; median age: 18 years), followed by mixed (12%, median age: 33 years) and neurological (8%; median age: 23 years). In the remaining 10%, the diagnosis was made through family screening. Kayser-Fleisher ring and cirrhosis were present at the time of diagnosis in one third of the cases. Discordant results were observed regarding diagnostic non-invasive laboratory parameters in 58% of cases; While ceruplasmin (CP) levels were decreased in 88% of cases, only 43% of patients had 24-hour clipping over 100 mcg/24 hours at the time of diagnosis. Intrahepatic copper concentration was used in most patients, with results consistent with WD in 79%. Genetic testing was performed in half of the patients, most of whom (83%) had mutations compatible with WD. DP and Zinc (Zn) were the most common initial treatments used as single agents in 76% and 18% of patients, respectively. Half of the patients changed therapy during follow-up at a mean of 8 years, mostly due to the transition to Zn maintenance therapy (median 7 years 47%) or toxicity (39%, median 2 years). ). Although good compliance was observed in 90% of patients, up to one-third of patients had abnormal liver enzymes at the last FU visit. Overweight and hypertension were more common in these patients (p=0.006 and 0.05). Additional data are being collected to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of factors associated with non-normalization of liver enzymes. RESULTS: Discordant results with standard tests for the diagnosis of WD were common in our multicenter Spanish cohort. This variability may be due to the lack of reproducibility between laboratories, which has forced invasive techniques to be applied in a significant number of patients. Although most patients start treatment with DP, switching to Zn is the norm because of the maintenance protocol and/or toxicity. In one-third of cases, complete normalization of liver enzymes was not achieved, possibly for unrelated reasons.",,"Berenguer, M.",2017,October,,0,1,
1118,Clinical presentation and outcome of Wilson's disease patients in a single-center liver reference center cohort,"Promotion. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that causes liver cirrhosis and neuropsychological deterioration. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low disease frequency. Take aim at. Determine the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with Wilson's disease in a patient cohort from a French liver reference centre. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD who were examined at a liver reference center at the Paul-Brousse Hospital in Villejuif, France. The patients were evaluated clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Liver involvement was evaluated by liver biopsy and/or liver stiffness measurement. Results. We included 107 patients, 54 (50.5%) women and 53 (49.5%) men, with hepatic symptoms of WD from 1974 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 15 years, with extremes ranging from 1 to 44 years. 57 of 107 patients (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed symptoms, neurological and hepatic) at presentation. The mean age at diagnosis of WD is 20.1 (>10.54) years, and there is a difference between the “Hepatic group” (17<=8.6 years) for hepatic symptoms and the other group (23>11.4 years) with neurological symptoms (23>11.4 years). ) ( p=0.0081). Liver pathological analysis was performed in 65 (70%) patients, and liver stiffness was measured in 72 (67%) patients. Seventy-three (68%) patients had cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis of the disease. Among the patients with mixed symptoms (neurological and hepatic), 43 patients (76%) had cirrhosis, while 30 (61%) patients with isolated liver symptoms had cirrhosis. Thirty-four (32%) of 107 patients were transplanted at a mean age of 27 (>12.2). Eighteen (52%) patients who required liver transplantation had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) severe neurological disease and 5 (14%) liver cancer. Chelation therapy was predominantly D Penicillamine in 104/107 patients. 37 (35%) patients required a change in treatment due to side effects of Trientine or Zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke, and one after liver transplant for severe neurological symptoms. Solution. At the time of the presentation of Wilson's Disease, two-thirds of patients referred to a hepatology reference center had cirrhosis and one-third required liver transplantation.

1119,Excretion of WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) after intravenous administration in rat models,"Background Wilson's disease (WH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by toxic free copper (Cu) accumulation. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a Cu-protein binding agent under development for WD. WTX101 rapidly binds Cu to form a stable ternary complex of tetrathiomolybdate, Cu and albumin. We aimed to characterize the excretion pathways and rates of intravenous (IV) WTX101 168 hours after administration. Methods Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats (a model for WD) and Long Evans Agouti (LEA) rats (control strain with normal Cu metabolism) were administered a single IV dose of WTX101 at 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg. WTX101 was measured as molybdenum (Mo) in urine, feces and selected tissues collected over 168 hours. Results In the LEC WD rat model, WTX101 was partially excreted at 168 hours. Up to 45% of the Mo dose was recovered in the faeces: renal clearance corresponds to 29% of the dose and biliary clearance approximately 16%. Mo appeared to be eliminated in two phases: a rapid elimination mainly in the urine during the first 48 hours and a slower fecal elimination still continuing at 168 hours. In contrast, control LEA rats showed almost complete elimination of WTX101 within 168 hours (87%), mostly by renal clearance during the first 24 hours (79%). Considering only the excreted Mo, the ratio of renal and fecal excretion was 9:1 in LEA rats and 6:4 in LEC rats. In both LEC and LEA rats, Mo in the urine corresponded to molybdate, the terminal degradation product of WTX101. Excretion and tissue distribution of Mo were similar for the two WTX101 dose levels. Differences in Mo tissue distribution were found only in LEC and LEA rats for organs with high Cu content due to the WD phenotype: significantly more tissue Mo was found in LEC liver at 168 hours (with 1.5 mg/kg: 31.5% vs. 5.6% of dose) and kidney (7.6% vs. 1.5% dose) compared to LEA rats. Conclusion In the WD model, biliary excretion of Mo from WTX101 was enhanced compared to controls, possibly reflecting differential biotransformation under normal and Cu-overload conditions, and was consistent with the proposed MoA of WTX101. LEA controls have low amounts of Cu available to bind to tetrathiomolybdate; this allows a greater proportion of tetrathiomolybdate to be converted to molybdate, a terminal degradation product that does not bind Cu and is excreted in the urine. In the LEC WD model, excess Cu binds in a tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin ternary complex, preventing the conversion of tetrathiomolybdate to molybdate, resulting in lower urinary elimination and higher fecal excretion. The different tissue distribution observed between models is also consistent with the WTX101 MoA.",,"Plitz, T.;Boyling, L.",2017,October,,0,0,
1120,Decompensated wilson's disease: Advanced hepatic encephalopathy and high bilirubin decide the need for liver transplantation. Will the new Wilson index help?,"Background: The decision for liver transplantation in decompensated Wilson's disease (WD) is very difficult. The New Wilson index (NWI), previously thought to be useful, now has conflicting reports about its effectiveness in predicting the outcome of WD. Methods: 74 of 85 WD cases were either acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) or decompensated CLD (DCLD). They were managed with supportive care along with a combination of D-pentylamine and zinc salt. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to see the association of risk factors with poor outcomes (liver transplant or death) at any time during hospitalization. Results: Of the 74 people, 46 (62.2%) improved medical treatment, and 28 (37.8%) either died within 3 months of diagnosis (21) or had an organ transplant (7). The presenting symptom was jaundice in 100% of ACLF and 13 (33.3%) of DCLD. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was present in 52 (70.3%) of 74 decompensated cases (ACLF or DCLD): 29 cases had HE 1/2 grade and 23 cases had HE grade 3/4. Grade of HE 3/4 was present in 19/35 (54.2%) of ACLF and 4/39 (10.2%) of DCLD, and the difference was significant (OR 10.39% 95% CI 3.03-35.5, p=0.00) . Among those with poor outcomes, ACLF rates (35/35, 51.4%) were significantly higher (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.15-8.16, p=0.0031) than DCLD (10/39, 25.6%). Of those with a New Wilson Index (NWI)>11 (33/74 cases), 12 survived and 21 had poor results. Twenty of the 28 people with a bad outcome had a 3/4 degree of HE. HE grade 3/4 (OR 35.8 95% CI 8.58-149, p=0.00), bilirubin >20 mg/dl (OR 14.3, 95) % compared with univariate analysis of clinical and biochemical parameters to identify risk factors for poor outcome CI 3.58-57.2, p= 0.000), ACLF as presentation (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.15-8.16, p=0.031), AST (Mean difference 160.8, 95% CI 64.8-256, p=0.001), INR (Mean) difference 1.63, 95% CI 0.93-2.33, p=0.000), NWI (Mean difference 5.37, 95% CI 3.67-7.08, p=0.00) and PELD/MELD score (Mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2) , p=0.00), was significantly associated with poor outcome (table 1). The LRA model (HE grade 3/4, Bilirubin >20 mg/dl or HD score, NWI or INR or PELD) increased from 62.2% to 86.5% before and after model release. Significant association with poor outcome in LRA was only seen with HE grade 3/4 (adjusted OR 37.8, 95% CI 7.68-186.49 p= 0.000) and bilirubin >20 mg/dl (corrected OR15.5, 95% CI 2.7-86.8) p=0.002). Conclusion: HE grade 3/4 and elevated bilirubin (>20 mg/dl) are independently associated with liver transplantation need in decompensated WD. NWI did not show a significant independent association with the need for liver transplantation.",,"Alam, S.;Sood, V.;Khanna, R.;Lal, B. B.;Pawaria, A.",2017,October,,0,0,
1121,Epigenetic regulation of the thioredoxin system in an animal model and patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B, leading to copper deposition in the liver and brain. Excess copper has been shown to cause oxidative stress and impair DNA methylation. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation with the methyl donor, choline alone or in combination with the copper chelator, penicillamine (PCA), would alter the hepatic expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response pathway known as the thioredoxin system in Jackson toxic milk (tx). -j) WD's mouse model. We also examined the whole blood DNA methylation profile in healthy and WD patients. Methods: Fetal mouse liver: wild-type and tx-j dams consumed a normal or high choline diet 2 weeks before conception until embryonic day 17, at which time fetal livers were harvested. Adult tx-j strain liver: mice were randomized to one of 6 treatment groups: 1) normal choline in dam and strain; 2) high choline in dam, normal choline in generation; 3) high choline in dam and generation; 4) normal choline in dam, normal choline in progen+PCA; 5) high choline in dam, normal choline in progen+PCA; 6) dam high choline, progen+PCA high choline. Livers were collected at 24 weeks of age. Humans: DNA isolated from whole blood of 10 healthy (9M/1F) and 10 WD patients (9M/1F) was bisulfite-converted and used to prepare Methyl-Seq libraries for sequencing on an Illumina 2500 HiSeq. Samples were matched for age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity, and all WD samples harbored the H1069Q mutation in the ATP7B gene. Results: Fetal hepatic transcript levels of oxidative stress-related genes, thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), were lower in fetal livers of tx-j mice compared to wild-type and subsequently returned to normal in tx-j livers. maternal choline supplement. At the 24-week generation, hepatic transcript levels of Txn1 and Prdx1 were significantly higher in males and females receiving maternal and continuing choline compared to all other treatment groups (10-46% and 17-41%, respectively). PCA-treated males and females that did not receive choline after weaning had lower Txn1 levels (23-31%) compared to untreated tx-j mice. Txn1 hepatic protein expression exhibited the same pattern as Txn1 gene expression. Of the 40 Txn-related genes studied in human blood, 5 genes exhibited hypermethylation (7-28%) and 2 genes hypomethylation (5-6%) in WD patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Maternal and continued choline supplementation affects Txn1 hepatic transcript and protein levels in tx-j mice, and patients with WD exhibit altered blood DNA methylation profiles of genes related to the Txn system.",,"Kieffer, D.

1122,An ongoing extension of the phase 2 study of wtx101 in newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients,"Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class copper-protein binding agent that forms ternary complexes with albumin, reducing plasma ceruloplasmin unbound copper (NCC) and increasing biliary copper excretion. In a Phase 2 study, oral once-daily WTX101 rapidly reduced and controlled NCC, improved disability and neurological status, and stabilized liver function in newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's Disease (WH) after 24 weeks. Here we present preliminary data from 24 to 48 weeks from the ongoing extension period. Methods: All 22 patients who completed the 24-week open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study chose to continue WTX101 therapy with once-daily response-guided individual dosing. Key parameters reviewed at 24 to 48 weeks were change in NCC levels corrected for copper in triple tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes (NCC-corrected), liver status, neurological and disability scores using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and safety. Results: Patients (18 to 64 years of age, 45% male, 86% at study entry with varying degrees of neurological symptoms and approximately 50% with cirrhosis) received WTX101 once daily at a dose of 7.5 to 60 mg/day; most patients take 30 mg/day. Between weeks 24 and 48, the mean NCC correction remained in control (0.9 µM at week 24 and 0.5 µM at week 48). The mean international normalized ratio, albumin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and End Stage Model of Liver Disease (MELD) score improved or remained unchanged at week 48 compared to week 24, indicating stability of liver function. Reversible ALT elevations observed in approximately 1/3 of patients before week 24 were not observed during the extension period. Patients showed sustained improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (2.2 vs 4.1) and neurologic score (12.5 vs 16.6) at week 48 and week 24. WTX101 was generally well tolerated. Neutropenia observed in one patient at 36 weeks returned to normal with dose reduction. One patient discontinued treatment because of the desire to become pregnant. One patient with a progressive disease course experienced neuropsychiatric worsening despite continued therapy. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be well tolerated in patients with WD who exceed 24 weeks of treatment. Initial improvements in free copper levels and hepatic and neurological status were maintained or further improved with WTX101, suggesting that WTX101 may be an effective maintenance therapy for WD. These findings, together with the simple dosing regimen, suggest that WTX101 has the potential to meet many unmet needs in the treatment of WD.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F.

1125,The emergence of unusual de-novo neurological disorders after orthotopic liver transplantation in Wilson siblings: a case report of three sisters.,"Background: Wilson's Disease (WD) is an autosomal disorder of copper metabolism that results in progressive cirrhosis of the liver, neurological impairment, and kidney failure. Although WD is rare in number, it accounts for 6-20% of emergency Liver Transplants (LT) due to its rapid deterioration. This study presents two of three sisters with WD who developed serious neurological complications after orthotopic liver transplantation. Case Report: Three sisters, aged 28, 25 and 19, with a known case of WD cirrhosis and normal neurological status, underwent LT from deceased donors. The first and third sisters developed severe new-onset neurological disabilities 6 and 8 months after transplant, respectively, while the second sister showed no symptoms. Pre-transplant magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed bilateral basal ganglia hyperintensity on T2, particularly the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, and fluid-attenuated inversion healing sequences for both patients. Ceruloplasmin, copper, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion at diagnosis were 13 and 12.9 (mg/dl), 26 and 32 (lg/dl), and 9 and 21.8 (lg) in the first and third sisters, respectively. Post-transplant neurological findings included ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhea, and tremor. In addition, unilateral blepharoptosis was observed in the youngest sister. Continuous application of a chelating agent (mainly zinc sulfate) has been considered against copper toxicity. Neurological symptoms improved significantly 6-8 months after transplantation. Conclusion: Although the published literature shows that better pre-transplant conditions seem advantageous in achieving better outcomes in patients with WD, close monitoring of neurological symptoms remains an important area in the long-term post-transplantation process. Moreover, this phenomenon needs to be studied further in these siblings, as new-onset neurological deficits are not expected in WD following LT.",,"Aliakbarian, M.;Rezayat, K.

It originated in a family from Granada (Antioquia, Colombia) and was born in Cali (Colombia). We present three cases of this disease treated at a high-level institution. The index case started with neuropsychiatric disorder, the second case was diagnosed according to family history, and the third case started with steatohepatitis. The diagnostic score recommended by the Eighth Meeting on Wilson's disease was 3 in two of the patients and 4 in the third.

1128,Ancillary partial orthotopic living liver transplant for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disease that involves copper metabolism disorders that cause copper accumulation, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson's disease can be treated with pharmacological agents such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplantation is the only treatment option for Wilson's disease when liver failure occurs. In some patients, namely those with Child-Pugh A score, neurological disease can be seen without liver failure. Our recommendation is to perform auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation in these patients. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurological disease due to Wilson's disease who underwent successful living donor partial orthotopic liver transplantation from the left lobe. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease as a result of neurological symptoms such as tremor, walking and speech problems, and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, and liver biopsy was performed. The chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18 and the patient was given chelation therapy. Liver functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father, whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplantation, serum ceruloplasmin levels at day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. Liver function tests were normal at 1 month. Doppler ultrasonography showed native liver and normal vascular flow of the graft. The patient's neurological symptoms gradually decreased. Progressive neurological deterioration without hepatic failure is considered a suitable indication for adjunctive partial orthotopic liver transplantation; This procedure is recommended before the neurological and hepatic failure symptoms of Wilson's disease appear.

1130,Was Cavum Septum Pellucidum the Cause of a Persistent Seizure in a 17-Year-Old Boy with Wilson's Disease?,"Background Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is often found incidentally in several populations, sometimes becoming symptomatic when significantly enlarged. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare, autosomal recessive congenital disorder of copper metabolism characterized by abnormal copper accumulation in various tissues, especially liver and brain. While seizure disorder is rare in both CSP and WD, it can occur in a few patients with any of the conditions. Case Description We present a 17-year-old male patient who developed persistent seizures for one year and was known to have WD that could not be controlled with high doses of antiepileptics. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enlargement of his pre-existing CSP, which was small and asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of WD. His WD was in remission when he developed seizure disorder. He survived the seizure at endoscopic cyst fenestration. Conclusions Symptomatic CSP is a rare disease, but the association of WD is even rarer. Endoscopic cyst fenestration is a new procedure that can be successful in appropriately selected cases. To our knowledge, WD-related CSP has not been reported in any English literature.

1132,Zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"Introduction and Aims: AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). However, there are few reports of zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD. Here, we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children under 10 years of age with asymptomatic WD in Japanese pediatric centers and establish criteria for appropriate maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to examine 21 children (median age 6 years, range 1-9) who met the diagnostic criteria for WD at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to symptom onset. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urine copper 1-7 years after the start of zinc monotherapy. We performed abdominal ultrasonography and evaluated clinical signs of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The recommended dose of zinc acetate for the <= 5-year-old patient was 25 mg twice daily; For children 6 years of age and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L, and decreased if zinc had side effects such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: AST/ALT and 24-hour urine copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 mug/day (5.8+/-2.9 cups/kg/day) at the time of diagnosis. . days), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT dropped significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after initiation of therapy and mostly remained below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST /ALT : 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/L at 1 and 7 years after initiation of therapy, respectively. Twenty-four-hour urine copper dropped significantly to 49+/-21 cups/day (2.2+/-1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) 6 months after the start of treatment and was mostly kept below 75 cups/day, and the study 1 to 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder (2.2+/-0.6 and 1.5+/-0.2 cups/kg/day 1 and 7 years after initiation of treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy has proven to be highly effective and safe for young children with asymptomatic WD.

1133,Liver transplantation in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; a polycentric French experience,"Promotion. The standard treatment for Wilson's disease (WD) is a chelating copper agent or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of sudden severe hepatic failure or severe worsening under treatment. The indication for LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation is controversial. Take aim at. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of LT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods This is a retrospective study. From 2002 to 2015, seventeen patients underwent LT due to severe neurological complications of WD, without hepatic failure, without improvement despite medical therapy. Chelating copper was given to all patients and chelating copper was given to 4 patients with zinc salts. Twelve patients presented 5 patients after discontinuation of therapy with no worsening after the diagnosis of WD and no improvement after well-conducted therapy. Assessment of disease severity was done with the Unified WD Rating Scale (UWDRS) before and after LT. Results. The main neurological symptoms combined dystonic postures (15/17), parkinson's syndrome (9/17) and tremor (3/17). The mean age at diagnosis of WD was 17.9 [6-39] years, and the time between worsening and LT was 12.6 [3-24] months. The mean age in LT was 20.2 [11-41]. An emergency procedure was required for access to transplantation for all patients. After analysis of the native liver, all patients had cirrhosis. The CHILD score was A for all patients at the time of transplantation. The mean follow-up time after transplantation was 51.8 [3–156] months. Survival at 1, 2, and 5 years was 84%, 75%, and 66%, respectively. For patients who died of severe sepsis after LT, 16 [1.5–36] after a pause. All of these 4 patients had severe sepsis remaining in the intensive care unit prior to LT. In the context of swallowing disorders, 12 (70%) patients required nutritional support (gastrostomy or jejunostomy) and 9 (53%) needed tracheotomy. All patients who were alive showed an improvement after LT. The mean percent improvement of UWDRS was 61.2% (+/-22.2). According to percent improvement, 6 patients (35%) showed a major improvement (>70%), 5 patients showed moderate improvement (30% to 70%), and 2 patients (12%) showed a slight improvement (<30%). Solution. In Wilson's disease, liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in patients whose neurological symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with adverse evolution died of severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms and previous severe sepsis represent debilitating factors.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Brunet, A.

1134,Copper and molybdate metabolism in newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients treated with WTX101,"Background and objectives WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational drug with a novel copper binding mechanism. The WTX101 has a favorable stability profile. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of WTX101 on copper and molybdenum metabolism parameters in this phase 2 trial. Methods 28 newly diagnosed adult patients with blood and urine WD copper and molybdenum parameters were followed during treatment with WTX101. Results Urinary molybdenum excretion was strong, reaching an average of 20-25% of the administered dose 4 weeks after the start of treatment, with 24-hour molybdenum excretion ranging from 10 to 20 mmol. This showed good drug absorption. Urinary molybdenum excretion as a percentage of WTX101 dosage was the same for 15 and 30 mg/day, but less for 60 mg/day dosing, suggesting possible absorption saturation at doses > 30 mg/day. Molybdenum in the urine is excreted as molybdate, the terminal degradation product of tetrathiomolybdate. The mean 24-hour urinary copper was ~4 mmol or 254 mg before treatment and decreased at week 12 and week 24. Total plasma Cu levels were increased due to tetrathiomolybdate redistribution of hepatic Cu stores into the blood, forming a triple tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-. albumin complex. Levels decreased over time. Total plasma Cu levels closely followed total molybdenum in plasma, consistent with ternary complex formation. At steady state, the majority of molybdenum in plasma was part of a ternary complex with traces of molybdate not bound to Cu. A correction factor was calculated for the proportion of Cu redistributed to the blood compartment per mole of Mo and allowed to determine free copper. Free Cu, considered as non-ceruloplasmin Cu (NCC) adjusted for molybdenum, decreased over time. Summary Administration of WTX101 was accompanied by a strong urinary molybdate excretion showing good drug absorption. Urinary copper excretion decreased over time in line with decreases in NCC molybdenum-corrected free plasma copper. Total plasma Cu levels followed total plasma molybdenum, reflecting hepatic Cu redistribution and tri-complex formation in the blood. Result WTX101 redistributes hepatic Cu into the blood as tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin ternary complex. The non-Cu-binding drug is excreted in the urine as molybdate. Urinary copper excretion parallels improvement in copper metabolism and may be a useful marker to monitor in WD patients treated with WTX101. WTX101 is a new agent for the treatment of WD and a better understanding of the relationship between molybdate and copper metabolism is important for optimizing treatment and monitoring.",,"Askari, F.

1135,Wilson's disease: Sex-specific changes in methionine metabolism and mitochondrial function in a mouse model.,"Background and Purposes. While women with Wilson's disease (WD) present with acute liver failure more frequently than men, men present with neurological involvement more frequently than women. While these findings are attributed to hormonal factors, gender differences may be related to epigenetic mechanisms and their relationship to mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to determine whether the parameters of methionine metabolism and mitochondrial function differ by gender in an animal model of WD. Methods Tx-j mice (n=9 males; n=8 females), a WD model, were euthanized at 24 weeks of age to examine differences in transcript levels of genes involved in methionine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Targeted metabolomic analysis by LC-MS was performed on plasma samples to compare acylcarnitine profiles. An additional group (n=4 males; n=4 females) was treated with oral D-penicillamine (PCA) for 12 to 24 weeks to compare gender-related responses to copper chelation. Results. Men showed worse hepatic inflammation than women (1.6 +/- 0.6 vs 0.9 +/- 0.32; p<0.05), steatosis was similar and mild, and fibrosis was absent. Liver S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels were lower in males and higher in S-adenosylhomocysteine, resulting in a lower SAM-SAH ratio (2.2+/-0.7 vs 2.8+/-1; p<0.05), compared to global DNA. an indicator of methylation potential. The transcript levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) were higher in females and lower in males of Ndufab1 and Atp5j related to mitochondrial complex I and complex V, respectively. Metabolomic analysis revealed higher levels of unsaturated acylcarnitine 14:2 and saturated acylcarnitine 12:0 in women compared to men. PCA halved hepatic copper levels in men but was ineffective in women. Histological response to PCA was similar in both sexes, and there was no change in SAM and SAH levels in response to PCA. Among women, Dnmt1 transcript levels were significantly down-regulated after PCA, indicating an overall less improvement of mitochondrial function in association with higher 10-acylcarnitine levels. Results. Male and female mouse models of WD differ by parameters of methionine metabolism, mitochondrial function, and response to copper chelation therapy. These data provide insight into the gender differences observed in patients with WD and demonstrate the need to adjust chelation therapy for gender differences.",,"Medici, V.;Shibata, N.;Kharbanda, K.

1136,"An ongoing phase 2, multicenter, open-label, study of WTX101 in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease","Background and objectives WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational drug with a novel copper binding mechanism that has been tested in an ongoing prospective study to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's Disease (WD). Methods Patients >18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of WD and treatment-naïve or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <= 2 years initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD, and after 6 weeks, dosage was guided by laboratory and clinical criteria. Regular assessments included safety, liver disease status, neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and copper metabolism parameters. Results 28 patients were included in the study. At trial entry, most patients were untreated or treated with WD therapy for <= 28 days, only 5/28 treated for > 90 days. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 mM), 25/28 had neurological signs at baseline and mean UWDRS III. it was episode 22. The modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5. Adverse events (AEs) included reversible liver elevation. tests (n=5, 3 related to dose escalation per protocol) and neutropenia (n=2). After the initial dose was reduced from 60 mg to 15-30 mg QD per day and dose escalation was limited to 60 mg QD, WTX101 was well tolerated with several AEs. Hepatic status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable in all patients. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over time during treatment. Other Cu measurements (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) show a similar copper removal pattern. UWDRS part III scores were greatly improved in patients with neurological signs or stable in those without. Daily activity status (UWDRS part II) showed a similar improvement. Summary WTX101 appears to be safe and well tolerated as initial therapy in patients with WD. Improvements were observed in liver and neurological disease, Cu metabolism and daily activity status over time with WTX101 treatment. More data is being collected. Conclusion Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to determine its safety and efficacy for initial treatment of WD. The potential for once-daily dosing will improve patient comfort and adherence to therapy.",,"Schilsky, M. L.;Askari, F. K.;Ferenci, P.;Ala, A.;Czlonkowska, A.;Nicholl, D.

1137,Use of serum zinc level to predict severity of Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper accumulation. Zinc (Zn), a copper antagonist used as a therapy in WD, can inhibit intestinal copper absorption by upregulation of metallothioneins (MTs). However, no study has been done on the link between Zn and WD severity. Our aim was to evaluate the serum Zn level in various liver diseases and to examine its relationship with the new Wilson index (WI) score (1) used to predict the severity of WD. METHODS: Medical records of 26 patients with WD (8 WD and 18 without WD-ALF with acute liver failure (ALF)) and 69 patients without WD (31 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 29 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) medical records) and 9 uncertain ALF cause), initial serum Zn data before disease diagnosis were reviewed in our tertiary care hospital between 2005 and 2015. Disease-causing mutations were identified in all WD children and a new WI score was calculated for all. Adjusted Zn, Adjusted Zn<inf>patient</inf> = (0.25xZn<sup>normal</sup>) + ((albuminnormal albumin patient)x( Zn<inf>patient</inf> - (0.25xZn<) sup>normal</sup>))) Correlation between adjusted Zn level and new WI score was statistically analyzed by Pearson Correlation. RESULTS: WD-ALF was lower adjusted compared with non-WD ALF, NAFLD, AIH, and indeterminate. He had Zn level. Cause of ALF (7.3 (5.2-11.6), 13.8 (6.1-20.2), 13.7 (11.2-16.7), 9.9 (5.3-31.4) and 11.4 (7.6-17.8), respectively, P < 0.05. Demographic data and laboratory results Indeed, there was a significant correlation between the corrected Zn level and the new WI score in WD patients (r = - 0.554, P value = 0.004). Conclusion: Serum Zn level can predict the phenotypic severity of WD. In particular, low serum Zn level, WD -Can distinguish ALF from uncertain cause of ALF (1) Dhawan A, Taylor RM, Cheeseman P, et al. transplantation (Table Presented).",,"Sintusek, P.;Kyrana, E.;Dhawan, A.",2016,October,,0,0,

1139,Liver Transplantation in Wilson's Disease with Neurological Disorder: Evaluation in 4 Patients,"Background: The purpose of this study is to report our early experience of the benefits of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of persistent neurological symptoms in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: We describe our findings in 4 WD patients with neurological impairment or symptoms treated with LT: 2 patients underwent transplantation due to worsening of neurological symptoms despite long-term appropriate medical therapy. The other 2 required LT because of symptoms associated with liver failure. Patients were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale and the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: Neurological improvement was seen in 4 patients after LT. The 2 patients transplanted for neurological impairment had a pre-LT Rankin score of 4 compared to 3 and 2, respectively, after LT. The 2 WD cases transplanted for liver failure had pre-LT Rankin scores of 1 and 2, respectively, compared to 0 in both cases post-LT. The UWDRS score improved in 2 cases and remained stable in 1 less severely impaired case. Brain MRI abnormalities proved partially reversible in 3 patients and remained stable in 1 patient. Conclusions: These results suggest that LT can be predicted in WD patients with neurological disorders. Â© 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.",,"Laurencin, C.;Brunet, A.

1140,Maintenance zinc therapy after initial Penicillamine chelation to treat symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease in a resource-constrained setting,"Background: Experience with Zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. Purpose: To examine the efficacy of Zinc after Penicillamine in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed case records of 31 symptomatic hepatic WD patients in whom disease severity scores (Child's, MELD, Nazer, and nNew Wilson iIndex score) and 24-hour urine copper were compared at 3 three time points at baseline and transition. From Penicillamine to Zinc and at the end of follow up. Results: Of the 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD studied, 10 had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was changed to Zinc sulfate because of financial constraints (in 28 patients) or because of the adverse effects of Penicillamine (in 3 patients). The child's grade 6 was A in 6 patients, B in 5 patients, and C in 17 patients at presentation (baseline). The duration of initial Penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, with a median (range) duration of 363 (35-728) weeks, and subsequent Zinc therapy. There was a significant improvement from baseline in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer's, nNew Wilson's index, Child's and MELD score) when switching from penicillamine to Zinc. This improvement was maintained until the end of the study period. 17 17 patients with Child C cirrhosis at admission were treated with Penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks followed by Zinc for 344 (41-652) weeks, of which 15 had significant improvement in liver function and disease severity scores by the end of follow-up. . -above. Three of the 31 study patients died at weeks 284, 112, and 437. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: In a limited resource setting, penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with symptomatic hepatic WD of all degrees of initial disease severity. Our data also suggest that some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease can be managed with medical therapy by avoiding liver transplantation.",,"Gupta, P.;Choksi, M.;Goel, A.;Zachariah, U.;Sajith, K.

1141,Psychiatric comorbidity in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a relatively rare autosomal recessive disease that causes copper accumulation in different organs, especially the liver and brain. Psychiatric disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic issue in WD. For articles focusing on psychiatric disorders published in WH between 1985 and 2016, relevant articles in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched. This review included 92 articles showing the findings of 35 observational and case-control studies and 57 case reports. In this study, findings regarding the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in WD, their effects on the lives of those diagnosed, and the effectiveness of current treatments on the psychiatric outcomes of WD were discussed. The high prevalence of mood disorders confirms the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in WD and contributes to worse Quality of Life and psychosocial outcomes. Because specific treatments for WD provide a good life expectancy, adherence to medications and clinical monitoring should be warranted through a multidisciplinary approach, including careful hepatological, neurological, and psychiatric evaluation and education of the affected and their relatives.

1143,Yeast as a model for the identification of viable new survival-promoting compounds to treat degenerative diseases.,"Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in the development and normal metabolic functioning of organisms. Excess cell death is the cause of many degenerative diseases for which current treatments are inadequate, such as neurodegenerative disorders and Wilson's disease. Current treatments focus mainly on reducing disease symptoms following cell death, rather than blocking the cell death process itself. The latter can be achieved either by reducing the presence of the toxic trigger (such as protein aggregation in many commonly known neurodegenerative disease states) or by blocking signaling cascades that cause death. Given the high conservation of PCD processes between yeast and mammalian cells, in this review we will focus on yeast and its drug discovery use as a model organism to study PCD-related diseases. More specifically, we will provide a comprehensive overview of novel compounds identified in yeast-based drug screenings that either reduce the amount of toxic triggers or inhibit PCD signaling cascades under PCD-inducing conditions.

It has mainly hepatic, neurological and ophthalmic manifestations. Although osteoporosis, rickets and early arthritis are common features of WD, they are underrecognized. Musculoskeletal manifestations very rarely lead to the diagnosis of the disease. Here, we present a case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with a 3-month-old pathological femoral neck fracture. The diagnosis of WD was made upon investigation of the cause of the pathological fracture, which was managed by performing a conventional McMurray intertrochanteric osteotomy. At the 6-month follow-up, the fracture healed and the patient was able to walk with support. WD may be a rare cause of pathological fracture. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in pathological fracture patients presenting with associated neuropsychiatric or hepatic manifestations.

1146,The plausibility of maternal toxic substance exposure and nutritional status as contributing factors to the risk of autism spectrum disorders,"Recent research suggests that the maternal environment may be particularly important for the risk of developing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, maternal infections, micronutrient deficiencies, obesity, and exposure to toxic substances are likely to interact with genetic risk factors to impair fetal brain development. Objectives: The aim of this article is to investigate the plausibility of maternal toxic substance exposure and nutritional status as causal factors in the development of ASD. Methods: This article reviews existing research investigating the hypothesis that maternal toxicant exposure and prenatal micronutrient intake are important modifiable risk factors for ASD. Conclusions: Zinc, copper, iron and vitamin B9 were identified as specific micronutrients related to the etiology of ASD. Specific toxicants induce a maternal inflammatory response leading to fetal micronutrient deficiencies that impair early brain development. More importantly, maternal micronutrient supplementation is associated with a reduced risk of ASD. In addition, animal studies show that micronutrient supplementation can prevent the teratogenicity and developmental neurotoxicity of certain toxic substances. Discussion: These findings lead to the hypothesis that maternal infection, obesity, and toxic substance exposures (eg, valproic acid, endocrine disrupting plasticizers, ethanol, and heavy metals) are environmental risk factors for ASD and lead to fetal micronutrient deficiencies resulting from a maternal inflammatory process. reaction. It may be possible to use markers of inflammation and micronutrient status to identify women who would benefit from micronutrient supplementation or dietary interventions to reduce the risk of ASD. However, more research is needed to demonstrate the causal role of fetal micronutrient deficiencies and to clarify the underlying mechanisms that contribute to ASD.

Anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive 1:20 and liver biopsy showed micronodular cirrhosis with abundant Mallory hyaline and stainable copper deposits. Liver histology was indicative of Indian childhood cirrhosis, while the presence of autoantibodies, elevated transaminases and increased globulin suggested autoimmune hepatitis.

1148,Copper(I)-binding properties of copper-removing drugs for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the P-type copper ATPase, ATP7B, which carries copper out of cells and is therefore crucial for the biliary excretion of excess copper. WD is primarily characterized by toxic copper accumulation in the liver and brain, leading to liver disorders and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unlike many other genetic disorders, WD can be treated primarily with copper chelation therapy, which mobilizes copper from the organism and increases its urinary excretion. Although a number of copper-removing drugs are currently available, their Cu(I)-binding affinities and interactions with essential cellular copper proteins have not been quantitatively characterized to date. Using an ESI MS-based approach, we determined the Cu(I)-binding affinities of five major copper-removing drugs (penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate and tetrathiomolybdate). to explore their ability to remove Cu(I) ions from two cellular Cu(I)-binding proteins with different Cu(I)-binding affinities. We report that the Cu(I)-binding affinity of copper-removing drugs varies by four orders of magnitude and is dependent on the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule. The resulting structure-activity relationships are important for understanding the effect of copper chelating drugs and for elaborating next-generation drugs that may provide better therapeutic results.",,"Smirnova, J.;Golendukhina, E.;Jarving, I.;Tougu, V.;Plitz, T.;Palumaa, P.",2017,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14174,0,0,
1149,Characterization of ZEB2 enhancers during brain development,"Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB2) is a transcriptional repressor that is a key regulator of the nervous system during development. De-novo heterozygous mutations in ZEB2 are associated with multiple neurological defects, including Mowat-Wilson syndrome, due to haploinsufficiency of ZEB2 expression during development. Therefore, mutations in ZEB2 enhancers that regulate its neuronal expression may lead to a similar phenotype. However, ZEB2 developers have not yet been characterized. Using enhancer-associated ChIP-seq data, we identified 13 sequences in the Zeb2 locus that may function as neuronal enhancers during development. Using the zebrafish enhancer assay, we identified nine neuronal enhancers, four of which act as notochord enhancers and two as specific neuron enhancers. Interestingly, the four notochord enhancers that maintain the similar GFP expression pattern do not have homology in their sequences, leading us to further identify the transcription factors that activate these enhancers. We found the repertoire of TFs likely to regulate the activity of these enhancers required for the spatio-temporal expression of ZEB2 during neuronal development. The enhancers identified shed light on the mechanism of action of ZEB2 regulation and may serve as potential sequences that should be screened for mutations in patients without mutations in the ZEB2 coding region.",,"Bar Yaackov, R.;Birnbaum, R.",2017,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14174,0,0,
1150,Iron and copper in fetal development,"Copper and iron are both essential micronutrients. Because they can both accept and donate electrons, they are at the center of many energy-dependent chemical reactions. For example, copper is a critical part of enzymes such as the ferroxidase enzymes ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and cyclopene, as well as dopamine-beta-monoxygenase, while iron is part of the catalytic site of many cytochromes and enzymes involved in fatty acid desaturation. Not surprisingly, therefore, copper and iron deficiency, malnutrition, where cell proliferation and differentiation is very active, especially during pregnancy, can have serious consequences. These problems may persist into adulthood with an increased risk of mental problems such as schizophrenia and, at least in animal models, hypertension and obesity. In this review, we consider what these problems are and how they can arise. We examine the role of copper and iron deficiencies during fetal development separately in terms of birth outcome, and then how problems with the condition in the womb may have long-term sequelae for the offspring. We examine several possible mechanisms of action, both directly and indirectly. Direct causes include, for example, decreased enzyme activity, while indirect ones may result from changes in cytokine activity, reduction in cell number or increased apoptosis, to name a few. We examine a crucial area of nutrition-interactions between micronutrients and conclude that while we have made significant progress in understanding the relationship between micronutrient status and pregnancy outcome, there is still much to be learned. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Gambling, L.;Kennedy, C.;McArdle, H.

There are numerous diseases caused by protein misfolding mainly due to mutations in the relevant gene. The consequences of this misfolding may be that the proteins are either removed by the cellular quality control mechanism or accumulated in the wrong intracellular or extracellular location, effectively losing their function.

1153,The role of MRI in the diagnosis and follow-up of Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disorder of Copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. The diagnosis of WD is usually made using blood tests and clinical findings. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize the contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of WD and monitoring the treatment. In her neurological examination, dysarthria, postural and actional tremor, and motor weakness were found in the lower extremities. EEG was unremarkable. Kayser-Fleischer rings were observed bilaterally. The blood test results were as follows: Serum ceruloplasmin 16.3 mg/dL (normal: 25-63 mg/dL), serum copper level 32 mug/dL normal: 70-140 cups/dL and 24-hour urinary copper excretion 56.5 cups /day (normal 24-hour urine excretion 20-50 cups/day) Abdominal ultrasonography revealed heterogonal liver echogenicity suggesting surface nodularity. On cranial MRI, abnormally high T2 signal was observed in the putamina, dorsal mesencephalon and pons. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's Disease. Trientine and zinc treatment was started. After one month of treatment, the patient was re-evaluated. There was a significant reduction in tremor with motor functional gain. Repeat MRI showed significant reduction in previously detected signal abnormalities. Conclusion: MRI findings closely reflected the clinical response to treatment.

Materials and methods: We present four pediatric cases with unusual forms of thrombotic microangiopathy within the framework of systemic diseases. Results: Case 1: 5 years old, acute pancreatitis (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure) with complement activation and HUS-triad. Early treatment with eculizumab results in rapid haematological and renal remission. MRI shows the anatomical variant (pancreas divisum) associated with a high risk of spontaneous pancreatitis. Recurrence of pancreatitis without signs of TMA under eculizumab therapy. Genetic analysis reveals risk haplotypes in CHF, MCP and CFHR3-CFHR1 deletion. Did pancreatitis trigger aHUS or vice versa? Case 2: 2 years old, acute myeloid leukemia M5, after haploidentic BMT, complete chimerism. After developing BMT, transfusion-induced anemia, malignant hypertension, and proteinuria. Temporary stabilization after cyclosporine suspension. Progressive disease with a twofold increase in creatinine, kidney biopsy shows TMA. Normalization of blood pressure and kidney function under eculizumab therapy, no proteinuria. Hemoglobin recovery, no need for transfusion. Material for genetic testing from saliva (blood cells from donor), results are awaited. Case 3: 15 years old, previously healthy, presents with the triad of cholestasis and HUS. Ocular evaluation shows Keyser-Fleischer Ring. Copper in the urine and low ceruloplasmin confirm the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Hemolytic anemia only gets better under treatment with Trientine. Progressive improvement of hemoglobin and kidney function. Labeled complement activation, CFB-Antibodies and the CFHR5 variant. Case 4: 10 years old, Wilson's disease. Three years after liver transplantation, the HUS triad occurs within the framework of viral infection. Recovery after discontinuation of treatment with tacrolimus and everolimus. Carrier of CHR1 and 3 homozygous deletions. Conclusions: These cases demonstrate the appropriateness of considering TMA in diseases not associated with aHUS in which complement activation and endothelial damage may be the trigger or result of complement activation.

1155,Canine Copper-Associated Hepatitis,"Copper-associated hepatitis is recognized with increasing frequency in dogs. The disease is characterized by centrolobular hepatic copper deposition, leading to hepatitis and eventually cirrhosis. The only way to make the diagnosis is histological evaluation of copper distribution and determination of copper amount in liver biopsy. Treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine is the most commonly used therapy. In addition, a low copper/high zinc diet may help prevent the accumulation or re-accumulation of hepatic copper. Mutations in the COMMD1 or ATP7A and ATP7B copper metabolism genes have been associated with hepatic copper concentrations in Bedlington terriers and Labrador retrievers, respectively. In the Labrador retriever, dietary copper contributes strongly to the disease phenotype.

1156,Zeb2 uses HDAC-NuRD to inhibit Notch and controls Schwann cell differentiation and remyelination,"The mechanisms that coordinate and balance a complex network of counterregulators to control Schwann cell (SC) differentiation remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2, also called Sip1) is a critical intrinsic timer that controls the onset of SC differentiation by recruiting histone deacetylases HDAC 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) and the nucleosome. remodeling and deacetylase complex (NuRD) co-repressor complexes in mice. Zeb2 deletion arrests SCs in an undifferentiated state during peripheral nerve development and inhibits post-injury remyelination. It antagonizes inhibitory effectors including Zeb2, Notch, and Sox2. Importantly, genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals a Zeb2 target gene encoding the Notch effector Hey2 as a potent inhibitor for Schwann cell differentiation. Strikingly, a genetic variant of Zeb2 associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome impairs interaction with HDAC1/2-NuRD and abrogates Zeb2 activity for SC differentiation. Thus, Zeb2 controls SC maturation by recruiting HDAC1/2-NuRD complexes and inhibiting a Notch-Hey2 signal axis, pointing to the critical role of HDAC1/2-NuRD activity in peripheral neuropathies induced by ZEB2 mutations.

1157,Clinical features of Wilson's disease in Peru: A review of eight cases.,"Objective: To describe the clinical features of Wilson's disease patients followed between 1995 and 2013 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurologicas (INCN), Lima, Peru. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with copper metabolism dysfunction. Mutation of the ATP7B gene. WD is manifested by hepatic, neurological, psychiatric and ophthalmic, and other manifestations. Neurological symptoms include parkinsonism, dystonia, and ataxia. The clinical course is highly variable and delay in diagnosis is not uncommon. The diagnosis of WD is based on clinical, biochemical and genetic analyzes when genetic characteristics are present. Early diagnosis is very important to prevent or minimize permanent neurological complications. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of WD followed at the INCN (Movement Disorders Unit and Neurogenetic Research Center). Demographic and clinical data as well as biochemical parameters (especially serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion); Neuroimaging and private consultations were obtained from clinical records. IRB Approval was obtained from the local agency for this study. Results: Eight of the 19 identified patients were included in the study. 87.5% (7) were male. Our WD patients had a mean age of 26 [17–44] and a mean age of onset of 23.7 [12–44]; The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 20.3 [3-72] months. Parkinsonism was the predominant phenotype in this group, with dysarthria the two most common symptoms at baseline (37.5%). Kayser-Fleischer ring was confirmed in 62.5% (5) of the patients. The mean serum ceruloplasmin concentration was 12.5 mg/dl [2.3-23.4] and the mean 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 109.6 ug/24 hora [33.2-278]. The most common finding in the MR brain was putamen signal changes (50%), followed by the thalamus (37.5%). 87.5% (7) of the patients started treatment immediately after diagnosis and 75% (7) of them received penicillamine treatment. Conclusions: This is the first case series of WD in the Peruvian population. Cases of WD in our Peruvian cohort appear similar to those described in other populations; however, the delay in diagnosis is higher than that reported worldwide.",,"Sarapura, E.;Ramirez-Quinones, J.;Cornejo-Olivas, M.;Torres, L.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26972,0,1,

1161,Clinically different presentations of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy and cytopenias in a patient using excess zinc-containing denture adhesive.,"Objectives Although copper deficiency has long been known to cause cytopenia, copper deficiency myeloneuropathy is a more recently described entity. Here we present two clinically distinct presentations of acquired copper deficiency syndromes due to overuse of zinc-containing denture adhesive over five years: myeloneuropathy and severe macrocytic anemia and neutropenia. Methods Comprehensive laboratory testing and histological evaluation of the liver and bone marrow were necessary to exclude other disease processes and to diagnose copper deficiency. Results The initial presentation consisted of a myelopathy involving the posterior columns. Serum and urinary copper were significantly decreased and serum zinc increased. At the second admission (five years later), multiple hematological abnormalities were detected. While serum zinc increased, serum copper decreased again. Conclusions Zinc overload is a preventable cause of copper deficiency syndromes. This rare asset presented here highlights the importance of the patient as well as education.

1162,Drosophila melanogaster models of metal-related human diseases and metal toxicity,"Iron, copper, and zinc are essential transition metals for life as they are required in numerous biological processes. Organisms have evolved to obtain the metal through food and to maintain adequate levels of each metal to avoid the harmful effects associated with its deficiency, excess, or misplacement. Interestingly, major components of metal homeostatic pathways are conserved, with many orthologs of human metal-related genes identified and characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila has gained recognition as a useful model for studying human diseases, including those caused by mutations in pathways that control cellular metal homeostasis. Flies have many advantages in the laboratory, such as short life cycles, easy handling and inexpensive maintenance. They can also be grown in large numbers. In addition, flies are greatly appreciated as they offer a significant number of genetic tools to address some of the unresolved questions regarding disease pathology, which may contribute to our understanding of metal metabolism and homeostasis. This review summarizes the metabolism of the major transition metals, namely iron, zinc and copper, in Drosophila and the use of this organism as an experimental model to investigate the role of metal dyshomeostasis in different human diseases. Finally, a summary of Drosophila's contribution as a model for testing metal toxicity is presented. Copyright Â© 2017 belongs to the authors.

1164,Delivery of the copper chelating Trientine (TETA) to the central nervous system by surface-modified liposomes,"The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) complicates the treatment of many central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including copper storage disease, Wilson's disease. CNS symptoms represent a serious problem, as therapeutics for Wilson's disease do not cross the ENT. One strategy to overcome this barrier is the transfer of drugs across the BBB by colloidal carrier systems such as liposomes. The aim of this study was to encapsulate triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper chelating agent, into surface-modified liposomes and investigate their permeability through the BBB. Liposomes were modified with cationized bovine serum albumin or penetratin, a cell-penetrating peptide. Liposomes were characterized for size, PDI, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. Size ranged from 139.4 +/- 1.9 nm to 171.1 +/- 3.5 nm, and PDIs were below 0.2. The zeta potentials of vectorized liposomes were at least 6.9 mV higher than that of standard liposomes. Cryo-TEM micrographs demonstrated liposomal structure, integrity, and similarity in structure and size between charged, uncharged, vectorized and non-vectorized liposomes. In vivo experiments in rats showed up to 16-fold higher brain uptake of TETA in vectorized liposomes compared to free TETA or TETA in non-vectorized liposomes, demonstrating successful brain transmission using target-seeking surface modifications. Tissue analysis showed that TETA concentrations in the brain were high enough to treat Wilson's disease.

1165,Chelation in metal intoxication-Principles and paradigms,"This review provides an update of general principles for the research and use of chelating agents in the treatment of metal poisonings. The clinical use of the former chelators EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate) and BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) is now limited due to the inappropriateness of parenteral administration, their own toxicity, and their tendency to increase neurotoxicity of various metals. The hydrophilic dithiol chelators DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercapto-propanesulfonate) are less toxic and more effective than BAL in the clinical treatment of heavy metal poisoning and are available in capsules for oral use. . Although D-penicillamine is still widely used, DMSA appears to be a potent antidote for copper overload. Thiols are ineffective in chelating iron because iron has higher affinity for nitrogen and oxygen and ligands, but new oral iron antidotes deferiprone and desferasirox have entered the clinical arena. Comparison of these agents and deferoxamine infusions is ongoing. General principles for the research and development of new chelators are briefly summarized in this review.

1166,Obstetric Outcome in Women with Chronic Liver Disease,"Objective: This study determines the prevalence, causes and outcomes of pregnancy in women with chronic liver disease at a tertiary education institute in South India. Methods: Retrospective analysis of case records was performed between December 2010 and May 2015 in the departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics and Gastroenterology, including pregnant women diagnosed with chronic liver disease before or during pregnancy. Results: The frequency of chronic liver disease during pregnancy was 50 (0.4%) in 10,823 deliveries. 26 women with chronic liver disease had 50 pregnancies during the study period. Fifty percent of women had cirrhosis. Maternal complications occurred in 22% of the study group. Varicose bleeding occurred in 4% and hepatic decompensation in 16%. There were two maternal deaths (4%). Obstetric complications such as preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage and puerperal infection occurred in 18%, 14% and 18%, respectively. Abortion occurred in 34% of patients with cirrhosis, 55% of patients with cirrhosis, and 4.8% of patients without cirrhosis. The live birth rate, which was 76%, was significantly higher in the non-cirrhotic group than in the cirrhotic group (p < 0.014). Conclusion: Pregnancies in chronic liver disease are associated with a high rate of miscarriage.

1171,"Late Onset Wilson's Disease, Dementia, Ekbom Syndrome, and Whittera","Objective: The aim of this study is to describe a patient with late-onset Wilson's disease, dementia and Ekbom Syndrome. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene that causes impaired biliary excretion of copper and its accumulation, first in the liver, but eventually in the brain and other tissues. Ekbom syndrome is characterized by the patient's firm belief that they are infested with parasites from the skin, mouth, eyes, or genital area. Methods: We present a patient with Ekbom syndrome with atypical presentations of Wilson's disease. Results: A 69-year-old male patient with chronic liver disease was referred to the Neurology group to investigate cognitive impairment, mostly executive complaints and episodic memory deficits, that had started 3 years ago. In her neurological examination, there was only whipping tremor. At follow-up, the patient deteriorated and became agitated, aggressive, and confused. After 6 months, she started to say that there were bugs crawling on her skin and were not noticed by her relatives. He later developed extrapyramidal manifestations along with bradykinesia and muscle stiffness. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Total serum ceruloplasmin was low in 2 cases: 6.9 and 11. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and D-penicillamine was started without clinical response. Conclusions: Ekbom syndrome is normally associated with psychiatric conditions or dementia, but its presence should raise the suspicion of other neurodegenerative disorders as it may precede other classical manifestations. Although late-onset Wilson's disease is rare and does not usually present with initial dementia, it can have an atypical course. Since it is a treatable disease, especially when diagnosed in the early stages, dementia should be included in the differential diagnosis.",,"Germiniani, F.;Marques, P.;Zorzetto, F.;De Oliveira, L.;Teive, H.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,0,

Background: Treatment of Wilson's disease remains a challenge for clinicians. A strict control of the different copper pools is required. Methods: Case report. Treatment control formula: ""Free"" serum copper (FC) = total serum copper - (serum ceruloplasmin x 3). Decopper status: FC <10mug/dL. Copper deficiency: FC <5mug/dL Results: A 25-year-old woman presented a rapidly progressive tremor with 1 year of severe functional impact. He had asymptomatic chronic liver disease without portal hypertension. Physical examination: Moderate amplitude Bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings and resting tremor in both upper extremities, both proximal and distal. More pronounced tremors in both upper extremities appeared within seconds of taking any antigravity stance or simple movement (""wing flapping"" tremor). Once manifested, it was of increasing amplitude and extended to the entire body, trunk, head, and lower extremities. It would only disappear if he brought his upper limbs back to the resting position. Sometimes dystonic right hand postures were observed. There are no other abnormalities. Investigations: Normal serum copper, elevated 24-hour urine copper excretion, and decreased serum ceruloplasmin. Normal liver function tests. The compound was heterozygous for the p.L1305P and p.H1069Q mutations in ATP7B. Pre-treatment brain MRI (fig. 1A): Bilateral and symmetrical hypointensity in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, and hyperintensity in the putamen, lateral thalamus, central pons, and dorsal midbrain. Initially, he was treated with D-penicillamine, Zn, and vitamin B6 with worsening of neurological symptoms and poor tolerance. D-penicillamine was withdrawn and AT was started. He showed remarkable improvement, asymptomatically at 4 months, 15 days after the start of treatment. Reached copper-free status 7 months after starting AT and was removed, only maintenance Zn (FC 5-10mug/dL) remained. Brain MRI was normal after 4 years of treatment (fig. 1B).

Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class copper modulating agent for the treatment of WD. Although treatments for WD are available, there are significant unmet medical needs for efficacy, side effects, and ease of treatment. METHODS: Patients with WD >18 years of age who were untreated or treated with chelation or zinc therapy = 2 years initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 once daily. After 6 weeks, dosage was individually guided by laboratory and clinical criteria. Evaluations included copper control, neurological and disability status, liver status, and safety using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: 28 patients participated in the study. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.6 µM) and 23/28 had neurological signs (mean UWDRS quotient 3 score 22.8). The primary endpoint for copper control was met in 79% of patients (p<0.001). The mean reduction in NCC levels was 77% (p<0.0001). Both neurological status (p<0.0001) and disability (p<0.001) improved as measured by UWDRS Parts 3 and 2. In addition, liver status as measured by the Modified Nazer Score stabilized or improved in the majority of patients. Treatment with WTX101 was generally well tolerated and most reported adverse events were mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 2). Reversible liver test elevations were observed in 39% of patients, and these elevations were generally mild to moderate, asymptomatic, and normalized with dose adjustments. No drug-induced neurological deterioration was observed at baseline when treatment with WTX101 was initiated. Conclusions: Once-daily WTX101 treatment has the potential to rapidly reduce and control free copper and improve neurological status and disability in patients with WD. In addition, WTX101 was generally well tolerated and no neurological deterioration was observed upon initiation of WTX101. Combined with its simplified dosage, WTX101 has the potential to meet the unmet needs in WD.

1174,"Neurological worsening in patients treated for Wilson's disease: frequency, causes and consequences","Purpose: To examine the pattern of neurological worsening (BP) in patients treated for Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WD is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment includes copper chelation and can reverse neurological disability and prevent disease-related death. However, some patients develop worsening of neurological symptoms during treatment. This may be due to medication or nonadherence, disease progression, co-morbidities, or emergent psychosis.a, b Methods: We prospectively recruited 120 consecutive patients who visited our Wilson disease Clinic between 2005 and 2016 and followed up for their neurological disability during treatment. Using the Global Assessment Scale 2 for Wilson's disease (GAS for WD).b All but 5 subjects using trientine (300-1800 mg/day) received penicillamine (125-2000 mg/day). Results: We observed 64 BP in 44 patients (30 men) out of 120 patients (72 men; 48 women). The earliest manifestations of KB were worsening of irritability or dysarthria, Wilson's facies, or Kayser-Fleischer rings. Non-adherence to treatment was the most common cause and occurred in 16 patients in the early intensive phase of copper chelation and in 18 patients in the maintenance phase. Many of these patients have defaulted on treatment multiple times. Drug-induced BP was seen in 12 patients; 11 penicillamines (average dose 900 mg; range 750-1750 mg) and 1 trientine (900 mg). The time between initiation of treatment and BP was very variable (mean 2.8 months; range 0.5-14 months). In 10 patients, such worsening was reversible by short-term down-titration of the drug over a median period of 1.2 months (range 0.5-4 months). However, it resulted in long-term disability in both of them. During the first few months of treatment, four patients had BP due to disease progression and improved with continued copper chelation. Immediate psychosis and intervening illnesses accounted for 11 and three PD cases, respectively. These also improved with continued chelation. Conclusions: BP is seen in more than one third of patients treated for WD, and non-adherence is the most common cause. Monitoring neurological disability using the GAS for WD scale allows a person to detect such deterioration, identify its cause, and respond appropriately (by promoting compliance, reducing dose, or continuing the course of treatment).",,"Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.",2017,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.27087,0,1,
1175,Follow-up of fatty liver and fibrosis in children with Wilson's disease using transient elastography (Fibroscan).,"Objectives and study: Liver involvement in children with Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fibrosis. Pharmacological therapy aims to preserve liver function and improve the clinical condition of patients. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens, France) has already been applied for the non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis in many chronic liver diseases. Using Fibroscan, we aimed to evaluate the change in liver stiffness/fibrosis and adiposity and selected laboratory markers of liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease. Methods: We included 33 children (19 women) with Wilson's disease, mean age 11.5 years, treated with zinc or d-penicillamine. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded from the study. At baseline and after a mean duration of 1.5 years, all patients underwent Fibroscan examination with the medium (M) probe to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (Controlled Attenuation Parameter, CAP). At the same time, repeated laboratory liver function tests were performed. Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Results: At baseline, our patients had mildly elevated liver enzymes ALT-49.5U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26U/I (19.5-35.5) and were well. preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial Fibroscan examination showed normal median liver stiffness 4.4kPa (M probe) (4.0-5.4) and mildly elevated liver steatosis CAP-257dB/m (235-283) [median, lower, upper quartile]. At the end of a 1.5-year period, we detected a statistically insignificant decrease in ALT, AST and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than baseline results (p=0.02). Similarly, we did not observe any significant differences in fatty liver (CAP) or liver stiffness with Fibroscan compared with baseline and repeated measurements. Conclusion: 1.

1176,First study of the prevalence of Wilson's disease in a Portuguese population,"Objectives and study: Wilson's Disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease responsible for abnormal tissue copper deposition. The global prevalence is estimated at 1:40,000, but recent studies suggest possible underdiagnosis. There are no studies on epidemiological information of WD in Portugal. The primary aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of the disease. Secondary objectives focused on the descriptive analysis of the main clinical, pathological, and biochemical features of the WH course in this population. Methods: The study design was retrospective and included WD patients of all ages observed between 1995 and 2015, followed for at least 3 months, and confirmed to be born in the northern region of Portugal. Patients were identified using the Portuguese National Health Service's clinical coding system based on clinical data from thirteen Portuguese hospitals, liver biopsy histological evaluation, and hospital prescription records. Statistical analysis was performed to identify potential clinical-analytical correlations via chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman, and Wilcoxon tests. Results: We identified and collected clinical data from 94 WD patients, six of whom died. The prevalence of WD in the last 20 years has been 1:37,000, the current prevalence is 1 in 45,000 and the incidence is 1 person per million/year. Pediatric age at presentation occurred in 55.8%, with a median age at diagnosis of 16.6 (12.3-20.8) and 53.2% in males. The mean follow-up was 15.2+/-8.8 years. Dominant liver disease was the most common presentation with 54.8%, and 37.0% of these presented with cirrhosis; Mixed neurological/hepatic symptoms in 17.9% and predominant neurological presentation in 10.7%. Neurological symptoms were associated with a later onset of the disease (p=0.001) and a higher presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring (p<0.001) and were detected in 27.0% of all patients. Liver transplantation was performed with a rate of 23.9%. Regarding treatment, penicillamine was the most commonly used, side effects were observed in 24.8% and trientine was used at some stage of the disease in 41.0% of patients. A significant decrease in hepatic liver enzymes was observed 6 and 12 months after starting treatment (AST: p=0.002; ALT:p=0.002), not urinary copper excretion. Conclusion: This study constitutes a step forward in better understanding the epidemiological, clinical and disease management of WD in the Northern Portugal region, which appears to be similar to previously published studies in other countries. As more than half of WD patients are diagnosed at pediatric age, the focus should be on developing tools for early diagnosis for better disease management.",,"De Sousa, B. R. R.

1177,Disturbances in Hepatic Copper Secretion: Wilson's Disease and Pleomorphic Syndromes,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disease with a higher prevalence than previously thought. Atp7b truncations caused by genetic variations that target copper (Cu) carrying the p-ATPase Atp7b and impair the elimination of Cu by the liver are associated with missense mutations with early presentation of severe liver disease and neurological disorders. The asymptomatic onset and false insignificance of initial symptoms often delay the crucial early diagnosis and life-saving treatment. Occasional acute liver failure consistently threatens the life of patients with WD. Disease severity and progression are strongly dependent on the genetic background that organizes the response to oxidative damage produced by increased free Cu levels. In this review, the authors focus on the prevalence, genetics, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment options in WD. They also discuss the novel relevance of cuprotoxicosis to pleomorphic syndromes, of which MEDNIK is the first example, produced by genetic variations that disrupt universal mechanisms of protein transport, thereby impairing Atp7b trafficking associated with Cu excretion.

1178,Wilson's disease,"Purpose of Review: This article reviews the clinical features of Wilson's disease, focusing on neurological and psychiatric abnormalities, and discusses diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the management of the disease. Recent Findings: The list of known mutations that cause Wilson's disease continues to grow, but advances in genetic testing may soon make it possible to routinely perform genetic testing on individuals suspected of having Wilson's disease. Summary: Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disease with variable symptoms that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any individual presenting with unexplained neurological, psychiatric or hepatic dysfunction. Because undiagnosed and untreated Wilson's disease will result in progressive and ultimately irreversible damage to the neurological and other systems, appropriate diagnostic testing should be performed promptly and treatment should be promptly initiated and continued.

1179,Atypical clinical and radiological features of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited copper metabolism disorder that causes hepatic, neurological and other systemic manifestations. Diagnosis should be considered in a young patient with chronic liver disease and neurological findings. Case report: In our case, a young man presented with insidious and increasing difficulty in walking and sitting. On examination, the patient had a dazed appearance and could not make a sound. Motor examination revealed dystonia and exaggerated deep reflexes (Figure Presented). The Kayser-Fleischer ring was visible to the naked eye from both sides. Ceruloplasmin was decreased, serum copper level was slightly elevated, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion increased to approximately 10 times the normal value. His USG showed the abdominal liver with coarse altered echo. On brain MRI, there was a ""giant panda face appearance"" with white matter abnormalities (Figure 1). Discussion: Wilson's disease (WH) is an inborn autosomal recessive defect of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. In Wilson's disease with neurological presentations, the sympathomatology is predominantly extrapyramidal, such as dystonia, tremor, dysphasia, dysarthria, and ataxia. Our case had neurological findings, mainly dystonia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment. MRI brain showed white matter involvement in the bilateral frontal cortex with features typical of Wilson's disease. These white matter abnormalities are rare and have been rarely reported. Our patient was treated with zinc due to the absence of trientine and tetrathiomolybdate, and neuropsychiatric improvements were observed. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion is required when dealing with adolescents and young adults with abnormal movements and neurobehavioral abnormalities. A high degree of suspicion and early detection of WD is critical as its diagnosis can be easily missed, but if diagnosed in the early stages and treated appropriately, the patient can lead a normal life.",,"Goyal, S.;Dabla, S.;Sharma, B.;Yadav, K.",2015,Juneï¿½July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2015.07.158,0,0,
1180,Trientine dihydrochloride encapsulated nanoparticles for copper chelation therapy in a rat model of non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis.,"Trientine cannot alleviate brain copper overload and neurological symptoms in patients with Wilson's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of conventional Trientine with Trientine-loaded nanoparticles administered orally for 90 days for non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis in a Wistar rat model. High performance liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, biochemical predictions, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, preparation and physicochemical characterization of nanoparticles were performed. Trientine nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 351 nm and less than 34% Trientine release. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased Trientine levels in the brain of the nanoparticle-based Trientine administration group compared to the conventional Trientine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based Trientine treatment resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory in a rat model of Cu toxicosis with concurrent increase in urinary Cu levels and acetylcholinesterase activity. Conventional Trientine treatment resulted in negative rhodanine staining, supported by a 63% and a 16% reduction in hepatic and brain copper content in the liver and brain sections, respectively, compared with the untreated Cu poisoned group. However, liver and brain sections of the nanoparticle-based Trientine therapy group showed grade 1 copper and no evidenced copper accumulation, with 46% and 28% reductions in hepatic and brain copper content, respectively, compared to the untreated copper poisoning group. Taken together, this study provides the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of Trientine nanoparticles in chelating more brain copper and alleviating neurological deficits at even half the dose delivered in conventional Trientine therapy.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1181,Spatial investigation of elemental distribution in Wilson's disease liver after D-penicillamine treatment with LA-ICP-MS.,"Currently, the copper chelator D-penicillamine (DPA) is the first-line treatment for Wilson's disease (WD), which is characterized by copper overload. Lifetime DPA treatments aim to reduce the amount of harmful excess copper retention in the liver and other organs. Although DPA has beneficial effects in many patients, it can cause serious side effects. Despite several years of copper chelation therapy, discontinuation of DPA therapy may be associated with rapidly progressive liver failure, indicating high residual liver copper load. To investigate the spatial distribution of copper and additional elements such as zinc and iron remaining in rat and human liver samples after DPA treatment, high-resolution (10 µm spot size) laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA)-ICP-MS) imaging was applied. . Untreated LPP<sup>-/-</sup> rats, an established animal model for WD, presented with a high overall copper concentration and a distributed hotspot copper distribution over liver tissue. In contrast, a low (>2-fold decreased) overall copper concentration was detected in the liver of DPA-treated animals. Importantly, however, the copper distribution was not quite homogeneous, with the lowest concentrations directly close to the blood vessels, as observed using the new regional analysis. A human liver needle biopsy of a DPA-treated WD patient confirmed the finding of an inhomogeneous copper deposition upon chelation therapy. In contrast, relatively homogeneous distributions of zinc and iron were observed. Our study demonstrates that high-resolution LA-ICP-MS analysis of liver samples is perfectly suitable for monitoring the efficacy of chelator therapy in WD patients.

1182,Wilson's Disease in China,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Its incidence is higher in China than in western countries. ATP7B is the causative gene and encodes a P-type ATPase involved in holoceruloplasmin synthesis and copper excretion. Disease-causing variants of ATP7B disrupt the normal structure or function of the enzyme and cause copper deposition in many organs, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations. Given the diversity of presentations, misdiagnosis is not uncommon. Genetic diagnosis plays an important role and has increasingly become a routine test in China. The first Chinese spectrum of disease-causing mutations of ATP7B has been generated. As a curable inherited disorder, most WD patients have a good prognosis with early diagnosis and chelation therapy. However, clinical trials in China are relatively few, and most treatments are based on the experience of experts and evidence from other countries. It is necessary to study and develop appropriate regimens specific to Chinese WD patients.

1184,Trace element research - historical and future directions,"Over the past 30 years the International Association for Trace Element Research and the Scandinavian Trace Elements Association have been active. During this period, the importance of these elements to human disease, including their contribution to the global burden of disease, was increasingly recognized. New analytical methods allow biomonitoring data to be correlated with health outcomes. Future research using modern chemical methods will focus more on elemental speciation and measuring lower concentrations leading to greater identification of adverse effects and critical organs. Extensive knowledge of the essentiality and toxicity of trace elements in humans has emerged over the past two decades, and the difficulties in defining a range of acceptable oral intakes for essential elements have now largely been overcome. Biological monitoring of trace element concentrations in various media such as blood or urine is of great importance and an overview is given. As an example, a more detailed description of the biomonitoring of cadmium is given and the biokinetics are described, including the role of metallothionein in modifying kinetics and toxicity. Finally, future challenges related to risk assessment of newly developed metallic nanomaterials and metal-containing medical devices are discussed.

1185,"Efficacy and safety of a novel copper-modulating agent (WTX-101) for Wilson's Disease: results of a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study.","Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in patients. newly diagnosed WD Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a new copper modulating agent under development for the treatment of Wilson's Disease (WD). Although treatments for WD are available, there are significant unmet medical needs for efficacy, side effects, and ease of dosing. Design/Methods: Patients with WD aged > 18 years who were untreated or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for < 2 years initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD. After 6 weeks, dosage was individually guided according to laboratory and clinical criteria. Assessments over 24 weeks included neurological and daily activity status, liver status, copper parameters, and safety using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: 28 patients participated in the study. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5uM), 23/28 had neurological signs (mean UWDRS part III score 22), and all had hepatic involvement. Final results will be presented at the 2017 AAN Annual Meeting. Preliminary data show that overall neurological (UWDRS part III) and daily activity (UWDRS part II) scores improve in patients with neurological signs. Liver condition greatly stabilized or improved. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over time during treatment. Other Cu measurements (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) show a similar copper removal pattern. Overall the WTX101 was well tolerated. Adverse events included reversible elevated liver tests and neutropenia in approximately 30% of patients. Results: WTX101 once-daily treatment for 24 weeks improved neurologic disease, liver status, and copper control in newly diagnosed WD patients. The WTX101 seems well tolerated. No drug-induced, paradoxical, neurological deterioration was observed. Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to determine its safety and efficacy for the treatment of WD.",,"Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Askari, F.;Bronstein, J.;Czlonkowska, A.;Ferenci, P.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

1186,"Late-onset Wilson's disease, dementia, ekbom syndrome, and white matter hyperintensities","Objective: The aim of this study is to describe a patient with late-onset Wilson's disease, dementia and Ekbom Syndrome. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene that causes impaired biliary excretion of copper and its accumulation, first in the liver, but eventually in the brain and other tissues. Ekbom syndrome is characterized by the patient's firm belief that they are infested with parasites from the skin, mouth, eyes, or genital area. Design/Methods: We present a patient with atypical presentations of Wilson's disease with Ekbom syndrome. Results: A 69-year-old male patient with chronic liver disease was referred to the Neurology group to investigate cognitive impairment, mostly executive complaints and episodic memory deficits, that had started 3 years ago. In her neurological examination, there was only whipping tremor. At follow-up, the patient deteriorated and became agitated, aggressive, and confused. After 6 months, she started to say that there were bugs crawling on her skin and were not noticed by her relatives. He later developed extrapyramidal manifestations along with bradykinesia and muscle stiffness. Brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Total serum ceruloplasmin was low in 2 cases: 6.9 and 11. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and D-penicillamine was started without clinical response. Conclusions: Ekbom syndrome is normally associated with psychiatric conditions or dementia, but its presence should raise the suspicion of other neurodegenerative disorders as it may precede other classical manifestations. Although late-onset Wilson's disease is rare and does not usually present with initial dementia, it may have an atypical course. Since it is a treatable disease, especially when diagnosed in the early stages, dementia should be included in the differential diagnosis.",,"Marques, P.;Larissa, B.;Germiniani, F.;Teive, H.

1187,Copper deficiency in a patient with a preliminary diagnosis of AIDP,"Objective: To report a previously reported case of Copper deficiency in the setting of AIDP Background: Copper deficiency (CD) has been postulated to cause myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and hematological abnormalities. Known causes are enteropathies, zinc intake and gastric surgery, and the etiology is unknown in approximately 20% of cases. Design/Methods: Case Report Results: A 32-year-old woman with a history of AIDP presented with increasing weakness, numbness, pancytopenia, and loss of bowel and bladder function on arrival. On examination, gross paraplegia and hypoesthesia below the T3 level were found with a unique delayed increased myotonic response with patellar stimulation. The patient also described rapid enamel loss, massive peripheral ataxia, and unstable effect in the previous months. The patient with a history of AIDP was started on 5-day IV methylprednisolone. He was found to have multiple nutritional deficiencies towards the end of IV steroid therapy: thiamine, copper, and folate. His examination improved, although a cause remains unclear. Plasmapheresis was started after the steroid cycle was completed. The low ceruloplasmin problem at the low copper setting briefly differentiated Wilson's disease, specifically withholding copper supplementation until ruled out by 24-hour copper excretion. Transient plasmapheresis - known to reduce circulating copper - was continued for possible treatment of CIDP. After Wilson's disease was ruled out, copper supplementation was restarted at 8 mg daily, indicating a slight improvement in symptoms and anemia leading to subsequent discharge. Conclusions: Presentation of CD mimicking chronic inflammatory demyelinating radiculopathy has proven challenging in diagnosis and management, especially in the setting of previous AIDP. Where an initial positive response to steroids and plasmapheresis suggested an inflammatory etiology, later tides suggested otherwise. The question is whether the first episode of AIDP in the previous year was actually the first presentation of said CD against CIDP.",,"Upadhyaya, P.;Ghodsianzadeh, F.;Romero, R.;Bhavaraju-Sanka, R.",2017,,,0,0,
1188,Non-Wilson hepatolenticular degeneration: clinical and MRI observations in four families from South India,"Non-Wilson hepatolenticular degeneration (NWHD) is a heterogeneous neurological disorder that occurs secondary to chronic acquired liver disease. Genetically determined familial NWHD is rare, poorly understood, and often confused with Wilson's disease (WD). We analyzed the clinical and MRI profiles of NWHD patients who had no obvious cause for alcohol intake or acquired liver disease such as hepatitis. Six patients from four families (four men, two women, mean age: 17.0 +/- standard deviation 7.9 years) with chronic extrapyramidal disorder resembling WD and imaging (abdominal ultrasound/MRI) evidence of cirrhosis were studied. They lacked Kayser-Fleischer rings or biochemical and/or genetic evidence of WD. Clinical features include dystonia (n = 6), parkinsonism (n = 3), tremor (n = 1), cerebellar ataxia (n = 3), orofacial dyskinesia (n = 1), behavioral abnormalities (n = 3), and cognitive decline ( n = 1). Brain MRI in pallidum (n = 6), crus cerebri (n = 4), putamen (n = 1), caudate (n = 1), thalamus (n = 1), and red nucleus (n = 1) ) showed T1-weighted hyperintensity. = 1) With T2-weighted shortening in some of these regions. Additional findings included the giant cisterna magna (n = 1), the face of the giant panda sign (n = 1), and the thin corpus callosum (n = 1). Areas of ""blooming"" on the sensitivity-weighted images were noted in two patients in the caudate (n = 2) and in the putamen (n = 1). The finding of T1 shortening is different from WD, where the majority of lesions are T1-hyperintense and T2-hyperintense. Extrapallidal T1-hyperintensity is also an exceptional observation in NWHD. The MRI appearance of intense T1 shortening, combined with the absence of increased sensitivity changes, suggests manganese as the most likely mineral deposited. In the absence of an acquired liver disease, the association between this neurological disorder and liver cirrhosis is a separate disease state. This syndrome may represent a manganese metabolism disorder that causes its toxic accumulation. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Nagappa, M.;Sinha, S.;Saini, J.

1190,Dog models for copper homeostasis disorders,"Copper is an essential trace nutrient metal involved in numerous cellular processes. Inherited defects in copper metabolism cause serious clinical disorders such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease. Copper accumulation in Wilson's disease leads to liver cirrhosis and neurological disorders. The lack of genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson's disease indicates the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In some non-Wilson forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain unclear. Several purebred dog populations are affected by copper-associated hepatitis, which has similarities to human copper metabolism disorders. Gene mapping studies in these populations provide an opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. Also, due to their relatively large body size and long lifespan, dogs are excellent models for the development of new treatment strategies. One example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review considers the opportunities offered by canine genetics for the discovery of genes involved in copper metabolism disorders. Furthermore, the possibilities for the use of dogs in the development of new therapeutic modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived hepatic organoids, are highlighted.

1191,D-penicillamine combined with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism enhances the response of lung and breast cancer cells to radiation and carboplatin via H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated oxidative stress,"D-penicillamine (DPEN), a copper chelator, has been used to treat Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent evidence shows that DPEN in combination with biologically relevant copper (Cu) concentrations produces H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in cancer cell cultures, but this has effects on cancer cell ionization responses. . radiation and chemotherapy are unknown. Increased steady-state H<inf>2</inf>2</inf> levels were detected in MB231 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells following treatment with DPEN (100 microM) and copper sulfate (15 microM). ). Clonogenic survival demonstrated that DPEN-induced cancer cell toxicity was Cu-dependent and significantly increased by inhibition of glutathione [using butionine sulfoxime (BSO)] before exposure, as well as by inhibition of thioredoxin reductase [using Auranophine (Au)]. Treatment with catalase inhibited DPEN toxicity and confirmed that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> is the toxic strain. Moreover, pretreatment of cancer cells with iron sucrose increased DPEN toxicity, inhibited DPEN toxicity when treated with deferoxamine, a Fe chelator that inhibits redox cycling. Importantly, DPEN also showed selective toxicity in human breast and lung cancer cells relative to normal untransformed human lung or mammary epithelial cells and increased cancer cell killing when combined with ionizing radiation or carboplatin. Consistent with selective cancer cell toxicity, normal untransformed human lung epithelial cells had significantly lower unstable iron pools than lung cancer cells. These results suggest that DPEN could be reused as an adjuvant in the treatment of metal ion-catalyzed H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated oxidative stress and DPEN in conventional cancer therapy.

As a key regulator of epithelial mesenchymal differentiation, ZEB2 plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis and its high expression has been observed in glioma patients. Different mutations in this gene have been described in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. A previous genome-wide schizophrenia association study (GWAS) conducted in Caucasians demonstrated a significant association of rs12991836, located near the ZEB2 gene, with schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study to investigate whether this genomic region is also a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population.

This patient's condition deteriorated further, resulting in a 4-year late diagnosis, as the cause of the death of this patient's sibling, which was not taken into account when taking his medical history, was the same genetic abnormality.

1197,Clinical features and outcomes in patients with osseomuscular type Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease of the osseomuscular type is a rare condition that often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and is easily misdiagnosed. Eight Chinese patients with osseomuscular Wilson's disease have been identified in our clinic in the last 10 years. Methods: Clinical information was collected from medical records and follow-ups. Genetic testing was performed on each patient. Serum ceruloplasmin, Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated. Results: The median age of onset is 12. Patients initially had musculoskeletal problems with arthralgia or joint deformity, and hepatic or neurologic manifestations were minimal. Most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms after a median interval of 36 months. All had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/L). Most (6/8) patients present with Kayser-Fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. Arthralgia improved with copper chelation therapy. Conclusions: The osseomuscular type of Wilson's disease presents without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, making clinical diagnosis difficult. Serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic tests help to establish the diagnosis. Early detection can initiate effective treatment and prevent further damage.

1200,Advances in understanding and treating liver diseases during pregnancy: a review.,"Liver disease in pregnancy is rare, but pregnancy-related liver disease can threaten fetal and maternal survival. Includes preeclampsia; eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet syndrome; acute fatty liver of pregnancy; hyperemesis gravidarum; and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Recent basic research has demonstrated the various etiologies involved in this disease occurrence. With these developments, prompt diagnosis is essential in severe cases, as the decision to urgently deliver is important for maternal and fetal survival. Other therapeutic options have also been demonstrated in recent reports based on clinical trials, and collaboration and knowledge sharing between hepatologist and gynecologist is important for timely therapeutic intervention. Therefore, correct understanding of diseases during pregnancy and differential diagnosis from pre-existing and co-existing liver diseases will help to obtain a better prognosis. Therefore, we review and summarize recent advances in understanding the etiologies, clinical course, and management of liver disease in pregnancy. This information will contribute to physicians' diagnosis of the disease and optimum management of patients. Copyright © 2015 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

1201,Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content as determined using the entire core of the liver biopsy specimen.,"Hepatic copper determination is an important test for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD). However, the method has not been standardized, its diagnostic accuracy has not been prospectively evaluated, and the optimal cut-off value is controversial. Accordingly, we aimed to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content as determined using the whole core of the liver biopsy specimen. Patients for whom liver biopsy was indicated were recorded consecutively. Hepatic copper content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. All tests were performed by a single technician using careful quality control. The diagnosis of WD was based on the WD score or in combination with clinical follow-up results. A total of 3350 consecutive patients underwent liver biopsy. Six hundred and ninety-one patients, 178 of whom had WD, underwent hepatic copper determination and two-pass liver biopsy. The mean hepatic content in WD patients was 770.6+/-393.2 cups/g dry weight (by weight). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of hepatic copper content for the diagnosis of WD in the absence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis at a cut-off value of 250 mug/g dry weight. were 94.4%, 96.8%, 91.8% and 97.8%, respectively. The most useful cut-off value was 209 cups/g dry weight with sensitivity and specificity of 99.4% and 96.1%, respectively. Hepatic copper content was >75 cups/g dry weight in a total of 23.3% of patients without WD and PBC. Conclusion: A liver biopsy specimen greater than 1 mg dry weight can reliably reflect hepatic copper content and should be used for hepatic copper determination. Hepatic copper determination is a very valid procedure for diagnosing WD and the most useful threshold value is 209 cups/g dry weight.

1202,<sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics investigation of the copper-loaded rat: a model of Wilson's disease,"Introduction and Aim: Wilson's disease (WD), also known as hepatoleticular degeneration (HLD), is a rare autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder that causes copper to accumulate in body tissues. In this study, rats fed a copper-loaded diet were used to establish clinical manifestations of WD and their organ lesions caused by copper toxicity were investigated. To investigate the metabolic behaviors of the 'decoppering' process, penicillamine (PA) was used to treat copper-loaded rats, as this chelating agent can remove excess copper through urine. To date, limited metabolomic studies have been performed on WD, while the metabolic effects of copper accumulation and PA administration have not yet been determined. Material and Methods: A combination of <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis was applied to examine the metabolic profiles of urine and blood serum samples collected from the copper-loaded rat model of WD with PA treatment. Conclusions: Copper accumulation in copper-loaded rats is associated with decreased glucose and taurine levels, as well as increased blood serum lactate, creatinine, valine, and leucine. There were also significant changes in p-hydroxyphenylacetate (p-HPA), creatinine, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), dimethylamine, N-acetylglutamate (NAG), N-acetylglycoprotein (NAC) in the urine of these rats. Notably, changes in p-HPA, glucose, lactate, taurine, valine, leucine, and NAG were found to be reversed following PA treatment. However, there was no change for dimethylamine, alpha-KG, and NAC as a result of treatment. Compared to controls, concentrations of hippurate, formate, alanine, and lactate were altered when PA was administered, possibly due to its side-effect. A tool called SMPDB (Small Molecule Pathway Database) was introduced to identify the metabolic pathway affected by the copper-loaded diet. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the potential application of NMR-based metabolomic analysis in providing further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying WD-related impairment.

1203,Functional analysis and drug response to zinc and D-penicillamine in stable ATP7B mutant liver cell lines,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of anti-copper treatment for the survival of hepatic cells expressing different ATP7B mutations in cell culture. METHODS: The most common Wilson's disease (WD) mutations found in the ATP7B gene encoding the liver copper transporter, p.H1069Q, p.R778L, and p.C271* were examined. The mutations represent the major genotypes of the United States and Europe, China and India, respectively. A human hepatoma cell line previously established to carry an ATP7B knockout was used to stably express WD mutants. mRNA and protein expression of mutant ATP7B, cell survival, apoptosis and protein trafficking were determined. RESULTS: Low temperature increased ATP7B protein expression in several mutants. Intracellular ATP7B localization is significantly impaired in mutants. Mutants were classified as high, moderate and non-survival based on their viability when exposed to toxic copper. Survival of mutant p.H1069Q and to a lesser extent p.C271* improved with D-penicillamine (DPA) treatment, whereas mutant p.R778L showed a marked response to zinc (Zn) treatment. Overall, DPA treatment resulted in higher cell survival compared to Zn treatment; however, only combined Zn + DPA treatment fully restored cell viability. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that the main effect of a genotype can be characterized by analysis of mutant liver cell lines. Copyright Â© 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

1206,Plasma exchange and chelator therapy saves acute liver failure in Wilson's disease without liver transplant,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is fatal in patients with a New Wilson Index (NWI) score >= 11 and these patients are good candidates for liver transplantation (LT). However, plasma exchange and chelator therapy are indispensable and effective even for WD >= 11. Furthermore, continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is required with these treatments for acute liver failure (ALF) in WD with hepatic encephalopathy, because CHDF can rule out toxic ones. Metabolites that can damage the brain. Here, we describe four rescued patients presenting with ALF in WD and discuss the treatment options available. Methods: We experienced 11 male and 8 female patients who applied to Kumamoto University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics with WD between 1999 and 2014. One male and 4 female patients were diagnosed with WD with ALF using a combination of clinical findings and biochemical tests. Results: In cases 1 to 3, the NWI score was >= 11. Cases 1 and 2 with hepatic encephalopathy received plasma exchange, CHDF, coagulation factor replacement therapy (CFRT), and LT. Cases 3 and 4 without encephalopathy achieved stable status without LT with plasma exchange, blood infusion and CFRT. Conclusions: LT is better in WD patients with NWI score >= 11, but there is a possibility of remission with plasma exchange and medical therapy even without LT. WD patients with NWI score >= 11 can be salvaged with conservative treatment when ALF of WD and hepatic encephalopathy are absent. Thus, ALF with hepatic encephalopathy itself is an indicator for LT in WD.

1209,Structure and synaptic function of metal binding to amyloid precursor protein and proteolytic fragments,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is ultimately linked to amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, current research reveals an important synaptic function of APP and APP-like proteins (APLP1 and 2). In this regard, various neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions have been reported for the APP proteolytic fragments sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta and the monomeric amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). APP is a metalloprotein and binds copper and zinc ions. Synaptic activity is associated with the release of these ions into the synaptic cleft, and dysregulation of their homeostasis is associated with different neurodegenerative diseases. Metal binding to APP or fragments thereof influences its structure and proteolytic cleavage and thus its physiological function at the synapse. Here we summarize the available data supporting this hypothesis and present a model of how these different mechanisms may be intertwined.

Although WD is one of the causes of myoclonus, it is rarely seen as an accompanying finding in WD. We present an adolescent female WD case at 6 months of age who presented with cortical multifocal myoclonus and later developed generalized dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome and cognitive decline. Kayser-Fleischer ring was present on slit lamp examination. Serum copper, urine copper, serum ceruloplasmin and magnetic resonance imaging were compatible with the diagnosis of brain WD. Copper chelation was initiated along with other symptomatic treatments and dietary changes. Myoclonus resolved at 3-month follow-up with improvement of other symptoms. This case report highlights that myoclonus may be the main and emerging feature of WD.

Materials and methods: Structured clinical interviews (patients and caregiver family members), repeated neurological examinations (afternoon and pre-sleep), comprehensive laboratory tests, WD-, RLS- and sleep-specific rating scales, and video-polysomnography. Results: Thirteen patients with WD (13/42 = 31.0%) clearly met the five diagnostic criteria for RLS; RLS burden was clinically significant in eight patients (19.1%). RLS is moderate in severity, evenly distributed between the sexes, presenting mainly in the evening and before falling asleep, and mostly after clinical manifestation of WD (10.2 +/-14.5 years past), at a young mean age (27.5 years). ) is developed. +/- 11.5 years). There were no known RLS-related features (normal iron and kidney parameters) or rare (positive family history, polyneuropathy). Compared with WH patients without RLS, patients with RLS were significantly older and had suffered longer from WD. RLS mimics specific to WD, as well as motor comorbidities confounding RLS (dystonia, tremor, chorea) were common and a diagnostic challenge; In difficult cases, differentiation was achieved by clinical observation of motor behavior in the evening or at night. Conclusion: RLS was common in this WD cohort and may be causally related to WD. RLS should be included in the diagnostic study of WD. Differential diagnosis of RLS in complex motor disorders may require evening/night examination and video-polysomnography.

1212,Trace metal regulation of neuronal apoptosis: From genes to behavior,"The genetically programmed form of neuron death known as apoptosis is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease. Apoptosis is also responsible for neuronal death after traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, and seizures. The cognitive and behavioral consequences of all these disorders can be devastating. Unfortunately, the mechanisms regulating neuronal apoptosis are complex. However, it is this complexity that provides us with a wide range of potential targets for the development of anti-apoptotic strategies. Therefore, our laboratory is currently investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for neuronal apoptosis, focusing on the role of the metals copper, zinc and iron. Each of these metals is essential for normal central nervous system (CNS) development and function. However, excessive or incomplete imbalances can cause neuronal apoptosis. In this review, we show the relationship between these metals in neurodegenerative disorders and CNS injury and the mechanisms governing neuronal survival and apoptosis. Â© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1216,The utility of transient elastography to predict outcome of Decopper Therapy in a 13-year-old girl with acute chronic liver failure from Wilson's disease.,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by abnormal copper accumulation. Decopper is an effective treatment with an excellent outcome if the disease is diagnosed early [1]. However, the majority of patients with acute liver failure or acutely severe manifestation over chronic liver failure need emergency liver transplantation [2]. Although a recent study showed that ultrasound-based transient elastography (Fibroscan) with a cut-off value of 6.6 kPa can be used to predict liver fibrosis [3], in untreated WD, particularly the outcome of initial therapy. Methods: Outcome: A 13-year-old girl with complaints of jaundice, ascites, and coagulation for 6 months was referred from a local hospital for liver transplantation. In our hospital, Wilson's disease was diagnosed with positive CF rings, low serum ceruloplasmin, high urinary copper level and neuropsychiatric involvement. Liver biopsy was not performed because of uncorrected coagulopathy. Transient elastography was measured with a value of 50.6 kPa (Figure 1A). At admission, patients had grade I-II encephalopathy with fluctuation of consciousness and hyperreflexia. Treatment was started with depenicillamine and zinc sulfate. After four weeks, clinical features and laboratory parameters were still abnormal (Table 1), but the Fibroscan value was significantly reduced (17.8 kPa) (Figure 1B), reflecting good treatment response and patient compliance. Conclusion: We present a case of WD with severe manifestations that may require liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is less likely with unpredictable waiting list time, so decopper therapy is initiated after the diagnosis of WD. Treatment response will last 3 months from baseline [1], as a result, new parameter is required to predict treatment outcome. We suggest that transient elastography be used, apart from clinical response and liver function testing, not only to predict treatment outcome, but also to assess patient compliance in long-term follow-up.

1217,Copper homeostasis as a therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with SOD1 mutation,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, and there is currently no cure or effective treatment. Mutations in a gene encoding Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme, were first identified as a cause of familial forms of ALS. It is widely accepted that mutant SOD1 proteins cause disease through an increase in toxicity, but not through loss of physiological function. SOD1 is an important copper binding protein and regulates copper homeostasis in the cell; therefore, a toxicity of mutant SOD1 may result from disruption of copper homeostasis. In this review, we will briefly review recent studies that imply roles of copper homeostasis in SOD1-ALS pathogenesis and highlight therapeutic interventions focused on pharmacological and genetic regulation of copper homeostasis to modify the pathological process in SOD1-ALS.

Patients and methods: Description of clinical and laboratory findings. Results: A 35-year-old female patient was referred to the neurology department with complaints of resting, postural and kinetic tremors in the upper extremities, and head tremor. Diagnostic study revealed Kaiser-Fleischer rings in both eyes, high copper levels in urine (200 cups/24 hours, normal value [nv] <100, low ceruloplasmin levels (17.5 mg/dL-nv22-58), and marginally low serum) A diagnosis of copper (0.6 cups/mL-nv0.7-1.4) Wilson's disease was made. On the chest X-ray of the patient, it was confirmed that the lung hilum was enlarged and this represented enlarged lymph nodes by computed tomography. angiotensin converting enzyme 72.2 U/L (nv 12-68), spirometry was normal (FEV1: 87%, FVC: 88%, Dlco: 81%, FRC: 89%, RV: 82%, TLC: 84%), and there was no significant hemoglobin desaturation during the six-minute walk test (97% to 96%, walking distance: 360 m) Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed: Cells: 0.132x10<sup>6</sup>, alveolar macrophages 44%, lymphocytes 42%, neutrophils % 6, mononuclear 3%, eosinophils 5% Ratio CD4/CD8: 2.57 The patient was started on triethylenetetramine (Trientine) because of his primary disease and was followed up for Stage I sarcoidosis. After three years, it remains clinically stable with no respiratory symptoms, with unchanged findings of sarcoidosis from spirometry and computed tomography. Coexistence of these two diseases is rare. Only one similar case has been reported. It involved a 43-year-old man who presented with the symptoms and signs of cirrhosis and no neurological symptoms.

1220,Update on the clinical management of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD), although relatively rare, is an important genetic metabolic disease due to highly effective treatments that can be life-saving. It is a great imitator and requires a high index of suspicion for accurate and timely diagnosis. The neurological, psychiatric and hepatological problems in WD are not very specific and we discuss the most common clinical phenotypes. Diagnosis remains laboratory-based, and here we review the most important challenges and pitfalls in laboratory evaluation of WD, including the emerging role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of WD. WD is a monogenic disorder but has very high allelic heterogeneity with >500 disease-causing mutations and new insights into phenotype-genotype correlations are also being reviewed. The gold standard of therapy is chelation of excess copper, but many unmet needs remain due to possible clinical deterioration in treated patients and the potential side effects associated with currently available chelating drugs. We also review the most promising new therapeutic approaches, including chelators, cell transplantation and gene therapy that target specific cell types.

1221,Surgical treatment in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutation in the ATB 7B gene, a membrane-bound copper-transporting ATPase. Impaired copper excretion causes an increase in serum levels and a buildup of copper in the body. Various symptoms can be seen in the liver, nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart. There are also changes in blood chemistry. Objective: A forty-six-year-old female patient presents with Wilson's disease in the treatment rooms of the Faculty of Dentistry of Plovdiv. He needs full dental care. He also suffered an ischemic stroke. Methods and Results: Since the treatment plan started with tooth extraction under local anesthesia, complete blood count and INR test were performed. Oral mucosa and bone were obtained by biopsy for evidence of pigments in these tissues. The biopsy results showed copper deposits in them as well. Conclusion: It is a rare disease that seriously affects the liver and nervous system and is seen at a rate of about 1 in 40 000.

Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. The indication for LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of LT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods This is a retrospective study. From 2002 to 2015, nine patients (mean age 21 [12-42] years) underwent LT in France without neurological improvement and acute liver failure despite medical treatment for serious neurological complications. Chelating copper was given to all patients and chelating copper was given to 2 patients with zinc salts. Results. Neurological symptoms were heterogeneous, combining dystonic postures, akinesia, cerebellar ataxia, chorea, and parkinson's syndrome. The CHILD score was A for all patients at the time of transplantation. After analysis of the native liver, all patients had cirrhosis. The mean time between the diagnosis of WD and LT was 11.4 [5-28] months and the mean follow-up time after transplantation was 50 [2-42] months. Five patients (mean age 19 [12-30] years) with a mean follow-up of 80 [2–156] months had a neurological improvement with a marked improvement in quality of life after LT. Four patients (mean age 24 [15-42] years) showed no significant improvement in neurological symptoms and died from infectious complications after a mean interval of 13 [2-36] months. Three of the four patients who died had severe Parkinson's syndrome and akinesia, limiting movements and swallowing. A relationship between genetic mutations and prognosis could not be demonstrated. Conclusion: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in WD in patients whose neurological symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, even in the absence of liver failure. Patients with adverse evolution died of severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms can be a humiliating factor.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Vanlemmens, C.;Hermeziu, B.;Adam, R.;Cherqui, D.;Castaing, D.;Samuel, D.;Woimant, F.;Duclos-Vallee, J.

1226,Evaluation of kidney function in children with Wilson's disease. [Turkish],"Introduction: In this study, it was aimed to evaluate kidney functions in Wilson's disease (WD) using urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and NAG/creatinine activity index. Material and Methods: For the study, 20 children with WD of similar age and gender were determined as the patient group, and 37 healthy children were determined as the control group. NAG levels were calculated as mlU/L and NAG activity index was determined as mlU/mg. Results: While four (20%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, chronic hepatitis, neurological WD, fulminant hepatitis and acute hepatitis were seen in six (30%), five (25%), three (15%) and two patients (10%). , respectively. Thirteen (65%) of the children were under trientine and zinc treatment, and seven (35%) were under d-penicillamine and zinc treatment. Ten (50%) children had proteinuria, one (5%) had glycosuria, and one (5%) had microscopic hematuria. While mean urinary sodium and creatinine levels were significantly lower than controls (p=0.048 and p=0.001, respectively), NAG and NAG indices were significantly higher (p=0.049 and p=0.03). It was observed that the clinical picture did not affect these parameters (p>0.05). No correlation was found between Child-Pugh score and these parameters (p>0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that WD itself and/or the drugs used in the treatment adversely affected kidney functions in children with WD, but did not have any effect on the severity of liver damage and the clinical presentation of the disease.

1230,Wilson's patient with iron metabolism discharge barriers: a case report,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal genetic disease. In this study, the patient was a 35-year-old woman who had exhibited drinking bucking (bulbar palsy) and dysphagia for nine years. The patient's genetic analysis identified mutations Thr935Met and Pro992Leu that lead to copper metabolism discharge barriers. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sensitivity-weighted imaging (SWI) hyperintense area in the bilateral substantia nigra and lenticular nuclei. These SWI observations indicated that 'mineral deposits' were present. This case demonstrates that the patient's symptoms, together with the bilateral lenticular nucleus, substantia nigra, and red nucleus SWI hyperintense area, are likely to diagnose WD when not detected by genetic analysis. In addition, it shows that systemic demineralization therapy (including manganese, iron, and copper) can be successful for initial treatment of WD. Copyright Â© 2016 Spandidos Publications.

1231,Clinical spectrum of eye malformations in four patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by a specific facial gestalt, intellectual deficiency, Hirschsprung's disease, and multiple congenital anomalies. Heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox2 gene (ZEB2) cause MWS. ZEB2 encodes Smad-interacting protein 1, a transcriptional co-repressor involved in the TGF-beta and BMP pathways, and is strongly expressed early in development in mice. Eye abnormalities have rarely been described in patients with this syndrome. Here we describe four patients (two men and two women; mean age 7 years) with MWS and eye malformations. Including ocular anomalies, iris/retinal colobomas, atrophy or absence of the optic nerve, hyphema and deep refraction problems, sometimes with serious visual consequences. All eye malformations were asymmetrical and often unilateral, and all eye segments were affected, similar to the nine previously reported cases of MWS with ophthalmologic malformations (iris/chorioretinal/optic disc coloboma, optic nerve atrophy, retinal epithelial atrophy, cataract, and chorectopia). In the human embryo, ZEB2 is expressed in the lens and neural retina. Using the present report and data from the literature, we set out to determine whether the presence of ocular findings is dependent on the specific type or location of mutations. We concluded that the presence of eye malformations, although a rare feature in MWS, should be considered as part of the clinical spectrum of the condition.

1232,Spectrum of ZEB2 mutations causing Mowat-Wilson syndrome in Japanese populations,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by moderate or severe intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, microcephaly, epilepsy, corpus callosum agenesis or hypoplasia, congenital heart defects, Hirschsprung's disease, and urogenital/renal anomalies. . It results from de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations, including nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and deletions in ZEB2 at 2q22. ZEB2 encodes the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 protein consisting of 1,214 amino acids. Here, we report 13 nonsense and 27 frameshift mutations from 40 newly identified MWS patients in Japan. Although the clinical findings of all Japanese MWS patients with nonsense and frameshift mutations were quite similar to previous review reports of MWS caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and ZEB2 deletions, the frequency of microcephaly, Hirschsprung's disease, and urogenital/renal anomalies was small. Patients harbored mutations in wild-type ZEB2 spanning the region between amino acids 55 and 1,204. There was no significant genotype-phenotype correlation among the patients. A transfection study showed that the cellular level of the longest form of mutant ZEB2 protein harboring the p.D1204Rfs*29 mutation was extremely low. The results showed that the 3'-end frameshift mutation of ZEB2 causes MWS due to ZEB2 instability.

Slight increases in iron content in certain brain regions, sometimes as little as twice, can have a devastating effect on brain function. In this current review, we will first discuss changes in brain iron homeostasis during healthy aging and longevity, and how changes in its concentration and distribution can accelerate various neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in metal ion homeostasis of other metal ions such as copper and zinc also occur in neurodegenerative diseases and will be discussed. In the last five years, the use of iron chelators has been reported to slow disease progression and even improve clinical symptoms in some neurodegenerative diseases; Clinical trials have confirmed their efficacy in specific neurodegenerative diseases such as Friederich's ataxia and Parkinson's disease. The development of new chelators that can target specific areas of the brain, coupled with drugs that can modulate inflammatory processes, will further raise hopes for eradicating these debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.

1236,Symptoms and Evolution of Wilson's Disease in Pediatric Patients Carrying the Very Rare atb7b Mutation l708p. [],"OBJECTIVES: To characterize a cohort of 11 pediatric patients aged 3 to 13 years affected by Wilson's disease on the island of Gran Canaria. METHODS: Genetic, biochemical, and pathological features, along with their response to therapy and clinical evolution, were analyzed for this patient group. RESULTS: Genetically, the group was highly homogeneous with a very high prevalence of the L708P mutation (four homozygous and five heterozygous). Although initially screened for asymptomatic hypertransaminemia, all patients presented with some degree of liver injury, never accompanied by any neurological findings. Hepatic damage was most severe in a compound heterozygote with a novel mutation, G1266W, affecting a motif in the ATP7B polypeptide that is highly conserved in similar proteins among metazoans. Serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper were found to be of great diagnostic value with the determination of hepatic copper content, while urinary copper measurements were found to be much less precise. All patients responded well to treatment with D-penicillamine and there were no documented adverse effects.

1238,Wilson's disease: Health-related quality of life and risk of depression,"Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and requires lifelong medical treatment. Therefore, quality of life analysis has garnered more attention. The aim of this study was to examine the risk of depression and health-related quality of life in patients suffering from Wilson's disease. Methods: 68 patients were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 Depression Scale was used to assess depression. The Short Form-36 Health Questionnaire questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of life. Results: The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 found that 21% (14/68) of patients were at risk for major depressive disorder (scores > 10) and 35% (24/68) were at risk for mild depression (scores 5-9). showed below. ). Women had significantly lower quality of life scores than men. Primary neurological disease manifestation was associated with significantly lower overall Short Form-36 and sub-dimension scores compared with primary hepatic or mixed presentation. Overall, patients with Wilson's disease experienced a higher quality of life than patients with other chronic liver diseases. Conclusions: Since patients with Wilson's disease have a high risk of depressive disorder, active assessment for depression is mandatory. Patients with primary neurological symptoms are at higher risk for decreased quality of life. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,"Schaefer, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1239,Role of zinc in liver cirrhosis,"Zinc is an essential trace element that plays essential roles in cellular metabolism. It mostly acts by binding to a wide variety of proteins, thereby affecting a wide range of biological processes including cell division, growth and differentiation. Zinc is critical for numerous structural proteins, enzymatic processes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency can cause a range of clinical signs including loss of appetite, loss of body hair, changes in taste and smell, testicular atrophy, cerebral and immune dysfunction, and decreased drug elimination capacity. These are common symptoms in patients with chronic liver diseases, especially liver cirrhosis. The liver is the main organ responsible for zinc metabolism, which can be affected by liver diseases. On the other hand, zinc deficiency can alter hepatocyte functions as well as immune responses in inflammatory liver diseases. Liver cirrhosis represents the most advanced stage of chronic liver diseases and is a common consequence of chronic liver damage. Numerous metabolic disorders such as energy malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia are associated with an imbalance between branched chain amino acids and aromatic amino acids, and decreased serum concentrations of zinc. All these processes can affect the clinical outcomes of patients such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we summarize the emerging evidence about the pitoval role of zinc in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis. Copyright © 2016 by Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur.

1241,Possible treatment options for neurological signs and symptoms in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly presents with liver symptoms but may also be accompanied by various neurological findings. WD can be successfully treated with chelators or zinc salts to correct abnormal copper metabolism, which usually improves both liver function and neurological deficits; however, improvement in neurological deficits may take years. Patients may initially present with severe neurological deficits that affect their activities of daily living. Consequently, treatment is needed to alleviate neurological symptoms. Treatment options are usually based on experience with other disorders with clinically similar symptoms to WD. Areas covered: Apart from general recommendations regarding anti-copper therapy and liver transplantation in patients with WD, no guidelines are available for managing neurological symptoms. Based mainly on case reports, this review describes the most common neurological symptoms and possible treatments. Expert opinion: There is no strong evidence for the treatment of neurological disorders in patients with WD. A few case studies show that drugs used to treat movement disorders such as tremor, parkinsonism, or dystonia can also alleviate these symptoms in patients with WD. In the case of severe, disabling, neurological symptoms, treatment options for symptoms should always be discussed with the patient.

1247,Wilson's disease in Thai children at the king chulalongkorn memorial hospital between 2000 and 2012,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper accumulation. Clinical presentations are extraordinarily diverse and currently no single diagnostic test can confirm WD with high accuracy. A thorough understanding of presentations and advanced diagnostic methods are important for disease management. The authors aimed to examine the disease characteristics, management and treatment outcomes of WD, especially in children with limited genetic analysis and liver copper measurements. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from 21 children with WD who were treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2012. Inclusion criteria followed the WD scoring system, in which other liver diseases were systematically excluded. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 13.5±3.36 years, with 19 symptomatic patients and two asymptomatic individuals diagnosed by family screening. Presentations are varied, jaundice (52%), ascites (52%), edema (52%), Coombsnegative hemolytic anemia (14%), neurological abnormalities (33%), renal involvement (19%), and fulminant liver failure (5%) ). According to key parameters in the WD scoring system, 14 (66%) patients had Kayser-Fleischer (CF) rings. Seventeen (89%) had low serum ceruloplasmin and 20 (95%) increased urinary copper excretion. These positive findings allowed the WD scoring system to correctly diagnose 66% of patients. Chelation therapy was the first treatment option in all patients except one patient who had liver transplantation. After treatment, liver function tests returned to normal in all patients. However, there was no improvement in neurological symptoms with combined drug therapy using chelating and neuropsychiatric agents. Conclusion: In children, WD mostly affected the liver. WD was suspected in seven patients (34%), therefore further investigation was needed. Therefore, long-term follow-up in those with suspected WD is a suitable method for diagnosis and treatment in limited diagnostic tests. We recommend using further treatment and clinical response to therapy as a criterion to confirm the diagnosis of WD. Copyright © 2016, Thai Medical Association.

1248,Chemical and physical characterization of thermal aggregation of model proteins modulated by zinc(II) and copper(II) ions.,"BACKGROUND: Metal ions are involved in the protein aggregation processes of various neurodegenerative pathologies where protein accumulation occurs, and in the field of biotechnology, such as food technology, where many processes in food production are based on heat treatments. OBJECTIVE: Models of the effect of Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions on the thermal aggregation process of two proteins, Bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), these ions It has been studied to describe its role in protein aggregation kinetics and to elucidate the relevant molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Protein structure changes were monitored by Raman spectroscopy, while aggregate growth was followed by Dynamic Light Scattering measurements. CONCLUSIONS: While both metal ions can promote BLG aggregation, only Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions have a supportive effect on BSA's thermal aggregation. The reason for this divergent behavior is that BLG cluster evolution is masculine affected by charge redistribution, while BSA is influenced by metal-to-metal coordination binding. CONCLUSIONS: Raman spectroscopy combined with dynamic light scattering experiments was very useful in determining the role played by Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> on the aggregation pathways of BLG and BSA. . The results provide evidence for the role of histidine residues in both the charge redistribution and bimetal binding mode involved in systems containing BLG and BSA, respectively.

The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease. The lesion biopsy showed transepidermal elimination of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-like elastic fibers. Clinical and pathological findings were consistent with elastosis perfurans serpiginosa secondary to D-penicillamine. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is estimated to occur in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. D-penicillamine directly or indirectly blocks the desmosine cross-links between elastin molecules, leading to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers. Elastosis perfurans serpiginosa may be the first manifestation of a multisystemic degenerative process of elastic connective tissue. Copyright Â© Ordem dos Medicos 2016.",,"Pinho, A.;Cardoso, J.

1254,High-sensitivity isotopic analysis of essential mineral elements in biomedicine: Natural isotope ratio variations as potential diagnostic and/or prognostic markers.,"High precision isotopic analysis of key mineral elements, particularly Ca, Cu, Fe and Zn, provides relevant biomedical information. For this application, multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometry is the preferred technique. The variation in the isotope signature of these elements is governed by changes in their uptake, metabolism, and/or excretion. Therefore, diseases that affect mineral metal metabolism such as hemochromatosis, cancer, liver cirrhosis and Wilson's disease affect the isotopic composition of these elements in certain body parts. This review discusses how natural isotope ratio variations in biofluids can potentially be used as alternative approaches for diagnosing diseases that would otherwise only be determined at a later stage or with a more invasive method and/or for prognostic purposes. This discussion also includes an assessment of isotopic variability in biofluids for apparently healthy individuals and in biofluids, soft tissues and bone of experimentally controlled animals. Attention was also paid to physiological and lifestyle factors.

1255,Serum Copper and Zinc in a Representative Sample of the Bulgarian Population,"Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are essential for life. Body Cu and Zn content depends on various factors such as age, gender and diet, type of drinking water, geographic location and genetic predisposition. Copper status becomes even more important not only in rare genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease, but also in diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, impaired glucose tolerance, and neuro-degenerative and tumor diseases. The study aimed to examine the distribution of serum Cu and Zn in a representative group of the Bulgarian population and to identify the factors affecting the metal content. It also aimed to describe the link between serum Cu levels and the frequency of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Bulgarians. Cu and Zn in serum were measured by flame atomic absorption using AAnalyst 400, Perkin Elmer in 379 individuals (172 males and 207 females) from 5 different regions of Bulgaria. Statistical analyzes were performed with SPSS, 19. The median and inert-quarter range (IQR) for blood Cu in the studied group were 15.89 (13.87-7.89) mumol/L and Zn-13.00 (11.7-14.68) mumol/L. Higher Cu levels were found in women than men (p < 0.001). It was determined that Zn decreased with aging (p > 0.05). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in serum Cu between youth (<30 years) and adults over 61 years of age. Statistically significant differences were observed in Cu and Zn according to residences (p < 0.05). A non-significant difference was measured between serum lipids and serum Cu (p = 0.541) and Zn (p = 0.741).",,"Ivanova, I.;Atanasova, B.;Kostadinova, A.;Bocheva, Y.;Tzatchev, K.",2016,2022-10-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/amb-2016-0013,0,0,
1256,A case of Wilson's disease presenting as chronic liver disease,"Wilson's disease is one of the most common inherited liver diseases with an incidence of 10-30 million cases worldwide. The increased incidence in some countries is due to high consanguinity rates, and fulminant presentation of the disease is more common in women than men. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, resulting in disruption of biliary copper excretion. Subsequent copper deposition first in the liver, then in the brain and other tissues produces clinical manifestations that may include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other disorders. Genetic testing is impractical due to the large number of mutations identified, so accurate diagnosis relies on the judicious use of laboratory and other diagnostic tests. Life-long palliative therapy with different combinations of drugs or, if necessary, liver transplantation can successfully cure the disease or prevent its progressive worsening, otherwise death is inevitable. Early and accurate diagnosis is very important because there is an effective treatment for this disease. Here, we present a case of Wilson's disease in a 15-year-old girl who presented to us with chronic liver disease. Copyright Â© 2016, Ibn Sina Trust.

1258,Liver disease caused by metabolic diseases. hemochromatosis. Wilson's disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,"Introduction Hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency are the main metabolic liver diseases. Hemochromatosis Patients with hemochromatosis develop a progressive iron overload leading to cirrhosis of the liver. Its diagnosis is based on confirmation of iron overload and the study of mutations of the HFE gene. Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice for hemochromatosis; prevents the progression of cirrhosis. Wilson's disease Wilson's disease is caused by mutations in ATP7B. Its main feature is copper overload, which causes liver toxicity (fulminant liver failure or cirrhosis) and neurotoxicity. Drugs used in the treatment of Wilson's disease are D-penicillamine, trientine and zinc. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency Patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease (neonatal cholestatic hepatitis and/or corinic liver disease) and emphysema as a result of hepatic retention and decreased serum levels of the enzyme. There is no specific treatment for liver disease due to alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Copyright © 2016",,"Santos, J. I. H.",2016,2022-05-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.med.2016.05.002,0,0,

In the same decade, several other important components of copper homeostasis were discovered, such as copper chaperones and plasma membrane copper transporters. This has finally led to a molecular understanding of two inherited human diseases related to copper: Menkes disease, which is manifested by systemic copper deficiency, and Wilson's disease, which is caused by defective secretion of excess copper. A historical perspective and untold stories of the events that led to these discoveries are presented here.

Hepatic and neurological manifestations often overshadow other system involvement, including cardiac symptoms and signs, which can be fatal. We present a case of a young woman who presented with progressive parkinsonian features and dystonia for approximately 4 months and presented with dizziness 2 months later. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease by the presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring and laboratory parameters of copper metabolism. In the patient's electrocardiography, 2nd degree Mobitz type-1 atrioventricular block was detected incidentally, which explains the dizziness attacks. Penicillamine and trihexyphenidyl were started. Heart block resolved spontaneously. Cardiac autonomic function tests, including blood pressure response to standing up and heart rate response to standing up, were normal. We review the literature on the cardiac manifestations of Wilson's disease and emphasize that patients with Wilson's disease should be evaluated for cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction because these may have therapeutic and prognostic implications.

1262,Tremor Diagnosis and Treatment,"Purpose of Review: Tremor, which is the rhythmic oscillation of a body part, is among the most common involuntary movements. Rhythmic oscillations can manifest in various ways; In conclusion, a rich clinical phenomenology surrounds tremor. Therefore, diagnosing tremor disorders can be particularly difficult. The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a simple approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with tremor. Recent Findings: Scientific understanding of the pathophysiological basis of tremor disorders has increased significantly in recent years with the use of a wide variety of neuroimaging approaches and rigorous, controlled post-mortem studies. The basal ganglia and cerebellum are structures that seem to play a prominent role. Summary: Tremor disorders are difficult to diagnose. The approach to tremor involves a history and neurological examination focusing on the nuances of the multiple phenomenology of tremor. Evaluation should begin with a history of tremor and a focused neurological examination. The examination should take into account the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, history and examination are used to determine whether the main type of tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intent tremor) or resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of differential diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor, and disorders in which resting tremor is the main tremor. The most common of the first type include essential tremor, increased physiological tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson's disease is the most common form of rest tremor, along with drug-induced rest tremor. This article details the clinical features of each as well as other tremor disorders.

1264,Wilson's disease: an update. [German],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease in which ATP7B mutations lead to dysfunction of copper metabolism. As a result, decreased excretion of copper into the bile and excessive copper accumulation in the liver and brain occur. Patients with WD typically present in late childhood or adolescence with hepatic symptoms or young adults with extrapyramidal or psychiatric symptoms. However, it is important to consider WD also in patients with movement disorder after the age of 40, especially with (sub)clinical hepatic dysfunction. Left untreated, WD results in serious disability or death. If diagnosed at an early stage, effective treatment is available that will prevent progression of the disease and reverse some symptoms. Treatment with chelating agents induces renal copper excretion and zinc salts inhibit duodenal copper resorption. Liver transplantation makes sense in severe liver cases and is also considered for a severe neurological course that could not otherwise be successfully treated.

1265,Basic bioimaging and speciation analysis for the investigation of Wilson's disease using MuxRF and XANES,"liver biopsy sample from a Wilson's disease (WD) patient was analyzed by micro-X-ray fluorescence (muXRF) spectroscopy to determine the elemental distribution. First, benchtop muXRF was used for a rough scan of the sample under laboratory conditions. The resulting copper and iron distribution maps allowed the identification of a region of interest (ROI) for further analysis. To obtain more detailed background information, this ROI was analyzed with synchrotron radiation (SR)-based muXRF with a beam size of 4 candles offering a cellular-level resolution. Distribution maps of additional elements for zinc and manganese, such as copper and iron, were obtained due to the higher sensitivity of SR-muXRF. In addition, X-ray absorption edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) was performed to determine the oxidation states of copper in WD. Such analysis showed a mixture of copper(i) and copper(ii) in WD liver tissue. Copyright Â© 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Hachmoller, O.;Buzanich, A.

1266,Zinc monotherapy in young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"Introduction and Aims: AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). We have reported that a reasonable goal in treating young children with asymptomatic WD using zinc is to maintain 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the first 1-2 years (Mizuochi, et al. JPGN 2011; 53:365) . Here, we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children under 10 years of age with asymptomatic WD in Japanese pediatric centers and establish criteria for appropriate maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to examine 21 children (median age 6 years, range 1-9) who met the diagnostic criteria for WD at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to symptom onset. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urine copper 1-7 years after the start of zinc monotherapy. Additional monitoring included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, gamma-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, iron, amylase, lipase, and prothrombin time, as well as 24-hour urinary zinc excretion. We performed abdominal ultrasonography and evaluated clinical signs of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The recommended dose of zinc acetate for the <= 5-year-old patient was 25 mg twice daily; For children 6 years of age and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L, and decreased if zinc had side effects such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: AST/ALT and 24-hour urine copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 mug/day (5.8+/-2.9 cups/kg/day) at the time of diagnosis. . days), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT dropped significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after initiation of therapy and mostly remained below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST /ALT : 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/L at 1 and 7 years after initiation of therapy, respectively. Twenty-four-hour urine copper dropped significantly to 49+/-21 cups/day (2.2+/-1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) 6 months after the start of treatment and was mostly kept below 75 cups/day, and the study 1 to 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder (2.2+/-0.6 and 1.5+/-0.2 cups/kg/day 1 and 7 years after initiation of treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy has proven to be highly effective and safe for young children with asymptomatic WD. A reasonable goal of treating young children with asymptomatic WD using zinc is to reduce both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion 1 to 3 cups/kg/day (and above 75 cups/day). below) seems to keep between.",,"Mizuochi, T.;Eda, K.;Takaki, Y.;Iwama, I.;Araki, M.;Inui, A.;Hara, S.;Kumagai, H.;Hagiwara, S.

1267,Serum zinc differential uncertain: Acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease: Acute liver failure,"Objective and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Combined clinical and laboratory findings are needed for early diagnosis. There is a proposed hypothesis that low serum Zinc (Zn) is associated with the phenotypic severity of WD. Indeed, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a Zn-containing metallo-enzyme, reflecting true Zn deficiency, is relatively low in WD patients, which may support this assumption. However, few studies underscore the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis and severity of WD. Our study aimed to observe the values of serum Zn, ALP and other baseline laboratory results in acute liver failure (ALF) of uncertain cause and WD. Patients and Methods: The medical records of children with WD (n=43) and ALF of unknown cause (n=9) at King's College Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Disease-causing mutations have been identified in all WD children. WD is classified as non-WD-ALF (n=28) and WD-ALF (n=15). Serum Zn, copper, ceruloplasmin (CP) and liver function tests values were taken. The formula for free serum copper and corrected Zn was calculated as follows; Free copper (mu mol/L) total copper (mu mol/L)-bound copper (mu mol/L) (Bound copper 0.0472 x ceruloplasmin (mg/L)) and Corrected Zn patient 0.25xZn normal + ((albumin normal/ albumin patient) x (Zn patient-(0.25x Zn normal)) Results: Our study shows a significantly lower serum Zn, corrected Zn, and ALP level in WD-ALF compared with WD without ALF and ALF of unknown cause (Table 1) Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the dramatic abnormality of serum Zn in WD-ALF can distinguish WD-ALF from indeterminate ALF.",,"Sintusek, P.;Dhawan, A.",2016,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000503536.79797.66,0,0,

Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which maintains detailed clinical records of all insurers in Taiwan. The database used in this study is a random sample of two million out of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. And the integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson's disease, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in the outpatient or inpatient registry. Results: During the study, 66 Wilson's disease cases were detected. The male female ratio was 1.75. The mean prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the mean annual incidence rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The age-specific incidence rate peaked at 10-14 years of age, followed by 20-24 years and 25-29 years. Fifty-four (81.8%) of all subjects started treatment with zinc (12.1%) and D-penicillamine compared to trientine (6.1%). Liver transplantation was performed in 27 (40.9%) of these 66 patients with Wilson's disease due to liver cirrhosis and 3 (4.5%) due to liver failure. Conclusions: D-penicillamine is still the most prescribed drug in patients with Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy.

1269,A Japanese boy with idiopathic copper toxicosis,"We experienced a Japanese boy with idiopathic copper toxicosis (BIT), diagnosed by special features of liver histology. Case: A seven-year-old boy was referred to our hospital because of deep jaundice. He had been suffering from itching and growth retardation since he was 3 years old. Physical examination findings were jaundice, angioma spider on the cheeks, hepatospolenomegaly (liver right rib 6 cm, spleen left rib 5 cm palpable), and bleeding scratches on the skin. Laboratory findings WBC 6,420/micro L, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, platelet 174,000/micro L, total bilirubin 13.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 10.6 mg/dL, AST 1.477 U/L, ALT 457 U/ L was LDH 393. U/L, GGT 162 U/L, Alb 2.9 g/dL, UA 2.4 mg/dL, PT 37.7%, APTT 49.4 sec, and haptoglobin 9mg/dL. Copper-related profiles were serum Cu 215 microg/dL, ceruloplasmin 48.6 mg/dL, and 24-hour urine Cu 472.8 microg/d. Clinical Course: The patient with no abnormality in the ATP7B gene and normal serum ceruloplasmin level was diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD). He was treated with trientine hydrochloride in addition to zinc acetate for 30 days. While his condition deteriorated, the 24-hour urinary Cu level increased to >2500 microg/day. The new Wilson Index has reached 17. He was transferred to the Organ Transplantation Center and a cadaver liver transplant was performed. Histology of the explanted liver: The liver surface and split face showed multiple nodular formations. Lobular architecture is disrupted by severe fibrosis. Inflammation was minimal. Mallory body-like materials were prominently found in hepatocytes. The copper content in the explanted liver was 1482.3 microg/g dry weight. Both Orcein and Rhodanine stainings were strongly stained in hepatocytes. Discussion and Conclusion: ICT is one of the less recognized copper metabolic disorders compared to Wilson's disease.

Objectives Misdiagnosis is not uncommon, as various manifestations of kidney failure occur at different stages of Wilson's disease (WD). We conducted this study to find the clinical features of renal failure in children with WD. b. Methods We included 102 children with WD who were treated in our department from January 1995 to December 2012. In kidney failure, one of the following is attached: abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria1/4 hematuria, glucosuria, hypercalcinuria, or increased urinary NAG; abnormal kidney function (BUN) >=7.14 mmol/L, Scr>=176.8 mol/L); Abnormal renal ultrasound or kidney biopsy, except for kidney involvement caused by other factors c. Results Demographic data: Among 102 WD patients, there were 58 patients with abnormal urine analysis. 34 patients, 14 of whom were treated with D-penicillamine only once and 10 of them: 14 boys and 20 girls. The course of the disease ranged from 3 days to 10 years. Clinical findings: hematuria in 14, proteinuria in 4 and 15 had both proteinuria and proteinuria. hematuria, nephrotic proteinuria in 2 cases, renal tubular acidosis in 1 case, urinary NAG increase in 12 cases, urinary erythrocyte phase morphology in 15 cases, glomerular hematuria in 3 cases and nonglomerular in 12 cases, and urinary calcium increase in 1 case decreased. Serum creatinine clearance rate decreased in 2 patients. Ultrasound revealed unsystematic kidney damage in 5 of 27 patients. Kidney biopsy 2 showed IgA deposition in the mesangial region. Initial renal failure: 9 symptoms of renal failure began, 4 with macroscopic hematuria, 1 with edema, hematuria and proteinuria, 1 with purpura, hematuria and proteinuria, 1 frequent and 2 with edema and severe proteinuria with urgent urination. Prognosis: Renal failure of all patients improved or disappeared after treatment. D. Conclusions Renal failure with WD, including injury, is not uncommon after D-penicillamine therapy.

After reducing the initial dose from 30 mg BID (60 mg total/day) to 30 mg QD and increasing the maximum daily dose to 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated without SAEs and few AEs. Hepatic status improved or remained stable. On average, high basal plasma NCC adjusted for molybdenum returned to normal within 3 months. UWDRS scores improved in all patients with neurological findings. Up to 3 months, the neurologic examination score (part III) was then reduced from approximately 30 to <10 with sustained improvement. Daily activity status (part II) showed similar improvement. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's Disease. With improvement in clinical (liver and neurological) and laboratory evaluations, including copper control, in these initial patients, further clinical evaluation is warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of WTX101.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Weiss, K.

1272,Iron deposition in a patient with Wilson's disease: A longitudinal 7T MRI and transcranial sonography study.,"Objective: To investigate the longitudinal changes in clinical symptoms, 7T MRI and transcranial sonography (TCS) during chelation therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: The pathophysiological causes and predictive biomarkers of clinical worsening in WD patients receiving anti-copper therapy are unknown. One possible contributing factor may be brain iron deposition. Our aim was to examine longitudinal changes in T2* relaxation time and echogenicity of deep gray matter structures as measures of iron content in a patient with WD. Methods: We studied a de-novo WD patient at baseline and followed him periodically for 30 months with anti-copper therapy. Clinical severity was assessed using the Unified Wilson's Disease rating scale (UWDRS). The 7T MRI imaging protocol included a 3D magnetization-prepared fast gradient echo (MPRAGE, TE=3 ms; TR=2300 ms) and 2D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE, 8 echo 4.1-25.5 ms; TR=1820 ms) for T2. * parametric mapping. R2* values were measured in the globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put), caudate nucleus (NC), and thalamus (Thal). TCS was performed and echogenicity indexes of the lentiform nucleus (NL) and NC were calculated using a software for TCS digital image analysis. Results: A 27-year-old male patient who developed ataxia and action tremor in his hands was diagnosed with WD (p.H1069Q homozygous mutation) three months later. There was significant NL hyperechogenicity bilaterally at baseline; The R2* value in GP (130) increased 1.3 times compared to four same age controls (mean 99.9+/-(SD)9.8). After initiation of penicillamine therapy (increased to 900 mg), ataxia and tremor progressed and vertical gaze palsy appeared with generalized dystonia. After switching to Trientine (upgraded to 900mg) and then Zinc(150mg)+trientine(600mg), her symptoms gradually improved and her UWDRS score dropped from 104 to 56. The R2* value increased steadily, especially in Put (red arrows) and Thal. (green arrows) suggest iron accumulation. This was associated with thalamic atrophy and cavitation on MP-RAGE MRI (green arrows). TCS did not show any changes in NL and NC echogenicity during treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that greater iron deposition may accompany degenerative changes during unsuccessful anticancer therapy and that increased brain iron concentration may be present in de-novo WD. NL hyperechogenicity does not reflect R2* changes and may serve as a trait marker.

1273,Copper chelation efficiency of alginate/chitosan-based D-penicillamine nanoparticles in a rat model of non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis.,"Purpose: To evaluate the copper (Cu) chelating efficiency of D-penicillamine-loaded nanoparticles orally administered for 90 days compared to conventional D-penicillamine treatment in a Wistar rat model for non-Wilson brain Cu toxicosis. Background: Oral D-penicillamine therapy fails to alleviate brain Cu overload and neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease patients. Methods: Atomic absorption spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and nanoparticle preparation/physico-chemical characterization were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 274.09 nm and a release of less than 29.32% D penicillamine under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed increased Dpenicillamine levels in the brain of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine delivery group compared to the conventional Dpenicillamine delivery group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine treatment resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory with simultaneous increase in urinary Cu levels in the Wistar rat copper toxicosis model. Conventional D-penicillamine treatment resulted in negative rhodanine staining in the brain and liver sections, supported by a 16.4% and 60.1% reduction in brain and liver Cu content, respectively, compared to the untreated Cu-intoxicated group. However, liver and brain sections of the nanoparticles-based D-penicillamine treatment group showed no grade 1 Cu and no Cu accumulation, as confirmed by 47.2% and 32.8% reductions in liver and brain Cu content, respectively, compared to the untreated Cu-poisoned group. Conclusions: Our data show the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine nanoparticles in chelating greater brain Cu and reducing neurological deficits, even at half the dose delivered in conventional D-penicillamine therapy.

1274,"Clinical profile of Wilson's disease in Yangon general hospital, Myanmar","Objective: To evaluate the clinical, biochemical and imaging profiles of patients with Wilson's Disease (WD). Background: There were no reported case series of WD in Myanmar. This study is a hospital-based study performed at the Neurology Department of Yangon General Hospital in Myanmar. Methods: During the 2010-2015 period, 17 patients were diagnosed with definitive WD using the Leipzig criteria, and one patient had a probability of WD. Results: Of the 18 patients, 8 were male and 10 were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 20. The main presentation features were: abnormal gait in 17 (94.4%) of 18 patients; Speech problems in 17 (94.4%), Parkinson's features in 9 (50%), tremor 8 (44.4%), cerebellar signs and symptoms in 4 (22.2%) patients. Psychiatric symptoms in 14 (66.6%) patients There were signs. Five patients (27.7%) had dysphagia, 2 (11.1%) had seizures, 1 (5.5%) had chorea. CF rings were positive in all patients. Serum ceruloplasmin level was low in 17 (94.4%) patients and was lower than normal in one patient. Only 3 patients (16.6%) had concomitant liver involvement. Renal and hematological involvement was observed in 2 patients (11.1%). Three (16.6%) patients had a positive family history, and one patient (5.5%) had consanguineous marriage between the parents. Only one of the siblings of affected patients was screened and found to have WD. CT (Brain) was performed in 8 (44.4%) of 18 patients, and all had bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity and one (5.5%) had subcortical involvement. MRI (Brain) was performed in 12 (61.1%) of 18 patients and showed hyperintense signals on T2, mainly in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain. All patients received penicillamine initially and zinc as maintenance therapy. One patient was 12 weeks pregnant at the time of diagnosis and penicillamine was given because trientine was not available. Her neurological symptoms improved markedly and she delivered prematurely at 34 weeks. The child had low birth weight and hypotonia and died at the age of one. Only 7 (38.8%) of 18 patients came to regular follow-up and clinical improvement was observed, but the outcome of 11 patients was unknown. Conclusions: Limited access to diagnostic facilities and availability of drugs are a major barrier to early diagnosis and adherence to long-term therapy, which led to devastating outcomes of the disease in the patients in this study.",,"Aye, S.

1275,Clinical and imaging deterioration in a mild case of Wilson's disease after chelation therapy,"Objective: To present a case of mild Wilson's disease with neuropsychiatric features and clinical and imaging deterioration five months after chelation therapy with trientine. Background: Wilson's Disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism. After our patient was diagnosed with Wilson's Disease, appropriate chelation was initiated from AL, and current drugs were selected, trientine. Trientine is a chelating agent indicated as an initial therapy with fewer side effects than penicillamine. Methods: Dosage was 300 mg daily for the first three months and 600 mg daily in two divided doses for the next two months. Neurological deterioration has been reported with increasing dose. In her neurological examination, dystonic spasms, mild sensory loss, and ataxic speech were mentioned, accompanied by postural and wing flapping tremor. Brain MRI worsened similar to that obtained before treatment. A characteristic facet of the giant panda sign has been described with lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain. Results: Treatment was discontinued but before urinary copper excretion could be evaluated. After two weeks without treatment, the patient's clinical condition improved and urinary copper excretion was reassessed and serum copper was both below normal levels. Conclusion: In conclusion, in this case, neurological and brain MRI deterioration was due to excessive copper removal. Therefore, conventional chelating agents may not be safe when used in mild types of Wilson's disease, and preventive treatments such as zinc may be more effective and preferable.",,"Kleoniki, C.;Spiridon, K.;Cristos, T.;Aristidis, K.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26688,0,0,
1276,A case of Wilson's disease presenting with depression as the first symptom,"Wilson's disease is a chronic disease caused by the abnormal accumulation of copper in various organs and often accompanied by copper metabolism disorders due to specific gene abnormalities. Many neurological symptoms such as delayed speech, dysarthria, dystonia, Parkinson's feature, chorea and ataxia are commonly known as the initial symptoms and syndromes of Wilson's disease. However, dementia or frontal lobe syndrome can also be seen in Wilson's disease. Here, we present a 17-year-old male patient presenting with executive dysfunction and apathy with depressed mood as the first symptom of Wilson's disease. A 17-year-old male patient was brought to our emergency department with apathy that developed about 3 days ago. Vital signs and laboratory findings were non-specific. Executive dysfunction was suspected in the initial neurological examination. During approximately 3 hours of observation in the hospital, he presented mild bilateral movement-postural tremor and noted suspicious speech impairment. Bilateral symmetrical high signal intensities in the putamen and caudate nuclei on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. In her diet history, she had overeat high copper-containing pork liver and shellfish for months. Urine copper concentration increased (2123.2 lg/24 hours) and serum ceruloplasmin level decreased (< 4 mg/dL). Upon the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, he received zinc and trientine treatment. Wilson's disease can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms such as subcortical dementia and frontal lobe syndrome. Usually hepatic dysfunction or motor symptoms are often present in the early stage of the disease. However, it should be considered that acute-onset cognitive disorders at a young age may be Wilson's disease and neurological symptoms should be followed closely.",,"Chang, H.;Park, H.;Cheong, J.",2016,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.13692,0,0,
1277,Wilson's disease associated with immobile cilia syndrome: a case report.,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are both rare autosomal recessive disorders with a frequency of <1:15,000. We present a unique case of WD associated with PCD. Methods: Case report Results: A 24-year-old female patient presented with a history of headache, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. Liver stiffness, hypotonia, hypo-excitable deep tendon reflexes, mild ataxia and Kayser-Fleischer rings were noted. Lab tests revealed increased liver function tests. In the patient's history, 5 hospital admissions due to bronchopneumonia before the age of 12 were emphasized. Each time, laboratory tests showed increased transaminasemia with normal ceruloplasminemia. Ultrasonography and liver biopsy documented moderate steatosis, which at the time was interpreted as PCD-induced cholestasis. Phase contrast and electron microscopy revealed ciliary immobility without dynein in the axonoma: she was diagnosed with PCD. At admission, Fibroscan showed hepatic fibrosis. Brain MRI was unremarkable. Normal ceruloplasminemia, increased copperuria (2260mg/24h, normal<70), high copper liver accumulation and fibrosis (349 mg/g; normal<9.9) were found. While DNAI1, DNAH5, DNAH11 genes were normal, compound heterozygosity was found for the 2304-2305insC and R1041W mutations in the ATP7B gene, confirming WD. The patient was started on penicillamine, with benefit: 8 years later, asymptomatic. Conclusion: The association of WD and PCD has never been reported. Loci adjacent to ATP7B may contain dyne-coding sequences affected by mutations of genes closer to them. Early detection can save lives. In this case, liver impairment was largely reversible with copper-removing agents. In addition, reduction of ceruloplasmin, an acute phase reactant, was inhibited by PCD-associated recurrent bronchopneumonia. Being dogmatic about ceruloplasmin levels may lead to deviation from correct diagnosis and treatment.",,"Romoli, M.;Tambasco, N.;Prontera, P.;Nardi, E.;Clerici, C.;Calabresi, P.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13094,0,0,
1278,First epidemiological study of Wilson's disease in France,"Background and objectives: The estimated prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) in the literature ranges from 1/30,000 to 1/100,000. In France, a population of 64 million, 640 to 2100 cases of WD can be expected. The aim of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of WD based on data from the French national health insurance information system (SNIIRAM) and analyze epidemiological data by age, gender, and treatments. Methods: This study concerned all beneficiaries of the universal health insurance scheme, representing 90% of the French population. WD patients were identified with long-term disease (affection longue duree (ALD)) eligible for 100% health reimbursement with code E83.0 (copper metabolism disorder) or at least one hospitalization between 2011 and 2013 with the same code. . Results: 906 WD patients were identified, ie the prevalence was 1.5/100,000. However, it is certainly underestimated because patients who have stabilized over many years are not registered as ALD. 43.2% were under the age of 40. Approximately 40% of the patients were treated with D-Penicillamine and 14.3% Zinc acetate, 5.6% received neuroleptics and 15% received antidepressants. 5.3% had undergone liver transplantation. Triethylenetetramine, given tenderly, does not appear in the base. Comparison of these data with 500 patients followed for WD in the national reference center will be presented. Conclusion: This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population, an important step towards understanding the public health impact of WD and further examining the quality of care.",,"Poujois, A.;Tuppin, P.;Samson, S.;Chaine, P.;Girardot-Tinant, N.;Woimant, F.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13093,0,1,
1279,Frequency of overtreatment-induced copper deficiency in Wilson's patients,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disease involving excess copper. Lifelong copper removal therapy is necessary, but copper deficiency can and does manifest as myelopathy and hematological abnormalities. The aim of the study is to determine the frequency of copper deficiency as a treatment complication in the WD patient group. Methods: We studied consecutive patients with routine follow-up between April 2012 and April 2014. Free serum copper concentration, complete blood count, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were determined to assess dorsal colon dysfunction. Careful neurological examination was performed for the presence of myelopathy or clinical signs of neuropathy. Overt copper deficiency was defined as the coexistence of low unbound ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) copper concentration (<5 cups/dl), blood count abnormalities, and/or myelopathy detected on SEPs and/or spinal MRI. Results: 64 patients with WD were enrolled (39% hepatic, 51% neurological and 10% presymptomatic features). The calculated NCC was <5mug/dl (normal range, 10 - 15mug/dl) in 14 (21%) patients. SEP conduction times were normal in 80% of these patients. Three cases treated with zinc sulfate were diagnosed with copper deficiency (two advanced myelopathy with haematological manifestations, one leukopenia). Only one had clinical signs of myelopathy. Conclusion: Overt copper deficiency is a rare (4.6%) side effect of long-term WD treatment. Neurological manifestations of copper deficiency are even rarer. However, a low NCC without other clinical manifestations is common (17%). Regular monitoring of copper metabolism parameters is essential to avoid treatment complications.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Sobanska, A.;Litwin, T.;Rakowicz, M.;Czlonkowska, A.",2016,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.13092,0,0,

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in WD patients. Methods: Patients who were untreated or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <=28 days were started on 30 or 60 mg of WTX101 daily. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks according to laboratory and clinical criteria. Evaluations included safety, liver status, copper parameters, and neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first 6 patients in the study were followed for 8 to 36 weeks. His baseline Modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5 and he had neurological findings of 5/6. Reversible elevated liver function tests were observed after per-protocol dose increases in the first 2 patents. After reducing the initial dose from 60 mg to 30 mg per day and increasing the maximum daily dose to 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated without SAEs and few AEs. Hepatic status improved or remained stable. On average, elevated baseline free copper returned to normal within 3 months. UWDRS scores and daily activity improved in all neurological patients.

1281,Altered zinc ion levels and transporter expression indicate that elevated liver copper impairs zinc metabolism in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of Wilson's disease.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. This mutation affects the regulation of copper metabolism primarily in the liver, but also in the kidneys and brain. The impaired function of the transporter eventually causes excessive copper accumulation in these organs and subsequent toxicity. Although Wilson's disease has traditionally been viewed as a copper-related disorder, significantly elevated hepatic zinc levels (p <0.01) were observed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model used for the study. Wilson's disease. To identify the mechanisms of this observed hepatic hypercinemia, the relative transcription levels of hepatic-specific zinc transporters belonging to the ZIP and ZnT families were observed using RT-qPCR. The results obtained showed differences in the mRNA levels of the zinc transporters in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Specifically, there was an increase in the relative amount of mRNA for the ZIP9 and ZnT10 carriers in 6 week old animals. Also, differences in relative mRNA abundance were observed between 6 week old and 20 week old animals, including decreased expression of ZIP7, ZIP9, ZnT4, ZnT6 and ZnT10 in animals older than 20 weeks. This suggests that there is indeed a link between the transcriptional regulation of hepatic zinc transporters and abnormal zinc concentrations as a result of high hepatic copper levels.",,"Meacham, K.;Burkhead, J.",2016,,,0,0,
1282,Developing a copper sensitive MRI Contrast Agent,"Copper is the third most abundant trace metal in the body.

1283,"If Wilson's disease is treated early, subclinical neurologic involvement does not develop.","Aim and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism in which metal deposits cause dysfunctions in various organs, especially liver and brain. Left untreated, WD is fatal, although early treatment results in a good prognosis, although the long-term neurological outcome is not yet clear. To address this issue, we evaluated the neurological status of early-treated WD patients without significant nervous system disorders using neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging procedures at least 10 years after initiation of therapy. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with WD (18 women and 20 men, age 24.47 +/- 7.50 years) diagnosed early in the presymptomatic or mild or moderate stages of liver disease without neurological involvement and prompt treatment were clinically evaluated with Global. Rating Scale. While the presentation was hepatic in 36 patients (95%), it was diagnosed in the presymptomatic stage in 2 patients (5%). A neurophysiological study was performed to investigate the central motor conduction time and motor cortex excitability of the upper and lower limbs using single pulse and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neuroimages were obtained with brain magnetic resonance scans. Cognitive abilities, psychiatric and behavioral disorders were evaluated with neuropsychological tests. TMS studies were also performed in a separate cohort of 15 WD patients (8 men and seven women; mean age 28.2 +/- 12.1 years, mean duration of treatment 15.8 +/-9.14 years) with neurological signs. Fifteen age, education, and gender-matched healthy subjects (10 females and five males; mean age 26.7 +/- 9.1 years; duration of education 13.2 +/- 2 years) unaffected by any neurological, psychiatric or other relevant clinical conditions 4) served as the control group for clinical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric evaluation. Results: Patients were treated with penicillamine (7 patients) or zinc salts (31 patients) with good compliance. They did not show any neurological signs on clinical assessment or a particular impairment scale, with a mean Global Rating Scale score of 0.3+/-0.7.

1284,Autoimmune hepatitis or Wilson's disease or both? Analysis of challenging cases,"Objectives and study: Comorbidity of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and Wilson's disease (WD) may be considered, but has never been proven based on therapeutic response. There is a risk of misdiagnosis with the standard diagnostic approach. In the primary diagnostic approach, we define difficult patients for whom a definitive diagnosis cannot be made and question the association of AIH and WD. Methods: We identified 4 cases among 165 WD (Ferenci score - diagnosis according to FS) and 321 AIH patients whose primary diagnosis was changed or questioned. Results: Three patients were diagnosed due to elevated serum transaminase (TA) activity and one patient was diagnosed with acute liver failure. Case 1: Liver histology (steatohepatitis and fibrosis), ANA 1:640, IgG: 2824.5mg/dl, AIH was diagnosed without WD tests. Prednisone and azathioprine (AZT) were ineffective and a diagnosis of WD was made 1 year later based on ceruloplasmin, urinary copper excretion, liver copper and molecular test results. Penicillamine was given, steroids and AZT were withdrawn, resulting in normal liver tests. Case 2: primarily did not meet the criteria for WD: ceruloplasmin 16 mg/dl, normal urinary copper excretion. Liver histology (severe inflammation and fibrosis) prednisolone was initiated according to ANA 1:640 and ASMA 1:160. After 1 year, the child developed psychiatric and neurological symptoms, abnormalities were revealed in the brain MRI. Based on ceruloplasmin concentration, neurological symptoms and molecular test (1 mutation), a diagnosis of WD was made and zinc therapy was started. Meanwhile, the patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The patient was treated with zinc, AZT and 5-ASA with good clinical and laboratory response. Case 3: had normal serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion. Prednisolone was initiated based on histology (periportal inflammation), positive ANA 1:320, and ASMA 1:80. TA was still high 1 year later. In the second diagnostic approach, WD was diagnosed with ceruloplasmin 14mg/dl and molecular test (FS: 7 points). Penicillamine was started and steroids were discontinued and liver function tests returned to normal. Case 4: ceruloplasmin 16mg/dl, urinary copper excretion 4901ug/24h, CF ring present, and a diagnosis of WD was made on the basis of molecular testing (2 mutations) (FS: 9 points). Penicillamine was started, but ANA positivity (1:40) and ASMA (1:40) steroids were added 1 month later due to hypertransaminasemia. Trientine was started 4 weeks later and penicillamine was discontinued due to neutropenia. Reducing steroids resulted in TA elevation, so steroids were continued. Liver biopsy after normalization of coagulation showed steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Conclusion: WD can usually be distinguished from AIH, but differential diagnosis is difficult in selected cases. WD should be retested in patients who respond poorly to steroids. In a large cohort of WH and AIH patients, only one appears to have comorbidity, but even in this case AIH is not fully confirmed.",,"Naorniakowska, M.;Wozniak, M.;Pronicki, M.;Kaminska, D.;Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,0,
1285,Predictors of fatty liver and fibrosis as measured by Fibroscan in children with Wilson's disease.,"Objectives and study: Wilson's disease in childhood may present with mild or significant liver damage as demonstrated by liver biopsy and liver function tests. Although zinc or D-penicillamine (D-pen) seems to stop the progression of liver damage, the effectiveness of zinc is often questioned. Because liver biopsy is not usually repeated over the course of the disease, only surrogate markers can be used for the assessment of liver disease. Recently, non-invasive temporary elastography - Fibroscan (Echosens, France) has been applied in many chronic liver diseases for the evaluation of fibrosis and steatosis. We aimed to evaluate the progression of liver disease and response to treatment as assessed by Fibroscan in relation to the extent and type of pre-treatment liver injury as assessed by liver histology and liver function tests. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed liver histology, liver copper content and biochemical markers at diagnosis in 34 children aged 12.8+/-4.1 years with Wilson's disease and compared them with liver stiffness (LSM) and steatosis (CAP) after averaging using Fibroscan. 9.7 years of treatment with zinc (n=21) or D-pen (n=13). In addition, LSM and CAP results of patients with Wilson's disease were compared with a control group consisting of 20 healthy controls aged 11.8+/-5.3 years. Liver histology was described semi-quantitatively, including micro- and macrovesicular steatosis (NAFLD scoring system modified by Kleiner et al.), portal and lobular inflammation, and cholestasis. Relationships were tested with the Spearman R test, and differences between groups were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Selected patient cohort with Wilson's disease, variable fibrosis (grade 3-4 in 13 patients), lobular inflammation (grade 2-3 in 2 patients), portal inflammation (grade 2-3 in 3 patients), microvesicular (grade 2-3 in 3 patients) ) and macrovesicular steatosis (12 points grade 2-3) and no cholestasis. There was no difference in pretreatment parameters between children treated with Zn and D-pen. Liver fibrosis (LSM) assessed by Fibroscan was slightly but significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease than healthy controls [5 (4.1-6.1) and 4.2 (3.8-4.5) kPa], and steatosis expressed by CAP was also increased [252 (218). -292 vs. 182 (119-194) dB/m], p<0.05. We found a significant association between steatosis as assessed by fibroscan (CAP) and macrovesicular steatosis in liver biopsy (r=0.68), while LSM was associated with liver fibrosis. LSM was significantly associated with baseline total bilirubin levels (r=0.4) but not other liver function tests, ceruloplasmin or liver copper content.With D-pen or zinc [LSM 5.4 (4.3-6.1) We found no difference in Fibroscan results between groups treated with 4.5 (4.1-5.8) kPa); CAP 251 (208-266) - 256 (235-307) dB/m]. Conclusion: In children with Wilson's disease, hepatic steatosis does not seem to respond to treatment, and the prevalence of steatosis in the course of the disease is closely related to pre-treatment values. Fibrosis at the start of treatment is affected by treatment and can change significantly over time. D-pen and Zn therapy appear to be equally effective when tested with Fibroscan in children with mild liver injury.",,"Janczyk, W.;Pronicki, M.;Grajkowska, W.;Kaminska, D.;Kmiotek, J.;Naorniakowska, M.;Podlaska, M.;Socha, P.",2016,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000484500.48517.e7,0,1,
1286,"Serum Zinc levels distinguish ""uncertain"" acute liver failure from ""Wilson's disease"" acute liver failure","Objective and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Combined clinical and laboratory findings are needed for early diagnosis. There is a proposed hypothesis that low serum Zinc (Zn) is associated with the phenotypic severity of WD. Indeed, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a Zn-containing metallo-enzyme, reflecting true Zn deficiency, is relatively low in WD patients, which may support this assumption. However, few studies underscore the role of these biomarkers in the pathogenesis and severity of WD. Our study aimed to observe the values of serum Zn and other key biomarkers in acute liver failure (ALF) and WD. Methods: Retrospective data from children with WH (n=30) and indeterminate ALF (n=9) at King's college hospital between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. WD patients were diagnosed with King's protocol and 23 patients were confirmed by genetic analysis. WD is classified as WD-ALF and WD non-ALF. Serum Zn, copper, ceruloplasmin (CP) and liver function tests values were taken. Conclusions: Our study shows a significantly lower serum Zn and corrected Zn level in WD-ALF compared with WD without ALF and ALF of unknown cause. Conclusion: This study showed that the dramatic abnormality of serum Zn in WD-ALF can distinguish WD-ALF from indeterminate ALF.

1287,Brain MRI and spectroscopy in the diagnosis of early neurological involvement in Wilson's disease in children,"Objective and study: Wilson's disease is an inherited copper metabolism disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys and other tissues, resulting in hepatic and neuropsychiatric features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps diagnose neurological Wilson's disease. The literature on MR spectroscopy (MRS) in Wilson's disease is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of brain MRI and spectroscopy in the early detection of central nervous system abnormalities in children with Wilson's disease. Methods: A case-control study was conducted between March 2011 and March 2014 after IRB approval in the 'Pediatrics department and Radiology department' of the Gastroenterology unit at Zagazig University Hospitals, Zagazig, Egypt. 26 patients with Wilson's disease and 26 healthy volunteers were included. Detailed history taking; A complete physical examination was performed, including regional examination of anthropometry, complete abdominal examination, and neurologic evaluation. Routine laboratory investigations included CBC' CRP' ESR, reticulocyte count, complete liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, Immunoglobulin electrophoresis, and kidney function tests. Specific investigations include serum ceruloplasmin level, copper concentration in 24-hour urine collection, copper concentration in 24-hour urine collection with D-penicillamine challenge test, autoantibodies panel (ANA, ASMA, and ALKMA). Slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring and percutaneous liver biopsy looking for consistent liver histology (fatty changes or nuclei with glycogen). All patients underwent MRI and MRS. Results: Eight patients showed abnormal magnetic resonance imaging in the form of bilaterally increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia on T1-weighted axial MR images. Compared with control subjects, patients with WD had a highly significant decrease in N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine values (p<0.001), and a significant decrease in N-acetyl aspartate/choline, N-acetyl aspartate/creatine, and choline/creatine ratios ( p <0.05) right basal ganglia. There was a significant decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (p<0.001) and choline, creatine values, N-acetyl aspartate/choline, N-acetyl aspartate/creatine and choline/creatine ratios (p<0.001) in patients complicated with hepatic cell failure. <0.05) result: MRI abnormalities were detected in 8 (30.7%) of 26 patients, while MRS showed decreases in N-acetyl aspartate, Choline, Creatinine, N-acetyl aspartate/choline, N-acetyl aspartate/creatine. and choline/creatine in all patients.

1288,Evaluation of exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper in ATP7b-/- mice,"Objective and study: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for toxic copper accumulation in the liver and central nervous system. The diagnosis of WD is based on a combination of clinical and biological findings. Phenotypic heterogeneity may challenge diagnostic confirmation. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) and its derivative Relative Exchangeable Copper (REC, CuEXC/total serum copper ratio, %) have recently been proposed as reliable diagnostic markers in WD. The aim of our study was to validate these new markers in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice, an animal model of WD. Methods: ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> (group a) and wild-type mice (WT, group b) were bred and studied under the same conditions. Animals were classified into subgroups according to age at sacrifice (groups1a and 1b = 6 weeks, 2a and 2b = 20 weeks, 3a and 3b = 40 weeks, 4a and 4b = 50 weeks). The following plasma data were compared between groups: liver function tests, serum copper (Cu), CuEXC and REC. Histological analysis of the liver and determination of intrahepatic copper (CuIH) were also performed. One group of ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice received a treatment with D-penicillamine from week 40 to week 50 sacrifice (Group 5). Results: The study included 141 ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice and 117 WT mice. No mice died before the planned sacrifice. Histological analysis was consistently normal in the WT groups, and Cu, CuIH, and CuEXC values remained constant over time. Histological analysis of ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a progressive development of chronic liver injury (group 1a: isolated moderate inflammation (48%), group 4a: inflammatory fibrosis with cirrhosis (100%) (65%)) . ). Cu, CuIH, and CuEXC changed over time with maximum values at week 20 for CuIH and week 40 for CuEXC and Cu. In each subgroup, CuIH and CuEXC were significantly higher in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to WT mice (p <0.005). REC was also significantly higher in ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mice (mean, 37.9 vs 11.2%, p <0.001). A cutoff of 20% for REC provided 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity regardless of age, gender, or use of a treatment (group 4a: 34.9% and group 5: 33%). Copper chelator significantly reduced liver fibrosis (p=0.03) and Cu (p=0.028) and reduced CuIH (p=0.29) and CuEXC (p=0.175). Conclusion: This study confirms that the ATP7B<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model is a reliable animal model of chronic liver disease due to copper overload. Relative exchangeable copper is a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker in this model. Further studies are needed to confirm that CuEXC is a good biomarker for monitoring the development of mouse WD, especially when copper chelators are used.",,"Heissat, S.;Bost, M.;Hervieu, V.;Brunet, A.

1289,Analysis of Wilson's disease treatments using urine-derived patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells,"Introduction and Aims: Wilson's disease is a monogenetic disorder of copper (Cu) metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. This causes a functional impairment of Cu excretion by the liver, followed by excessive accumulation of Cu in organs, mostly in the liver and brain. Patients exhibit clinical heterogeneity ranging from acute or chronic liver failure and/or neurological symptoms. Progression of WD can be partially improved with zinc or chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine. Although these treatments are generally effective, serious side effects have been reported in a significant proportion of WD patients. The molecular mechanisms of WD and response to various treatments have not been fully characterized as samples of WD patients are rare for analysis. In conclusion, samples of WD patients are indispensable for examining the impact of ATP7B mutations on disease pathogenesis. The aim of the study is to establish a new in vitro methodology for generating WD patient-specific cells that may help to not only understand the pathogenesis but also drug efficacy. This approach can be used as a tool to search for new compounds as well as new gene editing methods. Methods: Urine from WD patients was processed for isolation of renal epithelial cells, then reprogrammed into WD-iPS cells using non-integrated episomal vectors. After characterization, WD-iPSCs were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells using key growth factors for 14 days. iPSC-Heps was characterized by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry before being treated with novel chelating agents under various Cu conditions. Results: Upon cultivation of urine-derived cells, stable cell colonies appeared and nucleofection forming iPSCs with pluripotent character. iPSC-Heps was identified by similar morphology and gene expression (eg, ATP7B) compared to primary human hepatocytes. The results revealed a significant reduction in Cu content in WD iPSC-Heps after treatment with the new chelator compared to untreated WD iPSC-Heps. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that iPSCs derived from urinary cells of WD patients can be reprogrammed and differentiated into iPSC-Heps. WD iPSC-Heps will allow the establishment of a patient-specific in vitro platform for evaluating drug efficacy. Therefore, this technology appears to be perfectly suitable for disease modeling and will allow the evaluation of new drugs for advanced treatment of WD.",,"Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Guttmann, S.;Stella, J.;Chandhok, G.;Zischka, H.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1290,Retrospective study to evaluate the long-term outcomes of chelator-based therapy with trientine in patients with Wilson's disease withdrawing from treatment with D-penicillamine.,"Introduction and Aims: Wilson's Disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which causes copper accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain, and impaired hepatic copper excretion. If left untreated, it can be fatal in patients who die from liver failure or complications of progressive neurological disease. The chelating agent Trientine has proven to be an effective second-line therapy for patients with hepatic Wilson's Disease. This study aims to determine the long-term efficacy of the use of trientine chelator-based therapies after discontinuation of D-penicillamine therapy, namely the clinical course of neurological disease and liver disease, their effects on copper metabolism, and safety and tolerability. Methods: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, retrospective study involving approximately 90 Wilson's Disease patients in Europe. Inclusion criteria included physician-diagnosed WD patients aged 6 to 90 years who had previously discontinued D-penicillamine therapy and were subsequently treated with Trientine for at least 6 months and had a Leipzig score >=3. D-penicillamine withdrawal may be due to lack of efficacy, safety, tolerability, or other reasons. Results: Information will be collected for three endpoints. The efficacy endpoint will include assessment of the clinical course of neurological disease and liver disease and effects on copper metabolism, based on an Investigator's score and baseline, and will be performed at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. time points. Collection of treatment-emergent serious adverse event data at the same study time points will provide evidence for a safety endpoint. A time up to the discontinuation endpoint will also be evaluated to assess overall adherence to Trientine therapy due to discontinuation due to adverse events and/or inadequate response. Conclusions: The results of this retrospective study may provide information on the efficacy and safety of Trientine use in Wilson's Disease patients in a real-world setting.",,"Weiss, K.

1291,Prospective study to evaluate long-term outcomes of treatment with trientine in patients with Wilson's disease withdrawing from treatment with D-penicillamine.,"Background and Objectives: Wilson's Disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a membrane-bound enzyme responsible for copper transport in the liver. Wilson's Disease patients suffer from impaired copper metabolism, which leads to copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and brain. Trientine, a chelating compound, is recommended as a second-line therapy for patients with liver Wilson's Disease, as it removes excess copper from the body and consequently prevents further copper accumulation. This study aims to determine the clinical course and quality of life of copper stores, neurological and liver diseases, after initiation of trientine therapy and discontinuation of d-penicillamine therapy in Wilson's Disease patients. Methods: This is a prospective part of a nonrandomized, multicenter study involving approximately 55 Wilson's Disease patients. Only patients enrolled in the retrospective part of the study and continuing standard care therapy with trientine were selected for this part of the study. The length of the prospective trial is 12 months, with assessments done at baseline (at enrollment) and at 6 and 12 months following the baseline visit. Physical examination, blood and urine sampling, completion of a quality of life questionnaire, completion of the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), liver assessments (including non-invasive fibroscan), neurological status, side effects, and concomitant medication assessments will be performed during three sessions. study visits. Results: The primary endpoint to be evaluated would be the percentage of patients with stable disease after 12 months of treatment with trientine based on investigators' score. The Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) will be measured at 6 and 12 months and compared with baseline data. In addition, evaluation of serum and urinary parameters of copper metabolism will be performed at these time points. Quality of life will also be measured. The time to discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events and/or inadequate response will also be considered. Conclusions: Complementing the retrospective study, the results of this prospective study will provide information on the efficacy and safety of trientine in Wilson's Disease patients treated with trientine following discontinuation of d-penicillamine, as well as provide valuable quality of life data.",,"Weiss, K.

1292,Liver transplantation in severe neurological forms of Wilson's disease; french experience,"Background and Objectives: The standard treatment for Wilson's disease (WD) is a chelating agent of copper or zinc salts. Liver transplantation (LT) is indicated in cases of acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. The indication for LT in neurological forms without liver decompensation is controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effect of LT in WD with severe neurological symptoms without decompensated liver function. Methods: From 2002 to 2015, fifteen patients (mean age 20.4 [12-41] years) in France underwent LT without acute liver failure due to serious neurological complications without neurological improvement despite medical therapy. Chelating copper was given to all patients and chelating copper was given to 3 patients with zinc salts. Three patients worsened after temporary discontinuation of therapy without improvement after well-conducted therapy. Results: Neurological symptoms were heterogeneous, combining dystonic postures, tremor, chorea, and akineto-hypertonic syndrome. The mean age at diagnosis of WD was 17.7 [6-39] years, and the time between worsening and LT was 13 [4-24] months. The mean age in LT was 20.4 [12–41] years. All patients had a Child score of A in LT and native liver analysis confirmed cirrhosis. The mean follow-up time after LT was 52.5 [2–156] months. Eleven patients (73%, mean age 19 [12-30] years) with a mean follow-up of 56 [2–156] months had a neurological improvement and a significant improvement in quality of life after LT. This improvement continues in 4 (27%) patients. The remaining four patients (27%, mean age 24 [15-42] years) did not show significant improvement in neurological symptoms and died of infectious complications after a mean interval of 13 [2-36] months. Of the four patients who died, three had severe akineto-hypertonic syndrome and one had severe dystonia that limited movement and swallowing. There was no difference in the waiting time (12.5 [3-31] months and 13.7 [7-24] months, respectively) between the living patient group and the deceased patient group. Conclusion: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment option in patients with Wilson's disease whose neurological symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, even if there is no liver failure. Patients with adverse evolution died of severe sepsis. A long history of fixed neurological symptoms can be a humiliating factor.",,"Sobesky, R.;Poujois, A.;Brunet, A.

1293,"An ongoing phase 2, multicenter, open-label, WTX101 study in newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients - early observations","Background and Objectives: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigated copper removal agent under development for the treatment of Wilson's Disease. The aim of this ongoing study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 in newly diagnosed Wilson's Disease patients aged 18 years or older. Methods: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's Disease who were untreated or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <=28 days received 30 or 60 mg of WTX101 QD at baseline. Dosing was individualized after 6 weeks according to laboratory and clinical criteria. Regular assessments include safety, synthetic function, and liver disease status including modified Nazer score, change from baseline in free copper (assessed as ceruloplasmin unbound copper (NCC) adjusted for molybdenum plasma concentration), additional copper endpoints, and neurological status using Unified. Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: The first six patients (age 18-53; 2 men) were followed for 8-36 weeks in the study. The modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5, and 5/6 had neurological signs at baseline. Reversible elevated liver function tests associated with dose increases per protocol were observed in the first 2 patents. After reducing the initial dose from 30 mg BID (60 mg total/day) to 30 mg QD and increasing the maximum daily dose to 60 mg, WTX101 was well tolerated without SAEs and few AEs. Liver status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable. High baseline plasma NCC, adjusted for molybdenum on average, returned to normal within 3 months, and several patients treated longer had further reductions in NCC. Other copper measurements (exchangeable copper, total serum copper, 24-hour urinary copper excretion) show a similar copper removal pattern. UWDRS scores improved in all patients with neurological findings. Up to 3 months, the neurologic examination score (part III) was then reduced from approximately 30 to <10 with sustained improvement. Daily activity status (part II) showed similar improvement. Conclusions: WTX101 appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's Disease. With the improvement in clinical (liver and neurological) and laboratory evaluations, including copper control, in these initial patients, further clinical evaluation is warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of WTX101 for the treatment of Wilson's Disease.",,"Weiss, K.

1294,Late-onset Wilson's disease: A reported diagnostic dilemma,"purposes. This summary presents a case of late-onset Wilson's disease in a patient who demonstrated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on biopsy. Methods This case report is based on a retrospective chart review. Results. This report presents the case of a 53-year-old obese Chinese woman with a history of ulcerative colitis who was diagnosed with transaminitis during routine blood work. Study for abnormal liver enzymes revealed negative hepatitis B antigen, undetectable HBV DNA, negative immune markers but low serum ceruloplasm (<0.08 g/L). It was also found to have high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Abdominal ultrasound revealed moderate fatty infiltration in the liver. 24-hour urinary copper excretion was found to be high (1.69 mumol/day). Given the high urinary copper excretion, it worked harder for Wilson's disease. Slit lamp examination showed no evidence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. A liver biopsy was then performed with features consistent with moderate steatohepatitis with suspected Wilson's disease but not diagnostic. Hepatic parenchymal copper quantification showed a tissue copper dry weight of 4.42 mumol/g, consistent with the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's Disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Subsequent MRI did not show central nervous system involvement of Wilson's disease. The patient was started on penicillamine at 750 mg and was also counseled on weight loss strategies. Results. Wilson's disease is classically described as a disease of children and young adults. However, there are few case reports describing the disease in older adults. Diagnostic features and genetic background of patients with late-onset Wilson's disease are not different from early-onset patients. This case presents a diagnostic dilemma and approach to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in an elderly patient with a history, physical examination, and other findings consistent with NAFLD. The most common histological abnormality observed in patients with Wilson's disease is steatohepatitis, which is also seen in NAFLD. As NAFLD prevalence and detection increase, clinical suspicion also increases. This case highlights the importance of considering the diagnosis of late-onset Wilson's disease in this population and presents an approach to diagnosis and treatment in such a patient.",,"Mitchell, R.;Ko, H.",2016,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4792898,0,0,
1295,Wilson's disease: acute dystonia during treatment with SSRI or SNRI,"Objective: We present a patient with Wilson's disease who developed partially reversible dystonia during venlafaxine or sertraline therapy. Methods: A patient with genetically confirmed Wilson's disease (ATP7B p.Met769fs; p.His1069Gln comp. het.) was followed clinically, examined with serial MRI, 18F-FDG-PET, and 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT. Relevant literature was searched. Results: Anxiety and depression developed in a 31-year-old man. Treatment with 75 mg/day venlafaxine improved psychiatric symptoms, but perioral dystonia occurred within 2 days. Diplopia, action tremor and weakness were noted during 150mg/day venlafaxine treatment. Later, Wilson's disease was diagnosed and copper chelation therapy with trientine-dihydrochloride was started. Discontinuation of venlafaxine improved motor symptoms, but they returned after reinstatement during trientine therapy. There were also perioral and tongue dystonia, dysarthria, blepharospasm, and gait disturbance, which were partially reversible when sertraline was discontinued, under sertraline 50mg/day treatment. The patient's anxiety was symptomatically controlled with oxazepam without worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms. MRI showed hyperintensities in the pons, mesencephalon, claustrum and pyramidal tracts. Glucose metabolism and dopamine reuptake capacity are decreased bilaterally in the basal ganglia. Conclusions: Wilson's disease increases susceptibility to the side effects of SSRIs and SNRIs. Acute dystonia was previously described in a WD patient taking clomipramine [1]. Both the WD[2]-specific imbalance of copper metabolism and treatment with SSRIs [3,4] or SNRIs [5] are known causes of dystonia, and we suggest an additive effect when both factors are present simultaneously. The described patient showed imaging abnormalities suggestive of involvement of monoaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon and upper brain stem.",,"Wictor, L.;Wictorin, K.;Widner, H.;Puschmann, A.",2016,January,,0,0,
1296,Late-onset Wilson's disease with central pontine and extrapontine MRI changes,"Objective: The classic radiological presentation of Wilson's disease (WD) with the ""giant panda"" face is typically used to differentiate WD from other extrapyramidal disorders. Central pontine myelinosis-like (CPM-like) changes in WD are rarely reported and differ from the commonly known classical osmotic demyelination. Although CPM-like changes on MRI are common in young WD patients, there are no published reports of such a radiological picture in exceptional cases of late-onset WD. We report a late-onset WD with sequential MRI changes responsive to copper removal therapy. Methods: A 64-year-old male patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with a two-year history of worsening axial ataxia, postural, kinetic and resting tremors, and cognitive decline. Examination also showed diffuse hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed by the presence of low ceruloplasmin and homozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene. Results: MRI at symptom onset showed diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the pons adjacent to the midbrain hyperintensity, as well as focal hyperintensity and generalized cortical atrophy in the left thalamus. After nine months of chelation with trientine, partial resolution of T2 hyperintensity in the pons was observed, while thalamus hyperintensity became less pronounced. Conclusion: Regardless of age, WD should be considered in all patients presenting with hepatic or neurological symptoms without a definitive diagnosis. WD and CPM-like radiological changes may be under-recognized in older adult WD patients, but genetic confirmation and clinical examination findings should guide treatment.",,"Biller, T.;Fatterpekar, G.;Nirenberg, M.;Brys, M.",2016,January,,0,0,
1297,Zinc and copper in Alzheimer's disease,"In a recent meta-analysis by Ventriglia et al examining the association of zinc levels with Alzheimer's disease (AD), serum zinc was found to be significantly reduced in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy controls. However, such a finding does not suggest a causal role of low zinc in the pathophysiology of this neurodegenerative disease. Based on the available evidence, free copper toxicosis may play a causal role in age-related AD, and zinc therapy may be a rational causal treatment. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial testing a definitive hypothesis is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the value of zinc supplements in the treatment of AD.

1300,The protection provided by chelation therapy in diabetics after MI can be replicated with high-dose zinc supplementation.,"The recent Chelation Therapy Evaluation Trial (TACT) study enrolling subjects with prior myocardial infarction provides strong evidence that intravenous chelation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of mortality and vascular events in patients with diabetes, whereas no discernible benefit was observed in non-infarcts. - diabetics. It has been plausibly suggested that this reflects the role of transition metal ions - iron or copper - in the formation of advanced glycation end products, which are major mediators of diabetic complications that can destabilize plaque. As phlebotomy therapy fails to prevent vascular events in diabetics, we hypothesize that chelation removal of labile copper may be the chief culprit mediating the observed benefit in TACT. If so, less time- and labor-intensive strategies than chelation therapy may provide comparable benefit. A number of recent studies report that the copper-specific orally active chelator trientine can reduce the risk of various diabetic complications in rodents; A clinical trial with this agent demonstrated some reduction in left ventricular mass in diabetics with ventricular hypertrophy. However, until this agent becomes cheaper, high-dose zinc supplementation may be a more viable alternative. Zinc opposes the absorption and redox activity of copper through the induction of the antioxidant protein metallothionein, which tightly binds copper. Many studies show that increased metallothionein expression reduces the risk of tissue damage in diabetic rodents, and in some of these studies metallothionein expression is increased with supplemental zinc. Zinc supplementation also moderately improves glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes and may reduce the risk of diabetes by protecting pancreatic beta cells from oxidative stress. A long-term study evaluating the effect of supplementing diabetic patients with high-dose zinc, assessing risk of death, vascular events, and diabetic complications may be warranted. Histidine, which readily forms complexes with copper with superoxide dismutase activity, also has the potential to moderate the contribution of loosely bound copper to AGE formation; Moreover, in a recent clinical study, supplemental histidine improved insulin sensitivity and showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in women with metabolic syndrome. Since ascorbate can reduce unstable copper and thus increase its pathogenicity, the effect of high-dose ascorbate supplementation on cardiovascular risk in diabetics should be further studied.

1301,"Chelation therapy in mercury, lead and copper poisoning","In this review, we provide an update on the appropriate use of chelating agents in the treatment of poisonings with mercury, lead, and copper compounds. The relatively new chelators meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercapto-propanesulfonate (DMPS) can effectively mobilize mercury as well as lead residues in the urine. These drugs can be administered orally and have relatively low toxicity compared to the classical antidote dimercaptopropanol (BAL). Although 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid or tetrathiomolybdate are more suitable alternatives today, d-penicillamine is widely used for copper overload. In copper toxicity, a free radical scavenger may be recommended as an adjuvant to chelator therapy. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",,"Cao, Y.;Skaug, M.

The clinical features associated with WD are highly variable. However, subtypes usually reflect neurological, hepatic and psychiatric symptoms. The current case study reports two brothers who had recently been diagnosed with WD. One brother (BL) exhibited neurological symptoms and cognitive deficits in the form of extrapyramidal features, while the other brother (AL) exhibited only hepatic symptoms. Extensive neuropsychological testing was performed on both siblings to compare cognitive profiles. The BL results showed significant impairment of motor function and information processing speed, which significantly affected him at school. Decreased visual and verbal memory, working memory and attention, as well as aspects of executive dysfunction were evident. Results for AL revealed evidence of verbal memory difficulties and aspects of executive dysfunction. Comparisons were made with the different and common cognitive characteristics of the presented cases in terms of implications for early intervention and the management of cognitive difficulties.

If left untreated, it always results in serious disability and death. The diagnosis is easily missed, but if discovered early, effective treatments are available that will prevent or reverse many of the symptoms of this disorder. The role of copper in the pathogenesis of the disease, coupled with clinical, biochemical and genetic markers, is crucial for establishing a clear diagnosis. Medical treatment includes several chelating agents (eg penicillamine, trientine) and zinc salts. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and may be lifesaving.

1307,Small fiber peripheral neuropathy in Wilson's disease: in vivo documentation of corneal confocal microscopy.,"AIM. Wilson's disease (WD) is a hepatic copper metabolism disorder that leads to copper deposition in hepatocytes and extrahepatic organs such as the brain and cornea. The aim of this study was to investigate central corneal changes and to evaluate the parameters of the corneal subbasal nerve plexus (SBNP) using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM), especially in patients affected by WD. METHODS. A total of 24 patients affected by WD and 24 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional comparative study. One eye of each subject was examined to measure different corneal parameters. Mean cell diameter and mean cell density of the epithelium; Fiber count (NF), nerve fiber length density (NFLD), branching number (NBr), bead count (NBe), and fiber curliness (FT) of SBNP; average cell density of keratocytes of the anterior, middle and posterior stroma; and mean cell density, polymegatism and pleomorphism of the endothelium, and central corneal sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS. Wilson's disease caused significant changes in SBNP and corneal epithelium. NFLD (P < 0.0001), NF (P < 0.001), NBe (P < 0.025) and NBr (P < 0.0001) were significantly lower, while FT (P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in WD subjects compared to controls. was higher. Also, mean epithelial cell diameter (P < 0.0001) and mean epithelial cell density (P < 0.0001) were significantly higher and lower, respectively, compared to controls. RESULTS. CCM showed corneal epithelial changes in WD with significant corneal changes in SBNP, indicating the presence of small fiber peripheral neuropathy in these patients. CCM may contribute to the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral nervous system involvement in WD. Copyright Â© 2015, The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

1308,Adult liver disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism: Review and update,"Congenital errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of genetic diseases that have multifaceted clinical manifestations and may involve several organ systems. Age of onset is highly variable, but IEMs mostly affect the pediatric population. However, in recent years, progress in management and new therapeutic approaches have led to improvement in IEM patient care. As a result, many patients with IEM survive to adulthood and develop their own complications. Additionally, some IEMs will emerge in adulthood. It is important that internists know and be familiar with these conditions, as it is anticipated that more adult IEM patients will need continued care in the near future. The review will focus on Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, citrine deficiency, and HFE-associated hemochromatosis, which are typically found in the adult population. Clinical manifestations and pathophysiology, especially those related to liver disease, as well as diagnosis and treatment will be discussed in detail.

1310,Neural plasticity and memory: Molecular mechanism,"Deciphering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory has been an important issue covering learning and memory as well as neurodegenerative disorders. Synapses accumulate cognitive information from lifelong changes in their molecular and structural composition. Current memory storage models describe post-translational modification essential for short-term information storage and mRNA translation for long-term information storage. However, the precise account of these changes is not summarized at the individual synapse level. Therefore, here we describe the spatio-temporal reorganization of synaptic plasticity at the dendritic spine level to elucidate the mechanism by which synaptic infrastructures are remodeled; albeit at a molecular level, such mechanisms are still rather unclear. Therefore, it is concluded that the existing mechanisms do not fully handle memory storage operations in detail. Therefore, further efforts are encouraged to delineate the mechanism of neuronal connectivity also at the chemical level, including patterns of intermolecular or intermolecular binding at the synaptic level, which can be a permissive and vital step in memory storage.

1312,Pregnancy and delivery in women with esophageal varices due to hepatic vein thrombosis,"Objective: Retrospective analysis of the course of pregnancy, labor and anesthesia in women with esophageal varices caused by portal hypertension and portal vein thrombosis. Material: Seven pregnant women were admitted from 2000 to 2012. None of them had liver transplantation (Ltx), varicose veins were in stage 1. Each was consulted by an obstetrician, transplant surgeon, and anesthesiologist. The condition of the patient during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period was analyzed. Results: Pregnancy progressed physiologically in five cases. In one threatening miscarriage diagnosed and treated with gestagens, two patients had tocolytics. One required varicose bands twice. Three thrombocytopenia worsened with platelet count <70g/L (up to 59g/L). They received a platelet transfusion before birth. Significant hypoproteinemia (4.7 g/L) occurred in one case. GDM G1 and oligohydramnios were found in one case. All women delivered at term (37-40Hbd). All general anesthesia was performed with the use of remifentanil. There was no fluctuation in MAP and HR. The time from incision to delivery was 2.5 minutes. The time from opioid administration to delivery is <4 minutes. All children were born in good condition, weight 10-90 percent. Regional anesthesia is contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia. Sudden elevation of heart rate and blood pressure in patients with esophageal varices may cause bleeding. Conclusion: Patients with portal hypertension can deliver at term. It is a high risk pregnancy. In this group, it is desired to shorten the second stage of labor with remifentanil, which provides the desired analgesia without complications, or to complete it with cesarean section under general anesthesia.

1316,No increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease during long-term follow-up,"Introduction and Aims: Data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Wilson's disease are scarce. We determine the risk of HCC in a well-defined cohort of Wilson patients. Methods: All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease (Leipzig score >=4) at three university referral hospitals in the Netherlands were included in this retrospective cohort study. End of follow-up was defined as date of diagnosis of HCC, liver transplant, death, or last hospital visit. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed to determine the incidence and mortality of HCC in Wilson's disease based on all published cohorts. Results: During a mean follow-up period of 15 years (range 0.1-51.2), 130 patients with Wilson's disease were followed. At baseline, 74 patients had cirrhosis (57% of the total: 64% compensated and 36% decompensated). At follow-up, liver disease severity improved, stabilized, or worsened in 20%, 46%, and 24% (10% unknown) of all cases. Two patients developed HCC (one with excellent decopperation after 50 years of follow-up, and the other with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease). The estimated annual risk of HCC for all patients was 0.09% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.28). In cirrhotic patients, subgroup analysis revealed an annual risk of HCC of 0.14% (95% CI: 0.02-0.46). The meta-analysis showed an annual risk of HCC of 0.04% (95% CI: 0.01-0.10) and an HCC mortality rate of 2.6/10000 person-years (95% CI: 0.7-7.0). Conclusion: Even in the case of cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is low in Wilson's disease. Our data do not support regular HCC surveillance in Wilson's disease.

1317,Effects of tetrathiomolybdate and penicillamine on brain hydroxyl radical and free copper levels: an in vivo microdialysis study.,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of excessive copper accumulation. The commonly used drug d-penicillamine (PA) or trientine causes a high rate (10-50%) of rare neurological deterioration with tetrathiomolybdate (TM) therapy. To investigate the mechanisms of neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy, brain hydroxyl radical and free copper were evaluated in vivo in this study. At days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after PA or TM administration, striatal hydroxyl radical levels of both TX mice and controls were assessed by terephthalic acid (TA) combined with microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Free copper was measured in the same microdialysis samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that both hydroxyl radical and free copper were significantly increased in the striatum of TX mice during PA administration, but not when TM was administered. These results suggest that increased free copper in the brain and oxidative stress caused by some chelators may contribute to neurological deterioration. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed a 3039-bp deletion in the homozygous state extending from the terminal portion of intron 1 to nt position 368 of exon 2. nt positions 578-579 produce a different breakpoint and remove the first 577 nt of exon 2, a acceptor and a donor insertion site at nt positions 20363-4 and 20456-7, respectively, in intron 1, resulting in a 94 It results in the activation of . The -bp cryptic Alu exon is included in the mature transcript. The resulting alternative transcript contains a TAG stop codon at the first amino acid position of the cryptic exon and produces a possibly truncated, non-functional protein. This study shows that intron exonization can also occur through large deletions that occur naturally in humans. The results show that the combination of DNA and RNA analyzes can be used for molecular characterization of gross ATP7B deletions, thereby improving genetic counseling and diagnosis of WD.

Anetoderma is a rare benign condition with focal damage to the dermal elastic tissue. Previous reports have described this skin disorder as associated with long-term d-Penicillamine therapy. Case report: A 26-year-old man was referred for evaluation of asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase levels. Studies showed negative markers for chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis, low ceruloplasmin level, and increased copper urinary excretion. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderate activity and severe bridging fibrosis. Mutation analysis found a compound heterozygous genotype and supported the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. During the primary physical examination, skin lesions consisting of multiple white to pale papules less than 7-8 mm in diameter with central prominence on the upper part of the body were also observed. It was formed according to primary anetoderma, presentation and skin biopsy findings. Treatment with d-Penicillamine at a daily dose of 1500 mg was initiated and during the 12-month follow-up, aminotransferase returned to normal and skin lesions remained unchanged.

Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease that results in copper deposition in the liver and central nervous tissue. The authors have often drawn attention to subcutaneous lipomas during clinical examinations of patients with Wilson's disease. This is the first study to analyze the prevalence and progression of lipoma development in patients with Wilson's disease. Study: Eighty consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary care center were examined for the presence of subcutaneous lipomas. Results: Subcutaneous lipomas were detected in 21 (26%) of 80 patients with Wilson's disease. Multiple subcutaneous lipomas were present in 16 (76%) of 21 affected patients. Lipomas were mainly found on the extremities and trunk. Neither initial presentation nor copper removal therapy affected the presence or course of lipomas in these patients. Conclusions: Subcutaneous lipoma formation is more common in patients with Wilson's disease than in the general population. We think that the presence of lipoma contributes to the differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Schaefer, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1327,An obese patient with impaired liver enzymes: It is not always non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [Dutch],"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in the western world. Even in patients with various risk factors for metabolic syndrome, caution should be exercised and other causes of liver disease such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and storage diseases should be excluded. Further investigation is warranted if treatment of NAFLD with weight loss does not result in improvement in impaired liver tests. One of the well-known mimics of NAFLD is Wilson's disease. This is an inherited autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper deposition in the affected tissues, particularly the liver and brain. Liver disease in Wilson's disease can present with a wide range of abnormalities, from asymptomatic impaired liver tests to liver cirrhosis and even acute liver failure. Diagnosing Wilson's disease is extremely important, as the disease is universally fatal - if left untreated.

1329,Wilson's disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is an inherited copper balance disorder that causes liver damage and varying degrees of neurological impairment. The mutant gene, ATP7B, encodes a copper-transporting protein that plays an important role in human copper metabolism. Our knowledge of Wilson's disease has increased dramatically; however, understanding the multifaceted effects of genotype-phenotype correlation and copper toxicity as the basis for targeted and individualized treatment strategies is still poor. Clinical manifestations include liver diseases ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria and psychiatric disorders. Mixed presentations often occur. Early recognition by clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and initiation of therapy with copper chelators or zinc salts are essential for a favorable outcome.

1333,Elevated serum brain natriuretic peptide and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disease characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the body. Abnormal copper metabolism has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease. BNP and MMP2/9 were biomarkers of congestive heart failure (CHF). There is a rare study investigating whether serum BNP, MMP2, or MMP9 concentrations are altered in patients with WD. In this study, we determined whether serum concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 were increased in patients with WD. Serum BNP, MMP2, and MMP9 were measured by an ELISA in 34 patients with hepatic WD, 68 patients with neurological WD, and 33 healthy controls. We found that serum BNP levels were higher in patients with neurological WD than in healthy controls (p = 0.033). Serum MMP2 levels were higher in patients with hepatic (p = 0.009) and neurological (p = 0.0004) WD compared to controls. Serum MMP9 levels were higher in patients with neurological WD than in patients with hepatic WD (p = 0.002) and controls (p = 0.0005), and were higher in patients with hepatic WD than in controls (p = 0.03). In patients with WD, serum BNP levels were negatively correlated with ceruloplasmin (p = 0.017, r = -0.215), while serum (p = 0.019, r = -0.221) and MMP9 (p = 0.011, r = -0.231) were negatively correlated. with ceruloplasmin.

True cases of Wilson's disease had significantly lower ceruloplasmin (6 versus 16 mg/dL) and higher 24-hour urinary copper (74.5 cups/day versus 322.3) compared to imitators. Initial low serum ceruloplasmin levels returned to normal in imitators at follow-up, and this can be used as a diagnostic indicator.

1335,Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine nanoparticles in a rat model of non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis.,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD) ie. Long evans cinnamon rats rarely exhibit neurological symptoms, which hinders the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WD patients. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of copper lactate injected intraperitoneally for 90 days on copper and zinc levels in liver, kidney and brain tissues; expression of hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene; and therapeutic evaluation of MT-III and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene in brain, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioral functions of male Wistar rats and orally administered D-penicillamine encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles in Cu-poisoned Wistar rats for 90 days. Reverse transcription-PCR and Morris water maze test were used for expression and neurobehavioral studies. Copper-poisoned animals showed increased expression of the hepatic MTI gene with significantly increased ceruloplasmin, serum and urinary copper levels, and decreased serum acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. However, no changes were observed in the expression levels of the hepatic Atp7b gene; and the MT-III and AChE gene in the brain. Cu-poisoned rats showed a significant increase in copper content (99.1, 73% and 74.9% increase, respectively), a decrease in liver zinc (40% decrease) and, interestingly, an increase in brain zinc content (77.1% increase) in liver, brain and kidney tissues. . controls mice. Histopathological studies showed grade 4 copper deposits in liver with rhodanin and orcein dyes, respectively, and grade 1 copper-associated protein in liver tissues of test rats. Swelling of astrocytes was observed in the cerebral cortex sections of the brain tissues of Cu-poisoned rats. D-penicillamine encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticle treatment resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain Cu content, serum ceruloplasmin level, and serum AChE activity, along with improvement in neurological functions. In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity may cause an increase in copper content in the liver and brain, an increase in hepatic MT-I gene expression, an increase in ceruloplasmin levels, and neurobehavioral disorders by interfering with acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission; however, D-penicillamine encapsulated nanoparticles can significantly reverse the disorders caused by chronic Cu intoxication in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.;Vasishta, R.

1336,Surviving a Wilson's crisis without a liver transplant,"Introduction: Wilson's Disease (WD), a copper excretion disorder, is a rare but important indication for emergency liver transplantation. Chelation therapy is ineffective in acute Wilson's crisis and liver transplantation is required as the treatment of choice. Case Report: A 19-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of weakness, fatigue, RUQ abdominal pain and hematuria for 5 days. In the last 4 months, she has experienced biliary colic symptoms with increasing weakness, loss of singing voice, and fatty foods. She recently started birth control but had no other medical history. Total bilirubin 10.8, direct bilirubin 3.1, AST 177, ALT 11, Alkaline Phosphatase 8, Albumin 3.4, INR 1.6, hemoglobin 6.6, MCV 112, white blood cell 18.0, platelets 195, creatinine 1.47, bilirubinuria and bilateral pleural effusions at presentation. Abdominal ultrasound revealed ascites, dilated common bile duct and biliary sludge. He was admitted to the PICU. She had Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, which required seven units of blood in seven days. Paracentesis was performed on the second day with SAAG compatible with portal hypertension. The patient underwent a comprehensive examination on admission to the hospital and did not respond, and empirical steroid therapy was started on the third day. Ceruloplasmin was 21 and this low was normal. Liver biopsy was performed at the time of cholecystectomy because of persistent RUQ pain showing cirrhosis and swollen glycogen-rich hepatocytes suggestive of glycogen storage disease; it came back after discharge. He recovered from hemolytic anemia and was sent home on the fourteenth day with steroids. He was followed up with the GI and the 24-hour urine copper was ordered to find 144 cups of copper. Emergency ophthalmology referral revealed Kayser-Fleisher rings. Diagnosed with WD and started on Trientine. Follow-up labs revealed decreased urinary copper, ATP7B gene mutation, and improved singing voice and fatigue. This case represents an often fatal presentation of WD without a transplant. This patient survived without the transplant and I question whether steroids played a role in his recovery without the transplant. It also serves as a reminder of the complexity of recognizing WD in the acute setting.",,"Mohrhardt, L. S.;Wisser, K.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2015.270,0,0,
1337,"A nationwide, population-based epidemiology and disease burden of Wilson's disease in South Korea in 2009-2013.","Introduction/Aim: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited, autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder in which copper accumulates in the organ, especially in the liver and central nervous system. As a rare disease, the population-based epidemiology of WD is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the nationwide, population-based prevalence, comorbidity, treatment regimen, and direct medical cost in South Korea from 2009 to 2013. Methods: Using 2 large data sources from the Health Insurance Review and Evaluation Service (HIRA) claims database and the Rare Persistent Diseases registry database from 2009 to 2013 in Korea, by physicians for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-) for WD (E83.0) 10) for rare disease in Korea, and all patients with WD registered as code (V174). Five-year data included 1,509 patients linked to information, including age, gender, comorbidity ICD-10 codes, prescription drugs, and direct medical costs. Results: Overall, the crude prevalence of WD was 2.38/100,000 individuals and showed an increasing trend over 5 years (2.27, 2.28, 2.35, 2.45 and 2.53/100,000 in 2009-2013, respectively). Most patients (72%) were diagnosed before the age of 30, and 1.4% had an additional disease code for neurological/psychological disease. Liver cirrhosis and liver cancer were detected in 33.2% and 9.9%, respectively. Liver transplantation was performed in 4.6% of the patients. D-penicillamine, trientine, and zinc were prescribed to 58.3%, 29.7%, and 13.9% of patients, respectively. The average annual total medical cost per person for WD was $1,643.15. Conclusion: The prevalence of WD was slightly lower in Korea than in other countries and increased from 2009. Since approximately one-third of WD patients have advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis and cancer, more efforts are needed for early diagnosis and treatment of WD, especially in the pediatric age group.",,"Baeg, J.

1338,Functional analysis and drug response to zinc and D-penicillamine in stable ATP7B mutant liver cell lines,"Objective: To evaluate the in vitro functional analysis and drug response to zinc (Zn) and D-penicillamine (DPA) treatment of the most common disease-causing ATP7B mutations observed in Wilson's disease (WD) patients. Background: WD is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B. More than 600 disease-causing mutations have been identified. If left untreated, WD is fatal. Commonly used drugs to reverse Cu toxicity in WD include direct chelation with DPA or metallothionein induction using Zn salts. The effect of these drugs in the rescue of hepatocytes carrying individual mutations is unknown. Methods: Homozygous mutations common in Europe/USA, Asia and India were selected for functional analysis. An ATP7B knockout hepatic cell line previously established by our group (PLoS ONE, 9: e98809, 2014) was used to generate stable mutant cell lines. ATP7B gene and protein expression were determined for all mutant cell lines. Cu-induced cell survival, apoptosis and intracellular trafficking were investigated. Cell viability against Cu toxicity was determined by treatment with Zn, DPA, or both. Results: While ATP7B mRNA was similar, protein expression varied between different mutant cell lines. Co-localization studies with the late endosome lysosome beacon2 suggested that trafficking is impaired in the presence or absence of Cu. All mutant cell lines showed varying degrees of ATP7B activity against Cu-induced toxicity and apoptosis, and p.H1069Q showed moderate ATP7B activity. In treatment with Zn, DPA or both cell lines, it showed a characteristic response to treatment. DPA was more effective than Zn in rescuing cells against Cu toxicity. Only the combination with Zn and DPA treatment was able to rescue mutant cells similar to the wild type. Results: The study gave insight into the genotype-phenotype correlation in WD. Different ATP7B mutations showed varying susceptibility to Cu with high/moderate and low ATP7B activity. Individual ATP7B mutations demonstrated a genotype-specific response to treatment. Combination treatment with Zn and DPA showed maximum survival of hepatic cells. Our data suggest that the prognosis of WD patients may benefit from knowledge of mutation-specific in vitro functional analysis and the use of Zn/DPA combination therapy.",,"Chandhok, G.;Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

About 30 cases have been reported worldwide, indicating that this complication is rare. We performed this study to determine the frequency and characteristics of HCC in a cohort of 262 patients over 19 years. Patients and methods: We reviewed case records of patients with Wilson's disease from the Wilson disease registry maintained from 1996 to 2014. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease is based on >4 points developed by the International group in Leipzig (J Hepatol 2012;56:671-85). Patients were treated with D-penicillamine with or without Zinc Sulphate. The patients were followed up regularly at 3-6 month intervals. Patients with HCC were initially evaluated by abdominal ultrasonography followed by contrast-enhanced CT scan. Results: We identified 3 cases of HCC among 262 patients with Wilson's disease. All three had cirrhosis with portal hypertension at diagnosis, as evidenced by esophageal varices and ascites. The characteristics of these patients are shown in Table. All three had multicentric HCC and presented with persistent complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, persistent ascites, and one hemoperitoneum. Given the advanced nature of HCC at presentation, only supportive treatment can be given. Results: In a large cohort of 262 patients, the incidence of HCC was 1.1%. Although low, patients with WD are also at risk for HCC. HCC appears to be aggressive in our Wilson disease cohort. Patients with Wilson's disease, similar to other etiologies, should be screened regularly for early detection of HCC. Those who are inadequately chelated appear to be at greater risk for HCC.

1340,Zinc monotherapy for young pediatric patients with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: A two-center experience in Japan.,"Objective: We have previously reported that a reasonable goal in treating young pediatric patients with Wilson's disease (WD) using zinc is to maintain 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the first 1-2 years (Mizuochi et al. JPGN). 2011;53:365). Here, we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy in young pediatric patients with WD and to establish criteria for appropriate maintenance therapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective and prospective study at Kurume University Hospital and Okinawa Chubu Hospital to examine 7 girls (median age 5 years, range 4-8) who met the diagnostic criteria for WD and were treated with zinc acetate alone before symptom onset. in Japan. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urine copper 2-7 years after the start of zinc monotherapy. Additional monitoring included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, serum total bilirubin, albumin, iron, amylase, lipase and prothrombin time, as well as 24-hour urinary zinc excretion. We performed abdominal ultrasonography and evaluated clinical signs of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. Zinc acetate dose prescribed for patients <= 25 mg twice daily for 5 years; For children 6 years of age and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the zinc dose if the patients had AST/ALT > 50 U/L, and decreased if the zinc had side effects such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: At the time of diagnosis, AST/ALT and 24-hour urine copper were 207+/-182/292+/-211 U/L and 143+/-68 mug/day (7.2+/-3.5 mug/kg). /day), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 7 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT dropped sharply to 35+/-7/37+/-16 U/L 1 year after treatment and mostly remained below 50U/L for the remainder of the study (AST/ALT: 35+/-9 2 and 6 years after treatment /42+/-29 and 33+/-9/41+/-17 U/L, respectively). Twenty-four-hour urine copper decreased to 54+/-18 cups/day (2.3+/-0.6 cups/kg/day) 1 year after treatment and mostly remained between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of treatment. study (1.7+/-0.7 and 1.9+/-0.9 cups/kg/day, 2 and 6 years after treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy has proven to be highly effective and safe in young pediatric patients with presymptomatic WD. A reasonable goal in treating young children with WD using zinc seems to be to maintain both AST/ALT below 50 U/L and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day.",,"Eda, K.;Iwama, I.;Takeuchi, T.;Takaki, Y.;Mizuochi, T.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.28235,0,0,
1341,Effect of treatment with chemical chaperones and zinc acetate on excess copper-treated hepatocytes,"[Purpose] Copper is an essential trace element in human activity. But excess copper harms human activity. Wilson's disease is a genetic disease characterized by excessive copper accumulation in various organs. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to liver disease progression in Wilson's disease. Oxidative stress causes the accumulation of abnormal proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the subcellular organelle that plays the role of proper protein folding. Accumulation of misfolded proteins disrupts ER homeostasis resulting in ER stress. Zinc acetate has been widely used to treat Wilson's disease as it increases the production of metallothionein and inhibits the absorption of copper in the intestinal epithelium. The effects of chemical chaperones and zinc acetate on copper-induced hepatotoxicity have not been studied. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the chemical chaperone and zinc acetate on copper-induced disruption of cell homeostasis. [Methods] We used the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and the immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29). The following materials were used: copper sulfate; acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal and epoxomycin as proteasome inhibitors (PIs); bathcuproin disulfonate as a copper chelator; n-acetyl-1-cysteine; zinc acetate; 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) as chemical chaperones. We detected reactive oxygen species using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein. We analyzed copper-induced ER stress by immunoblotting for ER stress markers, including the phospho alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and X-box binding protein 1. ribose polymerase and cleaved caspase 3. by immunoblotting analysis and immunofluorescent staining, respectively. We also examined cell proliferation on excess copper by immunofluorescence staining using Ki67. [Results] Excess copper-induced oxidative stress and ER stress. Chemical chaperones and zinc acetate reduced copper-induced oxidative stress and ER stress. Co-treatment of copper and PI exacerbated copper-induced apoptosis. Although excess copper resulted in decreased cell proliferation, chemical chaperones rescued the proliferation block in copper-treated cells. However, zinc acetate did not show this effect. [Results] Excess copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Chemical chaperones, PBA and UDCA, and zinc acetate reduced hepatotoxicity. These results suggest that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects for the treatment of Wilson's disease. On the other hand, zinc acetate used in the treatment of Wilson's disease can directly prevent liver damage.",,"Oe, S.;Miyagawa, K.;Honma, Y.;Harada, M.",2015,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.28214,0,0,
1342,Is serum copper concentration related to implantation?,"OBJECTIVE: It is thought that copper-containing birth control devices cause the accumulation of copper ions in the endometrium, resulting in implantation failure. Similarly, patients with untreated Wilson's disease often experienced low fertility and/or early pregnancy loss. Such patients treated with zinc successfully gave birth to babies. These observations lead to the hypothesis that infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations may have implantation failure. This study was to investigate whether serum copper concentration is related to the pregnancy rate of human embryos in vivo. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2014 and March 2015, a total of 408 patients with a mean age of 34.2 years who performed freezing and thawing embryo transfer with the same hormone replacement cycle protocol (Estradiol >140 pg/mL, Progesterone >10 ng/mL) , with good blastocyst (3BB and above according to Gardner classification) were included in the study. Pregnancy test (serum hCG), serum copper, zinc and ceruloplasmin concentrations were measured 16 days after the first progesterone replacement date. Pregnant women who did not have miscarriage (group P) and 176 non-pregnant (group NP) pregnant women at the 10th gestational week were compared. Student's t test was used to compare the two groups. The cut-off line was determined by the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the Chi-square test was used for the 2x2 emergency table. Statistical significance was defined as P <0.05. RESULTS: There was no age difference between the two groups. Group NP's copper concentration (mean 192.3mg/dL) was significantly higher than group P (mean 179.7mg/dL) and group NP's zinc concentration (mean 75.5mg/dL) was significantly lower than group P (average 90.3mg/dL). All patients showed a normal ceruloplasmin level (mean 39.4 mg/dL) rejecting Wilson's disease. Based on the ROC curve of copper concentration and pregnancy outcome, the negative/positive threshold was set at 159/160 (P=0.004 by Chi-square test). With this cutoff, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0.88, 0.26, 0.68 and 0.54, respectively. Copper concentration was not associated with age, estradiol, progesterone, or hCG. CONCLUSION: High serum copper levels may be an independent risk factor for implantation failure. A prospective study is required to reveal the causal relationship.",,"Matsubayashi, H.;Kitaya, K.;Yamaguchi, K.;Nishiyama, R.;Takaya, Y.;Ishikawa, T.",2015,September,,0,0,
1343,Fatal copper toxicity despite early aggressive interventions,"Background: Copper sulfate (CuSO4) is highly toxic with hemolysis and multiple organ failure at doses of 0.15-0.3 g/kg. There is no consensus on optimal means for enhanced elimination in cases of severe copper (Cu) toxicity. Case report: A 19-year-old female chemist swallowed > 10 g of CuSO4 solution from her mother. She had abdominal pain and blue vomit. Examination revealed excessive salivation and tachycardia. He was intubated due to hypoxia and aspiration. Early bronchoscopy showed tracheobronchitis and segmental bronchial blue-green staining that was irrigated for decontamination. Endoscopy revealed grade 2 esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis and ulcerations. Late in hospital day 1, he developed significant hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and anuric renal failure. 1.5 g penicillamine was started due to the deficiency of calcium disodium edetate and dimercaprol at the national level. Trientine was not available. He received hemodialysis (HD), exchange transfusion, methylene blue, zinc and folate treatment. Blood drawn in the emergency room resulted in hospital day 3, revealing a serum Cu level of > 500 cups/dL. Cu could not be detected in the dialysate after two cycles of HD. Despite the decrease in serum Cu levels, his kidney function did not improve and his neurological status deteriorated. After 14 days, her family withdrew care given her unimproved clinical condition. An autopsy was not done. Discussion: Our patient showed severe toxicity after ingesting a large amount of CuSO4. Bronchial irrigation provided some decontamination. HD was initiated to reduce direct Cu- and penicillamine-induced nephrotoxicity and to support kidney function. There was no penicillamine-bound Cu in the dialysate. Exchange of blood products and exchange transfusions may have contributed to the reduction of Cu load. Serum Cu at day 8 doubled from day 3, which may represent a redistribution. Conclusions: Acute Cu toxicity is rare but carries high mortality due to severe hemolysis and multi-organ toxicity. Penicillamine is standard of care in cases of chronic Cu toxicity in Wilson's disease. There is no evidence that it is an optimal chelator for acute toxicity, but calcium disodium edetate and dimercaprol have been used successfully. In our case, the patient died despite decontamination measures, early multi-organ support, chelation and increased elimination attempts.",,"Eisnor, D.;Anwar, M.;Morgan, B.;Pomerleau, A.",2015,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/15563650.2015.1071025,0,0,
1344,MEDNIK syndrome: Clinical and biochemical depiction of the response to long-term zinc therapy-A case report,"Background: MEDNIK syndrome - abbreviation for mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, keratoderma - is caused by mutations in the AP1S1 gene encoding the sigma 1A subunit of adapter protein complex-1 (AP-1). AP-1 manages the intracellular trafficking of various transmembrane proteins, including the copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B. We have recently identified impaired copper metabolism in MEDNIK syndrome, a picture that combines abnormalities of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases partially resolved with zinc acetate therapy. Methods: To confirm our previous observation, we performed serial clinical and biochemical evaluations in an Italian patient with MEDNIK syndrome under zinc therapy. The duration of treatment was 4 years. Results: Our patient presented with hepatopathy, hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia, increased urinary copper excretion, hepatic copper overload, and intrahepatic cholestasis at the time of diagnosis. At the end of follow-up, he showed dramatic improvement in hepatopathy and enteropathy with complete normalization of serum transaminases and liver copper content. However, on follow-up, the skin abnormalities worsened and cognitive development stagnated. Conclusions: The above findings raise new questions about the clinical and biochemical implications of AP-1 dysfunction and possible therapeutic options. Chronic zinc acetate may protect affected patients from hepatic copper overload, although some copper may be required for normal brain growth and maturation.",,"Martinelli, D.;Dionisi-Vici, C.",2015,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10545-015-9877-x,0,0,
1345,Wilson's disease. Further evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity in the two sisters,"Wilson's disease (WH) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene at 13q14.3. The defective protein leads to low ceruloplasmin blood levels and copper deposition in the liver, basal ganglia, and cornea with clinical evidence of liver disease, tremor, dysarthria, dystonia, and psychiatric manifestations. Hemolytic anemia, hypertransaminasemia, renal tubular acidosis are other common findings. We present a series of 21 patients aged 8 to 52 years treated with penicillamine, zinc, or both. A striking phenotypic variability was observed in two sisters with the same genotype (c.3207C->A(p.H1069Q) / c.3904-2A->G). Although both begin to show symptoms at the age of 10, the first is characterized by neurological symptoms (tremor, motor coordination, language and cognitive impairment), while the liver involvement is the only symptom in the other. After a 20-year follow-up, the former is severely affected (basal ganglia copper deposits and hypergenic liver, MRI evidence for piastriopenia), while the latter still has moderate liver enlargement. This phenotypic variability can be explained by the interference of modifier genes (CTR1, ATOX1, MURR1) that regulate copper metabolism in the presence of defective ATP7B protein function. More research into their role could have a profound impact on therapy as well.",,"Fiumara, A.;Sapuppo, A.;Brafa Musicoro, V.;Lepori, M.

1346,Hand stereotypes in Wilson's disease,"Objective: We present the case study of a young patient diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD) who presented with stereotypes in both hands. Background: Stereotypes are a phenomenological category of hyperkinetic Movement Disorders. The precise definition of stereotype varies with different authors. It is defined as a coordinated, patterned, repetitive, rhythmic, purposeless but apparently purposeful or ritualistic movement, posture or speech (Jankovic 1994). It attempts to distinguish stereotypes from tics and other repetitive Movement Disorders, which are defined as ""a pattern of non-purposeful movement that is repeated repeatedly in the same way and multiple times over a period of time,"" which is typically distracting. (Edwards et al. 2013). Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism with excessive copper deposition in the basal ganglia. Hyperactive Movement Disorders seen in WD include dystonia (often prominent in the face, jaw, neck, trunk, and limbs), tremor - postural, action-related, intentional, resting tremor, or swaying involvement of the proximal upper extremity (wing flapping tremor). . Yorio et al. (1994) described a stereotype of toes on both feet in a WD patient. Methods: This is a case study. Results: A 26-year-old right-handed woman presents a history of approximately 3 months of decline in function with slowed information processing and dysarthric speech. On examination, there were aimless flexion-extension movements of all fingers in both hands. They are involuntary, patterned, repetitive and rhythmic. Movements have improved a bit in terms of distraction. There were occasional dystonic movements in the lips and chin. There was no other feature on neurological examination. Kayser-Fleisher rings were evident on slit lamp examination. MRI brain showed T2 hyper density in bilateral striatum. Laboratory investigations showed very low ceruloplasmin, high copper levels, and abnormal liver function, so he confirmed WD and trientine was started. Conclusions: We believe this is the first official definition of hand stereotype in Wilson's disease. It is important and difficult to distinguish stereotype from tremor, myoclonus, tics, dystonia, chorea and athetosis. A videotape showing the patient's movements will be presented at the conference.",,"Mittal, S. O.;Ranpura, A.;Salardini, A.;Jabbari, B.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26295,0,0,
1347,Bone turnover and its link to penicillamine use in Chinese patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) is higher than in the general population, the cause of which is still unclear. The purpose of this research is to analyze the possible reasons for the high prevalence and association between penicillamine and bone mineral density. Methods: Eight-four WD patients (44 men and 40 women) and 76 controls (27 men and 49 women) were included in this study. The patients were diagnosed with ATP7B mutation analysis. Dual energy X-ray Analysis (DXA) was used to assess bone mineral density (BMD). Serum phosphate, calcium, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, osteocalcin, 25-(OH)-Vitamin D as well as alkaline phosphatase were measured to assess bone turnover activity. Based on imaging, laboratory testing, and prior medical history information, we analyzed correlations between BMD, bone turnover activity, and patients' age, sex, clinical manifestations, and maximum penicillamine dose. Results: Fifty-eight patients underwent DXA scanning. While the prevalence of osteoporosis was 27.58% (16/58) in WD patients, it was 19.74% (15/76) in controls. Lumbar spine BMD, T score and Z score, and hip neck BMD, Z score were significantly lower in WD patients. 25(OH)-vitamin D, serum phosphate, serum calcium and ALP were significantly higher in WD patients compared to controls. However, among patients receiving different maximum daily doses of penicillamine, the higher dose was associated with lower BMD. Age, gender and clinical signs did not affect BMD in WD patients. Conclusion: WD patients have a higher prevalence of osteoporosis, lower BMD and higher bone turnover activity compared to controls. The use of penicillamine is an important accelerating factor.",,"Dong, Q. Y.;Dong, Y.;Ni, W.;Zhang, Y.;Wu, Z. Y.",2015,May,,0,0,
1348,WTX101-201: Phase 2 study of bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate in newly diagnosed wilson disease patients,"Introduction and Aims: Wilson's Disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, causing copper accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain, and impaired hepatic copper excretion. WTX101 (biscoline tetrathiomolybdate) is a new copper-removing agent with a unique mechanism of action (MoA) under development for the treatment of WD. WTX101 targets better control of Cu due to the rapid formation of irreversible Cu-tetrathiomolybdate-protein complexes leading to a rapid removal of copper without activating free Cu, which can cause tissue toxicity, including neurological deterioration. Tetrathiomolybdate has been studied in several clinical studies in WD patients using ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. The study will evaluate whether an individualized BID oral dose of WTX101 with an up-titration design in the initial copper removal phase is safe and effective in reducing free copper levels (NCC adjusted for plasma Mo concentration) and maintaining this low free copper. levels using QD dosing. It will also provide data on additional free Cu endpoints, 24-hour urinary copper and neurological outcomes with UWDRS. Methods: This is a Phase 2, open-label, uncontrolled, 24-week study conducted in the EU and USA. An individualized dosing regimen of WTX101 with PPI is administered in newly diagnosed symptomatic (neurological, stable hepatic, or combined) WD patients 18 years of age and older with elevated NCC levels treated with chelation therapy or zinc therapy for <=28 days. Eligible volunteers will receive omeprazole 20 mg per day with WTX101 as an outpatient at doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg per day. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved normalized NCC levels (<=2.3 µM) or achieved a reduction in NCC of at least 25%. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, change in NCC levels and time to normalization, copper endpoints (interchangeable copper, Mo/Cu/Protein triple complex species profile and 24-hour urinary copper), ALT, AST, INR, and hepatic status. and bilirubin measurement, neurological assessment (UWDRS), psychiatric assessment (MINI Monitoring), clinical symptom status (CGI), and QOL/PRO endpoints (EQ5D, MMAS-8, TSQM). The PK of WTX101 will be measured by plasma total and free elemental Mo. Conclusions: The unique mode of action may make WTX101 an effective treatment option for WD patients with a lower potential for neurological deterioration, while once-daily dosing offers increase compliance.",,"Weiss, K.

1349,Functional characterization and drug response of disease-causing ATP7B mutations to zinc and D-penicillamine in a human hepatoma cell line.,"Introduction and Aims: Hepatocyte survival in Wilson's disease (WD) is significantly affected by toxic copper (Cu) overload due to mutation of the liver copper transporter ATP7B. More than 600 mutations of ATP7B have been identified. Copper toxicity in WD is commonly reversed with D-penicillamine (DPA) and/or zinc (Zn). The impact of individual ATP7B mutation expressed in WD patients for the efficacy of standard therapy is unknown. Methods: ATP7B mutations common in Europe/USA and Asia and various homozygous genotypes observed in India were selected. Stable cell lines were generated by our group expressing mutations in a recently established human hepatoma HepG2 ATP7B knockout cell line (PLoS ONE, 9: e98809, 2014). Cell survival and induction of apoptosis were determined following Cu exposure and Zn/DPA treatment in mutant cell lines. Results: ATP7B protein expression was variable in mutant cell lines, while mRNA expression was at similar levels compared to wild type. Co-localization studies with late endosome-lysosome beacon2 suggested disruption of trafficking in various mutant cell lines. Mutant cell lines showed varying degrees of activity to escape toxic Cu, with the p.H1069Q mutation exhibiting moderate activity. No activity was observed for mutant cell lines encoding missing reading frames. Characteristic responses to treatment were observed after combined treatment of Zn, DPA and Zn+DPA for individual cell lines. Overall, DPA treatment was more efficient compared to Zn treatment. It should be noted that only Zn+DPA treatment was able to fully restore ATP7B activity compared to the ATP7B wild type. Conclusions: Individual ATP7B mutations differ in their capacity to evade toxic Cu and show genotype-specific response to treatment. The type of ATP7B mutation may modulate the efficacy of Zn and DPA treatment, suggesting that current regimens can be further improved using knowledge of functional parameters exerted by ATP7B.",,"Chandhok, G.;Sauer, V.;Niemietz, C.;Zibert, A.;Schmidt, H.

1350,Copper-Wilson disease,"Wilson's disease was described a hundred years ago by Kinnier Wilson. He focused on the neurological aspects of the disease, but also made the critical observation that the liver was affected. He suggested that a toxic agent was responsible for both neurological and liver damage. We only know that the toxin is copper and that it accumulates in tissues at toxic levels due to a defect in a specific gene, ATP7B, which is critical for copper transport and metabolism in the liver. Injury to other organs, especially the brain, is secondary to copper overload in the liver and elevated copper levels in the blood. Both the hepatic and neurological symptoms of the disease are very variable, ranging from mild over the years to rapidly progressive leading to severe disability and death. Diagnosis is very important for WD patients. Clinical features are based on a combination of copper metabolism studies, genetic analysis, and neuroimaging. Antibody therapy is based on either copper chelation (d-penicillamine, trientine) or inhibition of intestinal copper absorption (zinc salts). Both types of treatment appear to be equally effective and the choice depends on the experience of the centre, patient preference and drug availability. Liver transplantation is performed only in cases with fulminant liver damage and liver failure progressing despite treatment. Antibody therapy should be lifelong. Clinical improvement is achieved in most cases that are not diagnosed with pharmacotherapy in the final stage. It is important to screen asymptomatic siblings and children of affected patients. Early treatment prevents the development of symptoms. It is patient compliance that is critical to therapeutic success.",,"Czlonkowska, A.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12813,0,0,
1351,Diagnostic value of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after 48 hours of discontinuation of d-penicillamine in the assessment of compliance in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment with copper inhibitors is effective in most cases. However, compliance is essential. Copper excretion in the urine is an important parameter for diagnosis and treatment follow-up. During prolonged therapy with chelating agents, a two-day break in therapy should result in normal values of urinary copper concentration (<50mug/dl). The aim of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of this method in the assessment of compliance in these patients. Methods: We studied consecutive patients treated with d-penicillamine (DPA) for at least one year at our center through routine follow-up studies. We evaluated copper metabolism parameters, neurological examinations, liver status, and compliance. We performed 24-hour urinary copper excretion analysis 48 hours after chelation therapy was interrupted. Results: 33 patients were recruited. The mean duration of treatment was 11.78+/-11.75 years. After 48 hours of discontinuation of DPA, normalization of copper excretion (<50mug/24h) was observed in 20 (87%) of 23 compliant patients. Ten patients were noncompliant, and 7 (70%) of them had copper excretion greater than 50 µg/24 hours after discontinuation of DPA. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were 87% and 70%, respectively. Receiver operator curve analysis found the optimal cut-off limit of urinary copper excretion of 62mug/dl for compliant patients. Conclusion: Measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after 48 hours of discontinuation of DPA treatment in patients with WD is a reliable method to confirm patient compliance and may be helpful for further treatment decisions.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2015,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12807,0,0,
1352,Early neurological worsening in Wilson's disease patients,"Objective: The aim of our study is to analyze the factors that may affect the frequency of early neurological deterioration, outcomes, clinical and laboratory factors in WD patients. Background: Early neurological deterioration at the start of treatment for Wilson's Disease (WD) remains an unresolved therapeutic problem. Methods: We analyzed 143 symptomatic WD patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2010. The early neurological worsening group was based on worsening or the appearance of new neurological symptoms on the Unified Wilson Disease Score (UWDRS), which was initially scored for up to 6 months. Reversibility of worsening was followed for up to 24 months. In addition, analysis was performed in subgroups with and without neurological deterioration according to the selected clinical and laboratory variables and type of anticancer therapy. Results: Early neurological worsening in 11.1 [percent](16/143) of WD patients, only in patients with neurological findings at diagnosis. The mean time to worsening since the start of WD treatment was 2.3+/-1.9 months. It was completely reversible in 53[%] (8/15) and partially reversible in 13[%] (2/15) patients for 9.2+/-5.2 months. Gender, age at diagnosis, disease duration, type of WD treatment (Dpenicillamine) or zinc sulfate), type of neurological manifestations, initial copper metabolism outcomes, and liver function parameters had no effect on early neurological deterioration. Baseline neurological symptoms (15/69 vs.0/73; p<0.01); progression of neurologic deficits scored in UWDRS sections II and III (p<0.01); emergence of WD-induced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in the thalamus (p<0.01) and brainstem (p<0.01); Concomitant treatment with drugs that potentially modulate the action of dopamine (p<0.05) were the main predictors of early neurological deterioration in WD patients. Conclusions: Neurological deterioration at the start of anticopper therapy in patients with WD occurs in patients with advanced brain damage with severe neurological signs at baseline and can also be provoked by concomitant therapy, but this is unrelated to the type of anticopper therapy.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Karlinski, M.;Dziezyc, K.",2015,,,0,1,
1353,Zinc therapy reverses neurodegeneration in wilson's disease patients with parkinsonism,"Objective: To evaluate how effectively zinc therapy can reverse parkinsonism in Wilson's patients who were initially treated with penicillamine. Background: For years, treatment of Wilson's disease has aimed to stimulate excretion of accumulated copper by chelating agents. The dilemma arises when patients paradoxically deteriorate because chelators increase free copper levels. Conversely, zinc therapy normalizes elevated serum and urine-free copper by inducing metallothionein production. Methods: In a retrospective observational study of four Wilson's disease patients with severe parkinsonism who were initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared subjective and objective clinical improvement before and one year after switching to zinc monotherapy. The Global Assessment Scale (GAS) was used for clinical assessments. Global disability was measured in four domains: liver, cognition and behavior, motor and bone-muscle, and neurological dysfunction were assessed in 14 main categories. Results: Three of the four patients whose condition worsened with penicillamine (0.5-1 g/day) significantly improved to normal biochemical and clinical status on zinc (150 mg/day). The fourth patient, who received 250 mg/day penicillamine plus 200 mg/day zinc, improved slightly in the lower extremities one month later, while with zinc monotherapy he had significantly improved to a symptom-free state in the following months. Their global disability improved by approximately 73% and neurological assessments showed 100% improvement. Conclusions: The results show that zinc monotherapy is a safe and promising treatment for copper intoxication and supports the normalization of increased serum and urine copper values as a rational therapeutic strategy.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.

1354,First successful zinc therapy in Wilson's disease with acute liver failure and copper intoxication: There is a miracle drug,"Objectives: To evaluate initial zinc monotherapy on copper levels and liver recovery. Background: The accumulation of copper in the brain and liver is considered the cause of Wilson's disease. However, there is evidence that it is the origin of free copper intoxication. Methods: A 10-year-old girl with Wilson's disease who presented with diffuse jaundice, acute liver failure, hemolytic anemia, positive family history, elevated copper in the urine, liver function and copper values was evaluated retrospectively before and after the first zinc monotherapy. The patient was treated with 125 mg elemental zinc daily and liver transplantation was considered in case of unresponsiveness. Results: The patient improved biochemically and clinically 10 days after zinc treatment, consistent with an 86% urinary copper decrease. The revised Wilson's disease prognostic index increased from 13 to 5 and the patient was removed from the transplant list. After 2, 4, 8 weeks of zinc treatment, AST, ALT, bilirubin, urinary copper showed steady improvements up to 62%, -26, 82, 77%, respectively, up to week eight. Results for the second 8-week period showed another 25, 41, 48, 86 and 33% reductions for serum-free copper compared to previous results, respectively. No side effects or clinical deterioration were observed. Conclusions: The results suggest zinc therapy as a promising, fast-acting, safe and cost-effective option for the treatment of copper intoxication in Wilson's disease with acute liver failure. It also supports the hypothesis of normalizing elevated serum-free copper as a rational targeted therapeutic strategy.",,"Avan, A.;Kianifar, H. R.;Hoogenraad, T.

1355,Copper chelation efficiency of D-penicillamine nanoparticles in an experimental rat model for non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis,"Objective: D-penicillamine cannot alleviate brain copper overload and neurological symptoms in Alzheimer's/Wilson's disease patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine-loaded nanoparticles administered orally for 90 days to that of conventional D-penicillamine in a Wistar rat model for non-Wilson brain copper toxicosis. Methods: High performance liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, neurobehavioral and histopathological studies, and nanoparticle preparation/physicochemical characterization were performed. Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 274.09 nm and less than 29.32% D-penicillamine release under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that D-penicillamine levels were increased in the brain of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine treatment resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory with simultaneous increase in urinary copper levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in a rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine treatment resulted in negative rhodanine staining, supported by a 60.1% and 16.4% reduction in brain copper content in the liver and brain sections, respectively, compared to the untreated copper poisoning group. However, liver and brain sections of the D-penicillamine therapy group based on nanoparticles showed no accumulation of grade 1 copper and copper, which was confirmed by 47.2% and 32.8% reductions in liver and brain copper content, respectively, compared to the untreated copper poisoning group. Conclusions: Taken together, this study provides the first in vivo evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy in chelating more brain copper and attenuating neurological deficits at even half the dose given in conventional D-penicillamine therapy.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

1356,Successful liver transplantation for Wilson's disease as a rare cause of liver failure after SCT in a child with Fanconi aplastic anemia,"Introduction: Liver toxicity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be due to various causes such as drug toxicity, graft versus host disease, hepatic veno-occlusive disease. However, other rare causes should be kept in mind. We present a child who developed liver failure after Allo-SCT and was subsequently diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The patient was successfully treated with repeated plasmapheresis for acute liver failure, followed by a cadaveric liver transplant. Material (or patient) and method: A 13-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Fanconi aplastic anemia and stem cell transplantation was performed from a HLA-matched sibling. The reduced conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were moderately elevated after engraftment. Hepatitis markers were negative. We thought that hepatic toxicity was due to the conditioning regimen. Abdominal acid did not develop. Total bilirubin levels were 10-15mg/dl in the first three months and remained relatively constant at around. In the fourth month of the patient's direct bilirubin levels began to rise, coagulation tests became abnormal. Percutaneous liver biopsy was taken. Toxic hepatitis was considered in the preliminary biopsy report. Except for trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, all drugs including cyclosporine A were discontinued. Bilirubin values rose during this period. Total bilirubin was 35.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin was 26.7 mg/dL, ammonia was 194.6 mcg/dl, and ceruloplasmin was 47.1 mg/dl. Patients were considered to be in hepatic coma and began receiving therapeutic plasmapheresis. A total of seven plasmapheresis was performed. The first five plasmapheresis were performed with fresh frozen plasma. Allergic reactions occurred at the last plasmapheresis. Two plasmapheresis with albumin was performed one week later. Results: Liver biopsy was reported as toxic hepatitis and copper accumulation. The 24-hour urine copper level was high. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. D-penicillamine and zinc therapy was started. Liver transplantation from cadaver was performed one month later. Two years after stem cell transplantation, the patient is disease-free with complete donor chimerism in the bone marrow and stable liver graft function with immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion: In conclusion, Wilson's disease should be kept in mind in hepatic toxicity after allo-SCT. Patients with autosomal recessive disease such as Fanconi aplastic anemia may also have another autosomal recessive disease. Therefore, a detailed family medical history should be taken.",,"Albayrak, C.;Albayrak, D.;Kalayci, A. G.;Bicakci, A.;Elli, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/bmt.2015.37,0,0,
1357,Molecular genetic diagnosis of PFIC 3 presentation overlapping with Wilson's disease and response to treatment,"Case: The patient was admitted at the age of 15 with signs of fatigue, splenomegaly and mild thrombocytopenia. Other tests included 24-hour urine copper [>100 mcg], absence of Kayser-Fleischer ring, normal ceruloplasmin level, and absence of ATP7B mutation. Liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis, focal bridge fibrosis, moderate bile duct proliferation, and markedly elevated hepatic copper content (1471 cups/g), suggesting WD. Started on zinc therapy but switched to trientine due to gastrointestinal side effects. Despite treatment with trientine for more than 12 months, transaminase levels did not improve and urinary copper remained elevated. Further evaluation for another possible etiology revealed increased bile acids. A trial of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been initiated for PFIC3. ABCB4 gene sequence showed heterozygous c.984T > G (p.Y328*) mutation consistent with PFIC3 diagnosis. Trientine was discontinued and UDCA continued. Transaminases decreased but did not return to normal with UDCA treatment (Table). After 4 months of treatment, liver biopsy was repeated and showed that the hepatic copper content had dropped dramatically to 135 mug/g dry weight liver. After 10 months, liver indices remained slightly abnormal, but synthetic function was stable. Conclusions: In cholestatic disorders such as PFIC3, hepatic copper deposition can be observed at levels above the diagnostic threshold for WD, and therefore, the diagnosis of PFIC3 should be considered in patients with elevated hepatic copper and without overt features of WD. treatment. UDCA improves cholestasis in PFIC3, and we show for the first time a reduction in hepatic copper in response to treatment.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-015-9609-1,0,0,
1358,A case report of colitis during treatment with trientine for Wilson's disease,"Case: A 40-year-old female patient with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms, recently diagnosed with Wilson's disease (WD), was started on 250 mg triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) three times a day and developed bloody diarrhea. Trientine was discontinued and colonoscopy revealed active ileitis and severe colitis of uncertain nature. He was referred to us with a prediagnosis of steroid psychosis after prednisone was started and his neuropsychiatric symptoms worsened acutely. Zinc therapy was started for WD and prednisone was discontinued. Clinical symptoms of colitis resolved and sigmoidoscopy showed resolution of colitis. Trientine was restarted due to persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. He developed multiple bloody bowel movements again, so trientine was discontinued. Evaluation for other causes of colitis was negative for markers for infection and IBD. At this time, colonoscopy again showed active colitis and proctitis. Histology showed widespread inflammation with cryptitis, crypt abscess formation, and ulcerations suggestive of drug-induced colitis. The patient was resumed on zinc therapy for WD and his colitis symptoms resolved without recurrence. All of his neurological symptoms improved and improved over a longer period of time. She had stable liver function during zinc maintenance therapy. Conclusion: Chelation therapy is an integral part of the initial treatment of symptomatic patients with WD, but patients should be followed appropriately for side effects. Colitis is a rare side effect of trientine, and zinc is an alternative therapy for patients with WD who have chelation-related side effects.",,"Boga, S.;Jain, D.;Schilsky, M.",2015,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-015-9609-1,0,0,

1362,Simultaneous monitoring of cerebral metal deposition in an experimental model of Wilson's disease by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"Background: Neuropsychiatric affect, including extrapyramidal symptoms, is a common component of Wilson's disease (WD). WD is caused by a genetic defect of the copper (Cu) efflux pump ATPase7B. Mouse strains with natural or engineered transgenic defects of the Atp7b gene served as the WD model. These show a gradual accumulation and concentration of Cu in the liver, kidneys and brain. However, little is still known about the regional distribution of Cu within the brain, its effect on other metals, and the subsequent pathophysiological mechanisms. We performed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and performed comparative metal bioimaging on brain sections of wild-type and Atp7b null mice in the 11-24 month age range. Reporter RNA and protein expression of a panel of inflammatory markers was assessed using RT-PCR and Western blots of brain homogenates. Conclusions: We could confirm the accumulation of Cu in the brain parenchyma in WD (5.5 mug<sup>-1</sup> in the cortex) compared to controls (2.7 cups g<sup>-1</sup>) by two factors. ) was already established in exactly 11 months. In the periventricular regions (PVR), known as structures with significant Cu content, Cu decreased by 3 times, in sequence. Also, the increasing Cu gradient downstream of the PVR was relieved. Otherwise, the architecture of the Cu distribution is essentially preserved. Zinc (Zn) increased by up to 40%, particularly in Cu-high regions, but not in typical Zn accumulator regions, a side effect from the fact that Zn is to some extent a substrate for Cu-ATPases. Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) concentrations were constant in all regions evaluated. Inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, TIMP-1 and capillary proliferation marker alpha-SMA increased 2-3 times in WD. Conclusions: This study confirmed stable cerebral Cu accumulation in the parenchyma and discovered reduced Cu in cerebrospinal fluid in Atp7b null mice, underlining the diagnostic value of micro-local analytical techniques.

1363,Genotype-phenotype correlations in a mountain population community with a high prevalence of Wilson's disease: Genetic and cynical homogeneity.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by more than 500 mutations in the ATP7B gene, presenting significant heterogeneity of clinical manifestations even in patients with a particular mutation. Previous findings suggested a potential role for additional genetic modifiers and environmental factors on phenotypic expression among affected patients. We performed clinical and genetic studies to perform genotype-phenotype correlation in two large families living in a socioculturally isolated community, with the highest ever reported prevalence of Wilson's disease of 1:1130. Sequencing of the ATP7B gene in seven affected individuals and 43 family members identified a common compound heterozygous genotype H1069Q/M769H-fs in five symptomatic and two asymptomatic patients and detected the presence of two of the seven identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in all affected patients. Symptomatic patients had similar clinical phenotype and age of onset (18+/-1 years) and showed dysarthria and dysphagia as common clinical features at the time of diagnosis. In addition, all symptomatic patients showed absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and dystonia accompanied by adverse clinical outcomes. Our findings add value to the understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in Wilson's disease based on a multifamily study in an isolated population with a high degree of genetic and environmental homogeneity in contrast to the majority of reports. We observed an equal influence of other putative genetic modifiers and environmental factors on age of onset and clinical presentation of Wilson's disease in patients of a given genotype. These data provide valuable implications that can be applied to predict clinical management in asymptomatic patients in such populations.

1364,Neurological manifestations of acute and chronic liver disease,"Purpose of Review: This article summarizes the most common neurological sequelae of acute and chronic liver failure, liver transplantation, and other treatments for liver disease, and summarizes the pathogenesis, neurological manifestations, and management of Wilson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Neurological manifestations of liver disease result from the failure of the liver to detoxify active compounds that have deleterious effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, liver disease treatments such as liver transplantation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and antiviral drugs may also be neurotoxic. Wilson's disease affects the liver and nervous system simultaneously and can often be initially diagnosed by a neurologist; Treatment options have evolved in recent years. SUMMARY: Acute and chronic liver diseases are common in the general population. Neurological dysfunction will eventually affect a significant proportion of these individuals, especially if the disease progresses to liver failure. Early recognition of these neurological signs may lead to more effective management of these patients.

1367,Long-term outcomes of liver transplantation for Wilson's disease: experience in France.,"Background and Objectives Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for serious complications of Wilson's disease (WD). We aimed to report the long-term outcomes of WD patients after LT. Methods Medical records of 121 French patients transplanted for WD between 1985 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-five patients were adults (median age: 29 years (18-66)) and 46 patients were children (median age: 14 years (7-17)). Indication for LT (1) fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis (n = 64.53), median age = 16 years (7-53), (2) decompensated cirrhosis (n = 50, 41%), median age = 31.5 years (12-66) or (3) severe neurological disease (n = 7, 6%), median age = 21.5 years (14.5-42). The mean post-transplant follow-up was 72 months (0-23.5). Results Actuarial patient survival rates were 87% at 5, 10, and 15 years. Male gender, pre-transplant renal failure, non-elective procedure and neurological indication were significantly associated with worse survival rate. None of these factors remained statistically significant under multivariate analysis. Patients transplanted for liver indications had a worse prognosis with a fulminant or subfulminant course, non-elective procedure, pre-transplant renal failure, and patients transplanted before 2000. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the last period of LT was associated with better prognosis. At the last visit, the calculated median glomerular filtration rate was 93 ml/min (33-180); 11/93 patients (12%) had stage II renal failure and none of them had stage III. Conclusions WD-related hepatic failure is a rare indication (<1%) for LT with an excellent long-term outcome, including renal function. Â© 2013 European Association for Liver Research.

1369,Cause of Alzheimer's disease with copper toxicity and treatment with zinc,"Evidence that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) epidemic is new and that the disease was very rare in the 1900s will be presented. The incidence is increasing rapidly, but only in developed countries. We hypothesize that the nascent environmental factor that was partly the cause of the AD epidemic was the intake of inorganic copper from drinking water along with a high-fat diet and supplementation pills. Inorganic copper can be partially absorbed directly and raise the serum-free copper pool. The Squitti group demonstrated that serum-free copper was elevated in AD, correlated with cognition and predicted loss of cognition. Therefore, our inorganic copper hypothesis fits well with the Squitti group data. We also showed that AD patients were zinc deficient compared to same-aged controls. Since zinc is a neuronal protective factor, we hypothesize that zinc deficiency may also partially cause AD. We conducted a small 6-month double-blind study on a new formulation of zinc and found that it protected against loss of cognition in patients aged 70 years and older. Zinc therapy also significantly reduced serum-free copper in AD patients, so efficacy may come from restoring normal zinc levels or lowering serum-free copper, or both. Â© 2014 Brewer.",,"Brewer, G.

1371,A case study on Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is a disorder in the liver that results in improper metabolism of copper, leading to excessive accumulation of this vital trace element in the liver, brain, eyes and other organs. Although copper is essential for normal physiological function, it can become toxic and life-threatening when too much is present in critical organs, particularly the liver and brain. There is no cure for Wilson's disease, and patients affected by this disease face lifelong treatment. Fortunately, the disease is very treatable if diagnosed before significant damage to the liver or brain occurs. This article presents a case study of Wilson's disease and the role of sonography in helping diagnose and monitor patients with this condition. Â© Author(s) 2013.",,"Mills, B.;Baker, A.

Here, we report two Wilson's disease patients presenting with severe gastric ulcer several months after starting treatment with 50 mg of zinc acetate three times daily. Our patients were not taking any ulcerogenic drugs and had no evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. In both patients, zinc acetate was replaced with penicillamine and proton pump inhibitor therapy was initiated after complete resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms.

1373,Myocardial integrated ultrasonic backscatter for early detection of cardiac involvement in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background/Purpose: Videodensitometry is a viable, noninvasive ultrasound tissue characterization method that allows early detection of myocardial changes. This study aimed to investigate the ultrasonic backscattering properties of myocardium in patients with Wilson's disease. bMaterials and Methods: We compared cardiologically asymptomatic Wilson's disease patients (W group) (n=18) with healthy controls (K group) (n=15) of the same age (26.7+/-9.6 years). The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made on the basis of clinical signs, family history, and laboratory findings and was confirmed by liver biopsy. Transthoracic echocardiographic quantitative tissue analysis was performed on data from the septum and left ventricular posterior wall, and end-diastolic (d) and end-systolic (s) mean gray level (MGL) histograms were obtained after background correction (c). The cyclic variation index (CVI) was calculated using the formula [(cMGLd - cMGLs) / cMGLd] x100. bResults: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in gender, age, body mass index, heart rate or blood pressure, and conventional echocardiographic parameters. Posterior wall cMGLs value was higher in group W than in group C (30.9+/-2.6 vs. 22.2+/-2.7, p=0.033). Group W had a significantly lower septal CVI than group C (-22+/-4.4% vs. 43.4% +/-12.9%, p<0.001) and there was no significant difference in posterior CVI . wall (-67.0+/-15.9% vs. 41.7%+/-18.6%, p=0.32). bConclusion: There were abnormalities in two-dimensional echocardiographic gray level distributions in patients with Wilson's disease. These videodensitometric myocardial changes were significantly lower in Wilson's patients than in controls, possibly representing an early stage of cardiac involvement.

1374,"Osteoporosis and fractures in liver disease: relevance, pathogenesis, and therapeutic implications.","It is increasingly recognized that patients with liver disease develop bone loss that is severe enough to lead to atraumatic fractures, thus significantly reducing quality of life and expectancy. The estimated prevalence of liver-related osteoporosis in the general population is 20-420/100000 and fractures are between 60-880/100000. It should be kept in mind that up to 40% of patients with chronic liver disease may experience fractures. Pathogenic mediators include fibronectin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and various cytokines, but reduction in treatment with vitamin D and/or corticosteroids contributes to worsening bone health. Despite advances in bone biology that shed some light on the pathogenesis of this bone loss, treatment options are nonspecific and tightly linked to treatments for other types of osteoporosis. Therefore, treatment should include calcium and vitamin D supplementation in all patients with chronic liver disease. Treatment with bisphosphonates should be considered, especially in patients receiving corticosteroids. This review focuses on the prevalence of this entity in liver disease, along with the available evidence on the pathogenesis of bone loss, the diagnostic steps required in all patients, and the therapeutic options available.

1375,Low copper diet as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease,"Copper is an essential element and a deficiency or excess of copper can be life threatening. Recent studies have shown that the change in copper metabolism is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light of these findings, many researchers have proposed preventive strategies to reduce the risk of AD. Since the general population comes into contact with copper primarily through dietary intake, i.e. 75% food and 25% drinking water, a low copper diet may reduce the risk of AD in people with altered copper metabolism. We propose that a diet-gene interaction is at the root of the ""copper phenotype"" of sporadic AD. Here, we describe the pathways that regulate copper homeostasis, the adverse sequelae associated with its dysregulation, the pathogenic mechanism of the AD copper phenotype, indications for a low copper diet, and future perspectives for developing this preventative strategy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Squitti, R.;Siotto, M.;Polimanti, R.",2014,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.02.031,0,0,

1379,Abnormal copper metabolism in Niemann-Pick disease type C mimicking Wilson's disease,"Background: Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare lysosomal storage disease in infants, adolescents and adults. Objective: We investigated a family of two siblings with adult-onset Niemann-Pick disease type C presenting with abnormal copper metabolism mimicking Wilson's disease. Methods: Case 1 was an unrelated 26-year-old Japanese man, who was recently referred to the hospital outpatient clinic for gait disturbance and intellectual impairment since age 20. Since her brother (case 2) was diagnosed with Wilson's disease, she was tentatively diagnosed as a heterozygous carrier of Wilson's disease. He presented with dementia, dysphagia, dystonia, ataxia and downward gaze palsy. Laboratory work showed mild liver dysfunction and moderate splenomegaly. Magnetic resonance images showed a thin corpus callosum and narrowed deep white matter. Case 2 was 35 years old and had developed psychiatric and motor symptoms since the age of 20. He had been treated for Wilson's disease for 11 years due to copper accumulation in his liver and abnormal copper metabolism. Despite chelation therapy and tube feeding with gastrostomy for one year, the symptoms gradually worsened. Molecular diagnosis was performed for Niemann-Pick disease type C. Results: Philippine staining in cultured skin fibroblasts of Case 1 was partially positive, and gene analysis showed that both siblings had compound heterozygosity for p.G992R and IVS6-3 C>G of NPC1 in exon 20. Administration of miglustat for 3 months partially ameliorated intellectual and motor dysfunctions. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis between Niemann-Pick disease type C and Wilson's disease is important for specific treatment.

1384,The copper chelator ATN-224 induces caspase-independent cell death in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,"Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic proteins are associated with defective caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, resulting in chemoresistance. We have previously shown that ATN-224, a copper chelator drug, induces cell death in Bcl-2-transfected murine thymic lymphoma cells. In the current study, we tested whether ATN-224 was effective in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells that increased anti-apoptotic proteins by translocation or amplification. We found that nanomolar concentrations of ATN-224 induced cell death in DLBCL cells regardless of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 status. ATN-224 treatment resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and induction of caspase-independent cell death. In addition, ATN-224 disrupted Mcl-1 and enhanced the effect of the BH3 mimetic ABT-263. These findings indicate that ATN-224 has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of DLBCL. Induction of caspase-independent cell death in apoptosis-resistant DLBCL would provide a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of resistant disease.

Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this article, we present a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease due to physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). Within 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, she developed an acute-onset illness characterized by persecutory delusions, fear, extreme alertness, and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, confusion, hallucinations, and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of symptoms, she was given tabulated penicillamine 250 mg/day initially, which was increased to 500 mg/day 3 days later. After increasing the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and he was hospitalized. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder due to Wilson's disease (F06.2) was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started and the dose of penicillamine was reduced when the symptoms disappeared.

1390,Evidence for synergistic effects of PRNP and ATP7B mutations in severe neuropsychiatric impairment,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD), a rare cause of neuropsychiatric deterioration, is associated with mutations in the ATP7B gene. Prion diseases are also rare causes of neuropsychiatric deterioration that may occur sporadically without an identifiable cause or be attributable to mutations in the PRNP gene. Case report: Here we describe a biological ""nature experiment"" of a patient presenting with severe neuropsychiatric regression and strong biochemical evidence of WD. Genetic analysis revealed it to be a compound heterozygous for two ATP7B sequence variants (c.2165dupT, p.Arg723Glufs*32; and c.4039G >A, p.Gly1347Ser), the first reported once before and the second new. . In addition, the patient was heterozygous for a PRNP variant, c.160G > A, p.Gly54Ser, which was reported only once in a neuropsychiatric patient, associated with a similarly severe clinical neuropsychiatric disease course and early age of onset, but no additional information on the ATP7B genotype. Of particular interest was the observation that the patient's older sister, who had the same ATP7B genotype and laboratory evidence for biochemical WD, but was clinically asymptomatic, lacked the PRNP variant allele. Conclusions: We suggest that synergy may occur between at least some allelic variants of ATP7B and PRNP, possibly through effects on cellular copper metabolism.

The traditional auxiliary liver transplantation for WD is orthotopic liver transplantation and heterotopic liver transplantation. But the traditional procedure could not avoid the problem of space, functional competition, hemodynamic variation. Here, we present a case of heterotopic living-donor liver transplantation (HALDLT) to treat WD. We changed the surgery to splenectomy, implanting a graft in the splenic fossa. The patient recovered after transplantation and was symptom-free during the 5-year follow-up. This modified process is safer and simpler. HALDLT may be an effective treatment for WD patients with splenomegaly.",,"Dou, K.;Wang, D.;Tao, K.;Yue, S.;Ti, Z.;Song, Z.;Li, L.;He, Y.;Hou, X.",2014,May-June,,0,0,
1394,Chelating polymeric beads as potential therapeutics for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a genetic disease caused by the malfunction of ATPase 7B, which leads to high copper accumulation in the organism and consequently toxic effects. We propose gentle therapy to remove excess copper content by oral administration of insoluble, non-absorbable polymer sorbents containing selective chelating groups for copper(II). Polymeric beads were investigated with chelating agents triethylenetetramine, N,N-di(2-pyridylmethyl)amine and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQB). In a preliminary copper uptake experiment, we found that 8HQB significantly reduced copper uptake (using copper-64 as the radio tracer) after oral administration in Wistar rats. We also measured organ radioactivity in rats to show that 8HQB radiolabelled with iodine-125 is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Absorption and blocking of copper uptake were also confirmed by small animal imaging (PET/CT) in mice. In a long-term experiment with Wistar rats fed a diet containing polymers, we found that there were no signs of polymer toxicity and that adding polymers to the diet led to a significant reduction in copper content in the kidneys and brains. and livers of rats. We show that polymers containing specific ligands could potentially be new therapeutics for Wilson's disease.

1398,Liver transplantation in neurological Wilson's disease: Is there an indication? a case report,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper overload. In this disease, insufficient hepatic excretion leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. Patients with WD may develop severe neurological symptoms, usually in the absence of associated liver damage: it is unclear whether liver transplantation (LT) can reverse neurological symptoms and LT is not currently recommended in this situation. We present a case in which neurological symptoms regressed in a patient affected by WD with extensive neurological involvement. A 19-year-old man with disabling neuropsychiatric symptoms from WD, including frontal ataxia, akinesia, dystonia, tremor, and behavioral disorders in the presence of preserved liver function (Model score for End Stage Liver Disease = 7; Child-Turcotte-Pugh score = A5) November LT was applied in 2009. During LT, encephalic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse neurodegenerative changes involving subtentorial and supratentorial structures; There was bilateral Kayser-Fleischer ring. Four years after LT, laboratory tests show normalized copper metabolism and excellent liver function test results. Encephalic MRI shows a significant improvement in already known signal changes in the nucleus thalamus and putamen, mesencephalon and pons. The Kayser-Fleischer ring has disappeared in the right eye, but a small remnant is still visible in the left eye. On neurological examination, all previous signs and symptoms are no longer present and behavioral disturbances are no longer present; psychosocial functions are fully restored. The present case provides some evidence that LT may be a viable therapeutic option for WD patients with significant neurological impairment, particularly those who are no longer responding to chelation therapy.

Methods: Questionnaire-based interviews (patient and relatives), neurological examinations, two-week prospective dream diary, video-polysomnography, transcranial sonography, MRI. Results: Four Wilson's disease cases with REM sleep behavior disorder were described; three had REM sleep behavior disorder as the first symptom. All showed mesencephalic tegmental/tectal sonographic hyperechogenicities and two presented ponto-mesencephalic tegmental MRI hyperintensities. Conclusion: This initial description of REM sleep behavior disorder in Wilson's disease in the literature documents REM sleep behavior disorder as a possible symptom of Wilson's disease and adds further evidence for the parallelism of Parkinson's disease with Wilson's disease in phenotype and brainstem topography. will be studied more. REM sleep behavior disorder has prognostic significance for neurodegeneration in α-synucleinopathies. The benefit of early diagnosis and treatment in Wilson's disease is already well established.

1400,Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable congenital metabolic disorders,"Possible organic causes of psychiatric symptoms may be overlooked in the clinical setting. In some cases, it is important to raise awareness among psychiatry and neurologic professionals of some inborn errors of metabolism, as disease-specific treatments are available that can, for example, treat underlying metabolic causes. The following article describes the basic pathophysiology, clinical and neurological features, and current diagnostic procedures for six treatable metabolic diseases associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms: Wilson's disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, porphyria, homocysteinemia, urea cycle disorders, and Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). NP-C is taken as a particularly relevant example because while it has traditionally been considered a condition that presents with severe neurological and systemic manifestations in children, an increasing number of patients with the adolescent or adult-onset form are being identified. is often associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. A significant proportion of adult-onset cases have been reported where NP-C is mistakenly diagnosed and treated as a psychiatric condition, usually based on patients' first presentation with psychotic or schizophrenia-like symptoms. Organic causes of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis should be considered in patients with atypical symptoms and/or refractory to standard therapy. The development of convenient and affordable biochemical screening and/or diagnostic methods, as well as improved frameworks for additional multidisciplinary diagnostic studies in patients with suspected organic disease, has provided new ways to narrow differential diagnoses.

1406,Copper Chelaters: Chemical Properties and Biomedical Applications,"Copper is found in different concentrations and chemical forms in the earth's crust, on the surface and in deep water, and even in trace amounts in the atmosphere itself. Copper is one of the first metals used by humans with the first artifacts dating back 10,000 years. Currently, world refined copper production exceeds 16,000 tons/year. Copper is an essential microelement for life mainly due to its red-ox properties that make it an essential cofactor for many enzymes such as cytochrome-c oxidase and superoxide dismutase. In some animal species (eg octopus, snail, spider, oyster) copper-hemocyanins also act as oxygen carriers instead of hemoglobin. However, these red-ox properties also make the Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> pair a formidable catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species when excess copper is present. in the body or tissues. In cases of copper overload or intoxication, the preferred treatment is chelation therapy. Different molecules are currently in clinical use as chelators or in study or clinical trials. It is worth noting that chelation therapy is also recommended to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases or cardiovascular disorders. In this review, after a brief description of copper homeostasis and some cases of dyshomeostasis, the main (used or potential) chelators are described; Their properties in solution are discussed, even with regard to the presence of metal or ligand competitors under physiological conditions. Legislation of the most important Western countries regarding both the use of chelating agents and the limits of copper in foods, drugs and cosmetics is also outlined.

1407,Comparison of predictors of mortality and Wilson's disease-specific prognostic indices in children with acute liver failure associated with Wilson's disease.,"Introduction and Aims: Acute liver failure (ALF) associated with Wilson's disease (WD) affects children more than adults. The determinants of mortality and outcome in patients without encephalopathy are unclear. We investigated the prognostic factors and the ability of various models, including the end-stage liver disease (MELD) model, to predict mortality among children with WH and ALF. Methods: We analyzed admission characteristics in 61 children younger than 18 years of age with WD and ALF. In univariate Cox regression analysis, factors associated with mortality were analyzed with a forward stepwise Cox hazards regression. Prognostic models such as the Nazer model, the revised Kings College Model, and the pediatric end-stage liver disease/model for the end-stage liver disease (PELD/MELD) score were compared. Results: Of 145 children with WD less than 18 years of age, 61 experienced ALF, and 33 (54%) of these, 22/27 (81.5%) with encephalopathy and 11/34 (32.4%) without encephalopathy ) died. The mean age of children with ALF was 9.7, 38 (62.3%) were male. Prognostic factors important for mortality included encephalopathy, international normalized ratio, total proteins, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and white blood cell count. Advanced progressive Cox proportional hazards regression identified encephalopathy (hazard ratio 2.88; CI 1.1-7.4) and total bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.05; CI: 1.02-1.09) as predictors of outcome. The Nazer index, the revised King's College Criteria, and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of PELD/MELD were 0.74, 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Results: Mortality in children with WD and ALF was 54%, 81.5% with encephalopathy and 32.4% without encephalopathy. Prognostic models are comparable to the MELD/PELD score, Nazer index, and Kings College Criteria, with an AUC of 0.74-0.76.

Trilineage dysplasia was detected in the bone marrow aspiration performed to evaluate the cause of bicytopenia. By correlating the clinical condition with bone marrow and biochemical parameters, copper deficiency was suspected and he was given a treatment trial, after which the hematological parameters improved. This case highlights hypocupresemia as a reversible cause of bone marrow dysplasia in chelated Wilson's disease, where serum copper levels are not useful in the diagnosis. We also believe that monitoring blood counts in patients undergoing copper chelation may provide a clue to impending copper deficiency.

1409,Determination of serum metallothionein (MT)1/2 concentration in patients with Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease,"We have developed an easy and specific enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the simultaneous detection of serum metallotinein-1 (MT-1) and 2 (MT-2) in both humans and experimental animals. A competitive ELISA was established using a specific polyclonal antibody against rat MT-2. The antibody used for this ELISA exhibited the same cross-reactivity as MT in humans and experimental animals. The NH<inf>2</inf> terminal peptide of MT containing acetylated methionine has been shown to be the epitope of this antibody. The reactivity of this ELISA system with liver, kidney, and brain was significantly lower in MT1/2 knockout mice, but was normal in an MT-3 knockout mouse. The lowest detection limit of this ELISA was 0.6ng/ml, and the added MT-1 was fully recovered from the plasma. We investigated and found that the normal range of MT1/2 (25-75% tile) in 200 healthy human serums. 27-48. ng/ml and this was compared with serum levels in various liver diseases. Serum MT1/2 levels in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients were significantly lower than in healthy controls as well as other liver diseases. In cases of chronic hepatitis, MT1/I2 levels gradually increased, after which the disease progressed to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In particular, we found significantly higher plasma levels of MT1/2 in patients with Wilson's disease, levels very similar to those in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat (model animal for Wilson's disease). Also, a significantly higher MT1/2 level was found in patients with Menkes disease, an inborn error of copper metabolism, such as Wilson's disease.

Various mutations of ATP7B cause Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disease that can be treated pharmacologically. Diagnosis and prompt diagnosis are crucial because Wilson's disease is fatal if left untreated. In this review, I summarize the pathogenesis and treatment of Wilson's disease.

1411,Treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate affects copper metabolism and improves but does not normalize parameters of antioxidant capacity in Wilson's disease.,"Copper accumulation in tissues due to biallelic pathogenic mutation of the gene: ATP7B results in a clinical phenotype known as Wilson's disease (WD). Deviations in copper homeostasis can create favorable conditions for superoxide-producing redox cycling and oxidative tissue damage. The drugs used in the treatment of WD aim to remove the accumulated copper and normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood. In this study, the effect of decoppering on copper metabolism and systemic antioxidant capacity parameters was analyzed. Patients with untreated WD (TNWD) (n = 33), those treated with anti-copper drugs (TWD) (n = 99), and healthy controls (n = 99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients were characterized by decreased copper metabolism parameters, as well as decreased total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) level, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and S-transferase glutathione compared to controls. TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolism parameters, higher total AOP, and higher GSH levels than TWD patients; however, no difference was observed between these two patient groups in terms of other antioxidant capacity parameters. Patients treated with d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate did not differ in parameters of copper metabolism or antioxidant capacity, except for GPx, which was lower in those treated with d-penicillamine. These data show that anti-copper therapy affects copper metabolism as well as improves, but does not normalize, the natural antioxidant capacity in patients with WD. We propose to conduct studies aiming to evaluate the usefulness of antioxidants in addition to selenium as a complementary therapy in WD.

1412,Reversible lesions of the brain parenchyma in Wilson's disease confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging: Early administration of chelation therapy can reduce brain damage.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the resolution of brain lesions using magnetic resonance imaging during long-term chelating therapy in patients with Wilson's disease and to evaluate the possible significance of the time delay between the first symptoms of the disease and the initiation of this therapy. . The first magnetic resonance examination was performed in 37 patients with cerebellar, parkinsonian and dystonic presentations with proven neurological form of Wilson's disease. 14 patients underwent magnetic resonance reexamination after 5.7 +/- 1.3 years. The patients were divided into the following groups: group A, in which chelation therapy was initiated <24 months after first symptoms, and group B, where treatment started >= 24 months after first symptoms. Symmetry of lesions was seen in 100% of patients. There was a significant difference in the complete resolution of brainstem and putaminal lesions between groups A and B (P = 0.005 and P = 0.024, respectively). If the correct diagnosis and adequate treatment is not made 24 months after the onset of symptoms, irreversible lesions in the brain parenchyma can be expected. Signal abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging may therefore represent, at least in the early stages, reversible myelinolysis or cytotoxic edema associated with copper toxicity.

1415,"D-Penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa, involvement of the glans penis","Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is an unusual perforating disorder characterized by the protrusion of altered elastic fibers from the epidermis. Clinically, it presents as keratotic papules, most commonly involving the sides of the neck and back, with a tendency to serpiginous or annular distribution. However, penile involvement has been rarely reported. We present a case of EPS with neck, armpit and glans involvement in a 42-year-old male patient who received long-term d-penicillamine therapy for Wilson's disease. Skin biopsy revealed penetrating ducts containing multiple modified elastic fibers with a characteristic ""blackberry brush"" or ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance, as indicated by an elastin patch. The latter is thought to be pathognomonic for penicillamine-induced degenerative elastosis. These degenerative changes in the glans penis have rarely been described in the literature.

Results: Psychiatric symptoms occur before, during or after the diagnosis and treatment of WD. 30-40% of the patients had psychiatric symptoms at the time of diagnosis and 20% had gone to a psychiatrist before the diagnosis of WD. When psychiatric symptoms preceded neurological or hepatic involvement, the mean time between psychiatric symptoms and diagnosis of WD was 864.3 days. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in WD patients varies wildly (major depressive disorder, 4-47%; psychosis, 1.4-11.3%). Certain gene mutations of ATP7B may be associated with certain personality traits. Conclusions: Psychiatric manifestations represent an important part of the clinical presentation of WD and can occur at any point in the course of the disease.

1421,Drug elimination modes and bioactive metabolites,"Drug elimination is the removal of the active drug from the body. Metabolism largely takes place in the liver and produces water-soluble metabolites that can be excreted in the bile or urine. Metabolism can also produce active or toxic metabolites from an inactive prodrug or a pharmacologically active drug. Most volatile anesthetics are excreted unchanged through the lungs. Drug elimination can be affected by factors such as first pass metabolism, genetic variants, and various disease processes. Knowledge of these processes will allow better estimation of pharmacokinetics in practice. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Chillistone, S.;Hardman, J.

1423,Design of intrahepatocyte copper(I) chelators as drug candidates for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13. Since the corresponding ATPase is responsible for copper (Cu) distribution and excretion in the liver, its malfunction leads to Cu overload. This short review considers treatments for this rare disease aimed at reducing Cu toxicity and therefore relying on chelation therapy. First, the drugs used since the 1950s are described, and then a new approach developed in our laboratory is presented. Since the main organ of Cu distribution in the body is the liver, we targeted the intracellular Cu pool in hepatocytes. This Cu pool is in the +1 oxidation state and therefore soft sulfur ligands were developed inspired by the binding sites found in metallothioneins. Targeting hepatocytes through functionalization with ligands of the asialoglycoprotein receptor led to their cellular assembly and intracellular Cu chelation.

1424,Treatment of Wilson's disease motor complications with deep brain stimulation,"significant proportion of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) experience functionally disabling neurological symptoms. The most common neurological problems in advanced WD are dystonia and tremor. Medically resistant idiopathic dystonia and essential tremor (ET) have been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), functional surgical therapy targeting the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) or the ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus. Although the pathophysiology of tremor is different in WD and ET, current experience supports DBS targeting Vim for WD patients. WD-related dystonia is classified as secondary dystonia, and GPi stimulation has produced mixed results in these patients. The presence of structural changes in the basal ganglia may limit the therapeutic success of DBS for WD dystonia compared with idiopathic dystonia. Despite these limitations, DBS in WD may be an effective approach in the treatment of medically refractory residual neurologic symptoms in carefully selected patients.

1429,Wilson's disease. [Check],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease in which copper accumulates in tissues, especially in the liver and brain. The genetic defect affects the P-type ATPase gene (ATP7B). More than 500 mutations have been identified that cause Wilson's disease. The most common mutation in Central Europe is related to H1069Q. Symptoms of Wilson's disease include hepatic or neurological conditions. The liver condition manifests as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Neurological conditions are most commonly manifested as motor disturbances (tremors, speech and writing disorders) after the age of 20, which can result in severe extrapyramidal syndrome with rigidity, dysarthria and muscle spasms. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory evaluations (neurological signs, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, high Cu volumes in urine, Kayser-Fleischer ring). Diagnosis is confirmed by high Cu level in liver tissue or genetic evidence. Untreated Wilson's disease causes death of the patient. If properly treated, the survival rate approaches the survival rate of the common population. Treatment consists of removing copper from the body using chelating agents (Penicillamine, Trientine) excreted in the urine, or limiting intestinal copper absorption and reducing the toxicity of copper (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). Penicillamine or zinc is used in the Czech Republic. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis. In the family, all siblings of the affected individual must be screened to treat any asymptomatic subject.",,"Marecek, Z.;Bruha, R.",2014,,,0,0,
1430,Effect of molecular adsorbents on circulatory system therapy in children with acute liver failure caused by Wilson's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Since fulminant Wilson's disease (WD) has an extremely poor prognosis, the use of liver support that can bridge patients to liver transplantation is life-saving. We report the experience of albumin dialysis in children with WD-induced acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: Chart review of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated with molecular adsorbents and recirculation system. During the Molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) sessions, copper levels in the blood and in the circuit were measured. Clinical and biological evaluations were reported after the MARS session. RESULTS: Four children with a mean age of 12.3 years were treated from 2004 to 2009 for severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, hemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All of the children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were conducted over an average of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good except for one child who had bleeding due to vascular injury after insertion of the dialysis catheter. A neurological improvement or stabilization was noted in all children, with an improvement in Fisher index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper and reduce serum copper levels by an average of 28%, and bilirubin and creatinine levels by >25%. All children subsequently underwent a liver transplant and had a good outcome without injury. RESULTS: MARS can remove copper and stabilize children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.

1433,Effect of zinc and D-penicillamine in a stable human hepatoma ATP7B knockout cell line,"Mutations in the copper (Cu) transporter gene ATP7B, the primary cause of Wilson's disease (WD), result in elevated liver Cu and death of hepatocytes. Cu chelators and zinc salts are the two most important drugs used in the treatment of WD patients; however, the molecular mechanisms of drugs related to ATP7B expression have not been determined. A targeted knockout of ATP7B (KO) has been established in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, the most widely used for molecular studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease. KO cells showed similar growth, Cu uptake, release and gene expression compared to parent cells. However, morphological changes, oxidative stress, apoptosis and loss of viability were observed in the presence of Cu. Metallothionein (MT1X) induction was significantly reduced in KO cells after Cu exposure. Following zinc treatment, MT1X expression was strongly induced and a high percentage of KO cells were rescued from Cu-induced toxicity. D-penicillamine treatment had little effect on the viability of KO cells, while the parent cell line showed significant improvement. The combined treatment showed a highly synergistic effect in KO cells. The data show that zinc has a previously unrecognized effect on the viability of ATP7B-deficient hepatocytes due to an induction of high MT1X expression compensating for low gene expression after Cu exposure. A combination therapy targeting simultaneously MT1X induction and Cu chelation improves overall survival of hepatocytes for the most efficient treatment of patients with WD.

Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate therapy for Chinese children with pre-symptomatic WD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed pre-symptomatic children receiving zinc gluconate at a single Chinese center specializing in pediatric hepatology. Short-term follow-up data on safety and efficacy are presented and the effects of different zinc dosages are compared. Results: Thirty children (21 boys) aged 2.7 to 16.8 years were followed up to 4.4 years; 26 (87%) children had abnormal ALT at baseline. Most patients (73%) received a higher dose than the currently recommended dose of elemental zinc. Zinc gluconate significantly decreased mean ALT (p<0.0001), AST (p<0.0001), GGT (p<0.0001) levels after 1 month and urinary copper excretion after 6 months (p<0.0054) . Mean direct bilirubin levels decreased significantly at 1 month (p = 0.0175), 3 months (p = 0.0010), and 6 months (p = 0.0036). Serum zinc levels increased gradually and reached a significantly higher level after 6 months (p<0.0026), reflecting good adherence to treatment. Complete blood count parameters did not change throughout the analysis period. 8 children experienced mild and transient gastrointestinal side effects. Higher zinc dose did not affect treatment response and was not associated with different or increased side effects compared to conventional zinc dose. Conclusion: In our cohort, zinc gluconate therapy was effective for Chinese children with pre-symptomatic WD, and the higher initial elemental zinc dose had the same efficacy as the conventional dose. © 2014 Abuduxikuer, Wang.",,"Abuduxikuer, K.;Wang, J.

If the patient is left undiagnosed and untreated, the outcome of the disease can be fatal. Lifelong therapy ensures the survival of normal WD patients. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Purpose: To evaluate the clinical course and long-term outcomes of WD patients. Materials and methods: 65 patients with WD (22 females and 43 males) with a mean age of 37 (range, 18-65 years) were analyzed between January 2003 and December 2013. Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier method and Logit model were used. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (43.08%) had liver disease only, thirty-two (49.23%) - hepatic and neurologic presentation, three - neurological features without any signs of liver damage. There were also two asymptomatic patients. The following hepatic forms have been proven: steatosis (6.6%), hepatitis (41.7%) and cirrhosis (51.7% of patients). There was an average of 39 months diagnosis delay. At the end of the study, 74.2% of the patients with cirrhosis were in Child A stage. Two patients developed acute hepatic failure after discontinuation of treatment. We observed hepatocellular carcinoma in one cirrhotic patient. Six patients with cirrhosis of the liver in juvenile stage C had fatal outcomes at the time of observation. Three of them had concomitant diseases - HBV and autoimmune cirrhosis. Kayser-Fleischer ring was detected in 35.4% of the patients, being more common in those presenting with neurological symptoms. The cumulative survival rate of people with WD after the first onset of symptoms increased to 76.38% by the end of 15 years and to 77.29% after diagnosis. The effect of delay in diagnosis of WD on overall survival was estimated. With each year of delay in diagnosis, the probability of death increased by about 10%. Almost all patients had a beneficial effect of D-penicillamine (Dp) therapy. No complications were observed in pregnancies with stable disease and normal delivery.

1439,Improvement in severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient receiving copper chelation therapy,"Introduction: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic, debilitating and progressive disease that often leads to premature death due to right ventricular (RV) failure. The pathobiology of severe PAH is based on the formation of angioproliferative lung lesions leading to blood flow obstruction. Recent experimental studies show that copper is required for the formation of lesions and that copper chelation can prevent and even reverse lesions. Tetrathiomolybdate is a highly effective copper chelator used to treat Wilson's disease and is used to treat treatment-resistant malignancies. Case report: Here we present our experience of using tetrathiomolybdate (ATN-224) for copper chelation in a patient diagnosed with idiopathic PAH 3 years ago. A 59-year-old female patient with exertional dyspnea and prominent symptoms related to fatigue (New York Association Class III) despite treatment with amlodipine, bosentan and sildenafil was evaluated with a 6-minute walk test (417 m) and cardiac catheterization (systolic and mean). 58/24 and 32 mmHg pulmonary artery pressure and 4.6 wood units pulmonary vascular resistance), Doppler echocardiogram (showing 73 mmHg systolic pulmonary artery pressure) and cardiac magnetic resonance (RV ejection fraction 48% and stroke volume 75 ml). ATN-224 (150 mg twice daily dose) was then started and continued for 16 days before stopping due to hypotension. No additional changes were made in the patient's treatment. A repeat evaluation showed improvement in NYHA class (-1 class), improvement in 6-minute walk test (+83 m), reduction in Doppler estimated systolic pulmonary pressure (-30 mmHg), and increase in RV ejection fraction (+11%). ) and stroke volume (+15 ml). Discussion: PAH is a progressive disease and current PAH treatments have minimal effects on pulmonary artery pressure and RV ejection fraction or stroke volume, and therefore it is thought to slow disease progression rather than alter the course of the disease. The present case shows an unexpected change in the natural history of the disease that appears to be associated with the initiation of copper chelation therapy. While ATN-224 was poorly tolerated at the dose used (systemic blood pressure reduction), we suspect that the short duration of treatment with ATN-224 led to significant ""de-modeling"" of pulmonary vascular lesions, as seen in the experimental animal. PAH model. The outcome of this single case justifies, in our view, further studies with copper chelation in PAH.",,"Grinnan, D.;Abbate, A.;Farr, G.;Bogaard, H. J.;Voelkel, N. F.",2014,,,0,0,

Here we describe a 15-year-old Caucasian boy with neurological and hepatic-onset Wilson's Disease (WD) who developed keratoticgranulomatous annular popular cutaneous lesions on the nape and right arm at 3 years of penicillamine therapy. Methods: A diagnosis of WD was made at the age of 12 because of the presence of irregular proximal tremor, dysarthria, micrographia, unstable mood, and inappropriate behavior. The patient also showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with mild hypertransaminasemia. Diagnosis was based on low ceruloplasmin serum levels, high 24-hour urine copper values, high liver copper concentration, and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. Molecular analysis showed the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene. Penicillamine treatment was started with a positive response to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Liver function tests (LFTs) continued normally. The diagnosis of EPS was made according to the lesion characteristics and findings of the skin biopsy. Results: Topical steroid therapy was tried and it did not help. Penicillamine therapy was suspended and replaced with zinc acetate 3 months after the onset of EPS, as the skin lesions worsened with a significant visual impact. In the following months, after three years of zinc monotherapy, the cutaneous lesions remained unchanged with no histological signs of progression, while the general clinical status and LFTs remained normal. Conclusions: Although penicillamine is an effective and generally safe drug for patients with WD, the risk of some serious cutaneous and non-cutaneous adverse events may suggest more extensive use of zinc monotherapy as maintenance therapy in patients with WD.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Leone, F.;Tufano, M.;Vajro, P.;Spagnuolo, M.

Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a treatable autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and is characterized by variable manifestations due to copper deposition in the liver, brain cornea, and other tissues. Although curable, deaths are not uncommon in patients with WD. Methods: The cause of death was investigated in 44 patients diagnosed with WD by detailed clinical evaluation of the cornea Kayser-Fleischer ring and biochemical studies (decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper and high urinary copper) and neuroimaging. Results: A total of 6 patients (13.6%) died during the observation period. The main cause of death was delay in diagnosis. The mean delay in diagnosis was 18.9 months in all patients and 25.4 months in those who died. Of the 6 patients who died, 5 had a dystonic presentation and one had a parkinsonian presentation. Five of the 6 patients were young (under 18 years old) and one was an adult. Four out of 6 patients showed poor compliance with treatment (zinc and penicillamine) as well as regular follow-ups.

Serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests and other routine laboratory tests. Slit lamp examination for Kayser Fleisher rings and 24-hour urine for copper were performed before and after penicillamine loading. Most patients also underwent percutaneous liver biopsy. Results The most prominent hepatic presentation was jaundice and Kayser Flisher rings. The most important laboratory findings were copper excretion and a decrease in the mean ceruloplasmin concentration (13.8 +/- 2.38 mg/dl) below 20 ug/dl after challenge with depensilamine (1546.57 +/- 99.55 cups/Dl). After treatment, there was a significant increase in albumin and a significant improvement in prothrombin time.

1443,A phase I pharmacokinetic profile study in patients receiving trientine dihydrochloride for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Background and purpose: Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is a common treatment for Wilson's disease, but data on pharmacokinetics are limited to healthy volunteers. The aim of the study was to determine the PK parameters assumed to represent steady state in Wilson's patients treated with trientine. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01874028 Patients and methods: Twenty subjects (9 males, 4 children, mean age 39.3 years [12-61]) with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease were exposed to trientine after oral dosing at the standard dose for this subject. 0.5 blood was taken; one; 1.5; 2nd; 3; 4; 6; 8 and 12 hours after dosing. Trientine concentration in plasma samples was measured by LC-MS/MS after protein precipitation extraction in the calibration range of 20-2000 ng/mL. There was some variation in exposure, with a range of 10-fold in Cmax and 13.8-fold in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly lower when dose normalized for PK parameters (6.7-fold range in Cmax/D and 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). Terminal half-life where defined was largely consistent between subjects (range 2.33-6.99 hours). AUC0-8 could be calculated in 14 of 20 subjects, but since dosing occurs at pharmacokinetic steady state, AUC0-t represents exposure during the dosing interval. There was no significant difference in PK parameters between adult subjects (n=16) and children (n=4). The Cmax range was 508-3100 ng/mL in adults and 309-1940 ng/mL in children - equivalent ranges for AUC0-t were 1240-17100 ng.hr/mL and 1500 8060 ng.hr/mL, respectively. When PK parameters were normalized for the given dose, Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children were kept within the ranges for adult subjects.

1444,Sex differences in liver SAM:SAH ratios and gene transcript levels after pre- and postnatal choline supplementation and copper chelation therapy in an animal model of Wilson disease,"Background. Methionine metabolism, central to DNA methylation reactions, may provide epigenetic regulation of genes involved in liver injury in Wilson's disease (WD). We hypothesized that perinatal maternal treatment with choline could alter the sex-specific response to penicillamine in offspring in the tx-j model of WD. Methods Control (choline 8 mmol/Kg) or choline-supplemented (36 mmol/Kg) diets were started in wild-type and tx-j female mice 2 weeks before mating and continued until the pups were 24 weeks old. A tx-j subgroup of both sexes received oral penicillamine with or without a choline-fortified diet at 12 to 24 weeks of age. Results. The decreased S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio decreased an index of DNA methylation capacity in each sex of the offspring tx-j mice, consistent with the known downregulation of SAH hydrolase levels in this mouse model WD (Table 1). The SAM:SAH ratio was higher in male tx-j mice versus untreated female mice (p<0.05).

1445,No increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease during long-term follow-up,"Background and objectives: Although cirrhosis of the liver is a common complication in Wilson's disease (WD), data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in these patients are scarce. Here we report the risk of HCC in a well-defined cohort with WD with conclusive long-term follow-up (FU) and correlate the risk of HCC with the efficacy of copper removal therapy and severity of liver disease. Methods: All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of WD (Leipzig score >= 4) at three Dutch university referral hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. End of FU was defined as date of HCC diagnosis, liver transplant death, or most recent hospital visit. Results: A total of 130 patients with WD were followed during a mean of 15 years of FU (range 0.1-51.2). The total FU year was 2336. The median age at diagnosis was 16 (range 0-43). The presentation was asymptomatic, hepatic only, neurologic, combined, and unknown in 4%, 55%, 9%, 30%, and 2% of cases, respectively. The median Leipzig score was 8 points (4-13 points). At baseline, 74 patients had cirrhosis (57% of the total: 64% compensated and 36% decompensated). At the end of FU, liver disease severity had improved, stabilized, or worsened in 20%, 46%, and 24% of all cases, respectively. Twenty-eight patients underwent liver transplantation. Five patients died from complications of liver disease, and two deaths were related to liver transplants. In patients treated for at least one year (n=111), zinc, penicillamine or trientine (alone, sequentially or in combination) was prescribed in 92%, 69%, and 14% of patients, respectively. At the end of FU, decoppering efficacy was excellent in 34% of patients, less than 42%, based on serum ceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration (target: <10 mg/dL) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (target: <100 mg/24 hours). moderate, bad in 13%, and unknown in 11%. HCC developed in two patients. The first patient was a 39-year-old man who presented with decompensated cirrhosis in combination with HCC. The second patient was a 63-year-old woman with definitive WD, diagnosed 50 years ago. Despite excellent copper removal at the end of FU, it progressed to decompensated cirrhosis, where HCC developed. No additional risk factors for liver disease were present in either patient. The estimated annual risk of HCC for all patients was 0.09% (95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.28). Subgroup analysis in cirrhotic patients revealed an annual risk of HCC of 0.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.45). Conclusion: Even in the case of cirrhosis in Wilson's disease, the risk of HCC is low and does not seem to be associated with decoppering efficiency. Our data does not support regular HCC surveillance at WD.",,"Van Meer, S.;De Man, R. A.;Van Den Berg, A. P.;Houwen, R.;Linn, F.;Siersema, P. D.;Van Erpecum, K.

1446,Neuropsychiatric interface in a depressed patient,"Psychiatric symptoms are significantly predominant at onset in most patients with Wilson's disease (WD). About half of the patients are hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital before the diagnosis of WD. Objective/Aim: To report a case of WD presenting with unresponsive depression. Methodology: A 31-year-old patient presented with complaints of increasing withdrawn behavior for 1 year, irritability, sadness in mood, and slowness in movements. He was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder by a private psychiatrist. Antidepressants were started and received 10 Electro Convulsive Treatments. However, he did not see any improvement and stopped treatment due to side effects. The patient presented to KJSH 6 months later due to worsening symptoms. On questioning, tremors, slurred speech, and backward bending of the body when sitting for several months. Neurological examination revealed vivid deep tendon reflexes. In MSE, the patient had retarded psychomotor activity and grimacing with facial movements. The mood was sad with limited affect. Ideas of helplessness, despair, and death wish were expressed. Calcification and gliosis in bilateral basal ganglia were seen on MRI. Keyser Fleischer ring is seen on ophthalmologic examination. Studies revealed elevated liver enzymes and high urinary Cu. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and was started on Tab. Penicillamine. Discussion: Although WD is rare, it often presents with psychiatric symptoms. Depression is extremely common in WD patients and affects 30-60% of them. Mood disorder shows limited response to antidepressants, while chelating substance use leads to normalization of mood and improvement in non-psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Psychiatrists should be aware of the psychiatric symptoms of WD. A Wilson disease differential may be considered if the patient shows poor response or hypersensitivity to psychotropic drugs. Comprehensive management of WD requires a consultation link in multiple specialties such as neurology, ophthalmology.",,"Dere, S. S.;Shah, B.;Jadhav, B.;Dhavale, H.",2014,January,,0,0,
1447,Wilson's disease: Catatonia as the sole symptom,"Introduction: Catatonia is a clinical picture with various causes ranging from infectious to metabolic causes. Wilson's disease is one of the known causes of catatonia, but catatonia has been reported as a rare presentation (0.01%) of Wilson's disease. Here, we present a case of Wilson's disease presenting as catatonia as the sole finding. Case Report: Ms. S, a 20-year-old, young, unmarried Muslim woman presented with a history suggestive of acute onset of 5-month-old catatonia (mutism, stupor, ambiance, waxy flexibility, and rigidity). The patient had no past history of psychiatric illness. An older brother and two older sisters with a family history of suicide had similar presentations who died of illness at 7 months of age. The patient did not respond to a 3-day trial of intravenous lorazepam and 10 modified electroconvulsive treatments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple hyperintensities in the brain, inner capsule and basal ganglia. Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen was normal. Biochemical studies showed an increase in urinary copper, a decrease in serum copper, and a decrease in blood ceruloplasmin. The slit lamp examination was unremarkable, and the neuropsychiatric examination revealed a catatonic state without obvious cardinal neurological signs of Wilson's disease. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and the patient improved with penicillamine, zinc sulfate, and lorazepam. Conclusions: Wilson's disease should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis in young adults presenting with catatonia.",,"Singh, A. P.;Kukreti, A. K. P.;Jhirwal, O.",2014,January,,0,0,
1448,Metal chelating pseudopeptides and their potential medical applications,"Wilson's disease (WH) is one of the major genetic disorders of copper (Cu) metabolism in humans. In this rare disease, the ATPase responsible for excessive Cu excretion from liver cells, ATP7B, is defective and, as a result, toxic Cu accumulates in the liver [1]. To treat WD, we propose innovative Cu chelators with the following properties: (i) they show a high affinity for Cu(I), the oxidation state of excess intracellular Cu (ii) they are selective for Cu(I). They are water-soluble relative to potentially competing endogenous metals such as Zn(II) and (iii). Mimics of binding sites found in proteins involved in Cu homeostasis are good candidates that meet all these expectations. Therefore, pseudopeptides are designed to mimic Cu(I) coordination by metal-retaining proteins such as metallothioneins. They are constructed as a tripod anchor from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and functionalized with the three amino acids cysteine or D-Penicillamine [2, 3]. The C<inf>3</inf>-symmetrical non-biological scaffold acts as a platform orienting the three binding arms in the same direction to coordinate the Cu(I) ion. To promote intracellular Cu chelation and internalization in hepatocytes, these sulfur ligands were functionalized with sugar units to target liver cells via asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-R). The resulting glycoconjugates were shown to release high-affinity Cu chelating agents in hepatic cells. This confirms that the use of intracellular Cu(I) chelators is very promising to treat Cu overload in WD [4]. (Figure presented) .",,"Jullien, A.

1449,Possible effects of copper chelation on iron homeostasis in Wilson's disease patients. Effect of penicillamine on ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity,"Introduction: Ceruloplasmin (Cp) belongs to the multi-copper ferroxidase protein family. It plays a role in the Fe loading of serum transferrin. Defective copper loading into apo-ceruloplasmin (apo-Cp) may result from mutations in the ATP7B gene that characterizes Wilson's disease (WD). Patients with WD are treated with copper chelators such as penicillamine (PA). As a result, it disrupts iron homeostasis. Here we investigate the in vitro effect of Cu and Cu-PA on HepG2 viability (MTT test), ferroxidase activity of Cp (pPD oxidase test), and expression of Cp, ferritin and transferrin (Western blot). In addition, we examine the activity of serum Cp ferroxidase activity in 5 PA-treated WD patients who are homozygous for a mutation in the WND gene. Results and conclusions: In vitro: Cu reduced the viability of HepG2 cells (50%), co-treatment with Cu-PA significantly altered cell morphology, further reduced cell viability (70%) and caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Cp expression in HepG2 cells increased with Cu, decreased with PA, and did not change with Cu-PA. Ferritin expression in HepG2 cells decreased with Cu, PA and Cu-PA treated cells Transferrin expression shows qualitative decline in PA and Cu-PA treated cells In Vivo: Serum Cp ferroxidase activity (0.007-0.01 units) in all patients very low serum Cp ferroxidase activity (0.007-0.01 units). control (0.022-0.027 units). While the transferrin level was within the normal range, a slight increase was detected in 2 patients. Cp Ferroxidase activity was significantly decreased in both HepG2 cells and serum of WD patients. Suggested survival therapy with Cu chelators affects the incorporation of Fe into transferrin and may result in accumulation of Fe in the liver. The meaning of our findings requires reevaluation of WD patients treated with PA for iron complications.",,"Usta, J.;Majarian, T.;El-Rifai, O.;Barada, K.",2014,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12919,0,0,
1450,Symptomatic copper deficiency in Wilson's disease treated with zinc sulfate,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by excess copper, which leads to copper deposition and requires lifelong copper removal therapy. However, overtreatment with anti-copper agents can cause copper deficiency, which can present with neurological and haematological symptoms. We present a patient with WD who had copper deficiency during zinc sulfate therapy. Case report: A 37-year-old woman who was diagnosed with presymptomatic WD in 1998 was admitted to our clinic with the complaint of paresthesia in her fingers and toes for 3 months in 2013 with zinc sulfate treatment. Neurological examination was normal. He had leukopenia (WBC 2.9 x 10<sup>9</sup>L, normal range 4.5-10.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Serum ceruloplasmin 0.92 mg/dl (normal range 25-45), copper serum concentration < 5 lg/dl (normal range 70-140), urinary copper excretion 11 lg/24 hours (normal range 0-50) were significantly decreased. MRI of the cervical spine showed a linearly increased T2 signal lesion in the posterior column of the cervical cord. Somatosensory evoked potentials showed impaired conduction in the dorsal colon. Electromyography did not show neuropathy. Vitamin B12 level was within the normal range. Liver function tests were normal. Zinc sulfate was withdrawn. The leukopenia resolved completely within 1 month. After 6 months, serum ceruloplasmin (5 mg/dl) and serum copper concentration (20 lg/dl) were higher than in previous tests. Urinary copper excretion was still low (12.5 lg/24 hours). MRI of the cervical spine after 6 months shows marked improvement. Nine months after the anti-copper treatment was interrupted, d-penicillamine was started instead of zinc sulfate. Conclusion: Copper deficiency as a result of anti-copper therapy may cause neurological and hematological findings. Treatment should be monitored regularly.",,"Dziezyc, K.;Sobanska, A.;Litwin, T.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowska, A.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-014-7337-4,0,0,
1451,Neuro-Wilson's disease: About seven cases and a review of the literature,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper overlap with neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms.

Methods: We present seven cases collected in the department of neurology MUB Sahloul Sousse. All patients had neurological findings with or without extraneurological symptoms. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made based on clinical, biological and radiological results. Results: Seven patients, two boys and five girls. The mean age is 25.5 and the endpoint ranges from 14 to 48. Neurological findings worsened in six patients, and the most common symptom was tremor. One patient had cerebellor ataxia and the other had seizures. Three patients had an autosomal recessive familial form. Kayseri Flecher's ring was found in one patient. Cupric balance was impaired in all patients, including an associated hemochromatosis. Cerebral MRI was pathological in two patients with lesions in the basal ganglia. All patients were treated with D penicillamine with good evolution in five patients. Conclusions: The evolution of Wilson's disease is always fatal if left untreated.

1452,Mixed type polyneuropathy in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's Disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of abnormal copper metabolism that predominantly affects the central nervous system and liver. Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported in the context of WD and is not well characterized. Objectives: To report a WD patient with peripheral neuropathy. Design: Case report. Center: Neurology Diagnostic Unit, POSan Martino, Oristano, Italy Methods: A 58-year-old man, suffering from WD on trientine treatment, was admitted to our center with mild distal extremity weakness with hypoesthesia. Clinical evaluation showed mild leg weakness with drop foot and hyporeflexia. A nerve conduction study was performed using standard techniques (Medtronic Keypoint v5.09). Distal motor latency, Fwave latency, motor nerve conduction velocity and CMAP in deep peroneal, posterior tibial, median and ulnar nerves were evaluated; Sensory nerve conduction velocity and SAP were measured in the sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar and radial nerves. When anamnestic and laboratory data were analyzed, no other cause of polyneuropathy was found. Conclusions: Electroneurographic findings suggested a mixed type of sensory-motor neuropathy due to asymmetric length. Conclusion: We confirmed peripheral nervous system involvement in WD. According to the literature, our findings also showed both myelin and axonal damage. Polyneuropathy may occur despite treatment, but an iatrogenic contribution cannot be ruled out.",,"Aste, R.;Salaris, E.;Pische, M. G.;Floris, E. R.",2014,June,,0,0,
1453,A novel pathogenic ATP7B mutation in a Thai patient with very mild Wilson's disease.,"Purpose: To describe a new mutation of Wilson's disease and its clinical manifestations. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13. H1069Q mutation, the most common mutation in the United States and northern Europe, associated with late onset and lesser severity. Methods: 39 years old female, graduate. She presented with progressive right hand dystonia for 25 years and noticed mild weakness in her right hand. Three years after onset it progressed to generalized dystonia and chorea. He did not have tremors, stiffness, or seizures. He had no history of psychiatric problems and no other underlying disease. There was no family history of WD. He was diagnosed with WD from another hospital but lost 5 years of follow-up. There was no sign of chronic liver stigmata on physical examination. There was generalized dystonia more prominent in the right hand and orobukkolingual region, and generalized chorea more prominent in the left. There was mild weakness and normal eye movements on the left side. Kayser-Fleischer ring was seen on eye examination. He had no rigidity or tremor, his cerebellar signs were normal, his senses were normal, and he had no other long-distance signs. Studies showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level of 2 mg/dl (20-60), a normal serum copper level of 0.33 ppm (0.66-1.50), and a high level of urinary copper of 98 ug/24h-ur(17-43). Liver function test and synthetic function of the liver were within the normal range. MRI brain showed typical feature of WD. Mutation screening in all 21 exons of the ATP7B gene was performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography followed by sequencing of the altered fragments. Results: A new frameshift translation, NM-000053.2(ATP7B) c.3168delT;p.Leu1057 Trpfs*64 and a new single-base deletion resulting in insertion error in intron 17,NM-000053.2(ATP7B) c.3700-1G >C (IVS17-1G>C) was detected in this patient. He was treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate. The clinic has improved. The CF ring has disappeared. Serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper levels returned to the normal range. Results: The patient presented with chorea of progressive generalized dystonia without other typical signs and symptoms of WD. Disease severity was mild. Genetic testing showed a new mutation of WD. This mutation can be associated with a favorable prognosis. (Fig. Presented).",,"Sringean, J.;Amornvit, J.;Limwongse, C.;Bhidayasiri, R.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25914,0,0,
1454,Examining response to therapy in patients with neurological Wilson's disease,"Purpose: To evaluate the response to treatment in patients with neurological Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease (WH) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that make a protein important for copper transport and removal of excess copper. from the body. The disease shows features suggesting mainly liver and brain involvement. It most commonly affects children or young adults and is always fatal if not adequately treated with copper removal therapy. Zinc and Dpenicillamine are drugs commonly available in India for the treatment of WD. Methods: This study was performed on 31 patients diagnosed with WD based on clinical features suggestive of WD; Detection of Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea by slit lamp examination and biochemical parameters (24 hour urine copper more than 100 microgram/dl; serum ceruloplasmin below 20 mg/dl and serum copper below 75 microgram/dl). All patients were given zinc and penicillamine. Results: All 31 patients were started on copper chelation therapy with zinc (elemental zinc 50 2150 mg/day) and penicillamine (250-1500 mg/day). Neurological deterioration was observed in 16 (51.6%) patients, decrease in platelets in 13 (54.2%) patients, increase in transaminases in 6 (19.4%) and skin rashes in 5 (16.1%). In these patients, penicillamine was discontinued and restarted after stabilization of clinical and biochemical parameters. Adjunctive therapy with trihexyphenidyl, levodopa and pyridoxine was used. Improvement was seen in 10 (32.25%) patients after restarting penicillamine. Of the remaining 6 (19.4%), 4 (12.9%) patients never returned to their pre-penicillamine status and were lost during follow-up. The remaining 2 (6.45%) patients worsened and died. To monitor the adequacy of the treatment, 24-hour urine copper measurement was performed from the patients. Variable improvements were noted - 13 (41.9%) fully recovered to pre-disease functioning; 12 (38.7%) showed incomplete recovery with sequelae; 4 (12.9%) patients died during follow-up and 2 (6.45%) patients died. Results: Twenty-five (80.6%) of our patients showed improvement while more than half showed complete recovery. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis together with appropriate treatment (with careful clinical and biochemical monitoring) and lifelong continuation can prevent devastating consequences as the disease is treatable.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2014,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25914,0,0,
1455,A case of copper deficiency myelopathy with features of Parkinsonism and iron deposition in the brain.,"Objective: To present a case of copper deficiency myelopathy with features of Parkinsonism and iron deposition in the brain. Background: Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) occurs as a result of acquired copper deficiency and resembles subacute combined degeneration of vitamin B12 deficiency in appearance. Acquired copper deficiency is rare and may occur as a result of gastric surgery, excessive zinc intake, prolonged TPN, and malabsorption. Progressive spastic tetraparesis, paresthesias, and sensory ataxic gait are seen in CDM. The characteristic MRI findings are hyperintensities in the dorsal columns of the cervical spine extending to the brainstem. No hypointensities were reported on brain MRI. We present a case of CDM with features of Parkinsonism and iron deposition in the brain. Results: An 81-year-old man presented with a 20-year history of progressive gait instability, leg stiffness, and macrocytic anemia. A vitamin B12 deficiency was diagnosed and treated. Serum ceruloplasmin (CP), copper (Cu), and urinary Cu excretion levels were consistently low at 10.3 mg/dL, 0.48 mcg/mL, and 9 ug/spec. The patient denied a history of gastric surgery or excessive zinc supplementation. He was treated unresponsive with oral and IV Cu. Five years after presentation, he was found to have Parkinsonism; bradykinesia, stiffness, masked facies, hypophonia and sialorrhea. He had a distinctly hunched posture and spastic gait. The levodopa trial failed. MRI brain revealed iron deposition consistent with aceruloplasminemia (ACP). Iron, transferrin, ferritin, zinc and HgbA1c were normal. CP gene testing showed no predefined mutations consistent with ACP. Conclusions: This case is unique in two ways: there is no underlying cause for Cu deficiency without correction of serum levels after treatment, and brain iron deposition (NBIA) was found on MRI with brain iron deposition suggestive of neurodegeneration. MRI findings and low urinary Cu excretion exclude Wilson's disease (WD). This case appears to be from a subset of patients with low CP and Cu levels that do not fit a diagnosis of WD or ACP. This combination of CDM and NBIA has not been described and may represent a novel form of ACP or two co-existing diseases in a single individual. Brain MRI should be obtained, especially in cases of CDM with progressive symptoms or unresponsive to Cu supplementation.",,"Frei, K.

1458,Pregnancy in women with Wilson's disease: The copper link,"Background Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by liver cirrhosis and neurological disorders. This is a report of two patients with Wilson's disease and their successful journeys during pregnancy and lactation. There are only a few reports of pregnancy outcome in Wilson's disease (WD) from India. The authors of this study emphasize that pregnancy is safe and successful in Wilson's disease when treatment with a chelating agent is continued uninterrupted. Case Case 1 is a 30-year-old G4P1L1A2 case known to have Wilson's disease since age 7. Had two miscarriages and one cesarean in the past. She had been using d-penicillamine since she was 7 years old and was switched to zinc sulfate during pregnancy on the neurophysicist's recommendation. She delivered by elective cesarean section and continued on postpartum zinc sulfate. The second case was a 24-year-old G2A1 who was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 13. She was using D-penicillamine and continued to do so during pregnancy. A year before her pregnancy, she had stopped taking penicillamine on her own and developed severe psychotic symptoms, mood disturbances, and memory impairment. With the rapid improvement of the symptoms, d-penicillamine was started again. She had a healthy baby with a normal vaginal delivery. Conclusion Successful pregnancies and uneventful full-term delivery can occur in mothers with WD who are treated. These women need anti-copper therapy throughout their pregnancy. The main goal of treatment is to protect the mother from copper toxicity while protecting the fetus from possible teratogenesis due to low copper levels. A d-penicillamine regimen during pregnancy can control the disease without harming the fetus. Treatment should not be stopped during pregnancy and zinc therapy should be considered. Liver functions and copper status should be evaluated in patients with Wilson's disease who are considering pregnancy.",,"Mehta, P.;Vishwanath, U.;Agarwal, P.",2014,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.12788,0,0,
1459,Complete neurological recovery in Wilson's disease: experience with 100 consecutive patients seen between 2005 and 2013.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the neurological outcomes of Wilson's disease (WD) following copper sequestration. BACKGROUND: Reasonable copper segregation can prevent mortality from WD and reverse neurological disability. DESIGN/METHODS: We prospectively recruited 100 consecutive patients with WD and WD-related neurological disability between 2005 and 2013. Penicillamine or trientine, all taken at recommended doses (125 mg/day - up to 2 gm/day) during the initial copper removal phase of therapy. Treatment was monitored using the standard WD-specific scale, the Wilson's Disease Global Rating Scale (GAS for WD). RESULTS: There were no deaths during the eight-year study period. 56 of 100 patients were male. The mean age of disease onset was 12.4 (range 3-35). Based on the three-point disease severity scale (SS3), 43% of patients had severe neurological disability at recruitment (defined as bedridden, silent, requiring enteral feeding and bladder catheterization). 37% had moderate and 20% had mild neurologic disability. Dystonia was the most common movement disorder (77%), followed by parkinsonism (53%) and tremor (47%). Of the 100 patients, 4 dropped out of follow-up after the first visit, and both were resistant to copper removal. All other 94 patients showed significant neurological improvement at a mean follow-up of 20.7 months (range 4-36). Seventy percent of 94 patients (including 68% of patients with severe neurological disability) showed complete neurological recovery and were able to continue their normal lives on an equal footing with their peers. At last follow-up, 30% of 94 patients showed sustained improvement. Hopefully, improvements were also seen in various movement disorders, including dystonia and parkinsonism. Adverse events observed include neurologic deterioration due to transient copper removal (n=15), thrombocytopenia (n=20), emergent psychosis (n=10), skin rash (n=6), non-traumatic fracture (n=4), and penicillamine. induced lupus (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Our report reinforces that with reasonable decoppering, significant neurological improvement can be expected in patients with WD.

Results: D-penicillamine nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 274.09 nm with a release of less than 29.32% D penicillamine for 2 hours under in vitro conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that D-penicillamine levels were increased in the brain of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine administration group compared to the conventional D-penicillamine administration group. Conventional and nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine treatment resulted in significantly improved neuromuscular coordination and memory with simultaneous increase in urinary copper levels and acetylcholinesterase activity in a rat model of copper toxicosis. Conventional D-penicillamine treatment resulted in negative rhodanine staining, supported by a 60.1% and 16.4% reduction in brain copper content in the liver and brain sections, respectively, compared to the untreated copper poisoning group. However, liver and brain sections of the nanoparticle-based D-penicillamine therapy group showed no accumulation of grade 1 copper and copper, which was confirmed by 47.2% and 32.8% reductions in liver and brain copper content, respectively, compared to the untreated copper poisoning group.

1461,"Wilson's disease pregnancy course in a single center, 20 years of experience","Introduction: The course of pregnancy and drug safety during breastfeeding in patients with Wilson's disease, whether under treatment or not, are not well understood issues. Materials and Methods: In this study, 194 patients (156 index cases) with a median follow-up of 51 months (13-105 months) and 1069 patient-years at Istanbul Medical Faculty were evaluated retrospectively for pregnancy. All patients met the criteria of the EASL 2012 Wilson's disease guidelines. Results: Twenty of 84 women (16 index cases) had a total of 49 pregnancies. At the time of admission, 7 patients had decompensated cirrhosis, 4 patients had compensated cirrhosis, 6 patients had neurological signs (dysarthria, tremor, etc.) and 9 patients were in the pre-cirrhotic stage. Nine out of 16 pre-diagnosed pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortion. After diagnosis, 5 out of 33 pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortion and 5 were terminated (one due to fetal anomaly and 4 at the request of the patient). One in 23 live births was born prematurely and died within three weeks. The other 22 did not report any abnormalities and are still alive and well. After 7 abortions, one patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and Wilson's disease. She had a live birth after two miscarriages under treatment. One of the patients who stopped taking the drug during pregnancy died of liver failure in the second month after delivery. The other patient developed tremor in the third trimester and his treatment was restarted. During pregnancy, drug doses were reduced; one patient was treated with zinc (100 mg/day), one with 600 mg trientine plus 100 mg zinc, and the others with 600 mg/day D-penicillamine and 100 mg/day zinc. Copper deficiency did not develop in any of the pregnancies. The patients breastfed their babies. After lactation, drug doses were increased when necessary. 10 patients who received D-penicillamine (600 mg/day) treatment did not experience any wound healing problem after cesarean section. Conclusion : Even if Wilson's patients present with decompensated cirrhosis, they can get pregnant under combination therapy (chelator and zinc). During pregnancy, drugs should be administered twice a day (D-penicillamine 600 mg/day, trientine 600 mg/day, zinc 100 mg/day) and treatments should never be interrupted. In the given doses, D-penicillamine does not impair wound healing after cesarean section.

1463,Wilson's disease-experience at Istanbul Medical Faculty O,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms associated with a positive copper balance. Even at a decompensated stage, it is possible to improve survival and quality of life with chelation therapy. Materials and methods: In this single-center study, we shared 20 years of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of 194 cases (156 indexes) diagnosed according to EASL 2012 Wilson's disease criteria. Patients presenting with acute liver failure were excluded and all possible causes of liver disease were investigated. Results: 56.7% (110) of all patients were male, with a mean age of 22.3 +/- 10 years at the time of diagnosis, and a diagnosis delay of 19 +/- 33 (0-168) months. Of all patients, 35.7% were liver, 20.7% were neurologic, and 28.9% were hepatoneurological. 14.7% of the patients were asymptomatic. Screening revealed 38 patients with family members, 24% with compensated liver cirrhosis and 39.5% with normal findings. HBsAg positivity was 3.1% and Anti-HCV 0.5%, respectively. Low serum ceruloplasmin levels (<20 mg/dL) were 86%, 24-hour urinary copper output (> 100 mcg) was 89.9%, and liver copper elevation (> 250 mcg/g) was 84.7%. During treatment, ceruloplasmin levels decreased in 89% of patients and were below the diagnostic threshold (p < 0.05). Kayser Fleischer ring was found more frequently in 65.7% of patients with neurological findings. With treatment, serum albumin levels increased, transaminase levels decreased, prothrombin time was shortened, and clinical ascites were significantly eliminated. Four people with drug incompatibility developed neurological symptoms. D-penicillamine therapy was converted to trientine in 10 patients due to increased neurological symptoms. We lost 15 patients due to drug incompatibility during follow-ups; 315 siblings of 93 index cases were screened because one patient had duodenal variceal bleeding and one patient had sepsis (D-penicillamine treatment increased transfer dysphagia and caused aspiration pneumonia). Secondary tests were requested in 89 cases because the diagnostic criteria were met. Parents of 46.4% were married within the family. Conclusion: Multiple markers of copper metabolism should be used in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease and family members should be tested. With the right treatment, the prognosis is excellent.",,"Soyer, Z.

1464,Do low albumin and high alanine transaminases help predict medical treatment outcome in Wilsonian chronic liver disease (CLD)?,"Introduction: The new Wilson index is not a reliable indicator of outcome in Wilsonian chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to look at predictive risk factors for poor outcome in Wilson's disease manifesting as chronic liver disease. Methods: Wilson's disease (WD), manifesting as CLD, was treated with D-Pencillamine (10-20 mg/kg/day) and Zinc combination therapy. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to see the association of risk factors with poor outcomes (Liver transplant or death) at the time of diagnosis. Results: 33 cases presented in the last 3 years. Five out of 7 people admitted acutely with chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 6 out of 20 people with decompensated CLD had poor results. All 6 compensated CLDs with decompensated CLD, 2 out of 7 ACLF, and 14 out of 20 were cured. Bilirubin, AST, ALT, Child Pughs score and New Wilson index score were significantly higher in univariate analysis. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between high ALT (adjusted OR 1.062, 95% CI 1.007-1.12, p = 0.015) and low albumin (adjusted OR 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.56, p = 0.028) and poor outcome. A 20 IU increase in ALT increases the single rate by 3.3 (95% CI 1.15 to 9.58) and a 1 gram decrease in albumin increases the single rate by 0.95 (95% CI 0.44-0.995). Conclusion: High ALT and low albumin are independently associated with poor medical outcomes in WD presenting as CLD.

1465,ASFA apheresis registry study report on Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the ATP7B gene that causes copper accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea and kidney (1:30.000). While there are treatment options available, such as low-copper diets, zinc acetate, tetrathiomolybdate, and copper chelation, patients may still be in crisis before or after their disease is diagnosed because of ineffectiveness or intolerance to current therapy. Patients with a crisis of Wilson's disease often present with fulminant liver failure, severe DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, and multi-organ failure with rapid clinical deterioration. Eventually, many patients require a liver transplant. In this setting, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been used to remove copper and provide a bridge to liver transplantation. Most studies describing the use of plasma exchange for Wilson's disease are case reports. Here, we report collective experiences with Wilson's disease through the ASFA apheresis registry. Methods: The ASFA apheresis registration study is a multicenter registration study. Both prospective and retrospective data are permitted in the registry, which includes data collection up to January 2000. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Children's National Health System. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The registry contains patient demographic and clinical information, apheresis procedure information, treatment schedule, and treatment outcome/complications. All participating sites had approval from local IRBs as well as the ASFA Practices committee's ASFA apheresis enrollment subcommittee. Results: To date, a total of 10 patients (three men and seven women) with Wilson's disease treated between 2005 and 2013 were included in this study. The median age at first diagnosis was 16 (6-30 years). The median age at first TPI was 17 (6-61 years). A total of 43 TPEs were performed on the patients, most of which required an intensive TPE session. The median number of TPE procedures was 3.5 (range 1-9). No patient received TPE prior to the initial enrollment study TPE, except for one patient who received a TPE prior to patient transfer to the study site. All of the TPEs using ACD-A as anticoagulation, 98% (42/43) TPE targeting 1-1.25 plasma volume and 95% (41/43) TPE with 100% fluid balance were performed. A central line for TPE was placed in all patients. After TPE, 90% (9/10) patients underwent liver transplantation, all 10 patients (transplanted and non-transplanted) had a survival of at least 6 months. Conclusion: All 10 patients with Wilson's disease who underwent plasma exchange had positive results in terms of 6-month survival.

1466,Outcome and development of symptoms after orthotopic liver transplant for Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease resulting in hepatic and neurological dysfunction. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases in patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on outcomes of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. Objective: To evaluate the course of neuropsychiatric and liver symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson's disease Methods: 19 patients with Wilson's disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms between 2005 and 2010. Results: Eight patients (all women) for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure were transplanted. Patient survival rates one and five years after transplant were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, hepatic symptom scores improved in all patients, and neurological symptom scores improved after OLT compared to time of first diagnosis and pre-OLT status, except for one patient. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvement. Conclusion: Survival after OLT is excellent for Wilson's disease with end-stage liver disease. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, confirming the arguments for expanding the indication for liver transplantation in symptomatic neurological Wilson patients with stable liver function. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1467,"Iron, zinc, and copper in retinal physiology and disease","The essential trace metals iron, zinc and copper play important roles in both retinal physiology and disease. They are involved in various retinal functions such as phototransduction, visual cycling and neurotransmission process, are tightly bound to proteins and other molecules to regulate their structure and/or function, or exist as unbound free metal ions. High levels of ""free"" or loosely bound metal ions can exert toxic effects, and appropriate mechanisms exist to protect retinal cells from their toxicity, such as the presence of metal transporters, chaperones, and certain tightly bound storage molecules to maintain homeostatic levels. binds metals to form non-toxic products. The ways metals maintain their homeostatic levels are closely linked to various metabolic pathways that directly and/or indirectly affect their concentration, partitioning, and oxidation/reduction states. Retinal deficiency or excess of these metals may result from systemic depletion and/or overload, or from mutations in genes involved in maintaining retinal metal homeostasis and are associated with retinal dysfunction and pathology. Iron accumulation in the retina, which is a feature of aging, may play a role in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Zinc deficiency is associated with poor dark adaptation. Zinc levels and RPE in the human retina decrease with age in AMD. Copper deficiency is associated with optic neuropathy, but retinal function is preserved. Changes in iron and zinc homeostasis in AMD have led to speculation that iron chelation and/or zinc supplements may be helpful in the treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Ugarte, M.;Osborne, N.

1468,Wilson's disease. [Check],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease in which copper accumulates in tissues, especially in the liver and brain. The genetic defect affects the P-type ATPase gene (ATP7B). More than 500 mutations have been identified that cause Wilson's disease. The most common mutation in Central Europe is related to H1069Q. Symptoms of Wilson's disease include hepatic or neurological conditions. The liver condition manifests as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Neurological conditions are most commonly manifested as motor disturbances (tremors, speech and writing disorders) after the age of 20, which can result in severe extrapyramidal syndrome with rigidity, dysarthria and muscle spasms. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory evaluations (neurological signs, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, high Cu volumes in urine, Kayser-Fleischer ring). Diagnosis is confirmed by high Cu level in liver tissue or genetic evidence. Untreated Wilson's disease causes death of the patient. If properly treated, the survival rate approaches the survival rate of the common population. Treatment consists of removing copper from the body using chelating agents (Penicillamine, Trientine) excreted in the urine, or limiting intestinal copper absorption and reducing the toxicity of copper (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). Penicillamine or zinc is used in the Czech Republic. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.

Early treatment can prevent irreversible tissue damage. Objective: To highlight the need for screening offspring of affected parents, we report four families with WD in two consecutive generations. Results: It was known that one parent in all families was affected by WD. Disease screening was not performed until the children of the two families had liver disease in one and neurological symptoms in the other. In the other two families, screening of children as soon as the diagnosis was made in the affected parent allowed timely recovery of advanced liver disease in one, while the two affected children were asymptomatic. In three children, diagnosis required direct sequencing of the ATP7B gene. Two new disease-causing mutations have been reported. Conclusion: When pregnancy is considered, patients with WD should be given genetic counseling and the offspring should always be screened for the disease.

Treatment begins with an appropriate diagnosis and differential diagnosis to find chorea and disorders suitable for causal therapy. Emphasis is placed on the importance of genetic testing and genetic counseling, as well as the importance of precise observation of the course of the disorder to tailor appropriate treatments. Pharmacological treatment is based on insufficient evidence but the expertise of centers largely devoted to the care of patients with Huntington's disease.

1473,"Reuse as an orphan drug development strategy, evidence from European approvals","Introduction: Increasing awareness of the value of drug reuse has led to a number of initiatives to prepare discarded drug candidates for screening. It has been suggested that there is an important use for reuse in the identification of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases. The 78 orphan drugs approved in Europe provide a useful kit for analyzing evidence of reuse. Areas covered: Orphan drugs approved in Europe were reclassified as fit-for-purpose to represent drugs specifically developed for orphan indications or as drugs classified as orphan drugs after their use was identified. Medicines were further classified as new medicinal assets, biological products, and natural products. The majority (60%) of approvals were from new medical organizations, including 17 of the 19 approved biological products. While 10 of the approved drugs were provided by natural products, 30 (38%) of the approvals were drugs used for purposes other than other indications. Expert opinion: Identifying drugs for the treatment of rare diseases requires cost-effective exploratory approaches. As the prevalence or incidence of the disease decreases, the need for lower-cost approaches becomes more important. The systematic use of repurposing provides better opportunities to achieve such goals and can facilitate subsequent development of the resulting drug(s).

1474,Liver diseases in pregnancy: Diseases not specific to pregnancy,"Pregnancy is a special clinical situation in which there are few normal physiological changes that affect body organs, including the liver. Liver disease can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both pregnant women and their infants. In light of such physiological changes, little difficulty arises in reaching the correct diagnosis. Laboratory test results should be interpreted with caution and knowledge of what normal changes to expect should be cautious to avoid clinical misjudgments. Other challenges require treatment methods and safety for both mother and baby. This review summarizes non-pregnancy-specific liver diseases. We focus on viral hepatitis and its mode of transmission, diagnosis, and impact on pregnancy, mother, infant, treatment and breastfeeding. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson's disease, Budd Chiari, and portal vein thrombosis in pregnancy are also discussed. Pregnancy is rare in patients with cirrhosis due to metabolic and hormonal changes associated with cirrhosis. Varicose bleeding may occur in 38% of pregnant women with cirrhosis. The management of portal hypertension in pregnancy is discussed. Pregnancy increases the pathogenicity leading to an increase in the rate of gallstones. We discuss some interventions for gallstones in pregnancy if symptoms occur. Finally, we provide an overview of some of the options for the management of hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma during pregnancy. Â© 2013 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

1475,Wilson's Disease Update,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disease of chronic copper toxicosis, characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the body, especially in the liver and brain. It is a progressive disease and is fatal if left untreated. Excessive copper accumulation is caused by the liver's inability to excrete copper in the bile. Copper is an essential trace metal and plays a crucial role in many metabolic processes. Almost all of the body copper is bound to proteins. In WD, the slow but relentless accumulation of copper suppresses copper chaperones (copper binding proteins) and results in tissue damage caused by high levels of free copper and copper. The liver is the central organ of copper metabolism, and copper initially accumulates in the liver but spreads to other tissues over time. WD has multifaceted clinical manifestations that are primarily attributable to liver, brain, and bone-muscle disorder. WD is difficult to diagnose and relies on a combination of clinical features and laboratory testing. The identification of several high-frequency mutations identified in different population studies around the world has rekindled interest in the development of DNA chips for rapid genetic diagnosis of WD. All symptomatic and all presymptomatic patients require life-long decomposition with careful clinical monitoring. Decoppering ensures that presymptomatic individuals remain symptom-free. With common sense copper removal, with given time, even patients with severe neurological disabilities can recover and return to normal life and continue school or work on an equal footing with their peers. Treatment regimens and patient monitoring using the WD-specific Global Rating Scale (GAS for WD) are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Aggarwal, A.;Bhatt, M.",2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-410502-7.00014-4,0,0,

Case Report: A female patient had several abdominal surgeries due to recurrent intestinal obstructions. She initially presented with severe megaloblastic anemia. He subsequently suffered from weight loss, diarrhea, edema, recurrent anemia (despite vitamin B12 substitution), and severe malabsorption of proteins, lipids, iron, and vitamins. Vague information about the surgeries performed, a difficult-to-interpret gut anatomy, and an unusual cholestasis made a diagnosis of stationary loop syndrome-related bacterial overgrowth difficult to come by. Treatment with antibiotics only temporarily improved the patient's condition. After restoring intestinal continuity and resection of an intestinal conglomerate as well as the enteroenteric fistula, the patient showed no further symptoms. Conclusion: The history of this patient shows that the diagnosis of stationary loop syndrome can be difficult.

1480,"Metabolism of triethylenetetramine and 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane by spermidine/spermin-N<sup>1</sup>-acetyltransferase and thialis acetyltransferase","Triethylenetetramine (TETA; Syprine; Merck Rahway, NJ), a drug for Wilson's disease, is a copper chelator and a charge-deficient analogue of polyamine spermidine. We recently demonstrated that TETA is metabolized in vitro to its monoacetylated derivative (MAT) by the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermin-N<sup>1</sup>-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) and thialicin acetyltransferase (SSAT2). Acetylation of TETA is increased in mice overexpressing SSAT1 compared to wild-type mice. However, SSAT1-deficient mice metabolize TETA at the same rate as wild-type mice, suggesting the presence of another N-acetylase response possible for its metabolism in mice. Here we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SSAT2 in HEPG2 cells and primary hepatocytes from SSAT1-deficient or wild-type mice reduces the metabolism of TETA to MAT. In contrast, 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (SpmTrien), an analog of charge-deficient sperm, was an extremely poor substrate of human recombinant SSAT2 and was metabolized by SSAT1 in HEPG2 cells and wild-type primary cells. hepatocytes. Thus, despite the similar structures of TETA and SpmTrien, SSAT2 is the main acetylator of TETA, whereas SpmTrien is primarily acetylated by SSAT1.

1481,"Urinary excretion of copper, zinc and iron with and without D-penicillamine administration in relation to hepatic copper concentration in dogs.","Hereditary copper-associated hepatitis in dogs is similar to Wilson's disease, a copper storage disease in humans. While urinary copper excretion values are well established in the diagnostic protocol of Wilson's disease, they have not been evaluated in dogs. The objectives of this study were to characterize both basal and D-penicillamine-induced urinary copper, zinc and iron excretion in dogs according to hepatic copper concentration. Beagle, Beagle-Bedlington terrier crosses, homozygous for the COMMD1 gene mutation causing copper toxicosis, and Labrador recipients with normal or increased hepatic copper concentrations were investigated. Hepatic copper phenotype was determined by histological evaluation of liver biopsies and measurement of hepatic copper concentration by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The urinary excretion of copper, iron and zinc was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry under basal conditions and after oral administration of a single dose (20 mg/kg body weight) of the chelator D-penicillamine. There was a rapid increase in urinary excretion of copper and zinc, but no iron after administration of D-penicillamine. This increase was not different between dogs with high or normal hepatic copper concentrations. D-penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion and copper/creatinine ratio did not correlate with hepatic copper concentrations in the dogs studied, but baseline urinary copper/zinc ratios correlated with hepatic copper concentrations in Labrador beagle dogs. The second parameter may be useful in diagnosis and follow-up protocols for copper-associated hepatitis in Labrador recipients. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fieten, H.;Hugen, S.;van den Ingh, T. S. G. A.

1492,New Bioimaging Techniques of Metals with Laser Ablation for Diagnosis of Fibrotic and Cirrhotic Liver Disorders Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry,"Introduction and Aims: Inherited disorders associated with metal overload or undesirable toxic accumulation of heavy metals can cause morbidity and mortality. For example, patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease may develop severe liver pathology, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. While relevant disease genes are identified and genetic testing is feasible, liver biopsy is still applied, along with metal detection techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), for accurate diagnosis of metals. On the contrary, many metals are needed in trace amounts for the fulfillment of vital functions and their deficiency due to rapid growth, pregnancy, excessive blood loss and malnutrition or digestive system intake causes organic and systemic deficiencies. Established in situ techniques such as EDX-ray spectroscopy are not sensitive enough to analyze trace metal distribution and metal images are difficult to quantify. Methods: In this study, selected metals were used in healthy and fibrotic/cirrhotic livers. Conclusions: While most metals are homogeneously distributed in normal tissue, they are redirected in fibrotic livers, causing significant metal deposits. In addition, total iron and copper concentrations in the diseased liver were found to be approximately 3-5 times higher than in the normal liver samples. Conclusions: Biometal imaging via LA-ICP-MS is a sensitive, innovative diagnostic tool that will impact clinical practice in the identification and evaluation of hepatic metal disorders and the detection of fine metal variations during ongoing hepatic fibrogenesis.

1496,Copper phenotype in Alzheimer's disease: Interruption of the way,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the onset and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, none of this seems to clarify the complexity of the pathogenesis. In fact, several and independent pathogenetic pathways may be disrupted simultaneously and each contributes to the disease etiology. In recent years, researchers have begun to study biometals more deeply. A number of studies have shown that metal dyshomeostasis can increase the onset and progression of AD. Specifically, different authors have hypothesized that changes in metal metabolism are associated with metal-associated oxidative stress and increased beta-amyloid oligomer formation and precipitation. Studies conducted in vivo, in vitro, in living patients, and in silico studies have shown that local and systemic disturbances of copper metabolism are characteristic manifestations of AD. This strongly supports the hypothesis that copper pathways may be disrupted by disease. More specifically, a copper phenotype for AD can be proposed based on defects found in genes involved in copper metabolism. In this review, we describe copper dyshomeostasis in Alzheimer's patients and try to explain the basis of the AD copper phenotype. By examining copper pathways, we highlight the mechanisms that may be at the root of the disease. We also discuss various associated translation results.

The hepatic phenotype of toxic dairy mice is similar to clinical manifestations in humans suffering from Wilson's disease (WND). In this study, the neurotransmitter system and locomotor performance in toxic dairy mice were investigated to confirm the applicability of this animal model for the study of WND neuropathology. 2- and 12-month-old mice were used in the experiment. Mice were tested according to the rotarod and footprinting protocols. Monoamine content in brain structures was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. To detect neuronal loss, the expression of enzymes specific to dopaminergic [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)], noradrenergic (dopamine beta-hydroxylase) and serotoninergic [tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)] neurons was analyzed by Western blot. 12-month-old toxic dairy rats showed impaired locomotor performance in behavioral tests. The motor deficits were accompanied by increased copper and serotonin content in different brain regions and a slight decrease in dopamine concentration in the striatum. Expression of TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase and TPH in various brain structures did not differ between toxic dairy mice and control animals. Despite the differences in brain pathology between humans and rodents, further investigation of neuronal damage in toxic dairy mice is warranted to expand understanding of neuropathology in WND.

1499,Monitoring therapy with oral radiocopper testing in Wilson's disease. [Germanium],"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper transport leading to inhibition of biliary copper excretion. Metal overload mainly in the liver and basal ganglia leads to hepatic but also extrapyramidal motor as well as psychiatric clinical symptoms. Depending on the stage of the disease, treatment with chelating drugs and zinc is possible but should be given for life without longer interruptions. With early diagnosis and subsequent treatment, the prognosis of Wilson's disease is excellent and the need for liver transplantation can often be avoided. Monitoring of therapy is important because treatment with the chelating penicillamine is complicated by side effects, triene is not always available, and non-responders to zinc therapy have been reported. Method: In our study, oral radiocopper test was applied to 58 patients with Wilson's disease to evaluate the inhibition of enteral resorption of copper. Patients were given 10 MBq <sup>64</sup>Cu and radioactivity was measured in serum one and/or 3 hours after ingestion, respectively. A total of 91 tests were evaluated. Results: Inhibition of copper resorption was not found in 1 patient who received penicillamine therapy. Partial inhibition of enteral resorption for triene was demonstrated in 6 patients. 48 tests showed sufficient inhibition with zinc treatment. Inhibition was not proven to be sufficient in 36 tests of patients receiving zinc. 6 of them can be improved by increasing the dose. Triene has also been shown to inhibit the absorption of copper by this test. No inhibition is seen with penicillamine. Conclusion: The high prevalence of inadequate efficacy of zinc therapy requires continuous control. The radiocopper test provides an estimate of the effect of zinc on copper absorption in Wilson's disease.

The following corneal manifestations of systemic storage diseases and modern systemic therapy are presented: periodic infusion of corneal verticillata, alpha-galactosidase a in Fabrys disease; Kayser-Fleischer ring, zinc, trienetin, low copper diet in Wilson's disease; Multiple, point-shaped crystals in Raptor RP 103(DR cysteamine), which reduces cytotoxicity as cystinosis, cysteamine, lysosome, kidney transplantation, continuous dissolution of cystine from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; peripheral ring but true lipid arch and moderate stromal turbidity in LCAT deficiency, recombinant enzyme injection or cells expressing encapsulated LCAT; diffuse stromal turbidity in mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Enzyme replacement therapy is currently indicated for MPS I, MPS II and MPS VI, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; In tyrosinemia type II (eponym: Richner-Hanhart syndrome), painful, bilateral pseudo-dendritic opacities on a low phenylalanine and tyrosine diet cause complete disappearance of corneal changes with a consecutive painless period. A strict diet is required throughout life to prevent corneal recurrences and palmo-plantar keratosis. Such therapies can enable the patient to lead a normal life for decades. © 2013 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

1506,D-penicillamine treatment of copper-associated hepatitis in Labrador recipients,"d-penicillamine has been used effectively in the life-long treatment of copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers and Wilson's disease in humans. A complex form of copper-associated hepatitis has recently been described in the Labrador retriever. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of d-penicillamine therapy for copper-associated hepatitis in this breed, to examine its effects on hepatic copper, iron, and zinc concentrations, and to evaluate parameters to estimate optimal treatment duration. Forty-three Labrador dogs of the client diagnosed with hepatic copper elevation were treated with d-penicillamine and underwent at least one follow-up examination, including liver biopsy for histopathological scoring of inflammatory lesions. Hepatic copper, iron, and zinc concentrations were determined at baseline and follow-up biopsies by instrumented neutron activation analysis. The effect of initial hepatic copper concentration, gender, age, formulation of d-penicillamine, and occurrence of side effects were investigated for their effects on hepatic copper concentration after a given treatment period by generalized mixed modelling. d-penicillamine has proven effective in reducing hepatic copper concentration and associated inflammatory lesions. Parameters derived from the model can be used to predict the duration of d-penicillamine treatment required for Labrador recipients with increased hepatic copper concentration. Continuous, life-long d-penicillamine therapy is not recommended in this breed as there may be a risk of hepatic copper and zinc deficiencies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fieten, H.;Dirksen, K.;van den Ingh, T.

1507,Astrocyte functions in copper homeostasis of the brain,"Copper is an essential element required for a variety of important cellular functions. Cellular copper metabolism is tightly regulated, as not only copper deficiency but also excess copper can severely affect cellular functions. In the brain, astrocytes appear to play a crucial role in copper metabolism. With their strategically important localization between capillary endothelial cells and neuronal structures, they are ideally positioned to transport copper across the blood-brain barrier to parenchymal brain cells. Accordingly, astrocytes have the capacity to efficiently absorb, store, and export copper. Cultured astrocytes appear to be highly resistant to copper-induced toxicity. However, exposure to copper can lead to profound changes in the metabolism of these cells. This article will summarize the current knowledge on copper metabolism of astrocytes, describe copper-induced changes in glucose and glutathione metabolism by astrocytes, and discuss the potential role of astrocytes in copper metabolism in the brain. disturbances in brain copper homeostasis.

1514,Unusual epileptic deterioration and diffuse white matter lesion during treatment in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder that can be well controlled by decoupuration therapy. However, in rare cases, symptoms may worsen even while WD is being treated. Here, we report a case of unusual neurological deterioration during decoupuration therapy for WD. Case report: A 28-year-old man was diagnosed with WD 13 years before his clinic visit; however, drug compliance has been poor over the years. In recent years, he was treated with trientine for complaints of tremor and dysarthria. However, he developed dysarthria and dystonia in his limbs, which was worse on his right side and exacerbated for several weeks despite good drug compliance. His symptoms were fluctuating. Initially misdiagnosed as dystonia; However, it turned out to be a seizure due to cortical degeneration. These symptoms resolved completely with antiepileptic drugs. In addition, cortical enhancement of bifrontal degeneration was lost on MRI. Conclusion: This case showed unusual epileptic neurologic deterioration due to cortical degeneration during decupuration therapy. Seizures in WD can easily be mistaken as part of dystonia. However, fluctuating symptoms suggest a seizure. Â© 2013 Kim et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Kim, Y. E.;Yun, J. Y.;Yang, H. J.;Kim, H. J.;Jeon, B.

1515,Metabolic disorders manifesting as liver disease,"The liver is a metabolically highly active organ and many inherited metabolic disorders have hepatic manifestations. The clinical picture in these patients is usually indistinguishable from liver disease due to acquired causes such as infection, drugs or hematological disorders. Symptoms include acute and chronic liver failure, cholestasis, and hepatomegaly. Metabolic causes of acute liver failure in childhood can be as high as 35%. Certain disorders, such as citrine deficiency and Niemann-Pick C disease, may present with self-limited cholestasis in infancy before presenting with irreversible disease in later childhood or adulthood. This article reviews important details from the history and clinical examination when evaluating the pediatric patient with suspected metabolic disease, specialist and genetic testing while investigating, and also discusses the specific disorders, clinical course and treatment. The role of liver transplantation is also briefly discussed. Increasing awareness of this group of diseases is important as in many cases early detection leads to early intervention with better outcome.

1516,Wilson's disease: Changes in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease,"Hepatic methionine metabolism may play an important role in regulating methylation status and liver injury in Wilson's disease (WD) through inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) by copper (Cu) and consequent accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We examined transcript levels of selected genes related to liver injury, levels of SAHH, SAH, DNA methyltransferase genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b) and global DNA methylation in an animal model, the tx-j mouse (tx-j). WD. Results were compared in control C3H mice and in response to Cu chelation with penicillamine (PCA) and dietary supplementation of methyl donor betaine to modulate inflammatory and methylation status. Transcript levels of selected genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation were initially downregulated in tx-j mice, further downregulated in response to PCA, and had little or no response to betaine. Hepatic Sahh transcript and protein levels were decreased in tx-j mice, resulting in increased SAH levels. Hepatic Cu accumulation was associated with histopathology and inflammation, as indicated by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) levels. Dnmt3b was downregulated in tx-j mice with global DNA hypomethylation. PCA treatment of tx-j mice reduced Tnf-alpha and ALT levels, betaine treatment increased S-adenosylmethionine and upregulated Dnmt3b levels, and both treatments restored global DNA methylation levels. Conclusion: Decreased hepatic SAH expression was associated with increased liver SAH levels in the tx-j model of WD, resulting in global DNA hypomethylation. Increased global DNA methylation was achieved by reducing inflammation by Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We propose that increased levels of SAH and inflammation affect the widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD.

1521,Efficacy and safety of oral chelators in the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes hepatic and neurological symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) are used as first-line treatments for symptomatic patients, but there are few data from large groups. We evaluated the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine therapy and the outcomes of patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson's disease from tertiary care centers in Germany and Austria and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry. Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effects on neurological and hepatic symptoms and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (Kaplan-Meier estimation; data collected at a mean of 13.3 years after treatment initiation). RESULTS: Changes in medication were common and resulted in the analysis of 471 chelator monotherapy (326 patients received D-penicillamine and 141 patients received trientine). Nine of 326 patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were more common among those taking D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight months after treatment, hepatic impairment was reported in only 4 of 333 patients initially treated with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in more than 90% of untreated patients and neurological improvements in more than 55%, and the values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, patients given D-penicillamine first (6 out of 295) had less neurological impairment than patients given trientine first (4 out of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelation agents are effective treatments for most patients with Wilson's disease; D-penicillamine and trientine produce comparable results, but D-penicillamine had a higher rate of side effects. A small number of patients receiving chelation therapy had neurological deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients receiving trientine. Â© 2013 AGA Institute.",,"Weiss, K.

1526,Clinical approach in Wilson's disease using the Leipzig scoring system.,"INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease of copper accumulation and toxicity. It can be treated if detected early. Recognition is evident in typical clinical presentations. Unexplained liver test abnormalities are a diagnostic challenge and require further investigation. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Purpose: To investigate the clinical features and diagnostic possibilities in WD. Material and methods: From June 2010 to March 2013, 63 patients (22 female, 41 male) with WD aged 18 to 64 years were analyzed. Leipzig scoring system was used for diagnosis. RESULTS: The patients were followed between 3 months and 21 years after diagnosis. The diagnosis was made based on clinical suspicion and findings, copper metabolism parameters, ultrasonography, ophthalmological examination, liver biopsy, MRI, DNA analysis, and evaluation of the Leipzig scoring system in the final evaluation. Twenty-seven patients (42.9%) had liver disease only, thirty-one patients (49.2%) had liver and neurological presentation, three patients had neurological features without evidence of liver damage, and two were asymptomatic. Liver presentation was as follows: steatosis (4/63), hepatitis 38.1% (24/63), cirrhosis 47.6% (30/53), acute liver failure after discontinuation of therapy (2/63) ), in one cirrhotic patient hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean level of ceruloplasmin was 0.137 g/l. 24-hour urine copper increased. The D-penicillamine challenge test showed a mean urinary copper excretion of 17.69 mumol/24 hours. According to Leipzig diagnostic criteria, 55 (87.3) patients scored >=4 (max.12). Eight patients had a score of 3, but the exclusion of another etiology and the clinical course of the disease confirmed the diagnosis. Kayser-Fleischer ring and 4 - sunflower cataracts were present in 23 (36.5%) patients. Liver biopsy was performed in 23 patients, rhodamine positive staining was performed in 9 patients, DNA analysis was performed in 54 patients, and mutations were detected in 26 (48.1%) patients. CONCLUSION: WD is a treatable hereditary disease. It should be considered in liver diseases to prevent the delay and progression of the recognition of copper metabolic disorder. Our experience confirms that the Leipzig scoring system, which includes a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters of copper metabolism, genetic testing and liver biopsy, is useful for diagnosing WD in clinical practice.",,"Gancheva, D.;Atanassova, M.;Stamboliyska, M.;Kotzev, I.;Kaneva, M.",2013,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050640613502900,0,0,

Clinical manifestations of copper accumulation in the liver include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether <sup>99m</sup>Tc-mebrofen dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy (DHBS) can be used to evaluate liver function in WD. Material and methods We studied 37 consecutive WD patients with clinical evidence of liver disease treated with zinc and/or penicillamine (18 men and 19 women; mean age 39+/-4 years). Standard biochemical liver function tests including ALT, AST, GGT, AP, TOT BIL, ALB, serum copper and ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion and <sup>99m</sup>Tc mebrofenin and DHBS were performed on all patients. Liver biopsies were performed in all WD patients. Liver tissue was examined for routine liver histology (grading and staging of fibrosis) and hepatic copper content. DHBS gains (30 sec/frame for 60 min) were obtained after iv injection of 110 MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc mebrofen. Time-activity curves were recorded from areas of interest superimposed on the hepatic parenchyma (H) and major intrahepatic bile ducts (B). The times required to reach 50% of hepatic activity peak (50% HTmax), maximum liver activity (HTmax), and 50% reduction of HTmax (HT<inf>1/2</inf>) were calculated. In addition, times at biliary maximum peak counts (BTmax) and up to half of peak activity (BT1/2 ) were calculated. Quantitative scintigraphic results were compared with biochemical parameters and liver histopathology. Results All patients showed low serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels (3.05+/-0.2mg/dl and 57+/-18mug/dl) and high 24-hour urinary copper excretion (201+/-42mug/24h), respectively. According to metavir fibrosis staging, 16 patients (43%) were classified as F1, 7 (19%) as F2, 8 (22%) as F3 and the remaining 6 as F4 (16%). Analysis of DHBS quantitative data showed slow hepatic uptake (>HTmax) and hepatobiliary excretion (>HT<inf>1/2</inf>) in almost all patients. A positive correlation was observed between histological findings and 50% HTmax (p= 0.004), HTmax (p=0.001), HT<inf>1/2</inf> (p=0.006) and BTmax (p=0.02) values. In addition, a statistically significant correlation was found between 50% HTmax, HTmax, HT<inf>1/2</inf>, BTmax and high grade fibrosis (F4) and other grade fibrosis in multivariate analysis. No correlation was found between biochemical liver function tests and DHBS parameters, except for bilirubin (p<0.01). Conclusions This study made it possible to reduce the number of liver biopsies in long-term follow-up of patients with WD, demonstrating the clinical utility of DHBS as a non-invasive diagnostic method for assessing the extent of liver fibrosis.",,"Serra, A.;Sini, M.;Loi, G.

Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine-encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) administered orally for 90 days in Wistar rats and (2) copper-poisoned rats. Results: Copper-poisoned animals had a significant increase in copper content in the liver (99.1%) and hippocampus (73%) with significantly reduced serum acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. showed. ; and interestingly, a 40.7% decrease and a 77.1% increase in hepatic and hippocampal zinc content, respectively, compared to control rats. Massive grade 4 copper deposits and grade 1 copper-associated protein in hepatocytes of copper-poisoned rats were confirmed by rhodanin and orcein stains, respectively. Copper-poisoned rats showed bloating with copper deposition in the choroid plexus and increased astrocytes count. Degenerated neurons with pycnotic nuclei were also observed in the brain sections of Cu-poisoned rats. D-penicillamine NPs of average size (275 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (35%) were synthesized. HPLC studies showed that the concentration of D-penicillamine increased with NP treatment compared to conventional D-penicillamine treatment in liver and brain tissues. Treatment based on NPs resulted in improvement in neurological function and a significant reduction in liver and brain copper content.

Here we report the benefit of zinc acetate therapy for Wilson's disease in children. Fifteen patients, 6 men and 9 women, were treated with zinc acetate. Before the treatment, nothing was given to 6 patients, penicillamine was administered to 5 patients, and trientine was administered to 4 patients. The median liver function levels measured at zero months, 6 months, and 1 year were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase 48, 35, and 33 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase 71, 25 and 46 IU/l; mu-glutamyltranspeptidase 49, 46 and 55 IU/l. The median value of spot urinary copper was 1112 cups/l (0.15 cups/mg/creatinine) with chelator use and 141 cups/l (0.10 cups/mg/creatinine) without chelator. Three patients experienced nausea and one patient experienced oral cavity discomfort.

1531,The promise of copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of previously incurable advanced cancer and in the treatment of inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) complexes copper with protein in a strong ternary complex. This complex, which contains nutritional protein, is excreted in the faeces, causing a negative copper balance. In the blood, this complex, TM, free copper, and albumin render free copper unusable and non-toxic. Developed for Wilson's disease, TM is very effective for the neurological condition for which no other drug is optimal. Reducing copper to moderate levels by TM inhibits many cytokines, with levels high enough to prevent clinical deficiency, those that promote fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and cancer. TM is effective in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis by inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TM is effective in mouse models of inflammatory disease involving the liver and heart and in four mouse models of immune-modulated disease. In man, TM achieved both primary endpoints in a one-year randomized controlled trial in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune attack on the bile ducts. TM shows great promise in disease areas such as fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmunity. Wherever steroids are useful, TM will be better and safer. Most excitingly, recent developments suggest that TM can treat advanced, previously incurable, metastatic cancer. Tumor growth requires angiogenesis (Folkman). Many angiogenic promoters, particularly those active at the micrometastatic cancer level, are copper dependent. IMPORTANT TIP: TM COMPLETELY INHIBITS CANCER GROWTH IN HER/2neu MOUSE GENETIC BREAST CANCER MODEL. The micro-clusters of cancer cells that were still there after one year of TM treatment failed to grow due to a lack of angiogenesis, while all controls had large cancers. Human trials ignored this clue and tried TM only against advanced cancers. These can recruit many promoters, most of which are not copper dependent, and only modest effects in these trials have generated little interest. Now, two US groups are treating metastatic cancer with TM, returning to the mouse tip. One group requires conventional suppression of no evidence of disease (NED), even though the disease is considered incurable due to micrometastases. After three years of TM, the cancer is treated with 10 different advanced metastatic cancers that were hitherto untreatable. The second group treats many patients with different metastatic cancers using TM and conventional therapy from the outset plus specific therapies that target cancer metabolic vulnerabilities. We commenced a randomized controlled trial of TM in micrometastatic osteosarcoma in dogs. It seems that TM can cure many previously hopeless cancer cases.",,"Brewer, G. J.",2013,November,,0,0,
1532,Zinc in Human Health: Its discovery 50 years ago and its impact today,"The importance of zinc in humans was established in 1963. Over the past 50 years, tremendous advances have been observed in both the clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans. The main contributing factor to zinc deficiency is high phytate grain protein intake in the developing world, and approximately 2 billion people may be zinc deficient. Conditional zinc deficiency has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, and other chronic diseases. The main clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs did not live beyond 25 years of age and died from intervening infections. In 1963 we knew only 3 enzymes that needed zinc for their activity, but now we know >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activity. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells and intracellular free zinc in these cells participates in signaling events. Zinc has been used very successfully as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold, and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry macular degeneration and is very effective in reducing the incidence. infection in the elderly. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity, but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.",,"Prasad, A. S.",2013,November,,0,0,
1533,Wilson's disease associated with pancreatitis,"14-year-old girl presented with complaints of abdominal pain and bloating for 1 month. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and zinc acetate treatment was started. A diagnosis of associated pancreatitis was made at admission, based on elevated serum amylase and an ultrasonically enlarged pancreas. Afterwards, there was no abdominal pain in the regular follow-up, and the normal serum amylase level was repeatedly normal and the pancreas was normal on ultrasonography. Since abdominal pain is a common symptom at presentation in Wilson's disease, this possibility should be considered in untreated patients. It was concluded that pancreatitis may be associated with Wilson's disease, possibly due to copper deposition in the pancreas and possibly responding to copper chelation therapy.",,"Kumar, T. S.

1534,Cytopenia and myelopathy associated with hypocupresemia: a national retrospective review.,"Background: Copper is an essential trace element involved in a number of important enzymatic processes in the body. Recent single case reports and small studies have shown that copper deficiency can cause reversible hematological changes and irreversible neurological damage. Introduction: Using information from a national reference laboratory, we chose to conduct a national study looking at all cases of copper deficiency in Scotland over a 5-year period. Results: We determined that 86% of the 16 patients identified had both hematological and neurological features of copper deficiency, while 18% had hematological features only at presentation. Twelve of the 16 patients had high serum zinc concentrations (>18 µm/L) due to zinc-containing dental fixatives (9 patients), oral zinc replacement therapy after proximal bowel resection (1 patient), Wilson's Disease treated with zinc (1 patient) and skin burns requiring topical zinc therapy (1 patient). 94% of the patients had hematological features such as anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia as the first sign of copper deficiency. Patients who subsequently underwent bone marrow testing had appearances consistent with refractory cytopenia with multiline dysplasia, refractory hyperblasted anemia, unclassified marrow dysplasia, or probable myelodysplasia (MDS). 75% of patients had progressive gait difficulties and gait difficulties without neurological symptoms or signs or sensory signs, including paresthesia. Clinical examination was consistent with spastic paraparesis (with or without sensory neuropathy). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal T2 hyper-dense foci in the subcortical white matter, and computed tomography (CT) also showed atrophy of the brain and cerebellum. cervical or thoracic cord. 93% of cytopenias responded to copper replacement and addressed the root cause of copper deficiency, but only 25% of patients showed improvement in neurological function, 33% worsened and 42% remained unchanged. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that copper deficiency is an underrecognized cause of several types of cytopenias that are reversible but can progress to significant neurological damage if left untreated. We demonstrate the importance of diagnosing these patients early to prevent irreversible neurological damage.",,"Gabreyes, A.;Abbasi, H.;Forbes, K.

1535,Mixed type polyneuropathy in Wilson's Disease,"Wilson's Disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease of abnormal copper metabolism that predominantly affects the central nervous system and liver. Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported in the context of WD and is not well characterized. Here we describe a WD patient with peripheral neuropathy. A 58-year-old male patient, receiving trientine treatment, was admitted to our center with hypoesthesia and mild distal extremity weakness. Clinical evaluation showed mild leg weakness with foot drop and hyporeflexia. A nerve conduction study was performed using standard techniques (Medtronic Keypoint v5.09). Distal motor latency, F wave latency, motor nerve conduction velocity and CMAP in deep peroneal, posterior tibial, median and ulnar nerves were evaluated; Sensory nerve conduction velocity and SAP were measured in the sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar and radial nerves. No other cause of polyneuropathy was found. Electroneurographic findings suggested a mixed type of asymmetrical length-related sensory-motor neuropathy. We confirmed peripheral nervous system involvement in WD. According to the literature, our findings also showed both myelin and axonal damage.

1536,"Case report: Brain MRI revealing the rare but distinctive ""Double Panda Sign"" in a patient with Wilson's disease","Introduction and Aim: Wilson's disease is a clinically rare, important genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain and other tissues and can be fatal if not recognized and treated when symptomatic. Methods: A 29-year-old woman presented with complaints of painful contractures in her left hand, dysarthria, dysphagia and gait disturbance. Symptoms had initially started 4 months ago with right hand eversion and 2 weeks of contracture with spontaneous resolution. He denied exposure to toxins, substance abuse, or similar family history. Results: He had normal mental status, dysarthria, hypophonia, dystonia, chorea, and broad-based gait. Ophthalmological examination revealed early Kayser-Fleisher rings. The diagnosis was confirmed by low serum ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper. Liver function tests were normal. Brain MRI showed bilateral T2 hyperintensities involving the putamen, thalamus, and brainstem with the characteristic ""double panda sign."" Results: Wilson's ""double panda sign"" feature has been described in several reports. It is formed by the 'giant panda's face' [1] in the midbrain and the 'miniature panda's face' in the pons [2] and results from the maintenance of normal signal intensity in the red nuclei and lateral pars. reticulata of the substantia nigra, hypertensity of the tegmentum and hypointensity of the superior colliculus. The ""miniature panda's face"" is seen within the pontine tegmentum, with hypointensity of the medial longitudinal fascicles and demarcation of the central tegmental tracts, whereas hyperintensity of the cerebral aqueduct is seen.

Combination therapy (administered at intervals to avoid interference) was shifted to zinc-only therapy after normalization of transaminases. At 12 months of treatment, normal transaminases and negative copper balance were considered successful treatment. Clinical and biochemical response time (AST & ALT <60 IU/L) was calculated. Thirty-three cases (median age 127.21+/- 42.27 months) were recorded. Liver transplantation (LT) was recommended for 5 patients with fulminant liver failure. Of the remaining 28 chronic liver disease (CLD) cases: 4 out of 5 presented as acute chronic liver failure (ACLF), and 3 out of 17 decompensated CLD required LT. 6 compensated CLD, 1 in 5 ACLF, and 14 out of 17 decompensated CLD were successfully treated with medical therapy. Twenty-one (75%) of 28 cases were successfully treated with medical therapy. Twenty cases showed clinical response within 6 months and 1 case at 12 months. Fifteen cases showed a biochemical response within 6 months and the remaining 6 cases within 12 months.

1538,Predicting poor outcome in medical treatment at the time of diagnosis in Wilson's Disease (WD) manifesting as Chronic Liver Disease (CLD): Is the new Wilsons index useful?,"Twenty-eight cases of WD that manifested as CLD were treated with D Pencillamine and zinc. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to see the association of risk factors with poor outcomes (liver transplant or death) at the time of diagnosis. Four out of 5 people presenting acutely with chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 3 out of 17 people with decompensated CLD had poor results. All 6 compensated CLDs with decompensated CLD, 1 out of 5 ACLFs, and 14 out of 17 were cured. Bilirubin, AST, ALT, Child Pughs score and New Wilson index score were significantly higher in univariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, there was a significant association between high ALT (adjusted OR 1.062, 95% CI 1.007-1.12, p= 0.015) and low albumin (adjusted OR 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.56, p= 0.028) and poor outcome. With a 20 IU increase in ALT, the singles ratio increased by 3.3 (95% CI: 1.15 to 9.58) and a 1 g decrease in albumin, the singles ratio increased by 0.95 (95% CI: 0.44-0.995) increased.

1539,Joint manifestations and bone changes in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder that causes pathological copper deposition in various organs, particularly the brain and liver. The most common clinical manifestations are the liver form and the neurological-psychiatric form. Problems with the joints are common and affect a high percentage of patients suffering from WD. Joint involvement in WD patients has not been studied in detail until now. WD treatment is very effective. One approach involves treatment with penicillamine. Alternatively, zinc can be used. Treatment should be lifelong. On the other hand, treatment of arthropathy is difficult and often not very successful. The aim was to determine the location and types of changes in the affected joints in a group of patients with WD, and to determine whether there is any relationship between the type of treatment and joint symptoms. Objectives To evaluate the changes in clinical and image evaluation of patients with WD after 5 years. Methods A group of 10 patients with arthropathy was selected from a group of 41 patients with WD. They were evaluated for history, clinical assessments, x-ray and sonography of the affective joints, and bone densitometry of the hip and lumbar spine. The full assessment was repeated 5 years later. Results Ages ranged from 19 to 61, with a mean age of 36. There were 8 women and 2 men. The knee was the most frequently involved joint. Other joints of involvement (in decreasing order of frequency) were wrist, schoulders, metacarpophalangeal joints, ankles, and lumbosacral spine. Patients had 1-15 joint/patient involvement. The physical finding consisted mainly of pain in the affected joints, pain on movement, stiffness, and crepitus. There was limited range of motion in abnormal joints in 5 patients and hypermobility in 2 patients. During a 5-year period, 5 patients had arthritis (clinically and sonographically determined) lasting 1 month to 2 years. Radiographic changes included joint space narrowing, osteophytes, cysts, soft tissue calcification, and bone fragmentation. 3 patients had osteoporosis and 3 patients had osteopenia. After a 5-year period in this group of patients, an increase in the number of affected joints, radiographic changes and a decrease in the T-score of the lumbar spine occur. More radiographic changes may be seen in the patient treated with penicilamine than in the patient treated with zinc. Outcomes Wilson's disease is associated with skeletal morphological damage, early arthrosis, arthritis and osteoporosis. Although all patients were treated with penicillamine or zinc and the neurological-psychiatric and hepatic manifestations were stable, there was progression in arthropathy. There are more changes in patients using penicillin. Studies with larger number of patients are needed.",,"Sleglova, O.;Marecek, Z.",2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-eular.2083,0,0,

Methods: 181 Wilson's disease cases were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Male patients were significantly more than female patients. The number of patients aged 8-29 was significantly higher than other age periods. Liver and extrapyramidal symptoms were the two main initial symptoms. Liver function is impaired in 40-60% of patients. More than 95% of patients had dysfunction in liver ultrasound, encephalic CT, and encephalic MRI. Penicillamine was generally effective. The main cause of death was liver failure. Conclusion: Wilson's disease is frequently seen in men and young people. Liver and extrapyramidal symptoms are the main clinical symptoms. Liver ultrasound and encephalic CT/MRI should be one of the auxiliary diagnostic devices. Liver function was impaired before symptoms appeared.

In our center, we report the clinical features, treatments and outcomes of WD patients. Methods: All WD patients (n=35) referred to our center between 2000 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 16 [range = 8-59] and 60% were female. Five (14.3%) gave a history of parental consanguinity. There was only liver involvement in 31 (88.6%) patients, and mixed neurological and liver involvement in 4 (11.4%) patients. Nine (25.7%) were fulminant WD, 14 (40%) had chronic WD with hepatic decompensation, and 12 (34.3%) were without hepatic decompensation. Serum ceruloplasmin was less than 0.2 g/L in all patients [median = 0.12 g/L, range = <0.06-0.24], 27 (77.1%) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 25 Urinary copper excretion was above 1.6 umol/L in 1 (83.3%) of them. days [median = 6.34 µmol/day, range = 1.71-65.07]. First-line treatments were penicillamine monotherapy (54.3%), penicillamine plus zinc (42.9%), and one (2.8%) did not receive any treatment as he died soon after admission. Complications such as hematuria (n = 2), proteinuria (n = 1), hematologic (n = 1), IgA nephropathy (n = 1), hyperprolactinemia (n = 1), and myasthenia gravis developed in 13 (38.2%) penicillamine patients . (n = 1), breast engorgement (n = 1), mucositis (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), and rashes (n = 4). Thirteen patients' medications were changed to trientine (n = 6), zinc (n = 3), trientine plus zinc (n = 2), and penicillamine plus zinc (n = 2). One patient underwent liver transplantation due to poor response to penicillamine therapy. Median follow-up was 24 months (0.06-132). At the end of the follow-up, 37.1% died in fulminant WD and the mortality rate was 77.8%. Conclusions: WD in our society affects more women with chronic WD diagnosed at a young age and predominantly with hepatic decompensation. All patients had low ceruloplasmin and high rate of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Penicillamine intolerance occurred in 38.2%. The mortality rate was 37.1%.",,"Shahar, H.;Tan, S. S.;Shamsul, A.

1542,Trientine encapsulated nanoparticles can chelate hepatic and brain copper and reverse neurological disorders caused by chronic Cu intoxication.,"Animal models of Wilson's disease rarely exhibit neurological disorders and brain copper deposition, hindering the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in Wilson's disease patients. The aim of this study was to (1) investigate the effects of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate (0.15 mg Cu/100 g BW) on copper and zinc levels in liver and brain tissues and neurobehavioral functions of male Wistar rats daily for 90 days on copper-poisoned rats. Copper-treated animals exhibited significantly reduced serum AChE activity, increased hepatic metallothionein-I gene expression, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory compared to control rats. Rats poisoned with copper showed an increase in copper and zinc with a significant increase in copper content (99.1%, 73% and 74.9% increase, respectively), a 40.7% decrease in hepatic zinc content, and interestingly a 77.1% increase in hippocampal zinc content in liver, hippocampus and kidney tissues. levels in serum and urine compared to control rats. Massive grade 4 copper accumulation and grade 1 copper-associated protein in hepatocytes of copper-poisoned rats were confirmed by rhodanin and orcein stains, respectively. Rats poisoned with copper showed swelling and increased astrocytes count, copper deposition in the choroid plexus, and neuronal degeneration. Trientine NPs of average size (355 nm) and encapsulation efficiency (28%) were synthesized. The therapy based on nanoparticles resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic and brain Cu content. HPLC studies showed increased Trientine concentration in liver and brain tissues with NP treatment compared to conventional Trientine treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the first in vivo evidence that Trientine-encapsulated NPs can significantly reverse disorders caused by chronic copper intoxication in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Vasishta, R.

Treatment is based on chelators and/or zinc. Efficacy of monotherapy with zinc Weiss et al. [one]. Objective: To evaluate the reasons for treatment changes in WD patients diagnosed in childhood. Methods: Forty-four patients with WD referred to our Department of Pediatrics (1984-2012) were analyzed. 42 had hepatic presentation and 2 were recruited for family screening. The type of treatment performed for each patient was classified as follows: d-penicillamine; zinc salts; Combination of d-penicillamine and zinc. Reasons for treatment changes were: treatment failure, adverse events, patient demand (not associated with adverse events), and maintenance regimen. We excluded treatment discontinuation associated with switching to maintenance therapy from our analysis. We calculated the duration of each treatment block until a drug change or the end of the follow-up period. We analyzed events of treatment changes using the Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: Of the 48 evaluated patients, 44 (31 males, median age at diagnosis = 5.9 years, range = 1-16.9) were selected for treatment analysis. Changes in medical therapy were common events resulting in a total of 79 treatment blocks (32 penicillamine treatments, 35 zinc treatments, and 12 combination treatments). Of these, 76 (31 penicillamine treatments, 34 zinc treatments, and 11 combination treatments) were eligible for analysis. A drug change was observed in 4 of the 34 zinc blocks (12%), 13 of the 31 penicillamine blocks (42%), and 4 of the 11 combination blocks (36%) not associated with switching to maintenance therapy due to treatment failure or adverse events. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events most commonly in patients taking penicillamine 6 (5 penicillamine, 1 combination) 42 blocks of therapy were therefore discontinued. Treatment failure-related drug changes were observed in 16 (21%) of 76 blocks: 8 (26%) of 31 penicillamine treatments, 4 (12%) of 34 zinc blocks, and 4 (36%) of 11 combination blocks. . This reached statistical significance comparing zinc with combination therapy, but not between zinc and penicillamine. Among treatment-failure blocks, non-adherence was noted in 1 (12%) of 8 treatments, 2 (12%) of 4 zinc treatments, and 4 (100%) of 4 combination treatments. Conclusion: Treatment failure and/or discontinuation due to adverse events were more common with penicillamine than with zinc.

Objective: To describe a series of patients with WD, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, and autonomic dysfunction. Methods: After IRB approval, we evaluated 4 patients with WD and parkinsonism for the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction and performed the water-induced skin wrinkle test - SWT (Teoh, JNNP 2008;79:835). Results: Patient 1: A 37-year-old female patient who presented with cirrhosis, aged 33, was diagnosed with WD and was treated with ZnSO4, penicillamine, and pyridoxine/complex B vitamins. Since the age of 35 he developed pramipexole and levodopa responsive parkinsonism with burning and numbness in the arms and genital area and urinary incontinence. NCS/EMG was normal. Water-induced SWT revealed small fiber dysfunction (mean 4-digit wrinkling 1). Patient 2: A 23-year-old man was diagnosed with WD at the age of 14 and was treated with penicillamine+pyridoxine. Since age 21, he has developed levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with resting tremor, weight loss, dysphagia, and dysphonia. NCS/EMG was normal but waterborne SWT was abnormal (mean wrinkling 0.25). Patient 3: A 34-year-old male presented with episodes of psychosis, behavioral disorder, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, and loss of consciousness. He was treated with penicillamine and complex B vitamins. NCS/EMG and waterborne SWT were normal (mean wrinkling 4).

1545,D-penicillamine versus zinc sulfate as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a treatable inherited disorder of copper metabolism. However, there is no international consensus on first-line treatment. Objective: Our aim was to compare the course of treatment in patients with symptomatic WD who started with d-penicillamine (DPA) or zinc sulfate (ZS) as the drug of choice. Patients and methods: We included 143 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic WD between 2005 and 2009. The decision about the first-line therapy drug was made at the discretion of the physician. Data were analyzed in subgroups with predominantly neuropsychiatric and hepatic WD. Results: Neurological and enzymatic improvements were achieved with similar frequency. In patients with neuropsychiatric WD, the probability of staying in first-line therapy was similar for DPA and ZS (20% versus 24% at follow-up). In patients with hepatic WD, it was significantly higher for ZS (31% vs 12%). After adjusting for WD type, gender, age at diagnosis, and at least the presence of severe liver symptoms, patients treated with DPA were more likely to experience worsening within the first 6 months of treatment (OR 3.84, 95% CI: 1.15–3.85). Patients on DPA were significantly more compliant (81% vs 94%), but experienced more adverse events (15% vs. 3%). Conclusions: DPA and ZS are effective in most WD patients. Despite some differences, none seem overtly superior. Therefore, ZS can be considered as a reasonable alternative to DPA as first-line therapy.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Karlinski, M.;Czerska, M.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.467,0,1,
1546,Wilson's disease and psychiatric disorders: Is there any indication of comorbidity or relapse?,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a rare pathology caused by the alteration of the ATP7B gene in the long arm of chromosome 13. This includes reduced transport of copper in the bile and its accumulation in the body, especially in the brain. Objective: The aim of this study is to show the importance of psychiatric disorders in WD. Case report: A 25-year-old woman with a personal history of Wilson's disease (WD) presented with acute psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric interview finds a concept of suicidal psychomotor agitation, aggression and depressed mood. He also has bilateral extra-pyramidal syndrome. Copper and ceruloplasmin blood levels were precipitated. The patient confirmed that he had discontinued D-penicillamine therapy two months ago. Discussion: WD starts as hepatic, neurological or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of patients. In some rare cases, the first signs of the disease may be psychiatric, accounting for only 10%. The illness may then include isolated behavior problems, a schizophrenic syndrome, or a manic-depressive syndrome. The main challenge was to determine whether psychiatric disorders were included in the WD array. Indeed, neuropsychiatric comorbidity is important in the context of WD. Poor adherence, copper balance, and recovery after D-penicillamine reintroduction confirm psychiatric relapse of WD. Conclusion: Psychiatric symptoms in WD may precede somatic disorders, may be complicated or independent. Early diagnosis is necessary to provide specific treatment.",,"Mrabet, S.;Ellouze, F.;Mrad, M.

1547,Increased seizure frequency due to copper deficiency in Wilson's disease,"Background: Epileptic seizures have been reported in 6-7% of patients in Wilson's disease (WD), mostly following chelator therapy. Penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency, direct copper toxicity, pathological changes, metabolic encephalopathy, and rarely copper deficiency are the mechanisms attributed to seizures. Purpose: To present a patient with WD and intractable seizures receiving strict copper-restricted diet and chelator and antiepileptic therapy. Patients and methods: A-29-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with recurrent seizures. He had previously been diagnosed with WD and epilepsy with penicillamine, zinc acetate and carbamazepine treatment in another center. Complex partial and less frequently secondary generalized seizures started after penicillamine ingestion and initially responded well to carbamazepine. She complained that the frequency of daily seizures, which ranged from 5 to 10, had increased in recent months. Results: Despite effective serum carbamazepine level and adjunctive therapy with levetiracetam and replacement of chelator therapy with trientine and oral pyridoxine, the daily frequency of seizures did not decrease and was attributed to low serum copper [0.3 mug/dl (70-140)]. seizures. The zinc acetate and strict copper restricted diet was terminated. During the follow-up, the frequency of seizures decreased as serum copper levels increased [16 mug/dl (70-140)]. Conclusion: Epileptic seizures in WD respond well to antiepileptic treatment. In this case, additional antiepileptic and pyridoxine treatment did not reduce the frequency of seizures. The association between decreased seizure frequency and increased serum copper levels suggests that copper deficiency may cause persistent seizures in patients receiving chelator therapy with a strict copper-restricted diet.",,"Kaleagasi, H.;Oksuz, N.;Ozal, S.;Yilmaz, A.;Dogu, O.",2013,2022-10-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2013.07.209,0,0,
1548,A neuropsychiatric presentation of the Wilson disease case report,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease of human copper metabolism, characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the body, especially in the brain, liver, kidney and cornea. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease can easily be overlooked. About half (40%) of people with Wilson's disease have neurological or liver symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms related to Wilson's disease are present in 15% of patients. Objective: To present an adolescent case who applied to Tuzla University Clinical Center Psychiatry Clinic, initially with psychiatric and neurological symptoms, was diagnosed with etiological reason based on biochemical abnormalities of copper metabolism, was treated and treated with etiological therapy. Effect. Case report: An 18-year-old boy who applied to Tuzla University Clinical Center Psychiatry Department with behavioral disorders such as indifference to the environment, decreased interactions with the family, and aphasia symptoms. Neurological examination revealed drooling, protruding tongue, and general tooth stiffness. Symptomatic treatment started without therapeutic efficacy. After laboratory examinations, low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, positive Kayser-Fleischer rings in ophthalmoscopic examination with slit lamp, and neurodegenerative disease in head computed tomography were diagnosed as Wilson's disease. The patient, whose psychiatric observation and treatment was started, was referred to Tuzla University Clinical Center Neurology Department. The patient responded very well to treatment with D-penicillamine, Clozapine, essential phospholipids, vitamins and pyridoxine. Regular follow-up is recommended to evaluate the outcome.",,"Aljukic, N.;Sutovic, A.;Avdic, L.;Pajevic, I.;Hasanovic, M.",2013,,,0,0,
1549,Isosteric analogs of natural polyamines with altered carbon chain length and additional amino groups,"The cationic biogenic polyamines spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) interact with negatively charged components of cells and are essential for their growth and viability. Spm and Spd are positively charged at physiological pH (7.4), and the localization of the charges defines their recognition. Changing the carbon chain length and adding the extra amino group(s) to the polyamine backbone results in isosteric analogs with a reduced degree of protonation. The total net charge of 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane (SpmTrien), the spm isostere, is +3 at physiological pH [1], while 1,8-diamino-3,6-diazaoctane, ( Triene, the Spd analog) ) is +2. Although these analogs have different localizations and total net charges, they still have some of the properties of their parent polyamines. Triene, an excellent chelator of Cu2+ ions, is used to treat Wilson's disease when the person is penicillamine intolerant and has recently been shown to improve left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with type 2 diabetes [2]. Triene is a weak imitation of Spd: it penetrates poorly into cells and cannot perform most of the cellular functions of Spd. However, Triene exhibits some of the substrate properties of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) reaction [3], but its physiological acetylating enzyme is thialicin N-acetyltransferase [4]. SpmTrien is a more successful imitation of Spm: it penetrates cells efficiently and can perform some Spm cellular functions [3]. In cells and in vivo, SpmTriene is acetylated by SSAT1 and then oxidized to Triene by acetylpolyamine oxidase [3,5]. Therefore, SpmTrien can be considered as a bioactive precursor of Triene.",,"Weisell, J.;Hyvonen, M.;Khomutov, A.;Alhonen, L.;Vepsalainen, J.;Keinanen, T.",2013,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12340,0,0,
1550,Different types of facial dystonia in a patient with Wilson's disease treated with botulinum toxin type A,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A (BoTN-A) treatment in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) and multiple facial dystonia and retrocollis. To describe the different types of abnormal movement demonstrated by this patient. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism characterized by impaired excretion of this metal resulting in accumulation of this metal in multiple organs such as the liver, brain, and cornea. Clinically, patients present with psychiatric, neurological or hepatic symptoms. BoNT therapy is the first-choice approach for most focal dystonias, including those associated with WD. Methods: A 20-year-old girl presented with a 9-month history of abnormal behavior, mild symmetric parkinsonism, dysarthria, and severe short-term retrocollis crisis and blepharospasm. Neurological examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings, grinning facial expression, continuous open mouth smile, dystonic low jaw, and mildly symmetrical parkinsonism. Irregular and frequent severe blepharospasm crisis and retrocollis were present. Brain MRI showed bilateral basal ganglia T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity, including the midbrain, thalamus, putamen, and white matter. Serum ceruloplasmin and urine copper studies confirmed the diagnosis of WD. Zinc and D penicillamine therapy was established. Different types of facial dystonias and retrocollis were treated with BoTN-A with an appropriate protocol. Results: BoTN-A improved facial and cervical dystonia by 80% with mild side effects (blurred vision). Improvement in quality of life was visible. Careful visual analysis revealed different types of facial dystonias with risus sardonicus, including grinning facial expression, persistent open mouth smile, dystonic low jaw, and irregular and frequent attacks of severe blepharospasm and retrocollis. Conclusions: BoTN-A is a safe and effective treatment for different types of facial dystonia and retrocolis associated with WD. Combination of different types of facial dystonias and retrocollis should suggest WD.",,"Ramos Burbano, G.;Echeverry, A.;Ramirez, C.;Ramos Alarcon, G.;Ramos Arevalo, A.

1551,Initial zinc therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease with acute liver failure and copper intoxication: a clinical observation.,"Objective: (1) whether initial zinc therapy works for liver failure in WD; (2) liver transplantation can be prevented by initial zinc therapy; (3) there is any correlation between normalized copper levels and clinical improvement. Background: Copper deposition in the brain and liver has been hypothesized to be responsible for neurodegeneration and liver disease in WD. Thus, while treatment aims to promote the urinary excretion of copper by chelators, since 1961 there has been conclusive evidence to support the idea of normalizing copper poisoning with zinc. Methods: In an observational study of a 10-year-old girl with WD presenting with acute liver failure, hemolytic anemia, and elevated urinary copper, liver function and copper were retrospectively checked before and after initial zinc therapy. The patient was given 125 mg/day elemental zinc. Liver transplantation was also considered. Liver enzymes, bilirubin, and urinary copper were controlled at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks with zinc therapy. Results: The patient improved biochemically and clinically according to 86% urinary copper decrease in 10 days with zinc treatment. The revised WD prognostic index increased from 13 to 5 and the patient was removed from the transplant list. After 2, 4, 8 weeks of zinc treatment, AST, ALT, bilirubin, urinary copper showed steady improvements of up to 62.26%, 82, 77%, respectively, up to week eight. Results for the second 8-week period showed another 25, 41, 48, 86 and 33% reductions for serum-free copper compared to previous results, respectively. No adverse events or clinical deterioration were observed during the 16-week treatment period. Conclusions: The results show that zinc is a promising, fast-acting, safe and affordable option for the treatment of copper intoxication in WD with acute liver failure. It also supports the hypothesis of normalization of elevated serum-free copper, which, instead of stimulating excretion of accumulated copper, can both save lives and result in an expensive and risky liver transplant.",,"Avan, A.;Kianifar, H.

1552,Effective transition from conventional chelation therapy to evidence-based zinc monotherapy in four patients with Wilson's disease and parkinsonism,"Objective: To compare clinical improvement in patients with Wilson's disease (1) following normalization of elevated serum and urinary free copper instead of excretion of copper accumulation, and (2) treatment of zinc with and without penicillamine. Background: The treatment of Wilson's disease for years has aimed to stimulate excretion of accumulated copper with chelating agents. However, the dilemma arises when patients paradoxically worsen on them. On the other hand, zinc is often underestimated by limiting it to maintenance or concomitant therapy. While chelators increase free copper levels in serum and urine, zinc normalizes values by interrupting intestinal copper absorption. Methods: In a retrospective observational study of four Wilson patients with parkinsonism who were initially treated with penicillamine with or without zinc, we compared subjective and objective clinical improvement before and after switching to zinc monotherapy. Results: Three out of four patients who worsened on penicillamine (0.5-1 gram daily) significantly improved to normal biochemical and clinical status on zinc (150 milligrams daily). The fourth patient, who took penicillamine (250 milligrams daily) plus zinc (200 milligrams daily), showed improvement in the lower extremities during the first month, while significantly improved on zinc monotherapy over the following months. Conclusions: The results of four patients suggest that zinc is a promising, safe and cost-effective treatment for patients with copper intoxication and neurological Wilson's disease. They also support the idea of normalizing increased serum and urine copper values rather than stimulating excretion of accumulated copper that induces free copper intoxication.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.

1553,Current status of Wilson's disease: Does early treatment protect from nervous system disorder?,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Wilson's disease (WD) on the nervous system in early treated (ET) patients with long disease duration. Background: Neurological disorders (ND) have been frequently described during the course of WD, especially when treatment is delayed. In recent years, most cases of WD have been diagnosed with early treatment when childhood hypertransaminasemia (HT) occurs, apparently because it does not indicate later disease progression. Methods: A clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological evaluation was performed in patients with WD with long-term disease and treatment. Clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the neurologic portion of the ""global assessment scale"" (GAS) for WD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed to examine central conduction time and cortical excitability with the paired pulse technique investigating short-range cortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation. A brain MRI scan was performed for each patient. Results: From 2011 to 2012, 27 patients (16 M, age range 13-47 years) with a mean disease duration of 16.5 years (7-28) were evaluated. All patients started treatment immediately after diagnosis and are currently using pennicillamine. (6 patients) or zinc acetate (21 patients). TMS and brain MRI studies were normal in 23 subjects who were diagnosed with WD due to HT in childhood and had never reported ND. The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed with ND onset in adolescence, of which only 2 still showed neurological signs (VAS 16-18), but all had brain MRI changes while TMS findings were normal. Conclusions: The natural course of WD seems to have changed since the nervous system is not affected when diagnosed in childhood in patients who received early treatment in recent years (Ala A 2007). Our study confirms that ET patients who do not show ND at baseline do not show neurological clinical signs even after a long course of disease. The normality of TMS and brain MRI studies also suggests that there is no sublicnic nervous system disorder.",,"Esposito, M.;Dubbioso, R.;Manganelli, F.;Ranucci, G.;Didato, F.;Matarazzo, M.;Iorio, R.;Santoro, L.",2013,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25605,0,1,
1554,Levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism and small fiber dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: To describe a series of patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and Wilson's disease (WD) associated with autonomic dysfunction. Background: Patients with WD present or develop a wide variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms during the course of the disease. Several reports have described autonomic dysfunction in WD patients. Methods: Chart review of 4 WD patients who were evaluated for the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction and who underwent a water-induced skin wrinkle test (Teoh, JNNP 2008;79:835). This work was approved by the local institutional IRB. Results: Patient 1: A 37-year-old patient admitted with cirrhosis, aged 33, was diagnosed with WD and was treated with ZnSO4, penicillamine, and pyridoxine/complex B vitamins. Since the age of 35, he has developed pramipexole and levodopa-sensitive parkinsonism, burning and numbness in the arms and genital area, and urinary incontinence. The NCS/EMG was normal, but the waterborne skin wrinkle test (SWT) revealed small fiber dysfunction (mean 4-digit wrinkling 1). Patient 2: A 23-year-old patient was diagnosed with WD at the age of 14 and has since been treated with penicillamine and pyridoxine. Since age 21, he has developed levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with resting tremor, weight loss, dysphagia, and dysphonia. NCS/EMG was normal but waterborne SWT was abnormal (mean 4-digit wrinkle 0.25). Patient 3: A 34-year-old patient presented with psychosis and marked behavioral disorder, followed by episodes of levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and unconsciousness. She has a family history of WD and has been treated with penicillamine and complex B vitamins. NCS/EMG and waterborne SWT were normal (mean 4-digit crease 4). Patient 4: A 38-year-old patient who was admitted with liver dysfunction, behavioral changes and parkinsonism (resting tremor in the upper extremities and akinetic-rigid state) at the age of 24 was diagnosed with WD. He was treated with penicillamine and biperiden. Parkinsonism almost completely subsided after treatment with penicillamine. Waterborne SWT was normal (mean 4-digit wrinkling 3.6). Conclusions: A subset of WD patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism also exhibit abnormalities in the skin wrinkle test (autonomic dysfunction).",,"Gondim, F. A.;Araujo, D. F.;Oliveira, I.

1555,Changes in cortical excitability and central motor conduction time in patients with Wilson's disease,"Purpose: To determine cortical excitability changes in patients with WD by measuring cortical resting motor threshold (RMT) and Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Background: Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, causes widespread structural changes in the central nervous system. However, little is known about neuronal dysfunction in this disorder. Methods: The subjects of this study were 13 patients (10 males and 3 females) diagnosed with WD based on Kayser-Fleischer presence and biochemical parameters. TMS was performed using an eight-figure coil connected to the Magstim 200 stimulator. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) at rest. RMT was determined using standard techniques and the CMCT 'F' wave method. Comparisons were made with data from 26 healthy controls. Results: The mean age of the patients was 19.5 +/- 9.5 years, the mean age of symptom onset was 16.5 +/- 10.7 years, and the mean disease duration was 2.8 +/- 2.5 years. Eleven of 13 patients were receiving zinc sulfate and/or penicillamine treatment, and two patients were not using any medication. The presenting symptom was dysarthria in five patients (38.5%). Chorea, tremor, dystonia, and abnormal gait were the presenting symptoms in two patients (15.4%). RMT could be recorded in 10 patients and not in three patients. Compared with controls, patients with WD with recordable RMT had a significantly higher mean RMT as well as CMCT (RMT: 80.9 +/- 14.8 vs. 41.1 +/- 7, p < 0.0001; CMCT: 6.7 +/- 0.5 ms vs. 4.8 +/- 0.6 ms; p < 0.0001). Three patients for whom RMT could not be recorded had disease durations of 4, 2, and 1 years. In two of these three patients, an MEP can be achieved with active contraction of true FDI. The CMCT in these two patients was also prolonged (8.8 ms vs 5.6 ms). Conclusions: Cortical excitability is decreased and central motor conduction time is prolonged in patients with WD, which may be due to intracortical presynaptic motor impairment. Follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether these changes are reversible with copper removal therapy.",,"Jhunjhunwala, K. R.;Prashant, D. K.;Pal, P.

1556,A case of Wilson's disease with lid-opening apraxia treated with botulinum toxin.,"Objective: To describe the response to botulinum toxin injection in severe neuropsychiatric Wilson's disease with lid opening apraxia. Background: It is well known that ocular manifestations such as Kayser-Fleischer rings and sunflower cataract are associated with Wilson's disease. Other ocular findings have been reported and are sometimes thought to be incidental. To our knowledge, valve opening apraxia has only been described once in 1988 by JR Keane. There are no cases of valve opening apraxia treated with botulinum injection in Wilson's disease. Methods: The patient experienced worsening of neurological status with the development of valve opening apraxia after initiation of d-penicillamine. He used sensory tricks to open his eyes. He was nearly functionally blind and needed help walking because his eyes were closed. No weakness or ptosis was detected on examination. We injected OnabotulinumtoxinA bilaterally into the upper and lower eyelids, pretarsal part of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Ocular findings also showed Kayser-Fleischer rings, sunflower cataracts, ocular flutter and square wave tremors. Results: Two days after the injection, the patient noticed a dramatic improvement in his condition with a significant improvement in quality of life. No side effects were reported. Conclusions: This is the second case of valve opening apraxia in Wilson's disease and the first reported response to botulinum toxin injection. Our findings also reinforce the idea that apraxia of valve opening is pretarsal dystonia with the presence of sensory manipulations, association with lower facial dystonia (risus sardonicus) and response to botulinum toxin injection.",,"Dufresne, A.

1557,Brain metal accumulation in Wilson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the copper, iron, zinc, and manganese concentrations in WD brain autopsy tissues and their relationship to the WD phenotypic presentation. BACKGROUND: Wilson's Disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper tissue deposition mainly in the liver and brain. Previous studies have shown that deposition of other metals in brain tissue occurs in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. However, this issue has not been quantitatively studied in WD until now. Design/Methods: The study material consisted of 17 brains (12 WD patients, 5 controls) obtained from autopsy. Samples were taken from 4 different regions of each brain: frontal cortex, putamen, nucleus dentatus, and pons. Copper, manganese and zinc levels were assessed using plasma mass spectrometry. Iron concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The clinical presentation of WD was considered hepatic or neuropsychiatric. RESULTS: Copper content was homogeneously increased in all examined structures of WD brains compared to controls (41.0+/-18.6 vs. 5.4+/-1.8 mg/g, p<0.01). Manganese and zinc concentrations in WD brains were similar to controls and did not differ between analyzed brain parts. However, iron concentration in the core dentatus was significantly higher in WD brains (56.8+/-14.1 vs. 32.6+/-6.0 µg/g, p<0.05). There was no correlation between any metal concentration in any part of the brain and the clinical manifestation of WD. CONCLUSION: According to our findings, copper accumulates in different regions of the brain during WD, regardless of the dominant phenotypic presentation. Zinc and manganese do not seem to be involved in pathology. However, increasing amounts of iron appear to accumulate in the nucleus dentatus. We think that this effect may be due to the decreased ceruloplasmin level, but more studies are needed.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Litwin, T.;Gromadzka, G.;Szpak, G.;Bulska, E.",2013,,,0,0,
1558,Therapeutic efficacy of D-penicillamine encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles in a rat model of copper toxicity with neurobehavioral disorders.,"Animal models of Wilson's disease (WD) ie. Long evans cinnamon rats rarely exhibit neurological symptoms, which hinders the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat neurological manifestations in WD patients. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of copper lactate injected intraperitoneally for 90 days, especially on copper and zinc levels in liver, kidney and brain tissues; expression of hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) and Atp7b gene; and MT-III and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioral functions in the brains of male Wistar rats and 2. Therapeutic evaluation of D-penicillamine encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticles administered orally in Wistar rats poisoned with Cu for 90 days. Reverse transcription-PCR and Morris water maze test were used for expression and neurobehavioral studies. Copper-poisoned animals showed increased expression of the hepatic MT-I gene with significantly increased ceruloplasmin, serum and urinary copper levels, and decreased serum acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory. However, no changes were observed in the expression levels of the hepatic Atp7b gene; and the MT-III and AChE gene in the brain. Cu-poisoned rats showed a significant increase in copper content (99.1, 73, and 74.9% increase, respectively), a decrease in liver zinc (40% decrease), and interestingly, an increase in brain zinc content (77.1% increase) in liver, brain, and kidney tissues. controls mice. Histopathological studies showed grade 4 copper deposits in liver with rhodanin and orcein dyes, respectively, and grade 1 copper-associated protein in liver tissues of test rats. Swelling of astrocytes was observed in the cerebral cortex sections of the brain tissues of Cu-poisoned rats. D-penicillamine encapsulated alginate/chitosan nanoparticle treatment resulted in a significant reduction in liver and brain Cu content, serum ceruloplasmin level, and serum AChE activity, along with improvement in neurological functions. In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity may cause an increase in copper content in the liver and brain, an increase in hepatic MT-I gene expression, an increase in ceruloplasmin levels, and neurobehavioral disorders by interfering with acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission; however, D-penicillamine encapsulated nanoparticles can significantly reverse the disorders caused by chronic Cu intoxication in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Badyal, R.;Vasishta, R.

Objective: To determine the rate of liver cirrhosis in children with WD. Materials and Methods: 101 children (boys - 50; females - 51; mean age 12.3+/- 2.9 years). Decreased serum ceruloplasmin (SC), increased urinary copper excretion: the presence of Kaiser-Fleischer rings (CF) after basal (Cu0) and D-penicillamine loading (Cu1), increased liver copper content and genetically supported the diagnosis of WD. analysis. Cirrhosis is diagnosed based on morphological data or complex laboratory and instrumental research. Results: At the first diagnosis, WD liver cirrhosis was detected in 44 (43.6%) children aged 13.3+/- 2.1 years: in children under 12 years old - 14 (31.1%) and over 12 years old - even in 30 ( 53.6%) patients (p < 0.05). In children with liver cirrhosis, presence of extrapyramidal neurological symptoms - 36.4% of cases, presence of CF - 68.2% of children, acute Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia (HA) - significantly in 20.5% (p < 0.05) noted more often. children compared with patients with WD in the absence of cirrhotic liver transformation (n = 57) with a proportion of neurological symptoms - 10.5%, presence of CF - 24.6%, presence of HA - 3.5%. In children with WD at the stage of liver cirrhosis: Cu0 189.5 [111.1; 492.9] mcg/24h, Cu1 2015.5+/-1206.7 mcg/24h, significantly exceeding this value in children with WD in the absence of liver cirrhosis: Cu0 100.8 [74.7, 133.0] mcg/24h, Cu1 1529.0+/-866.9 mcg/ 24 hours (p < 0.05). SC does not depend on the stage of WD: in liver cirrhosis, SC is 9.1+/-5.2 mg/dl and in its absence - 11.3+/-7.6 mg/dl (p > 0.05). Conclusion: There is a late diagnosis of WD in pediatric practice, which leads to a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis in 43.6%.

Setting and method: A retrospective, observational study covering a 1-year period (01-05-2011 to 01-05-2012) in patients diagnosed with RD during treatment for OD in Andorra. Estimated population is about 80,000 people and this country has only one hospital, Data 1. Data records of inpatient/outpatient pharmacy software (Farmatools) and cost in euros to determine the MH given by the hospital pharmacy department and to obtain the variables for Drug use in units . 2. OD sales report imported by international wholesaler during the training period. OD demands of community pharmacies are included. 3. Orphanet web page to identify variables: MD/RD indication association and estimated prevalence of RD in Europe (reviewed May 2012). We include OD with European marketing authorization. It is also included in the Triemtine as it has orphan status. Main outcome measures: MH type, RD type, number of patients diagnosed and treated, MH cost (euro), Annual budget of Pharmacy Hospital drugs (euro). Results: 18 patients, 50% male, 67% adult (14-64 years old) and 33% elderly (>65 years old) were identified in OD treatment for RD. The overall prevalence was 8 different RDs and the patient/RD ratio was 2.25 (range 1-5) to 18/80,000 (equivalent to 22.5/100,000).

1562,Hepatocellular carcinoma in a case of Wilson's disease,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma and other tumors of the liver are extremely rare in Wilson's disease. We present a 41-year-old patient who presented with hepatocellular carcinoma due to Wilson's disease. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 16. A 41-year-old was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, radiographic mass in the right lobe of the liver, and multiple pulmonary nodules. The patient died 7 days after admission. We believe that patients with Wilson's disease should be considered at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Aliver imaging and alpha-fetoprotien level should be included in the follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: In this article, we describe a young patient with HCC-associated Wilson's disease who was diagnosed with HCC after 25 years of penicillamine and zinc therapy. Results: Wilson's disease is a hepatolinticular degeneration caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for the production of the protein important for the transport of copper and the removal of excess free copper from the body. D-Penicillamine contains a free sulfhydryl group that acts as a copper chelating moiety. Its main effect is to increase the urinary excretion of copper and decrease the affinity of proteins for copper. Oral zinc inhibits the absorption of copper, induces metallothionein (an endogenous chelator of metals) in enterocytes, which has a greater affinity for copper than zinc, preventing it from binding luminal copper and thus entering the circulation [7, 8]. Hepatic copper is hypothesized to have a protective effect against malignant transformation [9, 10]. Some studies have found that copper can prevent HCC formation [11, 12]. However, patients with long-standing Wilson's disease who continue on D-penicillamine therapy are at greater risk of developing HCC. On the other hand, patients with Wilson's disease require lifelong treatment. Discontinuation of therapy may lead to the development of acute failure. In this case report, long disease duration with pinicillamine treatment played a role in the presence of HCC. Whether copper increases or reduces the risk of HCC remains to be determined [13]. Several important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been identified and have a well-known impact on the development of HCC. These include hepatitis B carrier status, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hereditary hemochromatosis, and cirrhosis of almost any cause [14]. The development of HCC in patients with Wilson's disease is extremely rare. In conclusion, earlier detection of HCC with periodic alphafetopritene level checks and abdominal US checks of patients with Wilson's disease and other treatment modalities of HCC, namely surgical resection, Radiofrequency ablation, Transarterial chemoembolization, or another modality that may be indicated. The possibility of being included in a transplant program may benefit patients in some cases. Conclusion: In conclusion, it is recommended that patients with Wilson's disease should be followed up periodically with alpha-fetopritylene level controls and abdominal US, to detect HCC earlier and to benefit from surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation from other treatment methods of HCC. , Transarterial chemoembolization or other modality that may be specified.

Mutations in the SLC30A10 gene, which encodes a manganese transporter, cause the syndrome of hepatic cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia, and hypermanganeseemia. Methods: We present the 10-year longitudinal clinical characteristics, MRI data, and treatment response to chelation therapy of the originally identified patient with a proven homozygous mutation in SLC30A10. Results: The patient presented with early-onset generalized dystonia and mild hyperbilirubinemia accompanied by high whole blood manganese levels. T1 sequences on MRI showed hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, characteristic of manganese deposition. Treatment with intravenous disodium calcium edetate led to clinical improvement and reduction of hyperintensities in brain imaging.

1567,Molecular basis of memory,"We propose a triple biochemical mechanism for memory. There are three physiological components: the neuron (individual and circuit), the surrounding neural extracellular matrix, and various trace metals dispersed in the matrix. Binding of a metal cation affects a corresponding nanostructure (contraction, bending, expansion) and dielectric sensitivity of the chelating node (address) within the matrix lattice sensed by the neuron. The neural extracellular matrix functions as an electro-elastic cage; where neurons manipulate multiple trace metals (n > 10) to encode, store and decode cognitive information. The proposed mechanism explains the low energy requirements of the brain and high storage capacity rates, defined as multiples of Avogadro's number (N<inf>A</inf> = 6 x 10<sup>23</sup>). Supporting evidence links memory loss to monitoring metal toxicity or deficiency, or impairment or disruption in the introduction/transport of metals into the matrix. Inherited diseases revolving around dysfunctional trace metal metabolism and memory dysfunction include Alzheimer's disease (Al, Zn, Fe), Wilson's disease (Cu), thalassemia (Fe), and autism (metallothionein). The triple mechanism points to electro-elastic interactions of neurons with trace metals distributed in the neural extracellular matrix as the molecular basis of ""synaptic plasticity"" that influences short-term memory, long-term memory, and forgetting. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Marx, G.;Gilon, C.",2012,2022-08-15 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cn300097b,0,0,

In this article, we show that a new prion-based contrast agent, P57/Gd, can selectively image tissues with excessive copper deposition using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). P57/Gd selectivity binds copper(II) to other physiologically relevant cations such as zinc, iron, manganese and calcium. To simulate a metabolic copper disorder, we administered an intraperitoneal injection of CuSO<inf>4</inf> solution to mice to induce copper overload in the kidneys.

1570,Therapeutic recommendations in latent chronic hypertransaminasemia,"Less than 25% of asymptomatic adults have elevated transaminase levels at initial evaluation, with one-third of these patients having normal values on repeat testing. Some of those with elevated ALT on repeat test proved to be suffering from acute liver disease (with normal ALT in less than 6 months) and others represent the category of chronic (more than 6 months) elevation of transaminases. The etiology of chronic hypertransaminasemia can be elucidated in 90% of cases due to liver disease of occult/atypical evolution or to extrahepatic causes of chronic elevation of transaminases. The remaining 10% represents the category of unexplained (undetermined cause) elevation of transaminases. Latent/atypical evolution is represented by liver diseases, chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), congestion liver, drugs and liver toxicants, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, a1 antitrypsin deficiency, parasitic. diseases. Extrahepatic causes determining chronic elevations of transaminases; hemolysis, smooth muscle diseases (polymyositis), occult celiac disease, adrenal insufficiency, thyroid pathology. 10% of patients whose etiology is still unexplained remain witches. Usually these patients are kept under surveillance, periodic reassessment, and a second liver biopsy performed; witch can reveal nonspecific lesions, NASH, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis. There are cases of witches in which spontaneous normalization of transaminases was observed during the surveillance period. Chronic hypertransaminasemia is quite common and may be highly appealing to the physician in patients with this type of pathology, as for many it is an incidental discovery in a routine blood check. It is also important to establish a clear diagnosis to begin specific treatment for patients who may benefit as soon as possible. © 2012.",,"Adriana, N.;Cristina, O.;Olariu, M.;Olteanu, D.",2012,,,0,0,

1572,Can mothers with Wilson's disease breastfeed their babies? [Japanese],"Background : Wilson's disease is a genetic disease characterized by copper deposition in various tissues. Trientine, penicillamine or zinc are applied to the patients to remove the copper accumulated in the body. These treatments should be continued throughout their lives. Recently, breastfeeding is recommended for babies around the world. When female patients with Wilson's disease have a baby, they want to breastfeed, even while continuing treatment for Wilson's disease. However, no studies have been conducted on the safety of breastfeeding in mothers treated for Wilson's disease. This study is concerned with the safety of breastfeeding in mothers treated for Wilson's disease. Materials and Methods: Breast milk was obtained from 4, 4 and 2 patients with Wilson's disease who were treated with trientine, penicillamine and zinc. Colostrum, transitional milk and mature milk were obtained from 16, 6 and 11 healthy mothers, respectively, as control breast milk. Copper and zinc concentrations in breast milk were analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrometry. At the same time, copper distribution profiles in breast milk were analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS. Trientine or penicillamine-bound copper levels were also analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS. Results and Discussion: Copper and zinc concentrations in breast milk of mothers with Wilson's disease treated with the drugs described above were nearly normal. Slightly higher concentrations of zinc and copper were detected in several breast milks from patients, but these levels were at infant formula levels. In the HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of breast milk from these mothers, the highest peak was detected in lactoalbumin-bound copper. Trientine and penicillamine peaks were not detected in milk. Conclusion : These results show that mothers with Wilson's disease can give breast milk to their babies even while continuing treatment for Wilson's disease.",,"Izumi, Y.",2012,January,,0,0,

1576,Zinc and liver disease,"Zinc is an essential trace element required for normal cell growth, development and differentiation. It is involved in DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and cell division and activation. It is a critical component in many zinc proteins/enzymes, including critical zinc transcription factors. Zinc deficiency/altered metabolism is observed in many liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and viral liver disease. Some of the mechanisms for zinc deficiency/altered metabolism include decreased dietary intake, increased urinary excretion, activation of some zinc transporters, and hepatic metallothionein induction. Zinc deficiency can manifest in many forms in liver disease, including skin lesions, poor wound healing/liver regeneration, altered mental state, or altered immune function. Zinc supplementation has been documented to block/attenuate experimental ALD through multiple processes, including stabilizing gut barrier function, reducing endotoxemia, reducing proinflammatory cytokine production, reducing oxidative stress, and reducing apoptotic hepatocyte death. Clinical trials in human liver disease are limited in size and quality, but it is clear that zinc supplementation reverses clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency in patients with liver disease. Some studies suggested improvement in liver function in both ALD and hepatitis C following zinc supplementation, and 1 study suggested improvement in markers of fibrosis in hepatitis C patients. The dose of zinc used for the treatment of liver disease is 50 mg of elemental zinc, usually taken with a meal to reduce the potential side effect of nausea.

1578,Selective bivalent copper chelation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus,"Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified by many researchers as key pathogenic mechanisms in aging-related metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease). However, although numerous molecular mechanisms have been developed to explain these processes, their precise nature remains unclear. This author has previously suggested that in such diseases, these two mechanisms are likely to occur as manifestations of a single underlying disorder of copper regulation. Copper is an essential but highly toxic trace metal that is closely regulated in biological systems. Several rare genetic disorders of copper homeostasis are known in humans: they primarily affect various proteins that mediate intracellular copper transport processes and can lead to states of tissue copper deficiency or overload. These examples show how impaired regulation of copper transport pathways can cause organ damage and provide important insights into the impact of defects in certain molecular processes, including those catalyzed by copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A (mutated in Menkes disease), ATP7B (Wilson's disease). ) and copper chaperones such as those for cytochrome c oxidase, SCO1 and SCO<inf>2</inf>. Impaired copper regulation in diabetes is manifested in urinary excretion of Cu<sup>II</sup>, increases in systemic chelable-Cu <sup>II</sup> and complete copper balance, increased pro-oxidant stress and defective antioxidant defenses. and progressive damage to blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves. Links between deregulated copper and organ damage can be demonstrated by Cu<sup>II</sup>-selective chelation, which simultaneously prevents/reverses both copper dysregulation and organ damage. Pathogenic structures in blood vessels that contribute to the binding and localization of catalytically active Cu<sup>II</sup> probably include advanced glycation end products (AGEs) as well as atherosclerotic plaque: the latter is likely involved in AGE-modification itself. Defective copper regulation mediates organ damage through two general processes occurring simultaneously in the same individual: Cu<sup>II</sup>-mediated elevation of pro-oxidant stress and disruption of copper-catalyzed antioxidant defense mechanisms. This author noted that diabetes-induced copper dysregulation is an important new target for therapeutic intervention to prevent/reverse organ damage in diabetes, heart failure, and neurodegenerative diseases, and that triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a novel anti-diabetic molecules that function by targeting these copper-mediated pathogenic mechanisms. TETA acts as a highly selective Cu <sup>II</sup> chelator, suppressing copper-mediated oxidative stress and restoring antioxidant defenses, preventing tissue damage and promoting organ regeneration. My group has used TETA in an extensive program of non-clinical studies and proof-of-principle clinical trials, thereby characterizing copper dysregulation in diabetes and identifying numerous associated cellular and molecular mechanisms by which TETA exerts its therapeutic effects. Many of the results obtained in non-clinical models of the molecular mechanisms of diabetic organ damage have not yet been replicated in patients' tissues, so their applicability to human disease should be considered inferential until the results of informative clinical studies are available. Based on the evidence from the studies reviewed here, trientine is now moving into the next stages of pharmaceutical development for the treatment of heart failure and other diabetic complications.

1580,Penicillamine increases free copper and increases oxidative stress in the brain of toxic dairy rats.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is characterized by copper accumulation caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Penicillamine (PA) worsens neurological symptoms in 10-50% of patients with neurological symptoms early in administration. The aim of this study was to determine how copper metabolism changes during PA administration of toxic milk (tx) mice, an animal model of WD, and whether the change impairs their brain. The concentrations of free copper and protein-bound copper in serum, cortex and basal ganglia of tx mice were investigated with PA administration for 3 days, 10 days and 14 days, respectively. The expression of the copper transporters, ATP7A and CTR1, was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. SOD, MDA, and GSH/GSSG were then detected to determine whether oxidative stress changed accordingly. The results revealed that free copper concentrations in serum and brain increased during PA administration, and protein-bound copper concentrations decreased in the brain of tx mice. Meanwhile, transiently increased expression of ATP7A and CTR1 was observed by immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot, usually in the brain parenchyma. In addition, it was observed that ATP7A and CTR1 are mainly located in the Golgi apparatus and the cellular membrane, respectively. Intense staining of ATP7A was found in the choroid plexus in tx mice at day 3 and 10 of PA treatment, but infrequent staining of ATP7A and CTR1 in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Decreased GSH/GSSG and increased MDA concentrations were also seen in the cortex and basal ganglia. Our results suggested that high free copper concentrations in the brain may lead to increased oxidative stress during PA administration. Increased free copper in the brain may come from copper mobilized from brain parenchymal cells, but not from serum, according to ATP7A and CTR1 expression analysis. Â© 2012 Chen et al.",,"Chen, D.

1581,Current and future techniques for the evaluation of dysphagia,"Dysphagia is common in the general population and is usually caused by mechanical obstruction or dysmotility. Patient demographics and symptom assessment are often helpful in identifying possible cause and guiding further investigation and treatment. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is often caused by neurological conditions for which treatment options are limited. Conversely, most esophageal causes of dysphagia are amenable to treatment. Gastroscopy is often the first-choice test given its diagnostic and therapeutic potential, especially when it comes to mechanical causes. Esophageal motor function can be evaluated with a variety of techniques, from radiology such as barium swallowing to specialized mobility tests such as manometry and impedance monitoring. The choice of test depends on the clinical indication and the results should be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's symptoms. High-resolution manometry with topography is now the new benchmark for motility studies. Several new techniques have also become available for motility testing, such as esophageal ultrasound and functional lumen imaging probe, but are currently limited to the research setting.

1584,New novel mutation of ATP7B gene in a family with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The WD gene codes for a copper-bearing P-type ATPase (ATP7B) located on chromosome 13q14.3. Mutation of this gene disrupts copper homeostasis and causes copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys and corneas and copper poisoning in these regions. Since the detection of the WD gene in 1993, approximately 300 disease-specific mutations have been identified. We recently evaluated a Korean family with WD. Proband, a 17-year-old boy, was admitted to our hospital with abnormal behaviors such as diffuse slow motion, difficulty in swallowing, drooling and ataxia. Laboratory results revealed decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels and increased urinary copper excretion. He had cirrhosis of the liver, brain lesions, and Kayser-Fleischer nuclear rings. Molecular genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed that it was heterozygous for the c.2697-2723del27 deletion mutation in exon 11. Further research on his family members revealed that his father and younger brother had the same mutation. The c.2697-2723del27 deletion mutation in exon 11 has not yet been reported as a causative mutation of WD, and an in-frame deletion is not expected to result in a frameshift. Therefore, we report a novel mutation of the ATP7B gene in a family with WD. Â© 2011 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Lee, J. Y.;Kim, Y. H.;Kim, T. W.;Oh, S. Y.;Kim, D. S.;Shin, B.

1586,Successful liver transplantation following veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a child with fulminant Wilson's disease and severe pulmonary hemorrhage: a case report,"In patients with fulminant hepatitis, massive pulmonary hemorrhage and other serious cardiopulmonary diseases cause not only graft failure but also post-LT mortality. ECMO is used to treat children with cardiorespiratory failure refractory to conventional intensive care. We describe a five-year-old girl with genetically confirmed fulminant Wilson's disease and severe pulmonary hemorrhage who underwent successful primary LT following veno-arterial ECMO. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful primary LT in a patient using veno-arterial ECMO. The present case demonstrates that ECMO as a bridging method to LT may be necessary to manage both massive pulmonary hemorrhage and possible graft loss due to hypoxemia.

1587,Wilson's disease in 71 patients followed for more than 20 years in a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia: A retrospective review.,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Our aim was to describe the various patterns, treatments, and outcomes of this disease. DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENT: A retrospective study of over two decades on WD patients in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia. Patients and Methods: The clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were analyzed from their charts, referral notes, and electronic records of our hospital. Results: The mean age and standard deviation were 16.8 (10.7) years and 56.5% were male. The main symptoms of WD were hepatic, neurologic and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%), and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) patients detected by family screening were asymptomatic. In 41 (57.7%) patients, WD was positive in the family, and in 26 (36.6%) patients, consanguinity was found between the parents. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 92.2 (72.9) (range, 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%) were followed up or out of follow-up, respectively. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 (12) (range, 4-62) years. Hepatoma was detected in 5 (7.0%) patients. Penicillamine treatment was given to 58 (81.7%) patients, and zinc and trientine (15.5%) to 32 (45.1%) patients. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation and one (1.4%) died on the waiting list. Liver status remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%) of 32 patients with neurological involvement, and neurological status improved in 11 (34.4%). Results: This is the largest reported cohort from the Middle East. The presentation of WD and the outcome of WD are very diverse, and its diagnosis still depends on clinical, laboratory, and radiological evidence of abnormal copper metabolism.

1591,Urinary copper excretion before and after oral d-penicillamine ingestion in parents of patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Urinary copper excretion greater than 100 cups/24. h is useful for diagnosing Wilson's disease. The d-Penicillamine challenge test can produce levels higher than 1400 mugs/24. h provides better diagnostic accuracy. In this study, it was investigated whether heterozygotes reached this value before and after administration of d-penicillamine to the parents of Wilson patients, and serum copper levels, ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion were compared. Methods: Fifty parents of adult patients were recorded to obtain 24-hour urinary copper excretion as well as serum copper levels and ceruloplasmin before and after administration of 1. g of d-penicillamine. Results: Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were significantly lower in fathers than in mothers (mean 21.8% x 27.8.mg; 71.4% x 88.0%; p<= 0.001). The mean baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion was higher in fathers (26.2 x 18.7 cups/24.h, p= 0.01), but did not differ between the sexes after d-penicillamine (521.7 x 525.3, range 31.6-1085.1 cups). /24. h, p= 0.8). Results: Mean values of serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and basal urinary copper excretion were different between men and women. Heterozygotes did not reach the current diagnostic threshold of 24-hour urinary copper excretion after d-penicillamine. Increased urinary copper excretion after D-penicillamine loading was much higher than five times the upper limit of normal urinary copper excretion in most heterozygotes and should not be considered in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

1593,Surgery in a Patient with Liver Disease,"Surgery is often required in patients with concomitant liver disease. The multiple physiological roles of the liver place these patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Diseases requiring surgery such as gallstones and hernias are more common in patients with cirrhosis. It is important to assess the severity of liver dysfunction prior to surgery and the risk benefit of the procedure should be carefully weighed. The severity of the disease can range from mild transaminase elevation to decompensated cirrhosis. Surgery should be avoided if possible in the emergency situation of acute and alcoholic hepatitis, in any patient with pediatric class C cirrhosis or a MELD score above 15, or with significant extrahepatic organ dysfunction. In this subset of patients, all possible means should be attempted to manage these patients conservatively. The modified Child-Pugh scores and model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores can quite reliably predict mortality after surgery, including non-hepatic abdominal surgery. Preoperative optimization will include acid control, correction of electrolyte imbalance, improvement of renal dysfunction, cardiorespiratory evaluation, and correction of coagulation. Global hemostasis tests, such as thromboelastography and thrombin formation time, may predict bleeding risk more than conventional coagulation tests in patients with cirrhosis. Correction of the international normalized ratio with fresh frozen plasma does not necessarily mean a reduced risk of bleeding and may increase the risk of volume overload and lung injury. International normalized ratio liver can better reflect coagulation status. Recombinant factor VIIa requires further study in patients with cirrhosis requiring surgery. It is recommended to avoid hypotension with safe anesthetic agents such as isoflurane and propofol during surgery. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and benzodiazepines should not be used. In a patient with cirrhosis, intra-abdominal surgery becomes more difficult in the presence of ascites, portal hypertension, and hepatomegaly. Uncontrolled bleeding, sepsis, renal dysfunction and worsening of liver failure due to coagulopathy and portal hypertension contribute to morbidity and mortality in these patients. Steps must be taken to reduce acid leaks and infections. Any patient with cirrhosis undergoing major surgery should be referred to a specialist center experienced in managing liver disease.

1596,The role of the human high-affinity copper transporter in the regulation of copper homeostasis and cisplatin sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy.,"The high-affinity copper transporter (Ctr1; SCLC31A1) plays an important role in regulating copper homeostasis because copper is an essential micronutrient and copper deficiency is detrimental to many important cellular functions, but excess copper is toxic. Recent studies have revealed that human copper homeostasis is tightly controlled by the interregulatory circuitry involving copper, Sp1 and human (hCtr1). This circuit uses the Sp1 transcription factor as a copper sensor to modulate hCtr1 expression; which in turn controls cellular copper and Sp1 levels in a 3-way reciprocal regulatory loop. Post-translational regulation of hCtr1 expression by copper stresses has also been described in the literature. As hCtr1 can also transport platinum drugs, this finding highlights the important role of hCtr1 in platinum drug sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy. Consistent with this view is the finding that high hCtr1 expression is associated with favorable treatment outcomes in cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. Furthermore, cultured cell studies have shown that high hCtr1 expression can be induced by depletion of cellular copper levels, resulting in increased cisplatin uptake and cell-killing activity. A phase I clinical trial using a combination of trientine (a copper chelator) and carboplatin was conducted with encouraging results. This review discusses new insights into the role of hCtr1 in regulating copper homeostasis and explains how modulating cellular copper availability may affect treatment efficacy in platinum-based cancer chemotherapy through hCtr1 regulation. © 2012 AACR.",,"Kuo, M.

1597,Wilson's disease: Canadian perspectives on presentation and outcomes from an adult ambulatory setting.,"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To describe the authors' clinical experience with a cohort of 48 adult patients followed in an outpatient setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with WD was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine charts were identified and 11 were excluded on further examination. At the time of diagnosis, 14 patients were asymptomatic, with 13 hepatic, 15 neurological and six mixed hepatic/neurological presentations. Ceruloplasmin levels were low (<0.20 g/L) in 94% of cases, and 24-hour urinary copper levels were high (>0.60 mumol/L) in 95% of cases. D-penicillamine was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc the most common (65%) in the review. Overall, biopsy and ultrasound reports documented cirrhosis in 53%. Portal hypertension defined as splenomegaly (>12.0 cm), reverse portal venous flow on ultrasound or varicose/gastropathy on endoscopy were seen in 63%. At the final examination, 39% had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (>34 U/L) and/or alanine aminotransferase levels (>40 U/L). One death and one transplant occurred, three patients developed encephalopathy, two patients developed jaundice, two patients developed ascites, and one patient experienced varicose bleeding. Of the 21 patients presenting neurologically, 14 improved compared to baseline, and four made almost complete recovery. Eleven patients experienced documented episodes of neurological decline, including four with a non-neurological presentation. Diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging showed basal ganglia (64%), brain stem (64%) abnormalities, and atrophy (36%); Basal ganglia lesions (50%) and atrophy (55%) were seen at follow-up. CONCLUSION: WD is a diverse chronic disease that can be managed predominantly in an outpatient setting, with generally favorable outcomes for patients who respond to initial therapy.

1598,Clinical efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for Wilson's disease: a systematic review of 9 randomized controlled trials.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Although curable, there is no universally accepted treatment regimen. Currently, various Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease in China, but there is a lack of reliable scientific evidence for the effectiveness of such treatments. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of CHM as an alternative and/or adjuvant therapy for Wilson's disease. A systematic literature search was performed in different medical databases to identify randomized controlled trials comparing CHM as monotherapy or CHM as adjuvant therapy to western traditional medical therapy in the treatment of Wilson's disease. A total of 687 participants were included in nine eligible studies. The main findings are that CHM as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy for Wilson's disease can improve clinical symptoms, increase urinary copper excretion, improve liver function and/or liver cirrhosis, and have fewer side effects compared to western conventional. medication. In addition, CHM has been shown to be generally safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. However, the evidence presented in this review is insufficient to warrant a clinical recommendation due to the generally low methodological quality of the included studies. In conclusion, CHM appears to be beneficial and safe for Wilson's disease, but high-quality evidence is still needed to further evaluate this treatment. Therefore, additional well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Wang, Y.;Xie, C. L.;Fu, D. L.;Lu, L.;Lin, Y.;Dong, Q. Q.;Wang, X. T.;Zheng, G.

In the 24-hour urine of 115 Wilson's disease patients treated with maintenance doses of D-penicillamine for 1 month to 22 years, as well as 115 healthy controls of the same age. Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd and Mn levels in the 24-hour urine of the cases were significantly higher than the controls (P<0.05), and the observed increases were Mg, Ca and Zn levels, respectively, 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 ( Ca) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) of 0.313 (Zn) were directly related to duration of treatment (P<0.05). On the other hand, 24-hour urine Al and As levels were lower than those of controls (P<0.05) and negatively correlated with duration of treatment with R -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As). ), respectively (P<0.05). Therefore, this study demonstrates that metal element levels may be altered in patients with Wilson's disease under D-penicillamine therapy.

The disease can cause copper to decrease its participation in ceruloplasmin, causing this metal to accumulate in the liver, central nervous system, kidneys, and other organs. The aim is to describe the frequency of psychiatric disorders in WD, the amount of deterioration in Quality of Life [QoL] in patients with WD, and the association of psychiatric disorders in the QoL of people with WD. Methods: This is a systematic review. Searching for important articles was done on PubMed using specific keywords. Results: Although a specific relationship has recently been found between Bipolar Disorders and WD, other neurological diseases such as WD are characterized by a chronic course and need for treatment, deterioration in functional outcomes, and a high frequency of psychiatric symptoms. Despite this, very few studies have been conducted on the quality of life of WD patients due to psychiatric symptoms since today. Some recent reports have shown a link between the presence of a Bipolar Disorder diagnosis, brain damage, and low Qol. Conclusion: Prospective studies in large cohorts are needed to determine the impact of psychiatric disorders comorbidity, especially Bipolar Disorders, on quality of life in WD and to clarify the causal link between brain injury, psychiatric disorders, and worsening quality of life.

Results WD patients had significantly lower TAC (p< 0.00001), lower IL-10 levels (p=0.039) and both higher IL-1beta (p=0.019) and IL-6 (p=0.005) compared to others. had levels. control issues. TNF-alpha, hs-CRP and IL-2 were not different from controls. Patients with the neurological form of WD had significantly lower TAC than those with the hepatic form (p<0.001). In addition, low CIC was associated with the severity of neurological symptoms (p=0.02). No relationship was found between inflammatory parameters and clinical symptoms. Conclusions Data from our study indicate that increased oxidative stress significantly contributes to the clinical manifestation of WD; As a lower TAC, it is associated with neurological symptoms in WD patients.

1616,Zinc and human health: an update,"The importance of micronutrients in health and nutrition is indisputable, and among them, zinc is an important element whose importance is increasing for health and whose deficiency can play an important role in the emergence of diseases. Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the organism with three main biological roles as catalyst, structural and regulatory ion. Zinc-binding motifs are found in many proteins encoded physiologically by the human genome, and free zinc is regulated mainly at the single-cell level. Zinc has a critical effect on homeostasis, immune function, oxidative stress, apoptosis and aging, and important disorders of public health importance are associated with zinc deficiency. In many chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, various malignancies, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, aging, age-related degenerative diseases, and Wilson's disease, concomitant zinc deficiency can complicate clinical features, adversely affect immunological status, increase oxidative stress, and lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causal roles in these diseases. Therefore, it is important in each case to assess the status of zinc and correct the zinc deficiency, as the unique properties of zinc may have important therapeutic benefits in these diseases. In this article, we review zinc as an all-purpose trace element, its biological role in homeostasis, proliferation, and apoptosis, and its role in immunity and in cancer, diabetes, depression, Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other chronic diseases. age-related diseases. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",,"Chasapis, C.

1617,Wilson's disease with normal liver function and low copper levels: an uncommon presentation.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Diagnose Wilson's disease in a patient with normal liver function and low serum copper. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: To recognize Wilson's disease in young patients presenting with Parkinson's features. CASE: A previously healthy 24-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with recurrent drowsiness and headache accompanied by Parkinson's symptoms (tremor, slurred speech, and drooling with swallowing difficulties). His mother and sister had a significant family history of psychiatric illness. On physical examination, only mild dysarthria and subjective weakness on the left side were remarkable. All initial laboratory data were negative, including CBC, baseline metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function, ESR, CRP, Lyme PCR, HIV, and RPR/VDRL. She had a negative paraneoplastic panel, IgG index, viral studies, and normal CSF examination with cryptococcal antigen. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine drug screening was unexplained. Autoimmune test including ANA and rheumatoid factor was negative. CT scan of the head revealed abnormal, symmetrical, diffuse hypodensities of the bilateral basal ganglia. An MRI to further evaluate soft tissue abnormalities showed increased T2 signal in the right and left lenticular nuclei. A heavy metal screen was ordered. Arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, and copper levels were all low. Given the high index of suspicion, an extremely low ceruloplasmin level of 3.1 mg/dL (normal: 14 - 78 mg/dL) was requested. A liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, showing mild chronic active hepatitis grade 2, septal fibrosis grade 3, and copper uptake in hepatocytes. Ophthalmological examination under slit lamp revealed clear Kayser-Fleischer (CF) rings. Trientine and zinc were started and at follow-up the CF rings disappeared and neurological symptoms showed modest improvement. CONCLUSION: Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is an autosomal recessive defect in copper export with a prevalence of 1 per 30,000 live births. Due to the decreased excretion of copper through bile, it causes accumulation in the liver and then progresses to other organs. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation with physical, biochemical and histological findings. Neurological disease (found in 35 percent of patients) includes Parkinson's tremor, gait stiffness and clumsiness, speech problems, and drooling. Ten percent of patients exhibit psychiatric symptoms ranging from subtle personality changes to overt depression, catatonia, and paranoia. Serum aminotransferases are usually elevated, but their severity is not associated with histological liver injury. Total body copper levels are elevated, but patients with low ceruloplasmin levels may have low serum levels. In the presence of only neurological symptoms with normal liver function and low copper levels, a slit lamp examination should be considered to look for CF rings. If positive, it is strongly suggestive of Wilson's disease. A liver biopsy may be required to confirm the diagnosis.",,"Gulati, G.;Gulati, S.;Nguyen, H. P.",2012,July,,0,0,
1618,"It's a riddle wrapped in a riddle, but maybe there's a key!","LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Discuss the differential diagnosis of cirrhosis in a young adult LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Discuss the importance of Wilson's assessment in conjunction with diagnostic procedures, the importance of a strong clinical suspicion, and continuity of care and communication among healthcare providers. CASE: A 26-year-old female patient with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and diagnosed at the age of 22 presented with a 2-week history of abdominal pain and bloating in December 2011. With the loss of insurance about 10 months ago, she was unable to maintain the appropriate dose of lactulose and lasix and became dependent on many subsequent emergency room visits for acute care. The pain characteristics were: sharp, squeezing, pressure sensation, widely localized over the entire abdomen and having a severity as high as 10/10. He complained of some episodes of nausea and vomiting, fever, and altered mental status. On examination, she had no fever, was normotensive, and had no acute distress. He had significant scleral icterus and no significant change in mental status. The abdomen was firm and swollen, tender on palpation with a positive wave of fluid and mild splenomegaly. Abnormal laboratories: hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 32.1, hepatitis negative panel, alkaline phosphatase 532, AST 132, total bilirubin 24.8 (direct 13.6; indirect 112), MELD score 26 and Child Pugh score 10, PTT 36, PT 29.7 and 1.88 INR. Review of previous records in 2010 revealed a normal serum ceruloplasmin level, 24-hour copper excretion 34 and liver biopsy positive for copper, but no quantification was performed. Antimitochondrial antibody, ANA and hemochromatosis gene mutation were negative. He had been treated for depression and substance abuse (EtOH), which was the reason why he did not qualify for a liver transplant. However, upon further questioning, we learned that he used alcohol to cope after losing his insurance. Our examinations revealed a faint Kayser-Fleischer ring, a ceruloplasmin level of 20.1, a 24-hour copper level of 86, and a copper/creatinine ratio of 78. At this point, we concluded that the patient met the diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease and started treatment with D. -penicillamine. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport (gene ATP7B) with a prevalence of approximately 1/30000. Typical presentation includes neurological and hepatic dysfunction. Diagnosis often requires a high index of clinical suspicion due to overlapping symptoms with other disorders. Delay and misdiagnosis are not uncommon, especially in our case where there is a possible history of substance abuse and lack of insurance becomes a limiting factor for proper follow-up and care. For this reason, the importance of the continuity of care and communication between physicians cannot be overemphasized. Diagnostic criteria include: presence of Kayser-Fleishcer rings in the slit lamp, <0.20 g/l ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urine free copper excretion, penicillamine challenge test, liver copper measurement, and presence of abnormal gene mutation. The mainstays of treatment are penicillamine, trientine and zinc. Long-term treatment for advanced disease, as in our patient, is liver transplantation.",,"Sapkota, S.

1619,case of acute copper toxicity,"LEARNING GOAL 1: Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is caused by an autosomal recessive defect in copper transport. Ceruloplasmin represents the copper circulating in the plasma. Hepatic production of aposeruloplasmin, the copper-free ceruloplasmin, results in the low serum ceruloplasmin level found in patients with Wilson's disease. Furthermore, improper function of Wilson's disease protein ATP7B leads to a disruption in biliary copper excretion, which allows copper to accumulate and accumulate in the hepatic, neurological, renal, and ophthalmic systems. Important clinical features of the disease include cirrhosis, acute liver failure, movement disorders, psychosis, and early osteoporosis. CASE: A 25-year-old male patient presented with a history of panhypopituitarism s/p, in which a suprasellar mass was removed secondary to Langerhan's histiocytosis, with mental status changes, generalized weakness, and lethargy. Remarkably, he had stopped using his DDAVP for several weeks. At the time of admission, the serum sodium level was found to be 172. Pituitary hormone replacement therapy was started immediately, desmopressin, solaortef, and synthroid. He was also found to have new-onset elevated liver function tests, ammonia, and INR. Initially, it was assumed that his altered mentality was a combination of hypernatremia and liver dysfunction. As a result, he took lactulose and rifaximin. His sodium level improved, but remained encephalopathic. Acute liver failure was evaluated separately by gastroenterology and hepatology. Diagnostic laboratory tests revealed low ceruloplasmin, high serum copper and high urinary copper level. He then had a liver biopsy showing portal fibrosis and steatosis stage III-IV and stage II-IV portal and parenchymal infiltrates, both consistent with Wilson's disease. He was started on penciling, which led to an immediate improvement in his mental state. The ATP7B gene was awaiting discharge. He will undergo a slit lamp examination on an outpatient basis. He was discharged home with close gastroenterology and hepatology follow-up. CONCLUSION: Wilson's disease should be considered in any individual between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of unknown origin and should be excluded in patients with unexplained liver disease accompanied by rapid neurological deterioration. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease is made by a slit lamp examination to identify Kayser-Fleischer rings, which represent decemet's deposition of copper in the corneal membrane. Biochemical tests show elevated liver function tests, low ceruloplasmin levels, and elevated serum and urinary copper excretion. Increased hepatic parenchymal copper content provides critical diagnostic information and should be taken when diagnosis is not easy. Histological abnormalities found on liver biopsy include steatosis, hepatocellular necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. If diagnosis remains difficult, molecular genetic studies such as the ATP7B mutation may be available. Treatment options include D-penicillamine, a chelator that promotes urinary copper excretion, trientine (also a chelator), indicated in patients without penlamine intolerance, and zinc, which inhibits copper uptake from the gastrointestinal tract.",,"Patel, P.;Andhavarapu, K.;Shah, P.;Menon, N.;Feldman, J.",2012,July,,0,0,

In rare cases, it may present with fulminant liver failure and multi-organ dysfunction. Initial therapy aims to lower Wilson's characteristic high serum copper levels. As copper is bound to albumin, we evaluated the efficacy of 2 modalities of extracorporeal copper clearance: Molecular Adsorbent Recirculation System (MARS) and plasmapheresis (PP). A 25-year-old female patient who was treated with Trientine was admitted with fulminant WD (hemolytic anemia, liver failure, AKI) due to drug incompatibility for 1 year. Blood Copper (Cu), Haptoglobin and Ceruloplasmin levels were monitored. Treatments ranging from MARS to PP. MARS sessions each consisted of 8 hours of albumin dialysis followed by CVVHDF. PP sessions were replaced with FFP 1.2 times the plasma volume. Copper reduction ratios (CRR) for each modality are shown in the table. The patient was bridged to liver transplantation after a total of 5 sessions (3 MARS and 2 PP). In this case, the mean CRR for MARS and PP was similar (18.6% vs. 26.9%, p=0.5). The mouse side effects of FFP replacement are not seen with MARS. Both MARS and PP can be used to scavenge copper in Wilson's crisis and bridge liver transplantation.

1624,Wilson's disease: Abnormal methionine metabolism and the role of inflammation and steatosis in the early stages of liver disease.,"Purpose of Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disorder characterized by hepatic copper accumulation and hepatic steatosis. Copper has been shown to inhibit the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), which is central to methionine metabolism and regulating S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels. The SAM/SAH ratio is an indicator of methylation capacity and regulates gene expression. This study examines the effects of copper-induced SAHH inhibition and treatment with the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA) on the pathogenesis of inflammation and steatosis in an animal model of WD to establish a link between methionine metabolism and gene expression regulation. Methods Used: Liver and blood were collected from 7 toxic milk (tx-j) and 7 C3H control mice at 12 and 24 weeks, and 7 PCA-treated tx-j mice at 24 weeks in each age group. We measured the activity of methionine metabolism metabolites SAM and SAH (HPLC) and SAHH. Lipid metabolism genes glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP 1c), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1alpha (CPT-1alpha), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), and proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) Real Time -Measured by PCR. Summary of Results: tx-j mice had hepatic copper levels 35-40 times higher than controls (p<0.0001), while PCA tx-j mice accumulated half as much copper as untreated tx-j mice (p<0.0001). At 24 weeks, SAHH activity was reduced in tx-j mice (p=0.01), but reestablished similarly to controls in PCA tx-j mice. The SAM/SAH ratio was lower in PCA and untreated tx-j mice (p<0.05). Expressions of GRP78, SREBP 1c, CPT-1alpha and PPARalpha were decreased at both ages in untreated tx-j mice and further decreased in PCA tx-j mice. TNFalpha expression was higher in untreated tx-j mice but decreased in PCA tx-j mice. Results: Copper accumulation is associated with SAHH activity inhibition in tx-j mice restored in PCA tx-j mice. The SAM/SAH ratio was decreased in PCA and in untreated tx-j mice with changes in inflammation and steatosis gene expression. These findings suggest that copper-induced abnormal methionine metabolism and the ensuing inflammation and zsteatosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of early liver disease in WD.",,"Dolatshahi, M.;Shibata, N.;Liu, S.;Halsted, C.;Medici, V.",2012,January,http://dx.doi.org/10.231/JIM.0b013e318240c940,0,0,
1625,Benefit of dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport due to defective hepatocyte-biliary copper excretion, which causes pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues, especially in the liver and brain. Clinical manifestations of copper accumulation in the liver include liver disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of dynamic hepatobiliary scintigraphy (DHBS) in the evaluation of liver dysfunction in Wilson's disease. Material and Methods: It was administered with clinical evidence of liver disease in 39 consecutive WD patients treated with 99mTc Mebrofenin and DHBS, zinc and/or penicillamine (19 males and 20 females; mean age 39+/-4 years). All patients underwent standard biochemical liver function tests, including ALT, AST, GGT, AP, TOT BIL, ALB, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Liver biopsies were performed in all WD patients. Liver tissue was examined for routine liver histology (grading and staging of fibrosis) and hepatic copper content. DHBS was performed with 30 seconds time/frame acquisition for 60 minutes after iv injection of 110 MBq99mTc Mebrofen. Time-activity curves were recorded from areas of interest superimposed on the hepatic parenchyma (H) and major intrahepatic bile ducts (B). Quantitative analysis of curves was performed using deconvolution analysis and nonlinear regression, which measures time to parenchymal (HTmax) and intraductal (BTmax) maximum peak counts and time to T1/2 breakthrough (HT1/2 ;BT1). /2nd ) . Results: All patients had low serum ceruplasmin and copper levels (3.05+/-0.2mg/dl and 57+/-18mug/dl) and high 24-hour urinary copper excretion (201+/-42mug/24h), respectively. According to metavir fibrosis staging, 16 patients (41%) were classified as F1, 7 as F2 (18%), 10 as F3 (25%), and the remaining 6 patients as F4 (16%). Analysis of DHBS quantitative data showed slow hepatic uptake (>HTmax) and hepatobiliary excretion (>HT1/2) in almost all patients. A positive correlation was observed between histological findings and Htmax (p=0.001), HT1/2 (p=0.006) and BTmax (p=0.02) values. Also, in multivariate analysis, significant correlations were found between HTmax, HT1/2 BT1/2 and high fibrosis grade (F4) and other fibrosis grade. No correlation was found between biochemical liver function tests, but bilirubin; (p < 0.01) and DHBS parameters. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the clinical utility of DHBS as a noninvasive diagnostic method for assessing the extent of liver fibrosis by reducing the number of liver biopsies in patients with Wilson's disease in long-term follow-up.",,"Serra, A.;Sorbello, O.;Loi, G.;Mighela, M.;Faa, G.;Demelia, L.;Piga, M.",2012,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-012-222-x,0,0,
1626,A precious metal: copper deficiency manifesting as myeloneuropathy,"Background: Copper deficiency is a rare cause of hematological and neurological diseases. We describe a case of copper deficiency mimicking subacute combined degeneration of the cord. Methods: A 65-year-old female patient presented with complaints of weakness in her legs, impaired balance, and numbness in her hands and legs. He was known to have celiac disease and B12 and folate deficiency with irregular adherence to B12 injections. There were no features of inflammatory joint or muscle disease or an underlying autoimmune connective tissue disorder. Neurological examination revealed normal tone and strength with lively reflexes. He had a sensory level in the mid-thigh, proprioception was down to the ankles, and there was no sense of vibration up to the hips. Sensory ataxia and a positive Romberg test were demonstrated. Its clinical picture suggested combined myeloneuropathy. From his medical history, actual or functional B12 deficiency was suspected. MRI spine and nerve conduction studies showed no specific changes. Blood tests including B12, folate, inflammatory markers and autoimmune profile were normal. However, copper studies were abnormal with serum copper level 2.3 [normal range 11-20], ceruloplasmin 0.1[NR 0.2-0.6] and zinc 6.1 [NR 11-24]. He was diagnosed with copper deficiency. His symptoms improved with oral copper supplementation. Conclusions: Copper deficiency is recognized as a cause of myelopathy in humans and other animals, particularly ruminants. Copper chelators are used to model demyelination and neurodegenerative phenomena in animal models. It has been seen in humans after gastric bypass surgery or after overuse of zinc-containing denture adhesives, but most cases are idiopathic. The disease may mimic subacute combined degeneration of the cord, optic neuropathy, or myelodysplasia with resistant anemia and other cytopenias. Copper deficiency myelopathy is more common in women and peaks in the 5th and 6th decades. This picture is not seen in Wilson's disease, but in cases of clinical suspicion, copper deficiency can be distinguished by low urinary copper levels. Spinal MRI may show increased T2 signal in the posterior cervical and thoracic cord. It is unclear how copper deficiency causes neurodegeneration or why it appears similar to other deficiency-related neurodegenerative conditions. Dysfunction of the methylation process involved in the synthesis of cytochrome oxidase and myelin protein may explain both the pathogenesis and the similarity between the phenotypes. Conclusions: Copper deficiency is a rare cause of neurodegenerative symptoms that can mimic other conditions. A combination of myelopathy and cytopenia is particularly suspect. Clinicians should be alert to this possibility, especially in patients with risk factors such as malabsorption, bariatric surgery, or mega-dose zinc. After treatment, cytopenias usually resolve, but neurologic recovery is often incomplete.",,"Hayes, F.;Coward, L.;Borg, F.",2012,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kes108,0,0,
1627,"Clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease and the effect of treatment","Objectives: To examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of Wilson's disease (WD) and the effect of treatment. Methods: This study was performed on 31 patients who underwent a detailed clinical history, physical and neurological examination. All patients underwent corneal slit lamp examination, biochemical studies (including ceruloplasmin, copper, and urinary copper), and brain imaging for Kayser-Fleischer (CF) ring. Results: The mean age at onset was 12.41 years and the mean delay in diagnosis was 16.96 months. Twenty-four (77.4%) of the patients were young (under 18 years old) and 7 (22.6%) were adults (over 18 years old). Dystonia was the most common initial neurological feature (64.5%), followed by dysarthria (41.9%), drooling (38.7%), and parkinsonism (38.7%). Among the main neurological features, the dystonic group was dominant (83.9%), followed by the dystonic group, respectively. Parkinson's group (64.5%), cerebellar group (22.6%) and choreoathetoid group (9.7%). While parkinsonism was dominant in the juvenile group, cerebellar features were dominant in adults. In addition, psychiatric complaints (41.9%), seizures (19.4%) and headache (22.5%) were observed. Bilateral CF ring was seen in all patients. Non-neuropsychiatric features (bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly and joint pains) were predominantly seen in juveniles. Serum ceruloplasmin was low (<20 mg/dl) in 93.54% of the patients, 24-hour urine copper (>100 microgram/day) was increased in all patients, and serum copper was low (<75 microgram/dl) in 64.5% of the patients. . Brain MRI was performed in 27 patients whose most common finding (85.2%) was basal ganglia signal changes. Brain CT scan was performed in 4 patients and basal ganglia hypodensity was the most common finding (75%). All patients were treated with zinc and penicillamine. 23 (74.2%) patients received regular treatment and neurological deterioration occurred in 16 (51.6%) patients. 13 (41.9%) patients recovered completely; 12 (38.7%) patients showed incomplete recovery with sequelae; 4 (12.9%) patients were lost to follow-up, maintaining the status quo, and 2 (6.45%) patients deteriorated and died. Conclusions: This WD series from eastern India highlights that the disease is not that rare in India and has a variety of clinical presentations. Dystonia and Parkinson's features were dominant in juvenile patients, and cerebellar features were dominant in the adult group. All asymptomatic siblings should be screened for WD.

Copper-treated animals showed significantly increased ceruloplasmin, serum and urinary copper levels, decreased serum AChE activity, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory, and increased expression of the hepatic MT-I gene. Autopsy studies in copper-poisoned rats showed a decrease in liver and brain copper content (99.1% and 73% increase, respectively), liver zinc decrease (40% decrease), and interestingly, an increase in brain zinc content (77.1% increase) compared to controls. ) revealed. rats. Copper accumulation in liver and brain tissues of test rats and copper-related proteins in liver tissues were confirmed by rhodanin and orcein stains, respectively. Nanoparticle-based therapy resulted in significant reductions in hepatic copper content, serum ceruloplasmin level, and increase in serum AChE activity. In conclusion, chronic copper toxicity may cause neurobehavioral disorders by interfering with increased copper content in liver and brain, increased hepatic MT-I gene expression, elevated serum Cu, ceruloplasmin levels, urinary copper, and acetylcholine-modulated neurotransmission; however, trientine dihydrochloride encapsulated nanoparticles can significantly reverse the disorders caused by chronic copper poisoning in Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Prasad, R.;Thapa, B.

BW) injected intraperitoneally for 90 days on copper and zinc levels, especially in liver, kidney and brain (especially hippocampus region) tissues; Expression, biochemical parameters and neurobehavioral functions (by Morris water maze test) of hepatic metallothionein-I (MT-I) & Atp7b gene and MT-III & acetylcholine esterase (AChE) gene in the brain of male Wistar rats. Copper-treated animals showed significantly increased serum ceruloplasmin levels, serum and urinary copper levels, decreased serum AChE activity, impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory, and increased hepatic MT-I gene expression compared to control rats. However, there was no change in the expression levels of the hepatic Atp7b gene and the MT-III and AChE gene in the brain tissues of Cu-poisoned rats. In Cu poisoning rats, liver, brain hippocampus region, and kidney tissues had a significant increase in Cu content (99.1, 73 and 74.9% increase, respectively), a 40% decrease in hepatic Zn content, and an interesting 77.1% increase. Zn content of the hippocampus region of brain tissues compared to control mice. Histopathological studies showed copper deposition in liver and brain (with swollen astrocytes) tissues, and copper-associated proteins in liver tissues of Cu-poisoned rats were confirmed by rhodanine and orcein dyes, respectively. In conclusion, this study shows the first evidence in vivo that chronic Cu toxicity causes neurobehavioral disorders, decreased serum AChE activity, Cu accumulation in the brain with swollen astrocytes, increased Cu and zinc levels in the hippocampus of male Wistar rats.",,"Pal, A.;Prasad, R.;Vasishta, R.

1630,"Presentation of Wilson's disease in Pakistan: A tertiary hospital experience in Karachi, Pakistan.","Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an average prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people worldwide. Data on WD from Pakistan are not available, so we aimed to determine the pattern of WD in the Pakistani population and compare it with the international literature. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi between 1985 and 2010. Results: 47 patients were seen, 32 (68.1%) were male, and the mean age (SD) was 26.6 (9.97) years. The most common presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%) were later neurological; 17 (36.2%) and 8 (17%) at rest presented with psychiatric symptoms. Patients with psychiatric symptoms had earlier onset of WD, with a mean age of 18.8 +/- 3.3 years. Mean ceruloplasmin levels were 0.17 (0.13) and decreased (<0.25 g/dl) in 39 (86.6%). Serum (Cu) decreased in 32 (68.1%). 24-hour urinary Cu increased only in 22 (47.6%). Slit Lamp examination was performed for Kayser-Fleischer (CF) rings in 15 (31.9%) patients, and CF rings were found in only 9 (60%) patients. Of these 9 patients with positive CF ring, 8 (88.8%) had neurological disease. The mean (AST)/(ALT) ratio was 1.92 and the median ALP/T. The bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05; 166.50). D-Penicillamine and Zinc (Zn) combination was given to 31 (65.4%) patients, D-Penicillamine only to 11 (23.1%) patients, and only Zn to only 5 (11.5%) patients. Liver transplantation was performed in only one patient who presented with decompensated liver disease. Conclusion: In our population, patients with WD present a little later in adulthood and it is the most common liver presentation. Disease presentation and biochemical parameters in Pakistan are no different from the rest of the world. WD should be suspected in patients with unexplained abnormal liver function tests and a positive family history of liver disease.",,"Parkash, O.;Ayub, A.;Jafri, W.;Alishah, H.;Hamid, S.",2012,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12006,0,1,
1631,Metabolic liver diseases common in children: Wilson's disease,"Wilson disense (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, was first described in 1912 by a neurologist, Dr. It was described by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson. Its estimated worldwide prevalence is 1 to 30,000-40,000 live births. Although the common age of onset is between childhood and young adulthood, extreme cases of WD have been reported in a 2-year-old girl and a 72-year-old woman with hepatomegaly and neurological disability, respectively. Clinical manifestations are significantly variable, including liver diseases, neurological disorders, and psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms are often indistinguishable from other common diseases. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary to prompt physicians to appropriately investigate and provide prompt treatment for this type of treatable disease associated with a fatal outcome. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to decreased hepatic excretion of copper associated with oxidative stress-induced cell damage in various organs. Numerous mutations have been discovered since 1993. Although a definitive diagnosis was made by genetic analysis, its routine application was not generally used due to gene length and numerous mutations. Thus, WD is practically inconsistent with the typical clinical setting with/or without Kaser-Fleischer ring and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.2 g/l), high 24-hour urine copper (>100 mugs/day), and some supporting laboratories. is diagnosed. high hepatic copper content (>250 mug/g dry weight). Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment option for patients presenting with fulminant liver failure. But early diagnosis and treatment can prevent and reverse fatal outcomes. Copper chelating agents, penlamin and/or trientine have been used with some limitations in terms of their side effects. There is evidence that penicillamine may impair neurological function; which tetrathiomolybdate and zinc can be good alternatives. The efficacy and safety of zinc therapy has been proven not only in symptomatic patients, but also in presymptomatic patients and patients with pregnancy.",,"Ukarapol, N.",2012,December,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12005,0,0,
1632,Prospective pilot study of a single daily dose of trientine for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) requires lifelong medical treatment. Patients who miss the dose of their medication frequently may develop liver failure, neurological or psychiatric disease. Current treatment for WD is with chelating agents or zinc salts given in divided doses. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine whether trientine given once daily is an effective maintenance therapy for WD and improves patient compliance. Methods: Seven male and 1 female patients with stable disease between the ages of 22-71 were included in the study group. Patients have been treated for WD for 4 to 50 years. WD presentations included family screening (n=1), incidental Kayser-Fleischer rings (n=1), neuropsychiatric post liver disease (n=1), and asymptomatic detection with primary liver disease (n=5). Previous treatments were zinc acetate (n=2), d-penicillamine (n=1), and trientine (n=5). After 3 months of monitoring on previous medications, patients were treated with a single daily weight-based dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). Close monitoring of treatment included clinical examination, blood count, and biochemical tests. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, all patients were clinically well and their clinical examinations were stable throughout the study period. There was no interruption in treatment due to elevated transaminases or side effects. There was no evidence of significant fluctuations in blood counts. Urinary copper excretion was increased in patients using zinc, but relatively unchanged in patients using prior d-Penicillamine or trientine. Mean 24-hour urinary copper and zinc excretion at the end of treatment were 313.4 +/- 191.7 and 2214 +/- 1346 micrograms, respectively. Results of patient surveys at the end of the study reported by all individuals in the study group showed that a key advantage of trientine given once daily was the convenience of not having to time dosages up to an hour or two before the recommended one. after meals throughout the day. This regimen has been reported to improve adherence by these patients, two of whom missed more than 5 doses one week prior to the study. CONCLUSIONS: Trientine once daily is an effective maintenance therapy for WD and improves adherence to lifelong medical therapy. Longer follow-up will determine the safety and efficacy of this once-daily treatment regimen for WD.",,"Ala, A.;Aliu, E.;Schilsky, M. L.",2012,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hep.26040,0,0,107.0
1633,Long-term outcomes of a large cohort of patients with Wilson's disease in Austria,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disease due to impaired hepatic copper excretion that causes copper accumulation in the liver and many other organs. Limited data are available on the long-term outcomes of patients with WD. Between 1961 and 2011, 223 patients with WD (2.77/100000 population) were diagnosed in Austria. One patient moved abroad and could not be reached. Data could not be obtained in 56 patients. Information about the survival status of these patients was obtained from the Austrian Statistical Office (Statistik Austria, Vienna). Median observation time was 14.4 years (range: 0.5-49), total: 3028 patient years. Results: The follow-up study included 222 patients (115 women/107 men; admission: liver: 133; neurological: 57, asymptomatic 22; symptomatic onset age of 22.3+/-12.3 [range: 2-61] years). 16 patients (7.2%) died during the observation period (12 patients were related to death, WD-7 hepatic decompensation, 3 liver transplants (LTX), 1 neurological disorder accident, 1 suicide). 28 (12.6%) patients required LTX (8 fulminant WD, 19 end-stage liver disease, 1 neurologic worsening). LTX was performed within a few months of diagnosis; only 3 patients received LTX several years after diagnosis (despite good treatment adherence). Overall survival after 20 years was 92%, slightly worse than the age-adjusted Austrian population (97%). Survival of patients who lived 10 years after diagnosis was not different from the healthy cohort. 96% vs. 99%). 41 (18.4%) recovered completely and 38 (17.1%) patients recovered after starting treatment (d-pesylamine or trientine). Most of the remaining patients were stable, only 7 (3.2%) worsened despite medical treatment. Clinical follow-up could not be achieved in 45 patients. Conclusion: WD is associated with severe, often fatal liver disease. 12.6% require liver transplant. If patients survive 10 years after initiation of therapy (medical or transplantation), their long-term prognosis in terms of survival and clinical status is excellent. Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are imperative to further improve survival and reduce the need for transplantation.",,"Beinhardt, S.;Leiss, W.;Graziadei, I.;Stauber, R.

1634,Wilson's disease: Changes in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease,"Hepatic methionine metabolism may play an important role in regulating methylation status and liver injury in Wilson's disease (WD) through inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) by copper (Cu) and the resulting accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). It is a potent inhibitor of methylation reactions. Methods: We examined the transcript levels of Sahh, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), SAH, DNA methyltransferase genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b) and hepatic global DNA methylation in an animal model, the toxic milk mouse (tx-j). in WD and control C3H mice. Tx-j mice (n=6-7/treatment group, males) at 12 to 24 weeks of age received oral penicillamine 100mg/Kg bodyweight/day in deionized water, and in separate experiments both tx-j and C3H mice modulated inflammatory and methylation status, respectively. received methyl donor betaine fortified at 1.5% in drinking water for 20 to 24 weeks. Hepatic global DNA methylation was assessed by dot blot assays and immunostaining was used to detect and quantify 5-methylcytosine in hepatocyte nuclei. Results: In the untreated condition, hepatic Sahh transcript and protein levels were decreased (p<0.05) in 24-week-old tx-j mice, resulting in increased liver SAH levels (56.8+/-13 vs 33.4+/-8.5 nmol/g); p<0.05). Hepatic Cu accumulation (259+/-104 vs 7.2+/-1.5 µg/gdw, p<0.001) in tx-j mice, elevated serum ALT (238+/-49 vs 36) as indicated by liver histology associated with inflammation +/-14 U/L, p<0.001) and elevated liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf- alpha) transcript levels (2.9+/-1.2 vs -0.56+/-1.4 fold changes, p<0.05) . Dnmt3b was downregulated in tx-j mice with global DNA hypomethylation (approximately 10% reduction compared to C3H mice). Cu chelation treatment of tx-j mice with penicillamine decreased Tnf-alpha and ALT levels, betaine treatment increased SAM, upregulated Dnmt3b levels, and both treatments increased DNA methylation in tx-j to control levels. Immunostaining for 5-methylcytosine showed a diffuse and less intense nuclear staining pattern in hepatocyte nuclei from tx-j mice (p<0.01). Conclusion: decreased hepatic SAH expression was associated with increased liver SAH levels in the tx-j model of WD, resulting in global DNA hypomethylation. Increased global DNA methylation was achieved by ameliorating inflammation with Cu chelation or by providing methyl groups. We propose that increased levels of SAH and inflammation affect the widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression in WD.",,"Medici, V.;Kharbanda, K. K.;Woods, R.;LaSalle, J.

1635,Controversies in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease in children - Results of an international survey,"Introduction: In rare pediatric metabolic diseases, insufficient evidence to guide management may lead to differences in care. The aim of this study is to determine the consensus and diversity in how pediatric hepatologists (PH) diagnose and treat patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: PH, a member of the AASLD Pediatric Liver Special Interest Group or ESPGHAN, was invited to participate in this web-based, international survey. Results: Turnout was 43% (108 participants, 253 invitations). The majority (64%) see 1-10 WD patients regularly and 30% see >=11. Roberts and Schilsky (Hepatology 2008) and Ferenci et al. (Liver Int. 2003) was preferably used as a guide (65% and 21%, respectively). The interpretation and use of laboratory data was variable. Basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) for 90% >0.6 mumol (40mug)/24 hours indicates the need for further investigation, while the definition of normal liver copper content (LCC) has changed (25% interpreted as 50 mg/g and interpreted as 56%). 250mug/g pathologically). Although tests are commercially available, genetic testing is performed in 48% of all patients and not performed in 13% of all patients in suspected WD cases. Regardless of disease severity, serum ceruloplasmin (CER), UCE, and LCC were the diagnostic tools of choice in patients from previously unaffected families. However, once the genotype of an index patient was known, DNA analysis was one of the 3 methods of choice (80%). Although not preferred, penicillamine (PEN) loading was similarly applied in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (20% vs. 26%). Based on CER, UCE and genetic testing, screening of a child of an individual with WD was selected at a rate of 76%. The use of a low-copper diet was evaluated in several ways: 45% indefinitely, 33% temporary, and 12% not recommending any diet. The drug of choice for primary treatment has changed significantly. Zinc monotherapy was preferred in the 4-year-old affected sibling of a WD patient with elevated aminotransferases (43%). In older patients, PEN and trientine were generally equally favored, but PEN was rejected by 51% of North America versus 7% of respondents from other countries. Concepts for managing a WD patient with acute liver failure (ALF) are varied. As primary therapy, chelators were chosen in 52% and transplantation in 15%. While applying medical treatment, follow-up with the disease severity score is the approach accepted by the majority. However, 23% reported only monitoring without choosing chelation therapy or an alternative. Conclusions: The approach to diagnosing and treating PD and WD in children is markedly variable. The reasons for these differences in clinical practice are not entirely clear but likely involve regional variations.",,"Piersma, F. E.;Tanner, S.;Socha, P.;Roberts, E. A.;Shneider, B.

1636,Wilson's disease in Oman: a study of neurological symptoms and delay in diagnosis from a University Teaching Hospital.,"Background: There is no comprehensive clinical description of Wilson's disease [WH, an autosomal recessive disorder (OMIM 277900) copper transport] in Oman, where consanguineous marriages are common. Objective: To examine the neurological, demographic and imaging profiles of WD cases in Oman and to detect the delay in diagnosis. Design and methods: Clinical features and MRI findings of WD cases admitted to the Neurology Service of Oman Sultan Qaboos University Hospital were obtained from electronic patient records. The patients were also contacted by telephone to determine the family history and the delay in diagnosis. Results: We studied a total of 22 cases (13 men and 9 women) from 4 different Omani families. Nine subjects from these families had neurological symptoms, and the mean age at onset of symptoms was 18 (range: 12-24). These subjects showed varying combinations and severity of dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, pyramidal symptoms, and affective disorder. MRI showed basal ganglionic signal changes in those with permanent neurological deficits (n=4). The median time delay at diagnosis was 3 months (range: 0-16 months). Maintenance therapy includes penicillamine (n= 3), trientine (n= 4), and zinc sulfate (n= 2). A recent genetic study of one of the 4 families revealed a novel homozygous splice site mutation (C.2866-2A>G) upstream of exon 13 in the copper transporter gene ATP 7B. Conclusions: Dystonia is the prominent neurological phenotype of WD in Oman.

1637,"An unexpected novel antioxidant activity for penicillamine, a classic copper chelating drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease.","Penicillamine (beta, beta'-dimethylcysteine) is widely used clinically as a copper chelating amino thiol drug for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's Disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provided significant protection against cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), an important toxic metabolite of the widely used wood preservative pentachlorophenol, whereas other classical copper chelating agents such as bathcuproin disulfonate did not. The autooxidation process of TCHQ giving reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ*<sup>-</sup>) radical was investigated by ESR and UV-visible spectral methods. Unexpectedly, we found that the formation of the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical was significantly inhibited and the autooxidation process of TCHQ was remarkably retarded by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no such effect was observed by the classical copper chelating agent or penicillamine disulfide, the oxidized form of penicillamine. ESR and HPLC-MS studies have shown that the TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical is mainly reduced to TCHQ by penicillamine, which is simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that the protective effects of penicillamine on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity are due not to copper binding, but rather to the effective inhibition of reactive TCSQ*<sup>-</sup> radical formation via an unusual redox pathway. This is the first report showing an unexpected novel antioxidant activity for this copper chelating drug that may be highly relevant to the biological activities of penicillamine.",,"Zhu, B.

1638,Wilson's disease in France: follow-up of a cohort of 395 patients,"Background: One of the priorities of the French National Reference Center for Wilson's Disease (WD) (FNRC), defined as late 2005, is to improve epidemiological information on this rare disease. The purpose of the WD database is to better define the different profiles that suggest diagnosis and to learn more about the development of the disease. Methods: Demographic, clinical, biological, radiological and therapeutic data of 395 patients (1 to 77 years old) at two reference centers (AP-HP and Lyon) and 6 competence centers (Besanon, Lille, Aix/Marseille) FNRC for WD, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Rennes) were collected at diagnosis and/or during follow-up. Results: The diagnosis was mostly made by neurological symptoms (33%), mean age 23 years, or hepatic symptoms (34%) or familial screening (20%). Genetic analysis was not significant for 16% of families. D-Penicillamine was the initial treatment for 85% of patients and is still prescribed for 44% of cases after 15 years of follow-up. Average causes of death are liver failure, infections, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the most important cohort of WD patients. However, it covers only 1/3 of French patients. Coordination of all healthcare professionals with a multidisciplinary approach should be encouraged in order to improve the registration of WD patients in the database at the time of diagnosis or during follow-up.

1639,Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia and liver disease: A case of Wilson's disease.,"Objective: A 45-year-old black female patient presented with complaints of yellowing of the eyes, epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting and dark urine, which started 3 weeks ago after hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage. His vital signs were found to be stable. Sleral jaundice and conjunctival pallor were present. There was mild epigastric tenderness without rebound or defense. Laboratories showed leukocytosis, macrocytic anemia, coagulopathy, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia, and markedly low alkaline phosphatase. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or common bile duct dilatation. Empirical antibiotics were given and transjugular liver biopsy was performed. Additional laboratories submitted showed a cerruloplasmin of 6.7 g/dL and confirmed a Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia. He was evaluated for liver transplant but was put on hold due to a possible pelvic infection. A 24-hour urine copper was sent on suspicion of Wilson's Disease. However, his condition deteriorated rapidly before the diagnosis was confirmed, and he was empirically started on penicillamine 250 mg PO Q6h, vitamin B6 25 mg daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg PO TID, and IV N-Acetyl Cysteine. It was determined that the 24-hour urine copper before the treatment was 4056 cups. A diagnosis of Wilson's Disease was made because of acute liver failure, markedly low alkaline phosphatase, low cerruloplasmin, Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia, high urine copper and positive Rubeanic acid stain. No pelvic infection was found, he was listed for liver transplant. Conclusion: Wilson's Disease leads to copper deposits that affect many organ systems, including the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. The diagnosis can be made by the presence of 2 of the following: positive family history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, low total serum copper and ceruloplasmin, high hepatic copper, and 24-hour urinary copper increase. When Wilson's Disease occurs as acute liver failure, the goal of treatment is to establish a negative copper balance by promoting urinary copper excretion and removing tissue copper using copper chelators. Liver transplantation is indicated in cases of acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease for which medical treatment options have failed.

1641,Impaired copper homeostasis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Objective: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common monogenetic inherited heart disease characterized by increased ventricular wall thickness, myocyte dysregulation, and myocardial fibrosis. Recently, HCM has been associated with increased oxidative stress, which has the potential to perpetuate hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Myocardial copper and zinc imbalance is an important source of oxidative stress and has been shown to cause hypertrophic forms of cardiomyopathy in animal models. Also, excess copper plays a crucial role in Wilson's disease, which is an important differential diagnosis of HCM. Copper chelation, a treatment for Wilson's disease, has recently been shown to reverse LVH and organ fibrosis in several animal disease models and in humans with Type 2 diabetes. Surprisingly, there are no published data on copper homeostasis in patients with HCM. We investigated whether there were significant abnormalities in copper and zinc homeostasis in patients with HCM. Methods: With ethical approval, we compared 20 HCM patients randomly selected from our local database with 18 compliant healthy volunteers. Each participant provided 24-hour urine and fasting blood serum samples that were analyzed for copper/ceruloplasmin/zinc using the highly sensitive and widely validated Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry technique. Results: HCM patients exhibited significantly higher serum copper and serum ceruloplasmin levels (Table 1). Serum zinc tended to be higher in healthy volunteers compared with HCM patients. There was no significant difference in urinary zinc or copper between the two groups. (Represented in Table) Conclusion: Patients with HCM exhibit severely altered copper homeostasis. Combined with the previous observation of fibrosis regression induced by LVH and copper chelation therapy, these findings provide a mechanistic basis for copper chelation therapy to be tested in HCM.",,"Potluri, R.;Roberts, N.;Miller, C.;Brooks, N.;Ray, S.;Cooper, G.;Schmitt, M.",2012,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehs283,0,0,

1643,A case of fulminant Wilson's disease: The effect of plasmapheresis,"Background/Case Studies: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of dysfunctional copper transport that causes copper to accumulate in tissues such as the liver, kidney, brain, and cornea. Rarely, patients presenting with fulminant Wilson's disease (fWD), in which fulminant liver failure, DAT-negative hemolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) cause rapid clinical deterioration and are almost always fatal without liver transplantation. Although therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been recommended for FWD, the level of evidence is very low, with only a few case reports addressing the efficacy of TPE. Here we present a case of fWD with successful liver transplantation after daily TPE. Study Design/Methods: A 21-year-old woman presented with a 1-day history of dark urine, jaundice, and fatigue. Physical examination and laboratory values revealed liver failure, DAT-negative hemolysis, Keyser-Fleischer rings, ceruloplasmin < 4 mg/dL, AST higher than ALT (123 and 40 IU/L, respectively), and 24-hour urine copper level as 4703 cups. . FWD was diagnosed and trientine and zinc acetate were started on the 1st day of hospitalization. The patient also received 6 units of plasma for coagulopathy. Beginning on day 2, the patient was given a daily plasma volume exchange with plasma as the replacement fluid. No additional plasma was required except on day 4 after starting daily TPE. Renal function began to deteriorate from day 2 and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started on day 4 following TPE #3. Due to anemia due to intravascular hemolysis, the patient was admitted to grades 1-4. Daily red blood cell transfusion was performed on days (total of 7 units). Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed on day 6. Serum copper levels were measured in blood samples taken at admission and after the last TPE. Medical records were reviewed to assess the clinical response to treatment. Results/Results: At admission and after 4 consecutive days of TPE and 29 hours of CRRT in addition to medications, serum copper levels were 200 and 140 cups/dL, respectively. Hemoglobin, 7.3 g/dL at admission, 2-4 with daily RBC transfusions. It was 7.7-9.1 g/dL on days and then 8.5-9.0 g/dL on 5 days. INR remained between 2.0 and 3.5 with TPE. Histology of the explanted liver showed cirrhosis with very little stainable copper in periseptal hepatocytes, and genetic analysis showed a heterozygous mutation of ATP7B (p.Q111X). Conclusion: Hemolysis continued during treatment with TPE alone, but improved with the addition of CRRT. However, TPE was an effective method to stabilize coagulopathy without increasing blood volume. Despite the reduction of serum copper, it remains unclear how much of the copper is removed by TPE versus CRRT. Our case suggests that TPE alone is effective in stabilizing coagulopathy, but a combination of TPE and CRRT may be more effective in stabilizing intravascular hemolysis in fWD.",,"Choi, E.

1644,Altered expression of metabolic nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Wilson disease mouse),"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the Cu-bearing P-type ATPase (ATP7b), causing excessive hepatic copper deposition and often resulting in liver failure. The Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse animal model has increased hepatic copper levels similar to Wilson's disease patients, as well as increased nuclear copper concentrations. Previous studies have shown that copper has a high affinity for the estrogen receptor DNA-binding domain (ER-DBD), and incubation of ER-DBD with copper results in loss of ER binding to response elements. Our hypothesis is that high hepatic copper concentrations result in decreased nuclear receptor activation due to disruption of zinc binding in DNA-DBD of nuclear receptors. In vitro translation of RXR with 4-40 mM copper (CuSO4) resulted in complete loss of FXR:RXR binding to the short heterodimer partner protein (SHP) and bile salt export pump (Bsep, canalicular bile acid transporter) promoters, and 40 µM of zinc ( Addition of ZnSO4) restored binding to the SHP and BSEP promoters. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 5 mM CuSO4 reduced chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated activation of BSEP mRNA expression. In Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, Bsep and SHP mRNA expression at 6, 12, and 16-20 weeks were reduced by 40% and 40-20% with reduced binding of FXR to Bsep and SHP mouse promoters in the EMSA analysis. 6, 12 and 16-20 in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. mRNA expression of other nuclear receptor target genes was also decreased in weeks: HNF4a (Na<sup>+</sup>-taurocholate transporter protein, basolateral bile salt transporter, decreased 20%), LRH-1 (Cyp8b required for cholic acid synthesis, 40%) decreased; Abcg8, canalicular cholesterol transporter, decreased by 20%) and TR (Spot14, regulation of triglyceride pools, decreased 40 - 20%). mRNA expression of HNF4a and protein expression of RXR were unchanged in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Basal mRNA expression of the phase-I enzymes Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10 was increased 2-fold (P= 0.057) in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but activation by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) agonist TCPOBOP was knocked out relative to wild-type offspring. attenuated in mice (20%, Cyp3a11 and 10% Cyp2b10). These data suggest that the Wilson disease mouse model has defects in nuclear receptor signaling that disrupts the regulation of genes involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the liver.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

1645,Immunological study of a child with D-penicillamine-induced generalized myasthenia gravis.,"Objective: D-penicillamine (D-Pen) is known as a cause of drug-induced myasthenia gravis (MG), but its etiology remains unclear. A decrease in regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) has recently been reported in non-drug MG cases. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease, we examined the immunological findings of a case with D-Pen-induced MG. Design: Case report. A 12-year-old girl was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of one and was given the D-Pen. He developed blepharoptosis and muscle weakness that changed daily but did not have bulbar palsy. The titer of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) was extremely high (1520nmol/L; normal range <0.04nmol/L). A Harvey-Masland test showed reduction, which was corrected by administration of edrophonium. Therefore, he was diagnosed with D-Pen-induced generalized MG. The D-Pen was discontinued and zinc acetate and pyridostigmine were started for the treatment of Wilson's disease and MG, respectively. Although the patient's MG symptoms disappeared after 6 months, the abnormally high anti-AChR-Ab titer persisted. He was treated with immunoadsorption therapy to reduce autoantibodies, followed by administration of immunosuppressants. In our patient, we analyzed various immunological findings, including peripheral blood Treg count by flow cytometry based on CD4, CD25 and intracellular Foxp3 expression. There was no correlation between the anti-AChR-Ab titer and the patient's MG symptoms. The mean expression levels of Treg/CD4+ lymphocytes (5.28+/-1.01%) were not significantly different from those of healthy controls. Conclusion: Our results support the idea that the pathogenesis of D-Pen-induced MG is different from that of non-drug-induced MG.",,"Nishimura, T.;Niimi, T.;Ishida, T.;Nakayama, Y.;Inaba, Y.;Naganuma, K.;Koike, K.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2012.04283.x,0,0,
1646,Presentation of Wilson's disease in Pakistan: Is it different from the rest of the world?,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an average prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people worldwide. Data on WD from Pakistan are not available, so we aimed to determine the pattern of WD in the Pakistani population and compare it with the international literature. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi. Results: Thirty-two (68.1%) of 47 patients were male. The mean age (SD) was 26.6 (9.97) years. The most common presentation was hepatic; 22 (46.8%) were neurological; 17 (36.2%) and the remaining 8 (17%) presented with psychiatric symptoms. Ceruloplasmin levels decreased in 39 (86.6%) (<0.25 g/dl) and 32 (68.1%) serum Cu decreased. 24-hour urinary Cu increased only in 22 (47.6%). Slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer (CF) rings was performed in 15 (31.9%) patients and only 9 (60%) had CF rings. Of these 9 patients with positive CF ring, 8 (88.8%) had neurological disease. The mean AST)/ALT ratio was 1.92 and the median Alkaline Phosphatase/Total Bilirubin ratio was 79.30 (IQR 35.05; 166.50). D-Penicillamine and Zinc (Zn) combination was given to 31 (65.4%) patients, D-Penicillamine alone to 11 (23.1%) and Zn only to 5 (11.5%) patients. Liver transplantation was performed in only one patient with decompensated liver disease. Conclusions: In our population, patients with WD present a little later in adulthood and hepatic presentation is the most common. Disease presentation and biochemical parameters in Pakistan are no different from the rest of the world.",,"Parkash, O.;Ayub, A.;Jafri, W.;Alsihah, S.

1647,Cerebral cortex and white matter lesions in Wilson's disease,"Purpose: To evaluate the clinical features and imaging findings of Wilson's disease (WD) with cerebral cortex and white matter lesions. Background: The cerebral cortex and white matter eventually become involved in WD patients during the long disease course. Sometimes, however, cerebral symptoms such as seizures are the first symptoms, with obvious cerebral lesions. Diagnosis of WD in these cases is difficult and the clinical course may differ from normal WD cases. Methods: From 1964 to 2011, we screened patients with WD who initially showed cerebral lesions in our department, two patients had cortical-subcortical lesions. We examined the clinical features and course of these patients. Results: Two of the 17 WD patients in our department had cerebral lesions. Case1: A 22-year-old male) initially presented with progressive gait disturbance, hand tremor, and psychiatric disturbance. Brain MRI revealed a high T2-weighted signal in the white matter (Rt >Lt) of the bilateral frontal lobes and basal ganglia, and the frontal lobe cortex was enhanced with gadolinium. The accumulation of cortical-subcortical lesions in the right frontal lobe in FDG-PET made us suspect the diagnosis of tumor for the first time. However, the possibility of WD was considered due to high echo abnormalities in the liver. The mutation in ATB7B (c.2304insC) provided a definitive diagnosis of WD. He was treated with Trientine. However, his clinical symptoms and MR image aggravated within 2 months. Therefore, zinc acetate was given secondarily. There was no change in clinical symptoms afterward. Case2: A 20-year-old male patient presented with complaints of stuttering, hand tremor and euphoric mood for 6 years. Brain CT showed low-density areas in the left anterior lobe. He was treated with D-penicillamine. He had a seizure 3 months later, and his left frontal lesion was more common on his CT. Conclusions: It was previously reported that cerebral lesion occurred in 25% of WD patients during the clinical course. In our department, approximately 10% of the patients initially presented with cerebral lesions. Diagnosis of WD was difficult in these patients and chelate therapy was ineffective. We should consider the possibility of WD in patients with tremor and psychiatric disorders or even with prominent cerebral lesions involving the basal ganglia.",,"Tanaka, N.;Hanajima, R.;Terao, Y.;Goto, J.;Tsuji, S.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1648,Myeloneuropathy secondary to excessive copper removal in Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Case report. Background: Treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) focuses on removing excess copper from the body and preventing its re-accumulation. Paradoxically, there have been reports of neuropathy and myeloneuropathy secondary to copper deficiency caused by excess removal. Methods: Case report. Results: The patient was a 36-year-old male diagnosed with WD at the age of 20. The main clinical picture was characterized by generalized dystonia, bradykinesia, hyperreflexia, bilateral Babinski sign and freezing of gait. He was admitted to our clinic with complaints of worsening gait instability, frequent falls, and numbness in hands and feet for 6 months. He presented stocking and glove distribution, postural and vibratory hypoesthesia in the lower extremities, gait ataxia and freezing and algic hypoesthesia. Neurax MRI detected bilateral hyperintensity in the T2 WI, which includes a long segment of the posterior dorsal cord, with no corresponding abnormal signal in T1. There was no contrast enhancement or spinal cord enlargement on post-gadolinium images. Lenticulocaudate copper deposition and putamen gliosis were also observed. Electromyography showed a sensoriomotor peripheral neuropathy. Analytical studies serum copper 10.2 mg/dL (69.9-152.5), urine copper 0.64 mumol/24h (0.78), serum zinc 14.7 mumol/L (12-20), Hb 8 .2 g/dL, Leukocytes 10.63x109/L, Platelets 624x109/L. Alternative causes of myelopathy and polyneuropathy were excluded. A causal relationship between copper deficiency and myeloneuropathy was classified as possible. Trientine (500 mg/day) and zinc sulfate (330 mg/day) were suspended and zinc acetate 100 mg/day was started. After 3 months of follow-up, a slight clinical improvement was documented. Conclusions: This case draws attention to the neurological consequences of excessive copper exposure during long-term WD therapy. Symptoms of myeloneuropathy may mimic progressive WD with worsening postural instability and gait disturbance. Knowing the risks associated with removing excess copper in conjunction with more frequent monitoring of copper levels can prevent this complication.",,"Teodoro, T.;Neutel, D.;Geraldo, F.;Rosa, M.

1649,Restless legs syndrome due to chelation therapy in Wilson's disease: A new complication after liver transplantation.,"Objective: To describe a new side effect of copper chelation therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease after liver transplantation. Background: A 52-year-old man with genetically confirmed Wilson's disease was started on D-penicillamine therapy when he was a teenager. He tolerated copper chelation well, but developed decompensated liver disease and required transplantation. Chelation therapy was discontinued after liver transplant surgery. Ten months after transplantation, he presented with progressive dysarthria, bradykinesia, and tooth stiffness. D-penicillamine treatment was restarted. Methods: Serial biochemical results were compiled from several hospitals attended by the patient. The stoichiometry of penicillamine-transition metal reactions and their dissociation constants are reviewed. Results: Biochemical abnormalities associated with Wilson's disease return to normal following liver transplantation. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms have a variable outcome. In this case, chelation was resumed in one patient due to progressive neurological symptoms but with essentially normal copper biochemistry. Since these patients in Wilson's disease are loaded with copper, copper is preferentially excreted by D-penicillamine. As the mass of copper decreases, other transition metals with lower affinity constants but relatively higher amounts of copper will be discarded. This patient developed iron deficiency in proportion to resumption of D-penicillamine therapy, which neutralized restless legs syndrome. Conclusions: The use of chelating agents after liver transplantation in Wilson's patients may lead to transition metal deficiencies. This occurs as copper levels normalize and the dissociation constant for the reaction remains unchanged. This is the first report of penicillamine-induced restless legs syndrome in a patient with Wilson's disease.",,"O'Brien, M.;Counihan, T.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1650,Epilepsy in Wilson's disease (WD),"Purpose: To evaluate WD patients with epilepsy. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive, treatable disorder of copper accumulation and copper toxicity with protean manifestations primarily involving the brain and liver. Neurologically, it presents as a movement disorder with speech abnormalities, tremor, incoordination, and dystonia being common features. Epilepsy is not a common presentation of WD. Methods: We evaluated 31 WD patients and found that 6 had epilepsy. Detailed history, general and neurological examination, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea, routine biochemical and copper studies (serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urine copper and serum copper) and electroencephalogram (EEG) other than brain imaging were performed on these patients. Results: Of the 6 patients (19.4%) with epilepsy, 4 (66.7%) were male and the rest were female. 4 (66.7%) patients were in the juvenile group (<=18 years old), and the other 2 patients (33.3%) were in the adult group (>=18 years old). 4 young patients presented with predominant dystonic features and 2 adult patients had both neurological and psychiatric features. There were secondary generalized complex partial seizures in 4 (66.7%) patients, and generalized seizures in 2 (33.3%) patients. Occasional myoclonic jerks occurred in 1 (16.7%) patient. EEG was abnormal in all 6 patients with theta background and focal and generalized discharges were seen. Seizures started before decoppering treatment was started in 4 (66.7%) patients, and later in 2 patients. All patients responded well to antiepileptics. The response of WD itself to treatment was more variable, with improvement in 2 (33.3%) patients, mild improvement in 3 (50%) patients, worsening at baseline, and worsening and death in 1 (16.7%) patient. Conclusion: In our study, the prevalence of epilepsy was 19.4%. It is approximately 30 times higher than the prevalence of epilepsy in the general population and is therefore unlikely to represent an accidental relationship. It may result from direct toxicity of copper (possibly inhibition of membrane ATPase) or from pyridoxine deficiency during penicillamine use or from a metabolic encephalopathy-like condition. Although the prognosis of epilepsy in WD is comparable to that in the general population, how much WD affects its prognosis requires evaluation of a larger series of patients.",,"Kumar, N.;Joshi, D.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,1,
1651,Spectrum of movement disorders and response to penicillamine therapy in Wilson's disease,"Objective: To report the spectrum of movement disorders and predictors of response to penicillamine therapy in Wilson's disease (WD). Background: Although movement disorder is a predominant feature in neurological WD, studies on its spectrum and response to penicillamine are scarce. Methods: A detailed history and clinical examination were performed in consecutive neurological WD patients. The type, prevalence and severity of movement disorders were recorded. Complete hemogram, serum chemistry, ceruloplasmin, copper, urinary copper, ultrasound abdominal and cranial MRI were performed. The severity of WD rated on a 0-3 scale. After penicillamine, patients were followed up at 3-month follow-up and worsening was considered if there was >1 grade deterioration. Results: 67 patients with neurological WD, 14 of whom were female, with a median age of 13 (4-41) years, were included. 63 patients had movement disorders; 17 had dystonia, 2 had tremor, 21 had tremor, 7 had myoclonus, 11 had choreoathetosis, and 5 had dystonia with chorea and tremor. MRI was abnormal in 79%; 87% had corpus striatum involvement, 56% had brain stem, thalamus and globuspallidus involvement. At 3 months of treatment, 22 (32.8%) patients deteriorated neurologically and were associated with a family history of WD (p=0.03), low leukocyte count (p=0.03), chronic liver disease (CLD) on ultrasound (p= 0.008). While 19 (86.4%) of 38 patients with CLD worsened, 90% (26/29) of patients without CLD did not. Disease duration (p= 0.47), severity of movement disorder (p= 90), serum creatinine (P=0.97), albumin (p= 0.87), bilirubin (p= 0.40), transaminase (p= 0.78), copper (p= 0.78) 0.93), urinary copper (p=0.70) and number of MRI lesions (p=0.60) were not associated with deterioration. Urinary copper excretion increased significantly at 3 months from baseline in the impaired group compared to those without impairment (mean 53.3 Vs - 3.2, p= 0.005). Conclusions: Movement disorder is a feature that occurs in 94% of patients with neurological WD, and worsening is seen in 34% of patients after penicillamine, especially in those with familial WD, low leukocyte count, and chronic liver disease.",,"Kalita, J.;Chandra, S.;Kumar, V.;Misra, U.

1652,Speech behavior in Wilson's disease,"Objective: This study analyzed the speech behavior of patients with Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease is defined as autosomal recessive and is mainly characterized by copper deposition in the liver and central nervous system. Speech problems may occur among the neurological manifestations of Wilson's disease, but these are poorly known and identified, making effective intervention procedures difficult to detail. Methods: All 30 patients diagnosed and treated, 16 males and 14 females, aged 19 to 58 years, in Sao Paulo University Medical Faculty Department of Neurology, Sao Paulo, Brazil are under medical treatment (D-penicillamine). or zinc sulfate) at varying doses. They were also subjected to phonoaudiological evaluation, which consisted of perceptual-auditory analysis of speech behavior. Results: The analysis showed 7 (seven) patients (23.2%) without speech changes, 9 patients (30%) with anarthria, and 14 patients (46.67%) with dysarthria. In this last group, 1 patient (3.33%) was at low level, 8 patients (26.66%) was at moderate level, and 5 patients (16.66%) was at emphatic level. Conclusion: These results show that clinical speech expression is variable as well as there is no standard in the manifestation of the disease. Therefore, systematic studies linking clinical signs and symptoms with functional testing and laboratory and imaging examinations are required to improve understanding of the various clinical forms, treatment, and rehabilitation of Wilson's disease.",,"Estevo, A.

1653,Odor analysis in Wilson's disease,"Purpose: Odor analysis in Wilson's patients. Background: Wilson's disease, described by Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson in 1912, is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Affected individuals have excessive accumulation of copper in the liver, which can be fatal if left undetected due to defective excretion of copper in the bile. Methods: Sniffin' Sticks test (16 pens) was used for odor evaluation. In the study, 60 controls (24 women and 36 men, mean age 33.81 years old) and 64 patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease (29 women and 35 men, mean age 31.28 years) were analyzed. All patients with Wilson's disease are under medical treatment (Trientin, D-penicillamine or zinc sulfate), 26 patients (13 women and 13 men) had hepatic manifestations only, and 38 patients (16 women and 22 men) had hepatic and neurological signs. Right Fisher and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Wilson's disease patients with only hepatic manifestations and those with neurological findings were statistically similar, but there were differences for the five variants (mint, banana, lemon, anise, and fish) and for the total variant between Wilson's disease patients and the control group for Sniffin' Sticks. group. Conclusion: Our study showed the difference between Wilson's disease patients and the control group in identifying certain scents (mint, banana, lemon, anise, and fish).",,"Carvalho, M.

1654,Wilson's disease: Follow-up studies in a cohort of 135 neuro-Wilson patients over a decade,"Purpose: To characterize the presenting features and response to treatment of patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Background: WD is an inherited metabolic disorder that mainly causes neuro-psychiatric and hepatic dysfunctions. If left untreated, it causes serious morbidity and case fatalities. Long-term clinical follow-up data are limited in the literature. Methods: 135 consecutive patients diagnosed with Neuro-WD at the Movement Disorder Clinic of a tertiary care center (Bangur Neurology Institute) in India were included. The study period was from June 1996 to December 2011. This is both a retrospective (28) and a prospective (107) study. The diagnosis of WD was made according to the Sternlieb criteria. CF ring was positive in all, Data compiled into semi-structured proforma. Treatment was with D-penicillamine and zinc salts. Other medications were also given as needed. The patients were followed up at regular intervals. Results: The mean age of onset was 11.79; (males: females 584:51). The mean disease duration before diagnosis was 15.30 months. 22.96% had a family history of WD; consanguinity at 10.37%. 47.41% had a history of jaundice; liver disease 44.44%. The admission features were as follows: dysarthria- 90.44%, parkinsonism- 81.62%, dystonia- 90.4%, tremor- 51.11, choreo-athetosis 11.85%, ataxia-11.76%, sialorrhea- 77.21%, dysphagia- 55.88%, seizure-17.16%, psychiatric - 62.31%; arthralgia/arthritis- 3.7%, myopathy- 7.5%, amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea - 7.5%, darkening of skin- 11.6%, bleeding disorders- 7%. The mean time to recovery was 7.11 months. 14.58% of patients worsened D-penicillamine at baseline, which did not recur when restarting the drug at lower doses. Dysarthria and residual dystonia were the most common residual deficits (86% and 90.4%, respectively). Behavioral abnormalities often worsened even as physical symptoms improved. The CF ring disappeared in 7.40% and urinary copper levels returned to normal in 11.11%. 33.33% of the patients had at least one drug default. 7.407% became symptom-free; 15.55%- had residual symptoms but were employed as significant; 25.92%- had symptoms but could have ADL; 24.44%- partially dependent; and 16.30%-severely dependent. Mortality rate was 10.37%. Results: Dystonia and dysarthria were the most common features. Early treatment leads to better outcomes. Treatment should be individualized.

1655,Patients with free copper toxicosis in Wilson's disease should be treated with zinc from the start.,"Objective: (1) To make it known that Wilson's disease (WD) is not an appropriate name for curable free copper toxicosis (2) Zinc is an appropriate choice for the treatment of copper toxicosis. Background: Patients with WD have been abused with chelators aimed at excretion of accumulated copper. It took 50 years for it to become generally accepted that chelators are unscientific and irrational. On the contrary, zinc reduces intestinal copper absorption, resulting in decreased copper intoxication. Basically, it is not possible to conduct a comparative clinical study for a rare disease. As a result, it should be learned from case reports and theories based on tested expert opinion. Methods: We conducted a best available retrospective observational study on three cases of free copper intoxication in WD treated with zinc monotherapy: (1) a 12-year-old boy with hypokinesia, dysarthria, tremor, dystonia, and involuntary movements, ( 2) A 24-year-old girl with progressive tremor, gait disturbance and torticollis, and (3) a 10-year-old seriously ill girl presented suddenly with hemolytic anemia, which was indicated for liver transplantation. The second patient, who initially presented with decompensated hepatitis, worsened with new neurological symptoms despite having been treated with penicillamine for nearly 15 years. Along with physical examination, clinical status and biochemical parameters such as urine copper and liver function tests were frequently evaluated. Results: The first patient with neurological and degenerative symptoms improved significantly biochemically within a few months with 150 mg of zinc and also clinically at approximately 12 months. In particular, the symptoms of the second patient disappeared in about a month with 100 mg of zinc. The most surprising outcome was in the third patient who needed an urgent liver transplant and was unlisted with just 2 weeks of 125mg zinc monotherapy with impressive clinical improvement. All have become symptom-free. Conclusion: The aim of WD management should be to prevent free copper intoxication. Zinc is the treatment of choice for treating free copper intoxication in WD from the outset and should have educational value for physicians to treat patients with tested evidence, not expert-based pseudo-scientific theses.",,"Avan, A.;Azarpazhooh, M.;Kianifar, H.;Hoogenraad, T.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.25051,0,0,
1656,Elastosis perforans serpiginosa with an atypical and widespread presentation,"Introduction and goals. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare skin disease in which there is transepithelial elimination of connective tissue elements such as elastic fibers from the papillary dermis. There are three different types of this disease: idiopathic, reactive, and drug-induced. Reactive forms are associated with other diseases such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, scleroderma, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The drug-induced form occurs in approximately 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. This drug is used in diseases such as Wilson's disease and homocystinuria. The most common clinical presentation is small keratotic papules that usually affect the face, neck, trunk, and upper extremities. Topical retinoids, corticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, and different types of lasers have been used to treat this disease with varying response rates. (Fig. Presented) We present the case of a 16-year-old boy with Down syndrome presenting an atypical and diffuse case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa. The report of the case. A 16-year-old boy with Down syndrome was referred to our clinic because of large plaques on both anterior thighs. The plaques were erythematous with a flattened center and elevated hyperkeratotic margins. No other skin lesions were observed. A skin biopsy was performed from one of the margins showing transepithelial elimination of elastic fibers that stained positively with Acanthosis and Orcein. These histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa. The patient was treated with topical betamethasone and calcipotriol without good response. Results. We present a case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa in a 16-year-old boy with Down syndrome. EPS usually affects children and teenagers aged 6 to 20 years, and the lesions are located on the face, neck, and arms. The clinical picture in this child was diffuse and atypical, with large erythematous plaques affecting the anterior aspect of both thighs without other lesions on the face and arms. The incidence of EPS is higher in patients with Down syndrome than in the general population. A possible explanation for this may be a change in connective tissue and elastic fibers, such as premature skin aging and post-folliculitis anetoderma in patients with Down syndrome.

A literature review is presented with the case. Methods: Prospective follow-up of the index case during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period. A retrospective review of the available evidence was conducted using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Results: A 28-year-old primigravid with Wilson's disease diagnosed in her late teens was admitted to us at 14 weeks of gestation. He suffered from liver cirrhosis. Her disease was preconceptionally stable compared to zinc therapy, which required a change to trientine at 20 weeks of gestation due in part to iron deficiency attributable to zinc therapy. A multidisciplinary approach has been adopted that includes Obstetricians, Hematologists and Hepatologists. Her pregnancy was initially complicated by self-terminating episodes of epistaxis that set in during the third trimester. Labor induction was performed at 38 weeks of gestation due to suspected obstetric cholestasis and a healthy male baby weighing 3014 g was delivered. Delivery was complicated by major postpartum hemorrhage of 1500 mL, which was successfully treated. It has returned to its stable pre-pregnancy state. Conclusions: This case serves to highlight the importance of the appropriate use of a multidisciplinary team approach and the use of limited resources in the management of a challenging medical disorder in pregnancy. It illustrates the difficulty of treatment during pregnancy and the fine line between overtreatment and undertreatment. Wilson's disease is a rare condition with limited evidence to aid management decisions.",,"Ryan, L.;Kapoor, T.;Muslim, I.",2012,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03376.x,0,0,
1658,Children with Wilson's disease: Proton magnetic spectroscopy findings,"Introduction and purpose: Neurological involvement Wilson's disease (WD) is less common in pediatric patients than in adults. Therefore, subclinical neurologic involvement cannot be ignored. Brain spectroscopy (MRS) has been used as a tool to provide clinically useful metabolic information about WD's neurological deterioration. The aim of our study is to determine the brain metabolic changes due to WD in patients with mild liver disease who have been treated since childhood using MRS. Materials and methods: Twenty-two patients (15 males) diagnosed with WD (mean age at diagnosis 6.6 years; range 1.8-14.4) were included in the study. The diagnosis of WD was made in the presence of at least two of the following features: ceruloplasmin level <20 mg/dl, basal urinary copper level >100 mcg/24 hours, urine copper level >1575 mcg/24 hours after penicillamine challenge test, liver copper level >250 mcg /g dry weight. All patients had mild liver disease at baseline, and 8 cases (36.4%) had mild neurological signs. All 22 patients were examined by MRS in the basal ganglia (BG), occipital cortex (POC), and anterior white matter (FWM). For creatine (Cr), the ratio of the following metabolites was calculated: N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and myoinositol (mI). The mean peak line width was measured in each spectrum. The mean disease duration at the time of MRS evaluation was 13.7 years (range 2.1-24.1) and the mean age was 19.6 years (range 9.8-34.4). Results: Metabolic rates in MRS in our cohort resulted in the normal range. Compared with the group of patients with hepatic symptoms, the group with accompanying subtle neurological symptoms did not significantly reduce the NAA/Cr ratio (GB: 82.7% versus 89.6%; POC: 101.2% versus 116.6%; FWM: 89.1% versus 86.2%) and increased mI/Cr ratio in the three areas studied (GB: 26.9% vs. 22.7%; POC: 34.8% vs. 34.9%; FWM: 46.4% vs. 42.9%). Conclusion: It is known that MRS changes are definitely associated with a decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio assigned to neuronal loss and an increased mI/Cr ratio due to gliosis and inflammation in adult WD patients with neurological findings. The absence of low NAA/Cr levels and increased mI/Cr levels in our cohort seems to indicate that an early treatment can prevent neuronal loss, gliosis, and inflammation in brain regions, also in children with mild neurological signs at baseline.",,"Ranucci, G.;Liccardo, D.;Puoti, G.;Di Dato, F.;Tufano, M.;Venturino, D.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960532-5,0,0,
1659,Pancreatic involvement in children with Wilson's disease receiving long-term zinc therapy,"Introduction and purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a disease characterized by copper accumulation in various organs, especially the liver. The treatment is based on the use of a copper chelator and zinc. Frequent increases in serum amylase and lipase have been reported in adult WD patients treated with zinc without symptoms of pancreatitis. The aim of our study is to evaluate pancreatic enzymes in children with WD receiving long-term zinc therapy. Materials and methods: 43 WD patients (28 men; mean age at diagnosis 6.1 years, range 1.1-20.9) were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were symptom-free. The diagnosis of WD was established in the presence of at least two of the following features: ceruloplasmin level <20 mg/dL, basal urinary copper (UCu) level >100 mcg/24 hours, UCu >1575 mcg/24 hours after penicillamine challenge test, liver copper level >250 mcg/g dry weight. Thirty-two patients (24 men) who received long-term (median duration 12 years, range 3-25) zinc therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc two or three times daily, depending on body weight and age) were studied. Adherence to treatment was evaluated on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Serum levels of amylase and lipase were analyzed during zinc therapy in all patients. Results: Twenty-seven patients (84%) maintained normal ALT levels with zinc treatment. At the end of the follow-up, according to the UCu excretion (37+/-2mcg/24 h), all patients had good compliance with the treatment. Pancreatic serum levels were all normal before starting zinc therapy. Nine patients (28%) showed hyperamylasemia (219+/-44UI/L) and 7 (22%) hyperlipazemia (110+/-30UI/L) with zinc therapy, without clinical and radiological signs of pancreatitis. Only a 24-year-old adolescent (3%) showed an episode of acute symptomatic pancreatitis with elevated levels of amylase and lipase (300UI/L and 220UI/L, respectively) after 78 months of zinc therapy. Common causes of pancreatitis other than zinc were ruled out. Conclusions: This study confirms that most WD patients chronically treated with zinc also show benign pancreatic hyperenzyme in childhood. Contrary to previous reports, acute pancreatitis may occur.",,"Ranucci, G.;Tufano, M.;Liccardo, D.;Di Dato, F.;Puoti, G.;Salvatori, M.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960410-1,0,0,
1660,Long-term zinc therapy in children with mild liver disease,"Introduction and purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder. In the pediatric age, most cases have a hepatic presentation. Penicillamine is the first-line therapy in children with liver disease, while zinc is indicated for presymptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of specific zinc monotherapy in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Material and methods: All WD patients referred to our Department of Pediatrics for diagnostic investigation of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. The diagnosis of WD was made in the presence of at least two of the following features: low ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL), increased basal urinary copper level (>100 mcg/24 hours), increased urinary copper level after birth. penicillamine challenge test (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), increased liver copper level (>250 mcg/g dry weight). Of the 43 WD patients enrolled, 29 were treated with zinc over a median period of 12 years (range 3-25). Zinc was the initial treatment of choice in 12 cases. The main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study was normalization of serum ALT. Adherence to treatment was evaluated on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Of the 17 (58%) children treated with penicillamine as first choice, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range, 4 to 48) and started maintenance therapy with zinc. The remaining 13 (76%) patients with persistent hyper-ALT while on penicillamine switched to zinc; nine (70%) of these normalized ALT over zinc over a median period of 9.5 months (range, 5 to 151). Of 12 patients (92%) given zinc alone as first-line, 11 (92%) normalized ALT over a median period of 14 months (range, 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT on zinc showed poor treatment compliance. At the end of the follow-up, the efficacy of decopperization was comparable between the two groups, based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56+4 vs. 37+2 mcg). Conclusions: Although penicillamine therapy is generally used in the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, this study demonstrated that zinc monotherapy can be used as first-line therapy in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Puoti, G.;Liccardo, D.;Tufano, M.;Iorio, R.",2012,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658%2812%2960278-3,0,1,
1661,Concomitant immune-mediated phenomenon in Wilson's disease: Implication for monitoring chelator therapy.,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines support the use of chelating agents (dpenicillamine, trientine) in the first-line treatment of symptomatic patients. The development of chelator-induced immunological adverse events leading to impaired renal function or bone marrow depression is a concern, particularly under d-pensylamine therapy. Based on several case reports, a predictive value for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) has been proposed in this context. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of co-existing or treatment-related immune-mediated disease in WD patients and to evaluate the role of anti-nuclear antibodies in treatment monitoring in a retrospective cohort study. Patients and Methods: A total of 222 WD patients in a European tertiary care center were analyzed retrospectively. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in terms of adverse events and course of anti-nuclear antibodies. Results: 153/222 (69.0%) and 71/222 (32.0%) patients had hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms, respectively. Confirmed co-existing immune-mediated diseases were evident in 28/222 (12.6%) patients. Conclusive data on course of ANA and adverse events under treatment were available for 91 treatments with D-penicillamine, 58 treatments with trientine, and 58 treatments with zinc salts. Among these treatments, an increase in ANA titers was observed in 16/91 (17.6%) patients in the d-penicillamine group, 12/58 (20.7%) patients in the trientine group, and 7/58 (12.1%) patients in the d-penicillamine group. zinc group (p=ns). Analysis of adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatments did not correlate with a previous increase in ANA titers in all groups. Conclusion: Elevation of ANA was a common finding in our cohort, but was not associated with disease presentation and was independent of the medical regimen. We observed no association between the increase in ANA and the development of related immune-mediated adverse events across all treatments. groups and especially in the d-penicillamine group. Therefore, the value of this parameter for monitoring adverse events seems clearly limited.",,"Seesle, J.;Gotthardt, D. N.;Merle, U.;Gohdes, A.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1662,Blisters from my surgery: clinical history helped by internet pictures,"At age 84, WF was admitted to subacute rehabilitation. To recover from the complications of total knee arthroplasty. PMHx. It consists of DM, HTN, anemia, HLD, CAD, COPD, CKD, anxiety, and Hypothyroidism. After two weeks of successful rehabilitation, he developed blisters on his extremities and trunk with no other symptoms. When the blisters burst, they express a clear liquid, followed by crusts and new blisters on other parts of his body. Prednisone was started while the patient was in the hospital, but no documentation was found regarding the reason for this. With further questioning, he stated that he had had blisters before and that steroids usually cured them. Until then, there was no documentation of his blisters, so the likely cause of steroid treatments was COPD exacerbations. After reviewing and considering that the patient was a woman older than 60 years of age, had had previous uncomplicated blistering episodes, as well as that these blisters had responded to steroid therapy, and lastly and most importantly, after comparing her lesions to those posted in multiple places online. Regions Our patient was diagnosed with Bullous Pemphigoid and was started on long prednisone therapy, then recovered and was successfully discharged home. Discussion: Bullous Pemphigoid is an extremely rare disease, but if it is usually present in elderly women, it is a differential diagnosis that we should consider in the presence of blisters in the elderly followed by Pemphigus (a similar but less common blistering disease). The difference between the two is auto-antibodies against intradermal epitopes in the latter and sub-dermal auto-antibodies in the former. Both are linked to a higher risk of death and so primary care geriatricians and anyone dealing with the elderly should be vigilant to diagnose and treat Bullous Pemphigoid, treatment mainly wound care (treated like a burn) and oral steroids. Relapse is common and longer steroid tapers may be required. The etiology is not well understood, but an autoimmune response is known. The diagnosis is clinical. It is known to be associated with the use of certain drugs (Furosemide, Penicillamine and Captopril - among the most prominent -).",,"Garrido, A.

1663,"Copper-deficiency myeloneuropathy with hypozinemia due to zinc excess, gastrectomy, and low serum ceruloplasmin","Objective: We describe low serum zinc level in copper deficiency myeloneuropathy (CuDM) associated with excessive zinc intake and previous gastrectomy. Background Copper malabsorption occurs after gastrectomy or bariatric surgery and can cause CuDM. The antagonistic relationship between copper and zinc is the basis for the treatment of copper excess conditions (eg Wilson's disease) with zinc supplementation. Zinc excess due to long-term use of denture cream may be the cause of CuDM. Design/Methods: Case Report: An 83-year-old man developed progressive triple flexor spasms, severe sensory loss, and absence/decreased reflexes with Babinski signs for 5 years following gastrectomy 38 years ago using zinc-based denture cream (three tubes per week). 30 years and has hypoceruloplasminemia. Serum copper was 0.12 cups/mL (RI 0.75-1.45mcg/mL), ceruloplasmin was 4.0 mg/dL (RI 15-30mg/dL), and serum zinc was 0.58 cups/mL (RI 0.66-1.0mcg/mL). Results: Our patient had three reasons for CuDM-hypocupremia, excessive zinc intake, and hypoceruloplasminemia. Serum zinc levels may be higher than normal in patients with CuDM due to excessive zinc intake (Nations 2008). Hypozincemia was noted by Kumar et al (Kumar 2004) in a patient following gastrectomy and poor copper absorption. Gastrectomy will reduce serum zinc as well as lower serum copper levels. Our patient showed low serum zinc levels in response to excessive zinc intake and was probably the result of her previous gastrectomy. Conclusions: Excessive zinc intake inhibits the absorption of copper and can result in CuDM. Our patient with CuDM, associated with previous gastrectomy, excessive zinc intake and hypoceruloplasminemia, had low serum zinc levels. This likely reflected reduced zinc absorption due to previous gastrectomy. Low serum zinc does not exclude CuDM.",,"Josiah, A.;Salomon, A.;Tacker, D.;Gutmann, L.",2012,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.78.1,0,0,
1664,Some issues and recommendations in the pharmaceutical treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease in which there is excessive copper accumulation in the body. It is a very rare condition in Caucasian populations, but appears to be more common in Chinese. Here we summarize our experience in the pharmaceutical treatment of the disease: (1) we select different initial therapy drugs for patients with different presentations. In general, we choose penicillamine mainly for patients with hepatic symptoms. Penicillamine should be avoided or used with extreme caution in patients with marked stiffness, drooling, dysarthria and dysphagia. (2) WD treatment should be started as early as possible. Zinc agents alone may be sufficient for asymptomatic children with WD who only have abnormal liver function tests. Penicillamines should be added when they become symptomatic or have abnormal liver sonograms. (3) The 24-hour urine copper content is a good reference for adjusting drug doses. A target of 200-500 µg24 UCC is usually an indication of good chelating dose. (4) Lifelong treatment with good compliance should be emphasized. (5) zinc can be used during pregnancy. If necessary, a small dose of penicillamine (250 mg/day) can be added. (6) Chinese herbal medicine should be chosen carefully and used as adjunctive therapy.",,"Liang, X. L.;Li, X.

1665,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes the accumulation of this metal in different organs and tissues. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the main clinical features of the disease. Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical presentation, epidemiological features, disease course, and response to treatment in a historical cohort of 36 Brazilian WD patients. Patients and Methods: Thirty-six WD patients diagnosed from 1971 to 2010 and followed in southern Brazil were studied. The diagnosis of WD was made on the basis of clinical presentation, family history, Kayser-Fleischer rings, low serum cerulosplasmin, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion, liver biopsy, genetic testing, and/or response to the D-penicillamine challenge test. Results: There were 16 (44.4%) male and 20 female (56.6%) patients with a mean age of 34.6+/-10.8 years, with a high predominantly only European continental origin (74.5%). The mean age at first symptom presentation was 23.2+/-9.3. The time elapsed since the first clinical symptom and definitive diagnosis was 27.5+/-41.9 months. At admission, 9 patients (25%) had neuropsychiatric symptoms only, 14 (38.9%) patients had hepatic symptoms only, 11 (30.6%) had both hepatic and neuropsychiatric features (mixed presentation), and 2 (5.5%) patients were asymptomatic.

1667,Differential clinical courses according to their phenotypes and their correlation with ATP7B mutations in a large cohort of Wilson's disease,"Wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneities have been reported in Wilson's disease (WD), which precludes investigation of their relationship. The aim of this study is to determine the factors related to these differences. Methods: Clinical courses and molecular genetic features were analyzed in 237 unrelated Korean WD families. The mean follow-up was 8.2 +/- 5.8 years. Results: Existing phenotypes H1 (12.2%), H2 (42.4%), N1 (21.6%), N2 (0.4%), NX (0.4%), presymptomatic (22.4%) ) and other (0.4%) were classified as modifiers. Guidelines by Ferenci et al. In the presymptomatic group, the age at presentation was the youngest and cirrhosis was the rarest. Decompensated cirrhosis was highest in the H1 group. Positive results were rare in the N1 group. Forty-seven (11 new) ATP7B mutations were identified in 85% of the 474 alleles. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification experiments in ATP7B and analyzes of the ATOX1 and COMMD1 genes did not identify additional mutations. Yeast complementation experiments showed functional disruption of seven novel missense mutants. Five major mutations, p.Arg778Leu, p.Ala874Val, p.Asn1270Ser, p.Lys838SerfsX35 and p.Leu1083Phe were responsible for 63% of alleles. H1 was more common, the age at presentation was younger, and N1+N2+NX tended to be less common in patients with nonsense, frameshift, or insertion mutations than those with lone missense mutations. Patients with either mutation in the transduction (Td) or ATP hinge domain showed presymptomatic or hepatic signs but no neurological signs. Conclusions: The current phenotype strongly influences the clinical outcome of WD and correlates with ATP7B mutation type and location, providing evidence for genotype-phenotype correlations in WD.

1668,An introduction to Wilson's disease for the general practitioner. [French],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper excretion that leads to toxic copper accumulation in the brain, cornea, and other organs as well as the liver. The defect is due to mutations of the copper-carrying ATPase ATP7B. Clinical manifestations are highly variable and include acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, as well as neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring is pathognomonic, but absent in approximately 50% of patients with hepatic alone. In clinically compatible situations, a high index of suspicion is key, with a combination of laboratory tests allowing a diagnosis of WD. Treatment is based on chelating agents, D-penicillamine or trientine. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with acute liver failure or advanced cirrhosis.",,"Hiroz, P.;Antonino, A.;Doerig, C.;Pache, I.;Moradpour, D.",2011,2022-09-07 00:00:00,,0,0,
1669,Serum copper and serum free copper values in the diagnosis and follow-up of Wilson's disease and its carriers. [Chinese],"Objective: To investigate serum copper and serum free copper values in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD), its carrier and viral hepatitis, and to investigate the guiding importance of serum copper monitoring in the treatment of WD. Methods: A total of 80 WD patients (hepatic type, n=60; encephalic type, n=20), 30 carriers, 20 viral hepatitis patients were recruited and serum copper levels were determined. Neural symptoms were scored with a modified Young's degree. Hemogram, liver functions, blood coagulation functions, serum copper and urine copper were tested on all 8 treatment courses with sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS). Patients were treated with zinc after discharge. All data were analyzed. Results: WH (0.17 mg/L +/- 0.04 mg/L), carrier (0.13 mg/L +/- 0.03 mg/L), and severe viral hepatitis (0.12 mg/L) ) patients had an increased free serum copper level. . A slight increase in WD carriers was also observed. Serum copper level correlated with liver function but not with severity of neural symptoms. Serum copper increased in patients without improvement in neural symptoms. However, with the improvement of neural symptoms, serum copper decreased in WD patients. Serum copper stabilized at approximately 0.2 mg/L during the extended treatment period. Conclusion: Serum copper has an auxiliary diagnostic importance in the determination of WD. Hepatic functions affect serum copper level in hepatic type WD. Serum copper of encephalic type WD cannot indicate the severity of neural symptoms. A high serum copper level indicates a poor prognosis. Serum copper is an effective marker in monitoring the development of the disease and its therapeutic efficacy.

1670,Ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The long road to diagnosis. [German],"We report a case of a 13-year-old boy who did not have any symptoms, but who had elevated transaminases and gamma-GT in his routine blood examination. The excessively increased hepatic copper concentration resulted in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease; D-penicillamine treatment was started. A few weeks later, the boy presented with weight loss and symptoms of colitis and pancreatitis. Discontinuation of treatment resulted in resolution of the colitis. Penicillamine therapy was discontinued due to suspicion of drug-induced colitis and pancreatitis after symptoms relapsed during reexposure. Under an alternative treatment of zinc, liver enzymes re-increased, with elevation of auto-antibodies and persistently elevated stool lacto-ferrin. The following reassessment led to the definitive diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis. The above case illustrates the diagnostic difficulties in cases of increased transaminases without specific clinical symptoms. Despite the high specificity of liver copper content for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, any cholestatic liver disease should be excluded as it may lead to significant secondary hepatic copper deposition. Based on the reported case, the characteristics of ulcerative colitis and PSC, especially their association, diagnosis and treatment are presented.",,"Tesch, N.;Lange, L.;Vorndamme, I.;Buderus, S.",2011,December,,0,0,
1671,Musculoskeletal disorders associated with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disease defined as an autosomal recessive disease characterized by free copper release and dramatic accumulation of intracellular hepatic copper followed by hepatic and central nervous system abnormalities. Mutations of the ATP7B gene are responsible for metabolic dysfunction. Small open studies have reported spinal radiological abnormalities, including scoliosis, extensive bone demineralization, osteochondritis, and sometimes fracture. The prevalence of osteoporosis in young adult patients is discussed, with normal mean Z-score values ranging from 10% to 43% in adults. Up to 50% of patients may have a past history of spinal or peripheral fractures. Joint disorders include arthralgias of the large joints such as knee pain, rare effusions, early onset of radiological features of osteoarthritis and associated osteochondritis of the knee joint. Radiological chondrocalcinosis, an unusual feature in young adults, should be confirmed. A small number of patients may develop drug-induced lupus with arthralgia, positive anti-nuclear and anti-histone antibodies secondary to D-penicillamine, the major copper chelator used in WD. In this orphan disease, small retrospective studies cannot allow definitive identification of the joint and bone manifestations of WD. However, such clinical and radiological abnormalities are sometimes the first signs leading to a diagnosis. Physicians should be aware that unexplained joint pain and effusion in large joints, and even radiological features of osteoarthritis in adolescents, may suggest WD and lead to copper examination.

1672,Wilson's disease in southern Brazil: a 40-year follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: Long-term data on the clinical follow-up and treatment efficacy of Wilson's disease are limited due to the low disease frequency. This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of Wilson's disease patients from southern Brazil over a 40-year follow-up period. METHODS: Thirty-six Wilson's disease patients diagnosed from 1971 to 2010 were retrospectively evaluated in terms of their clinical presentations, epidemiological and social characteristics, response to treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: When the continental origins of the patients were examined, it was seen that 74.5% of them were of European origin. The mean age at first symptom presentation was 23.3 +/- 9.3 years, with a delay of 27.5 +/- 41.9 months to definitive diagnosis. At admission, hepatic symptoms were dominant (38.9%), followed by mixed symptoms (hepatic and neuropsychiatric) (30.6%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (25%). Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected with a higher frequency in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (77.8%) and in 55.6% of patients. Eighteen patients developed neuropsychiatric features, most commonly cerebellar syndrome. Neuroradiological imaging abnormalities were observed in 72.2% of these patients. Chronic liver disease was detected in 68% of patients with liver symptoms. 94.2% of all patients were treated with D-penicillamine for a mean duration of 129.9 +/- 108.3 months. Other treatments included zinc salts, combined therapy, and liver transplant. After initiating treatment, 78.8% of patients achieved a stable or improved outcome, with an overall survival rate of 90.1%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first retrospective description of a patient population living in Southern Brazil with Wilson's disease mainly of European continental origin.

1673,Quality of life in patients with treated and clinically stable Wilson's disease,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Wilson's disease (WD) has not been extensively studied. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify clinical and demographic factors affecting HRQoL in 60 clinically stable WD patients treated using a generic questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36). . Disability level and grading of WD multisystemic manifestations were evaluated with the Global Rating Scale for WD (GAS for WD). Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scoring were also administered by the same trained interviewers. Lower scores were found in SF-36 areas in patients with neurological disease compared with those with a predominantly hepatic form of WD. Patients with WD and psychiatric symptoms also had lower HRQoLs than those without. Finally, significant inverse correlations were obtained between the various SF-36 domains and all of the following: latency since first symptoms/symptoms appeared and treatment initiation, MMSE and HDRS scores, and different domains of the GAS for WD.

1674,Medical management of chronic liver disease (CLD) in children (part II): focus on CLD and complications of CLD that require special consideration,"Many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD) may not be treatable. In this situation, complications need to be anticipated, prevented, or at least controlled by the best available therapeutic modalities. There are three main goals for the treatment of portal hypertension: (i) prevention of the first episode of variceal bleeding to a large extent by non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, which is not usually recommended in children; (ii) control of bleeding using a stepwise approach from the least invasive strategies to the most; (iii) and prevention of rebleeding using bypass operations, especially with enthusiasm for the use of meso-Rex bypass in the pediatric population. Hepatic encephalopathy management also consists of three main aspects: (i) excluding other causes of encephalopathy; (ii) identifying and treating precipitating factors; and (iii) initiating empirical therapy with drugs such as lactulose, rifaximin, sodium benzoate, and flumazenil. Treatment of mild ascites and peripheral edema should begin with sodium and water restriction, followed by careful diuresis, followed by large-volume paracentesis associated with expansion of colloid volume in severe cases. Empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be used in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacterial and fungal sepsis, and cholangitis, with appropriate changes in therapy after appropriate cultures have been obtained, susceptibility testing. Empirical treatments remain standard practice for pruritus; these consist of bile acid binding agents, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines, rifampin (rifampicin) and carbamazepine. Partial external biliary diversion can be used in refractory cases. When hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, treatment should be started early to prevent progression of renal failure; Approaches include general supportive measures, management of accompanying complications, screening for sepsis, antibiotic therapy, use of vasopressin analogues (terlipressin), and renal replacement therapy if necessary. Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are best managed with liver transplantation. For the management of growth retardation, special care should be provided to provide adequate calorie, nutrition and vitamin-mineral support, necessary vaccinations and psychological well-being. Anticoagulation may be attempted in acute portal vein thrombosis. Some CLDs, such as extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and Indian childhood cirrhosis, require special attention. Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy for EHBA is the current standard surgical approach with nutritional therapy and additional fat and water soluble vitamins, minerals and trace elements. In type 1 Crigler-Najjar syndrome, comprehensive phototherapy combined with adjuvant therapy to bind photobilirubin such as calcium phosphate, cholestyramine or agar until liver transplantation can be performed is the mainstay of treatment. In India, treating childhood cirrhosis with penicillamine in the early stages of the disease and at doses similar to those used to treat Wilson's disease reduces the death rate by half. New hopes for the future include extracorporeal liver support devices (molecular adsorbent circulation system MARS and Prometheus). ), hepatocyte transplantation, liver-directed gene therapy, genetically engineered enzymes, and therapeutic modalities targeting fibrogenesis.

1675,Medical treatment of chronic liver disease in children (Part I): Focus on treatable or potentially treatable diseases,"Management of children with chronic liver disease (CLD) requires a multidisciplinary approach. CLDs can be classified as 'potentially' curable, curable, incurable and end-stage diseases. Goals for the management of CLDs can be divided into preventing or minimizing progressive liver damage in treatable CLD by treating the primary cause; prevention or control of complications in treatable CLD; and prediction of outcome in end-stage CLD to provide definitive treatment with surgical procedures, including liver transplantation. Curative, specific treatments for primary causes of CLDs are best evaluated by a pediatric hepatologist, if possible. Medical management of CLDs in children will be reviewed in two parts, with Part I (this article) focusing specifically on 'potentially' treatable CLDs. Dietary modification is the cornerstone of management of galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance and some glycogen storage diseases. as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nitisinone is required in addition to 2-(nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione therapy in tyrosinemia as well as in Wilson's disease with copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride. ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Zinc and antioxidants are adjuvant drugs in Wilson's disease. New advances in chronic viral hepatitis have been made with the advent of oral antivirals. In children, currently available drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection are standard interferon (IFN)-alpha-2, pegylated IFN-alpha-2 (PG-IFN), and lamivudine. Adefovir and entecavir are also licensed for adults, although telbivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, clevudine and thymosin alfa-1 are currently undergoing clinical testing. The most accepted treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection is PG-IFN plus ribavirin. Corticosteroids with or without azathioprine remain the main strategy for inducing remission in autoimmune hepatitis. Cyclosporine (cyclosporine) and other immunosuppressants can be used in patients who do not achieve remission with corticosteroidazathioprine therapy or who have significant side effects. The above treatments can prevent or at least minimize the progression of liver damage, especially if started early. leads to an almost normal quality of life in affected children.

Psychiatric symptoms are sometimes the first and only manifestation of Wilson's disease. More often, there is a psychiatric involvement in addition to a neurological or hepatic disease. We present an 18-year-old male patient with a clinical and laboratory pattern of cirrhosis and a history of subchronic hallucinatory psychosis, behavioral symptoms, and depressed mood and mood disorders. He had no familiar history of liver or psychiatric disease. Laboratory and imaging tests confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease with psychiatric involvement. After liver transplantation, copper metabolism and liver function returned to normal, and we noticed that the psychiatric disease did not recur.

The suspicion of Wilson's disease was based on the patient's history and the presence of high copper in the urine. Diagnosis was confirmed by liver biopsy followed by genetic examination. Liver transplantation was not considered because the patient was obese with a BMI of 60. In maximal conservative treatment with concomitant treatment with chelation agents, the patient was stabilized and liver function improved. The first option penicillamine had to be replaced with trientine due to the allergy reaction and bone marrow suppression. After 18 months from the start of treatment, patients are in good condition, fully compensated by Child-Pugh A classification (5 points).",,"Petraskova, H.;Novak, F.;Humlova, R.;Bruha, R.",2011,,,0,0,

1683,Metal-weakening therapies in neurodegenerative disease,"The clinical and pathological spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases is diverse, but common to many of these disorders is the accumulation of misfolded proteins, and oxidative stress is thought to be an important contributing mechanism to neuronal damage. In conclusion, transition metal ion dyshomeostasis appears to play an important pathogenic role in many of these diseases, including the most common neurodegenerative diseases. This review presents studies covering a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases that have been compared and contrasted with the participation of transition metals, including further examination of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases. For each of these diseases, a discussion of the evolving scientific rationale for the development of treatments aimed at ameliorating the detrimental effects of transition metal disorder is provided, including results from various human experiments.

1685,Transition metal homeostasis: From yeast to human disease,"Transition metal ions are essential nutrients for all life forms. Iron, copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt and nickel all have unique chemical and physical properties that make them attractive molecules for use in biological systems. Many of these same properties that allow these metals to provide essential biochemical activities and structural motifs to numerous proteins, including enzymes and other cellular components, also lead to the potential for cytotoxicity. Organisms had to develop a set of systems for efficient uptake, intracellular transport, protein loading and storage of metal ions to ensure that cells' needs can be met while minimizing the associated toxic effects. Disruptions in cellular systems for processing transition metals are observed in a range of diseases ranging from hemochromatosis and anemias to neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven useful as a model organism for the study of these processes, and many genes and biological systems that function in yeast metal homeostasis are conserved throughout eukaryotes to humans. This review focuses on the biological roles of iron, copper, zinc, manganese, nickel and cobalt, the homeostatic mechanisms functioning in S. cerevisiae, and human diseases involving these metals. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bleackley, M.

1688,Zinc monotherapy is not as effective as chelating agents in the treatment of Wilson's disease.,"Introduction and Aims: Wilson's disease is a genetic disease that affects copper storage, leading to liver failure and neurological deterioration. Patients are treated with copper chelators and zinc salts, but it is unclear which approach is optimal as there are few studies of large cohorts. We evaluated the long-term outcomes of different treatments. Methods: Patients in tertiary care centers were analyzed retrospectively for adherence, survival, treatment failure, and adverse events from different treatment regimens (chelators, zinc, or a combination) (n = 288; median follow-up, 17.1 years) . . An increase in the activity of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase) >2 times the upper limit of normal or >100% from baseline with an increase in urinary copper excretion was defined as liver therapy failure. Results: The median age of onset of Wilson's disease was 17.5 years. Hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were seen in 196 (68.1%) and 99 (34.4%) patients, respectively. Hepatic treatment failure occurred more frequently with zinc therapy (14/88 treatments) than with chelator therapy (4/313 treatments; P < .001). Actuarial survival without transplantation showed an advantage for chelating agents (P < .001 vs zinc). Changes in treatment were mostly due to adverse events, but the frequency did not differ between groups. Patients who did not respond to zinc therapy showed hepatic recovery after re-administration of a chelating agent. Conclusions: Treatments with chelating agents or zinc salt are effective in most patients with Wilson's disease; chelating agents are better at preventing hepatic deterioration. Identifying patients who do not respond to zinc therapy and whose liver enzyme activities are increased is important, indicating that a chelating agent should be added to the therapeutic regimen.

1689,Metals Rearrangement: Use of Chelating Compounds as Potential Treatments for Metal-Associated Neurodegenerative Disease,"Metal ions, particularly copper, zinc and iron, are involved in a variety of amyloidogenic neurodegenerative disorders. In the brain, as elsewhere in the body, metal ion excess or deficiency can potentially inhibit protein function, interfere with correct protein folding, or, in the case of iron or copper, promote oxidative stress. The involvement of metal ions in neurodegenerative disorders has made them a new target for therapeutic interventions. One approach has been to chelate and chelate the ions, thereby limiting their potential to interfere with protein folding or render them incapable of redox processes. Newer approaches suggest redistribution of metal ions has therapeutic benefits, and recent studies suggest that attenuating cellular copper deficiency may be a reasonable way to limit neurodegeneration. In this review, we will discuss the role of metals in amyloidogenic, neurodegenerative disorders and highlight some of the mechanisms and compounds used in various therapeutic approaches.

1690,Atypical presentation of Wilson's disease,"15-year-old Caucasian woman on a human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) diet presented with fever, cholestasis, coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia, and acute renal dysfunction. Biliary system and liver imaging were normal. He responded to intravenous antibiotics, vitamin K, and blood transfusions, but relapsed with discontinuation of antibiotics. He was in remission with antibiotic therapy again. Liver biopsy revealed marked bile ductular reaction, bridging fibrosis and hepatocytic anisocytosis suggestive of Wilson's disease, and anionucleosis with degenerative enlarged eosinophilic hepatocytes. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was further established based on the presence of low serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary and hepatic copper, and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Multisystem involvement of the liver, kidney, blood, and brain is consistent with Wilson's disease; however, the clinical manifestation of cholangitis and reversible coagulopathy is rare and may result from concurrent acute cholangitis and/or the HCG diet regimen of the patient.

1691,Critical review of Belgian reimbursement files of orphan drugs,"Background: Orphan medicinal products are designed to diagnose or treat serious, life-threatening or chronically debilitating rare diseases that affect 50 or fewer people per 100,000 in the EU. In Belgium, the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC) evaluates reimbursement claims for orphan drugs based on multiple criteria: therapeutic value, price and proposed reimbursement schedule; the importance of the drug in clinical practice; and the budgetary effect of the drug. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the reimbursement files of orphan drugs in Belgium and compare them with clinical evidence submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: A qualitative analysis examined all reimbursement files for orphan drugs submitted in Belgium between January 2002 and June 2008. The following information was extracted from each file: description of the orphan drug; indicator; refund status; therapeutic value and needs; budget effect; and the number of registered indications. For selected orphan drugs, an in-depth analysis was extracted and compared with information and results from clinical trials, their primary endpoints and EMA documents (i.e. marketing authorization application dossier, European public evaluation report and summary of product characteristics) and Belgian reimbursement files. Results: Most orphan drugs were reimbursed. In addition to formal criteria, other arguable factors appear to play a role in the reimbursement decision, such as price adjustments, employment incentives, patient population restrictions, and company funding of diagnostic testing. Despite the small number of patients, randomized controlled studies have been conducted for many orphan drugs. Budget impact analyzes were simple and did not take into account the impact on more than one indicator. Some differences were also observed between the clinical evidence submitted to the EMA and the clinical evidence submitted to the Belgian DRC. Conclusions: In addition to official criteria, other negotiable factors such as price adjustments and employment incentives may play a role in Belgium's reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs. Some discrepancies were also noted between clinical evidence reported in EMA documents and evidence in Belgian orphan drugs reimbursement files. There appears to be a need for further standardization of Belgian reimbursement practices and European cooperation in sharing clinical evidence for orphan drugs. Â© 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

1692,Wilson's disease: pathogenesis and clinical considerations in diagnosis and treatment,"Dr. Nearly a century after Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson wrote his doctoral dissertation on the pathological findings of lenticular degeneration of the brain associated with liver cirrhosis, we now know that mutation is the molecular basis underlying this autosomal recessive inherited disorder named after him. ATPase, ATP7B, is an intracellular copper transporter primarily expressed in hepatocytes. Loss of ATP7B function is the basis for decreased hepatic biliary copper excretion and decreased incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. During the intervening years, the clinical manifestations, histological, biochemical features and mutation analysis of ATP7B that characterize and diagnose this disorder have been recognized. These include the presence of liver or neurological signs of disease and detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings, low ceruloplasmin, elevated urinary and hepatic copper, and associated histological changes in the liver. Medical treatments and liver transplantation can effectively treat patients with this once uniformly fatal disorder. Early detection of the disease led to initiation of treatment to prevent disease progression and reverse pathological findings, if any, and family screening was warranted to detect the disorder in first-degree relatives. Gene therapy and hepatocyte cell transplantation for Wilson's disease have only been tested in animal models, but represent areas of future study. Despite all the advances, we still have to consider the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in order to test patients for this disorder and accurately establish the diagnosis before starting lifelong treatment.

Copper metabolism abnormalities have been associated with neurological disorders that affect movement, such as Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease; however, diagnosis of non-Wilson, non-Menkes-type copper metabolism disorders has been more difficult, especially in cases with atypical features. Here, we present a case of an adolescent with acute severe hemilingual dyskinesia and prominent tics, upper extremity balismus, but with normal brain and spinal MRI results and no signs of dysarthria, a recent presentation of a copper metabolism disorder. or dysphagia. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were low, but urine copper level increased after penicillamine loading. As many of them are treatable, we conclude that copper metabolism disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis for movement disorders, even in cases with rather unusual presentations. In addition, a link between copper metabolism disorders and tics was presented for the first time in humans to our knowledge; More research is needed to better establish this link and understand its underlying pathophysiology.

1698,Rheumatic manifestations associated with Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disease defined as an autosomal recessive disease characterized by free copper release and dramatic accumulation of intracellular hepatic copper followed by hepatic and central nervous system abnormalities. Mutations of the ATP7B gene are responsible for metabolic disease. A limited number of small studies allow for spinal radiological abnormalities including extensive bone demineralization, osteochondritis, and sometimes fractures. In a prospective study, with normal mean Z-score values, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 10% and the prevalence of past fracture was 50%. Joint disorders include knee pain, rare effusions, early onset of radiological features of osteoarthritis, and arthralgias of large joints such as associated osteochondritis. In some patients, arthralgia, positive antinuclear and antihistone antibodies and drug-induced lupus may develop secondary to D-penicillamine, the main copper chelator used in WD. In this rare disease, small retrospective studies do not allow to identify definitive joint and bone manifestations associated with WD. Such clinical and radiological abnormalities are sometimes the first signs leading to a diagnosis. However, unexplained joint pain and effusion of large joints in adolescents may suggest WD and lead to a copper survey. Bone disease and fracture management are common to those practiced in the general population. Â© 2011 Societe francaise de rhumatologie.",,"Quemeneur, A. S.;Trocello, J. M.;de Vernejoul, M.

1704,Alzheimer's disease and metals: Therapeutic opportunities,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Currently, there are no disease-modifying drugs, current treatments offer only short-term symptomatic relief. Two of the pathognomonic indicators of AD are the presence of extracellular protein aggregates composed mainly of the Abeta peptide and oxidative stress. Both of these phenomena can potentially be explained by the interactions of Abeta with metal ions. In addition, metal ions play a crucial role in synaptic function and their homeostasis is tightly regulated. A disruption in this metal homeostasis and generation of toxic Abeta oligomers would likely be responsible for AD-related synaptic dysfunction. Thus, approaches designed to prevent Abeta metal interactions, inhibit the formation of toxic Abeta species, and restore metal homeostasis may have potential as disease-modifying strategies to treat AD. This review summarizes the physiological and pathological interactions that metal ions play in synaptic function, with particular emphasis on interactions with Abeta. Various therapeutic strategies designed to address these pathological processes are also described. The most advanced of these strategies is the ""metal protein attenuating compound"" approach, in which the precursor molecule PBT2 has successfully completed early phase clinical trials. The success of these various strategies demonstrates that manipulating metal ion interactions offers many opportunities to develop disease-modifying treatments for AD. Â© 2011 Authors.

1708,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper affinity caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) known as Wilson's ATPase, which functions to move copper within hepatocytes. passes through intracellular membranes. The copper transport action directly supports the production of ferroxidase ceruloplasmin, in which copper is incorporated, as well as the excretion of copper into the bile. As a result, in Wilson's disease serum copper concentrations are low and hepatic retention of copper develops, leading to liver damage. Wilson's disease may present as hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease; clinical phenotypes are highly variable. Other organ systems may also be involved. Although the usual age range for clinical presentation is 5-45 years, younger children and older adults may also present with this disease. Clinical investigations include liver function tests, cerebral imaging, serum ceruloplasmin and copper, basal 24-hour urine copper measurement, and hepatic parenchymal copper concentration. Genetic diagnosis is complex but precise and is best used for family studies. Treatment is usually very effective and consists of lifelong administration of pharmacological doses of a chelator (D-penicillamine or trientine) or zinc. Liver transplantation is almost always required in patients presenting with fulminant liver failure (coagulopathy, encephalopathy, massive intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, elevated aminotransferases, subnormal alkaline phosphatase) or whose liver disease does not respond to medical therapy. Liver cancer is extremely rare in patients with Wilson's disease, but screening may be appropriate for older patients. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Roberts, E.

1710,Access to orphan drugs despite poor quality of clinical evidence,"OBJECTIVE We analyzed Belgium's reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs compared to innovative drugs for more common but equally severe diseases, with special emphasis on the quality of clinical evidence. METHODS Using the National Health Insurance Agency administrative database, we evaluated all orphan drug files submitted between 2002 and 2007. Quality analysis of clinical evidence in orphan reimbursement files was performed. French 'Haute Autorite de Sante' evaluation reports, including the five-point scale parameter 'Service Medical Rendu (SMR), were examined to compare disease severity. Chi-square tests (P < 0.05 significance level) were used to compare the outcome of reimbursement decisions between orphan and non-orphan innovative drugs. RESULTS Twenty-five orphan drug files and 117 non-orphan drug files were evaluated. Twenty-two (88%) of orphan drug shipments were reimbursed versus 74 (P= 0.02) of 117 (63%) non-orphan innovative drugs. Of the 25 orphan drug files, only 52% contained a randomized controlled trial, compared to 84% (P < 0.01) in a random control sample of 25 non-orphan innovative referrals. The duration of drug exposure was, in most cases, very short relative to the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS The orphan drug definition predicts repayment despite low-quality clinical evidence. The evidence gap in market authorization should be reduced by post-marketing programs where central regulatory and local reimbursement authorities cooperate effectively among European Union member states.

1712,Wilson's disease diagnosed late with hepatic and neurological manifestations,"50-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital because of liver dysfunction and progressive neurological symptoms. She was previously diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) effectively normalized serum aminotransferase levels, but presented with loss of balance, dysarthria, and difficulty in handwriting. Autoantibodies and hepatitis virus markers were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were recorded as 9mg/dL and 32mug/dL, respectively. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 331.8 ug/day. The Kayser-Fleischer ring was shown. Histological examination of the liver revealed inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis, and the hepatic copper concentration was 444.4 µg/g dry weight. We were diagnosed with Wilson's disease and started treatment with trientine. Immunohistochemistry for keratin 8 and p62 showed Mallory-Denk bodies. Most p62-expressing cells were positive for 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). There were few Ki-67 positive hepatocytes in the liver. Wilson's disease is one of the causes of NASH and UDCA may be a supportive therapeutic agent for Wilson's disease. Cell proliferation is suppressed under copper-loaded conditions, and this phenomenon may be associated with the clinical course of Wilson's disease.

We present a series of 19 patients with WD. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive case series of patients with WD followed in two hospitals in North East France. Results: Eight men and 11 women were studied. Median follow-up was 16 years, median age at diagnosis was 18 (range: 5-71 years). The median age at first symptom was 16.

1714,"Pathology, clinical features and treatments of congenital copper metabolic disorders - Focus on neurological aspects","Genetic disorders of copper metabolism, including Menkes kinky hair disease (MD), occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and Wilson's disease (WD), are reviewed with a focus on neurological aspects. MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of MD such as neurological disorders, connective tissue disorders and hair abnormalities can be explained by the abnormally low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard of care for the treatment of MD is parenteral administration of copper-histidine. Neurological degeneration can be prevented in newborn babies when treatment is started, but delayed treatment is much less effective. Also, copper-histidine treatment does not improve connective tissue disorders. New therapies targeting neurological and connective tissue disorders should be developed. OHS is the mildest form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. Although there have been no formal trials for OHS, OHS patients are typically treated similarly to MD. WD is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. Although the liver and nervous systems are typically most severely affected, initial symptoms are variable, making early diagnosis difficult. Medical education efforts for early diagnosis should target primary care physicians, as early treatments are often critical, especially in patients with neurological disorders. Chelation agents and zinc are effective for the treatment of WD, but neurologic symptoms temporarily worsen soon after treatment with chelating agents. Neurological worsening in patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate has been reported to be lower than neurologic worsening rates when treated with other chelating agents.

Corpus callosum (CC) lesions have not been studied in a large patient population with WD. Objective: To evaluate the frequency of CC lesions in patients with neurological symptoms related to WD. Methods: The authors included all patients with neurological expression of WD who were followed up at the French national WD center with brain MRI between March 2006 and December 2008. The localization of brain lesions was analyzed and the frequency of lesions in the CC was evaluated. All patients were evaluated using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale. A clinical disconnexion syndrome was investigated for patients with abnormalities in the CC. Results: Of the 81 patients (45 males, mean age: 34.8 years, 12 to 74 years) with neurological expression, 42% had white matter lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. 23.4% of the patients presented CC lesions limited to the posterior splenium.

1720,Clinical evaluation of Wilson's disease in patients with concomitant liver disease,"Objectives: To investigate variations in the clinical epidemiology of Wilson's disease in patients with concomitant liver disease and the impact of comorbidity on current diagnostic algorithms. Background: Wilson's disease is a rare disease and few studies are available on its diagnosis and natural history. Currently available tools have limited efficacy in complex patients and the presence of co-existing diseases may further limit their use. A more in-depth analysis of Wilson's disease among complex patients with co-morbidities will aid in the development of algorithms for early detection and treatment. STUDY: A retrospective cohort study using data from a large tertiary care center to perform the clinical assessment of Wilson's disease in patients with concomitant liver disease. Results: Forty-two Wilson's disease patients were identified; 9 had concomitant liver disease. Patients with co-existing liver disease had a significantly greater mean age at diagnosis (49.1 years vs. 26.8 years, P<0.0001) compared with those without underlying disease. Patients with concomitant liver disease had more evidence of cirrhosis at presentation (9/9, 15/33 vs. 100%, 45.5%) and showed higher mortality (4/8, 50% vs. 4/29 , 13.8%, P=0.0222). Without mutation analysis data, 44% of patients with concomitant liver disease were definitively diagnosed with Wilson's disease using the Leipzig criteria.

This is to describe a case of Wilson's disease presenting with recurrent bleeding and bulbar myasthenia-like symptoms. A 12-year-old Hindu girl first presented with signs of recurrent bleeding, such as nosebleeds, hematemesis, and melena, and continued 2 years later with dysphagia and fatigue. Bleeding was initially attributed to thrombocytopenia and dysphagia was not diagnosed because myasthenia gravis tests were negative. Four years later, the patient developed nasal intonation of voice with fatigue followed by a decline in scholastic performance. The patient was evaluated in our institution and mild extrapyramidal findings in the form of asymmetric appendicular dystonia and bradykinesia were recorded. As a result of clinical evaluation, laboratory and radiological examinations, Wilson's disease was diagnosed. The bleeding was most likely due to platelet dysfunction. No other cause of bulbar myasthenia-like symptoms was apparent. This case demonstrates that platelet dysfunction should also be considered in all Wilson patients with bleeding.

1723,Therapeutic potential of copper chelation with triethylenetetramine in the management of diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease,"This article reviews the latest evidence, most of which has been generated by my group's research program, that first identified a previously unknown copper overload state central to the pathogenesis of diabetic organ damage. This condition causes tissue damage in blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves through copper-mediated oxidative stress. This author now considers this case of copper overload to provide an important new target for therapeutic intervention whose goal is to prevent or reverse diabetic complications. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a recent novel anti-diabetic molecules through the original study reviewed here, thus providing a new use for this molecule, which was previously approved in 1985 by the US FDA as a second-line therapy for Wilson's disease. TETA acts as a highly selective divalent copper (CuII) chelator that prevents or reverses diabetic copper overload, thereby suppressing oxidative stress. TETA treatment of diabetic animals and patients has identified and quantified the interconnected defects in copper metabolism that characterize this systemic copper overload state. Copper overload in diabetes mellitus differs from that in Wilson's disease due to differences in the respective causal molecular mechanisms and consequent differences in tissue localization and behavior of excess copper. High pathogenetic tissue binding of copper occurs in diabetes. This may be mediated by enhanced glycation end-product (AGE) modification of sensitive amino acid residues in long-lived fibrous proteins, eg, connective tissue collagens at sites such as blood vessel walls. These AGE modifications can act as localized, stable endogenous chelators that increase the chelable copper content of organs such as the heart and kidneys by binding excess catalytically active CuII in specific vascular beds, thus focusing on patients susceptible to the respective copper-mediated oxidative stress. In this review, summarized evidence from clinical studies in healthy volunteers and diabetic patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and non-clinical models of diabetic cardiac, arterial, renal, and neural diseases are used to establish definitions of the mechanisms by which TETA therapy is delivered. prevents injury and regenerates damaged organs. Our recent phase II proof-of-principle studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and non-clinical diabetes models have helped to identify pathogenetic defects in copper regulation and have demonstrated that they are reversible by TETA. The drug tightly binds and removes excess systemic CuII from the urine while neutralizing its catalytic activity, but does not cause systemic copper deficiency even after prolonged use. Its physicochemical properties, crucial to its safety and efficacy, clearly distinguish it from all clinically available transition metal chelators, including D-penicillamine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, and clioquinol. The studies reviewed here show that TETA therapy is generally effective in preventing or reversing. Supports diabetic organ damage and its continued development as a new drug for diabetes. Trientine (TETA dihydrochloride) has been used as a second-line therapy for Wilson's disease since the mid-1980s, and our recent clinical studies have strengthened the impression that it is safe for long-term use in patients with diabetes. metabolic disorders. There is substantial evidence to support the view that diabetes shares many pathogenetic mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Indeed, the close epidemiological and molecular links between them point to Alzheimer's disease vascular dementia as another therapeutic target where experimental pharmacotherapy with TETA may find further clinical application.

Even redox inert zinc, if present in excess, can indirectly trigger ROS production by altering mitochondrial function. Although metal chelators appear to improve the clinical outcomes of various neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanisms of action remain unclear and the effects of long-term use are largely unknown. Most chelators are not specific to a single metal and may alter the distribution of multiple metals in the brain, with long-term unintended consequences.

The aim of the study is to confirm sleep comorbidity with questionnaire and objective sleep examinations (polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test). Methods: 55 patients with WD (22 hepatic, 28 neurological, five asymptomatic forms) and 55 age- and sex-matched control subjects completed a questionnaire regarding sleep habits, sleep comorbidities, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and rapid eye movement (REM) ) answered screening questions for conduct disorder (RBD-SQ). Polysomnographic examination was performed on 24 patients with WD and control subjects. Results: Unlike controls, patients with WD were more prone to daytime naps accompanied by fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy-like attacks, and poor night sleep. The mean ESS and RBD-SQ were higher than that of the controls. Total sleep time was lower, accompanied by decreased sleep efficiency and increased alertness. Patients with WD had lower latency in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage 1 and stage 2, and a lesser amount of NREM sleep stage 2. A short or borderline multiple sleep latency test was found in one-third of patients with WD. (MSLT) values are independent of nocturnal pathology (sleep apnea, periodic leg movements and/or restless legs syndrome). Conclusions: Patients with WD often suffer from sleep disturbances (regardless of clinical form). The spectrum of sleep/wake symptoms raises suspicion that altered REM sleep function may also be involved. Â© 2010 Author(s).

1730,Mowat Wilson syndrome; First case identified by array comparative genomic hybridization (ACGH) in Qatar,"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a recently described syndrome of mental retardation, usually associated with multiple health defects and characterized by typical facial gestalt. About 200 cases have been reported worldwide, mainly in Europe and North America. The syndrome arises as a result of heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, formerly called ZFHX1B (SIP1) located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at 2q22. The spectrum of mutations includes point mutation (81%), medium and large mutations (17%), or large-scale rearrangements (2%). We report the first MWS case in Qatar. A 2-year-old female patient has MWS features. Sequence comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis was performed with the 44k ISCA engineered oligonucleotide platform. The patient was found to have a de novo deletion of ~500 kb at 2q22. Routine chromosome analysis was normal. ACGH is a relatively new technology that is revolutionizing the field of clinical genetic diagnostics. aCGH can detect unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities, including microdeletion, microduplication, aneuploidy, unbalanced translocations, and subtelomeric and pericentromeric copy number changes throughout the genome. Contrary to conventional cytogenetics, aCGH can detect deletions and repeats smaller than 5 megabases and screen multiple aberrations simultaneously, unlike monochrome FISH. This case highlights the value of array CGH to detect or characterize chromosomal rearrangements in mentally retarded patients with/without dysmorphic features and multiple congenital anomalies.",,"Zafar, N.;Khitam, A.

1731,Treatment of patients with neurological Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease related to copper metabolism. The main strategy of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering both copper chelating agents and zinc. D-Penicillamine is considered the drug of first choice for Wilson's disease patients in Japan. The chelating effect of this drug is excellent. However, between 30 and 50% of patients with neurological symptoms may experience worsening of their symptoms in the early stages of treatment. Trientine is the second drug of choice in Japan. This agent has shown good results in response to the neurological symptoms of this disease. Zinc blocks intestinal copper absorption by inducing metallothionein synthesis in mucosal cells. Zinc is used as primary therapy in pre-symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease. The author recommends a treatment strategy for Wilson patients with neurological symptoms as follows: mild cases should be treated with trientine monotherapy, while moderate and severe cases require combination therapy with trientine and zinc.",,"Shimizu, N.",2011,October,,0,0,
1732,zinc deficiency,"The necessity and deficiency of zinc for humans was understood in 1963. Over the past 50 years, it has become clear that zinc deficiency is common in humans. Nutritional deficiency of zinc can affect approximately 2 billion people in the developing world. Consumption of cereal proteins with high phytate content reduces the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditional zinc deficiency is also very common. Growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, impaired immunity, neuro-sensory impairment and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. More than 300 enzymes require zinc for their activation, and about 2000 transcription factors require zinc for the control of gene expression. Zinc is also required for cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

1734,Role of Sip1 in cranial neural crest development,"Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1/Zeb2/Zfhx1b) is a highly conserved member of the two-handed zinc finger homeodomain transcriptional repressor family that has been shown to regulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) during tumor progression. In addition, Sip1 is involved in neural and anteroposterior patterning during embryonic development. Truncation of Sip1 proteins also plays a role in neural crest-related disorders; Mowat-Wilson syndrome and Hirschprung's disease. We set out to investigate the spatio-temporal expression pattern and function of Sip1 in the neural crest during chicken embryonic development. To evaluate the role of Sip1 during cranial neural crest development, loss-of-function experiments were performed using translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides injected after the onset of neural development. With this approach, we can determine whether Sip1 functions similarly in cancer cells and neural crest EMT and whether it has any additional functions during embryonic development. Our results show that the loss of Sip1 has no effect on cranial crest specification, but inhibits or delays the protrusion of the crest from the dorsal neural tube. Future studies will determine the mechanism by which Sip1 regulates the initiation of migration in these cells.",,"Rogers, C.;Bronner-Fraser, M.",2011,2022-08-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.05.416,0,0,
1735,Lingual dyskinesia and tics: A new presentation of copper metabolism disorder.,"Background: Abnormalities in copper metabolism have been linked to neurological disorders affecting movement; however, their diagnosis is difficult, especially in cases with atypical features. Methods: Case report. Results: A previously healthy 16-year-old male presented with acute onset of abnormal hemilingual waveform movements with tongue twisted to the left. When the patient was asked to stick out his tongue, the movements were suppressed; they did not interfere with swallowing or speaking and did not persist during sleep. In the examination, sudden ballistic and tic-like movements that could be suppressed voluntarily in all limbs were recorded. Otherwise normal neurological evaluation. Comprehensive metabolic, hematological and serological investigations were normal. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were low; 24-hour urine collection showed normal copper excretion, but penicillamine loading showed increased copper in the urine. These increased values were higher than the norm, but still significantly lower than the diagnostic value of Wilson's disease. Brain MRI was normal. Wilson and Huntington's disease screening was negative. The patient was started on zinc gluconate supplementation. After 8 weeks, the movements disappeared, although copper and ceruloplasmin levels did not return to normal.

1736,A young woman presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure and severe hemolysis.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 1. To recognize the main clinical features of WilsonaTM disease, including physical examination findings 2. To manage acute fulminant liver failure caused by WilsonaTM disease CASE DETAIL: A 22-year-old woman presents with a yellowish discoloration of her eyes and skin for 3 days. He also noted that his urine was dark and his stool had been light green for 3 weeks, accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. He had never consumed alcohol and had not taken any prescription or over-the-counter medication. He had no previous sexual contact and no significant family medical history. Remarkably, he was told he had ""abnormal liver function"" according to routine blood work done 8 months ago. He had no fever with normal hemodynamics. Jaundice with dense icteric sclera and mild right upper quadrant tenderness without significant hepatomegaly were remarkable on examination. He was neurologically intact and stool was guaiac negative. Their initial labs included creatinine 1.5, hematocrit 20%, platelet 135, bilirubin 59, direct bilirubin 34, AST 195, ALT 27, alkaline phosphatase 14, LDH 1588, albumin 3.1, and INR 3.3. Acetaminophen level was 30.5 (upper normal 30). Slit lamp ophthalmologic examination revealed golden-brown deposits at the level of Descemeta's membrane. The serum copper level rose at 220. Emergency plasma exchange was initiated using fresh frozen plasma replacement to ameliorate severe intravascular hemolysis and consequent acute renal failure (ARF), while status 1A was listed for liver transplant with a possible diagnosis of Wilsona TM disease. . On day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for worsening ARF (creatinine 2.4), which increased the MELD score from 39 to 48. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation on the 4th day and was then discharged home on the 18th day of hospitalization. Liver histology under rhodanine staining revealed cirrhosis with occasional nodules in which all hepatocytes and scattered macrophages contained granular intracytoplasmic copper. APPLICATIONS/Discussion: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease with mutations in the ATP7B gene, which impairs the transport of copper from hepatocytes to the bile and causes copper accumulation in tissues such as liver, brain, kidneys and cornea. The disease was first clinically described by K. Wilson in 1912 as progressive hepato-lenticular degeneration, reflecting that the primary manifestations of the disease are related to copper deposits in the liver and lenticular nuclei of the brain. Hepatic presentation is highly variable from asymptomatic to acute fulminant hepatic failure. About half of the patients present with asymptomatic or chronic liver disease. These patients typically have low ceruloplasmin levels and often (50%) have pathognomonic Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit lamp examination; they are typically treated as outpatients with chronic chelation and/or zinc therapy. However, fulminant hepatic presentations, which are more common in women than men (4:1), occur in up to 25% of cases. Key clinical features include rapidly progressive renal tubular disease, Coombs-negative acute intravascular hemolysis, and laboratory inconsistency, only slightly elevated serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, but extremely high bilirubin levels. Acute hepatocellular necrosis leads to toxic oxidative effects on red cell metabolic pathways and consequent hemolysis as well as renal failure and release of copper ions into the circulation. In cases of fulminant liver failure, acute plasma exchange is the bridge of choice to liver transplantation, as it can rapidly remove relatively large amounts of copper and alleviate hemolysis and further kidney damage. Otherwise, due to the high mortality and curative potential of the transplant, patients with fulminant liver failure due to Wilson's disease are appropriately granted the highest priority category for liver transplantation.",,"Zahiruddin, A.;Leung, S.;LeFrancois, D.",2011,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-011-1814-6,0,0,
1737,Development of oncolytic virus therapy with an angiogenesis inhibitor ATN-224,"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are genetically modified viruses specifically designed to destroy cancerous cells only. In the tumor microenvironment, angiogenic and inflammatory responses following OV vaccination have significantly limited the efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) in clinical trials. Physiological copper levels promote angiogenesis and can inhibit replication of wild-type HSV. Here, we tested whether OV efficacy could be enhanced by ATN-224, a second-generation analogue of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a copper chelating agent currently under investigation and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Wilson's disease. as an antiangiogenic and antineoplastic agent in clinical trials. Under serum copper concentration, both OV replication and glioma cell killing were significantly inhibited (P < 0.001). ATN-224 treatment rescued this copper-mediated inhibition of OV replication and cytotoxicity in vitro (P < 0.01). Antitumor efficacy was evaluated in vivo using two xenograft glioma models. First, mice implanted with subcutaneous U251T3 gliomas were treated with PBS, ATN-224, OV or OV + ATN224 (n = 10). The mean tumor size in the OV + ATN224 group was significantly smaller than in the OV-treated group alone (21.51 vs. 153.93 mm < P = 0.0383). Subsequently, mice implanted with intracranial U87deltaEGFR gliomas were treated as previously described (n = 8). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a greater mean survival time in the OV + ATN224 group than in the OV-treated group (43,875 days vs 24,000 days). To test a biological explanation for this enhanced efficacy, we evaluated U251T3 tumors from OV-treated mice receiving ATN-224 or PBS co-treatment. The analysis revealed that ATN-224-treated tumors significantly increased viral presence in vivo compared to PBS-treated tumors. This result was observed when OV was administered both intratumorally (P < 0.05) and intravenously. Thus, the reduced tumor growth and increased survival previously demonstrated in vivo may be associated with enhanced viral replication. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that co-treatment of ATN-224 with OV can significantly improve the poor efficacy profile of conventional clinical oncolytic virotherapy.",,"Pradarelli, J.;Yoo, J.

1738,Case Report: Catatonia as the initial symptom of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. The clinical manifestations are caused by the accumulation of copper in different parts of the body. Psychiatric symptoms (mood and psychotic) may be present in 25% of patients with Wilson's disease. Case Description: A 19-year-old male patient presented with complaints of refusal to eat, sleep disturbance, maintaining his posture, excitement, echopraxia, perseverance, decreased self-esteem, little talking, doubting that people are against him, and arguing about himself for 2 months. There was no past or family history of any mental illness. In her mental state examination, the patient had occasional delusions of excitement, negativity, posture, echoprexia, perseveration, reference and persecution, and decreased psychomotor activity. General physical examination and systemic examination were normal. She was diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia and treated with trifluperazine and 4 ECTs. In the subsequent follow-up, the dose of trifluperazine was increased, and she presented with severe EPS and catatonic symptoms within 4 days. The Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale score was 30 at admission. Antipsychotics were discontinued, slow recovery was observed in EPS, but catatonic symptoms persisted, quetiapine with low propensity to EPS was started, and ECTs were continued. We thought and investigated in terms of Wilson's disease since he was a young boy and was born from second degree consanguineous marriage and was susceptible to EPS. Investigations: Routine investigations were normal and MRI scan of the brain did not show copper deposition in the basal ganglia. 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 2165 mg/l, serum ceruloplasmin 45 u/l and serum copper 160 mug/dl. Slit lamp examination and hand x-rays of the eye were within normal limits. After starting him on 50mg of zinc and ECT daily, he showed significant improvement in symptoms and was discharged. Conclusion: Catatonia is rarely associated with Wilson's disease. It is important to make this diagnosis early, as effective treatment is available.",,"Shetageri, V. N.;Bhogale, G. S.;Patil, N.

1739,Triethylenetetramine metabolism and its effect on cancer chemotherapy,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper II chelator and a polyamine analog traditionally used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, is currently in Phase I clinical trials for cancer in combination with carboplatin. However, the metabolism of TETA has never been fully investigated, which is crucial for its further development in cancer therapy1. The two main TETA metabolites found in humans are N<sup>1</sup>-acetyl-TETA (MAT) and N<sup>1</sup>,N<sup>10</sup>-diacetyl-TETA. (DAT)<sup>2</sup>. Traditionally, acetylation of the drug is thought to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The FDA requires that the pharmacological properties of any drug metabolized by acetylation should be investigated in a population with a different NAT2 phenotype. However, our recent clinical study showed no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic and metabolite profiles of healthy volunteers with a fast or slow NAT2 acetylation phenotype<sup>3</sup>. Therefore, we hypothesize that the enzyme responsible for TETA acetylation is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT). To pinpoint the enzyme responsible for TETA metabolism, we performed in vitro drug metabolism experiments. TETA (as substrate) and acetyl-coenzyme A were incubated with human liver microsome and cytosol from 7 subjects in the presence or absence of pentamidine or acetaminophen, separately. MAT occurrence from TETA was detected and quantified using our previously published <sup>2</sup> LC-MS method. Both the liver microsome and the cytosol can catalyze the biotransformation of TETA. There is a large interindividual difference in metabolic rate in the microsome and cytosol (K<inf>m</inf> range 181 to 12,457 muM, V<inf>max</inf> range 110 to 3,068 pg/min/mg protein). Pentamidine, a specific inhibitor for SSAT, can inhibit the reaction and increase Km by over 30%. Acetaminophen, a specific inhibitor for NAT2, did not show any inhibitory effect. The same experiments were performed on rat liver microsome and cytosol and similar results were obtained except for K<inf>m</inf> and V<inf>max</inf> values. Two other polyamine analogues, diethylnorspermin and diethylspermin, all of which are being investigated for cancer treatment, were also tried, with similar results. The identification of SSAT, which has never been considered as a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, as the enzyme that catalyzes the activation of polyamine analogues has an important importance in cancer combination chemotherapy. The presence of SSAT (rather than NAT2) as the metabolic enzyme of TETA suggests that TETA may be an ideal candidate for cancer combination chemotherapy, as cancer drugs are rarely metabolized in this way; therefore, competition for the drug metabolizing enzyme is less likely to occur. However, individuals appear to have different SSAT phenotypes and this should be taken into account when using TETA as a chemotherapeutic agent.",,"Lu, J.;Li, M.;Tingle, M.;Xu, H.;Cooper, G. J.

1740,Abdominal pain and gastritis as side effects of zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease,"Objectives and Operation: Zinc compounds are widely used for the treatment of Wilson's disease and are considered safe and well tolerated. However, sometimes patients report abdominal pain and nausea and require a change in medication. Except for reports of abdominal pain, these side effects have not been fully investigated. The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease and to characterize its side effects. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 37 patients (20 females, 17 males, mean age 12 years (6'18 years)) with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson's disease (according to Ferenci score and mutation analysis). They were treated with zinc sulfate for 83.3 (8'344) weeks [median (range)]. Complaints of all patients were considered as possible drug side effects. Results: Adverse events were observed in 12 children (9 females, 3 males, mean 10.7 years) and all were of gastrointestinal origin: abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. They occurred after 67.1 (8'344) weeks on zinc sulfate treatment. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 4 patients with persistent and severe abdominal pain, and mucosal ulcerous gastritis and H. pylori test were negative in all subjects examined. Symptoms improved in 2 children with proton pump inhibitors, in 2 other cases additional conversion to penicillamine was required. Two patients with abdominal pain did not consent to EGD. Clinical improvement was observed in the remaining patients after administration of zinc acetate (2 patients), D-penicillamine (4 patients), or the alternative zinc sulfate dosing scheme (2 patients). Conclusion: It is observed that side effects such as abdominal pain, nausea and even gastritis are relatively common in patients treated with zinc sulfate. They can occur at different stages of therapy. EGD should be performed to detect and treat upper gastrointestinal tract inflammation in selected patients. Discontinuation of zinc sulfate is usually unavoidable and for these patients switching to penicillamine or zinc acetate may be a safer option.",,"Janowska, A.;Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2011,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e318224e326,0,0,
1741,Long-term zinc therapy in children with Wilson's disease with mild liver disease,"Objectives and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder. Most cases in the pediatric age have a hepatic manifestation: The percentage of children with WD presenting with isolated elevated aminotransferases ranges from 14% to 88%. Penicillamine is the first-line therapy in children with liver disease, while zinc is indicated for presymptomatic patients and as maintenance therapy. For patients presenting with isolated elevated serum aminotransferases, optimal medical management has not yet been determined. This reflects a lack of agreement on the classification of WD patients with isolated hypertransaminasemia as presymptomatic cases requiring zinc or cases with hepatic onset requiring chelating agents. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of special zinc monotherapy in children with isolated hypertransaminasemia. Methods: All WD patients referred to our Department of Pediatrics for diagnostic investigation of elevated serum aminotransferases were analyzed. The diagnosis of WD was made in the presence of at least two of the following features: low ceruloplasmin level (<20 mg/dL), increased basal urinary copper level (>100 mcg/24 hours), increased urinary copper level after birth. penicillamine challenge test (PCT; >1575 mcg/24 hours), increased liver copper level (>250mg/g dry weight). Of the 43 WD patients enrolled, 29 were treated with zinc for a mean period of 12 years (range 3'25). Zinc was the initial treatment of choice in 12 cases. The main parameter of treatment efficacy in this study was normalization of serum ALT. Adherence to treatment was evaluated on the basis of clinical history and serum and urine copper and zinc levels. Results: Of the 17 (58%) children treated with penicillamine as first choice, 4 (24%) normalized ALT within a median of 14 months (range, 4 to 48) and started maintenance therapy with zinc. The remaining 13 (76%) patients with persistent hyper-ALT while on penicillamine switched to zinc; nine (70%) of these normalized ALT over zinc over a median period of 9.5 months (range, 5 to 151). Of 12 patients (92%) given zinc alone as first-line, 11 (92%) normalized ALT over a median period of 14 months (range, 2 to 46). The patient with persistent hyper-ALT on zinc showed poor treatment compliance. At the end of the follow-up, the efficacy of decopperization was comparable in the 2 groups, based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion (56+/-4 vs. 37+/-2 mg). Conclusion: Although penicillamine therapy is generally used in the initial treatment of WD, this study showed that zinc monotherapy can be used as first-line therapy in children with WD with isolated hypertransaminasemia at presentation.",,"Ranucci, G.;Di Dato, F.;Della Corte, C.;Vajro, P.;Iorio, R.",2011,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e318224e326,0,1,
1742,Wilson's disease: Treatment on integrated traditional Chinese herbs and western medicine,"Objective: To analyze the outcomes of patients with Wilson's disease treated with simple western medicines combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine and orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT). Background: Wilson's disease (WD) or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder caused by ATP7B gene mutation. Because WD is an inherited nervous system disease, early diagnosis and early and life-long treatment provide a better prognosis. The best currently recommended treatment for Wilson's disease is to integrate traditional Chinese and Western medicines. See Wang XP, etc. Neurology in the People's Republic of China - An Update. Eur Neurol 2010;64:320-324. Methods: More than 10,000 WD patients have been treated by neurologists at four WD centers (Hefei, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Changsha) in China, and approximately 100 WD patients have been surgically treated with OLT. Conclusions: The decision of whether to choose transplantation is complex and more than purely a medical judgment, and even contradictions arise in the various WD centers, particularly in the differences between physicians and surgeons. Usually within four years, neurologically affected patients can recover during medical therapy, showing that more than 80% of WD patients treated for years or even decades live essentially normal lives with integrated medical therapy. Results: Treatment combining traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicines: penicillamine and sodium dimercaptosuccinate has more significant effects on copper excretion and relatively more side effects. These properties make Western medicine more applicable to moderate to severe patients. Although the effect of Gandou Decoction is not as good as penicillamine or sodium Dimercaptosuccinate, these elements make traditional Chinese medicine especially suitable for mild to moderate patients or to be taken with Western medicine. Additionally, the TCM herbs found in Gandou Decoction are mostly rich in zinc. In this case, Gandou Decoction can be taken at the same time as the Zinc preparation, as they can mutually reinforce the effects on copper removal. Therefore, before drug selection, we should learn about the copper removal amount of each drug, and then select the drugs with the best effect and the least side effects.",,"Wang, X.

1743,Wilson's disease: A Canadian perspective on presentation and clinical outcomes in an adult outpatient setting.,"Objective: To review the clinical experience of Wilson's disease followed in a liver (LC) and movement disorders clinic (MDC) at a single center in Toronto, Canada. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is rare in Western countries. Therefore, long-term follow-up and experience are rare. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with WD attending an LC and MDC. Results: 48 patients were included according to the Leipzig criteria. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 26.8y in the LC and from 0 to 19.8y in the MDC. Fourteen patients presented as asymptomatic, 13 with hepatic symptoms, 15 with neurological symptoms, and 6 with bilateral hepatic/neurological symptoms. The median age at presentation was > 40 years in 12.5%. Initial ceruloplasmin was low in 94% of cases, while 24-hour urinary copper was high in 95%. Neurological patients presented with a median of 4 symptoms (tremors, dysarthria, and gait abnormalities were the most common), with three patients developing neurological symptoms after diagnosis. 26% had additional psychiatric symptoms. All patients presenting neurologically had CF rings. Abnormalities were reported in all patients with neurological symptoms when MRI was performed, but were normal in patients with pure liver symptoms or asymptomatic. Abnormalities included lesions of the basal ganglia (62%) and brainstem (50%), atrophy (50%), and white matter changes (51%). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc (65%) the most common at the time of review. One patient had a successful liver transplant. Side effects were most pronounced with DP (41%). Neurological deterioration occurred in 11 subjects due to DP or maladjustment, but 9 showed improvement. With the neurological presentation, 14/21, he improved at the time of examination. Overall one death occurred. Conclusions: WD remains a diverse disease with generally favorable outcomes for those who respond to initial therapy. However, evidence of compensated liver injury and structural brain injury is widespread, emphasizing the need for close monitoring and adherence to treatment with articular liver and movement disorder clinics.",,"Moores, A.;Hirschfield, G.;Lang, T.;Fox, S.

1744,Gait disturbance in a patient with Wilson's disease 18 years after disease onset,"Purpose: To describe gait abnormalities in a patient suffering from clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease for 18 years. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes excessive copper accumulation in and outside the liver. A wide range of neurological symptoms, including dystonia, parkinsonian features, cerebellar and bulbar manifestations, are very common and can severely affect a patient's quality of life. Although gait disturbance is a very prominent neurological finding in Wilson's disease, the features of gait abnormalities have not been described in detail in the literature. Methods: This 51-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 33, which resulted in significant impairment in working ability due to 2 years of severe arm and head tremor. The irritable and aggressive behavior was present at the onset of the disease and worsened in the first years after diagnosis. He reported a significant worsening of symptoms after changing treatment from D-penicillamine to zinc sulfate in the late 1990s. Although D-penicillamine was restarted, this time as the gait disturbance persisted and the patient was attached to a gait frame to adequately overcome the gait disturbance. Recent urinalysis showed that copper was effectively eliminated under D-penicillamine. Results: On neurological examination, the patient showed a complex gait disorder that included features of severe (gait-specific) dystonia as well as apraxia of gait and freezing of gait (FOG), respectively. He used a simple cue to cure his gait disorder as he walked sideways along the wall. Otherwise, no significant impairment of leg motility and no significant dystonia were observed in the sitting or lying position. In this patient, some frontal findings were positive, but no pyramidal findings. Conclusions: This is an illustrative case showing a particular pattern of gait abnormality with a combination of FOG and dystonia. While dystonia is well known in patients with Wilson's disease, FOG is unusual and may reflect involvement of different neuroanatomical structures beyond basal ganglia pathology.",,"Brugger, F.;Felbecker, A.;Haegele-Link, S.;Tettenborn, B.;Kaegi, G.",2011,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23764,0,0,
1745,Pallidal surgery for dystonia in Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease is a disease characterized by increased copper content in the liver and brain. Surgical intervention is limited in Wilson's disease because most symptoms potentially return with medical treatment. However, some symptoms, such as tremors, are resistant to drug therapy and may require surgical intervention. Case report: A 20-year-old female patient with Wilson's disease since the age of four presented with jaundice. He was treated with penicillamine, trientine, and zinc at various times over the next nine years. At the age of thirteen, he worsened to develop tremors with writing difficulties. Trihexyphenidyl, tetrabenazine and injectable botulinum toxin were started and the dose of penicillamine was increased. At the age of 15, she was admitted as an emergency with unresponsiveness, hypotension, papilloedema, and suspected hepatic encephalopathy. Lymphocytic pleocytosis and high proteins were found in CSF, viral serology was negative in serum CSF, and mycoplasma IgM was positive in serum. Intravenous Acyclovir was treated with Azithromycin and pulsed with Methyl prednisolone, Dopa was added. The patient became unable to eat or swallow. He was bedridden and could not walk. [Video 1]. treated with high-dose penicillamine 3 g per day for two years. He recovered partially and had marked residual dystonia, akinesia, and rigidity. He could not speak clearly and was wheelchair bound. His bradykinesia partially responds to dopa replacement with worsening of his oral dyskinesia. [Video 2] With the placement of IPG under general anesthesia, DBS - Globus pallidal internus electrode placement was performed. In serial follow-ups, postoperative tone and mobility improved, with minimal assistance in mobility. He takes 1500mg penicillamine tablets daily with zinc[Video 3]. Conclusion: This young girl with Wilson's disease had persistent dystonia, parkinsonism, and mutism, which caused significant disability despite adequate medical treatment, and later recovered with an untested deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Wilson's disease-related dystonia. Only a few case reports of surgery in Wilson's disease have been recorded in the literature. The most common surgery for resistant tremors was thalamotomy.",,"Sankhla, C.

1746,Outcome and management of 207 pregnancies in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes liver failure and neurological deterioration. Lifelong medical treatment is required to maintain copper homeostasis. Optimal treatment regimens in pregnant women are discussed in terms of abortion rate, teratogenicity, and therapeutic efficacy. Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the outcome of pregnancies in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients and methods: A total of 207 pregnancies in 100 WD patients in European tertiary care centers were analyzed retrospectively. Medical regimens (D-penicillamine, Trientine, zinc salts, or a chelator and zinc combination) were classified and files were reviewed for maternal hepatic or neurological deterioration during pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes and abortion rates were analyzed in terms of maternal treatment and disease presentation. Results: Worsening of liver function tests was evident in 10 cases and occurred to a similar extent across all treatments. Liver function improved after birth in all cases. Neurological deterioration in pregnancy was rare and was observed in only 2 cases (one under zinc and one under D-penicillamine therapy), but it resulted in permanent worsening of neurological symptoms. The overall miscarriage rate in the study group was 48/207 (23.2%). Of these, 46 were recorded in the first three months; Two stillbirths were associated with placental insufficiency. The rate of miscarriage (8/20; 40%; p=0.04) was higher under trientine treatment than under D-penicillamine (14/96; 14.7%) or zinc (2/19; 10.5%). We observed congenital defects in 2/159 newborns: One child presented with partial esophageal atresia (under maternal D-penicillamine therapy), another child was diagnosed with Glu-6-P-DH deficiency (under zinc therapy). Conclusion: In most cases, control of liver function was achieved during pregnancy, regardless of the medical regimen chosen. Neurological deterioration was rare, but resulted in severe disability in two cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of WD patients during pregnancy is recommended. Contrary to previous reports, we observed a higher rate of miscarriage under Trientine treatment. Potential teratogenicity remains a concern, particularly under D-penicillamine therapy.",,"Weiss, K.

1747,An unexpected novel antioxidant-like activity for the classical copper chelating drug penicillamine.,"Penicillamine (beta, beta'-dimethylcysteine) is widely used clinically as a copper chelating drug for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that while penicillamine provided significant protection against cytotoxicity induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), an important toxic metabolite of the wood preservative pentachlorophenol, which is widely used in human fibroblasts, other classical copper chelating agents such as batouproin disulfonate did not. The autooxidation process of TCHQ yielding the reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ<sup>-</sup>) radical was investigated by ESR and UV-visible spectral methods. Unexpectedly, we found that the autooxidation process of TCHQ and the time course of TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical formation were significantly retarded by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. in contrast, no retarding effect on TCHQ autooxidation was observed by the classical copper chelating agent bathcuproin disulfonate. HPLC-MS and ESR studies showed that the TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical was reduced to TCHQ by penicillamine, which was simultaneously oxidized to the corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that penicillamine's protective effects on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity are due not to copper binding but to reduction of the reactive TCSQ<sup>-</sup> radical to the much less reactive TCHQ. This is the first report showing an unexpected novel antioxidant-like activity for this copper-chelating amino thiol drug and may be highly relevant to the biological activities of penicillamine.",,"Zhu, B.

1748,Triple liver transplant for recurrent autoimmune hepatitis that initially appears to be fulminant Wilson's disease,"In 2006, a 15-year-old female patient presented with symptoms of decompensated acute liver failure that required listing for liver transplantation (LTx). Other laboratory tests suggested Wilson's disease as serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were significantly reduced upon penicillamine intake and copper excretion was strongly increased. Genetic analysis confirmed compound heterozygosity for Wilson's disease with two heterozygous mutations in exons 14 and 20 of the ATP7B gene, respectively. In addition, post-LTx histology, which apparently confirmed the Wilson diagnosis, was consistent with the decompensated course of Wilson's disease resulting in cirrhosis of the liver. Over the next 28 months, she developed multiple episodes of acute rejection that responded to high-dose steroids but recurred despite high-dose CNI and mTOR-based immunosuppressive regimens, ultimately resulting in chronic allograft failure requiring re-listing for LTx. The clinical course after re-LTx was characterized by recurrent episodes of rejection resistant to conventional treatment regimens, again leading to cirrhotic allograft failure, and the need for re-LTx with a live donation from the mother 21 months after the second LTx. Prior to the third LTx, it was preconditioned with plasmapheresis and Rituximab to prevent recurrence of allograft failure, potentially from an antibody-mediated injury. However, despite this and maximal immunosuppression, including Alemtuzumab, photopheresis, and re-LTx followed by plasmapheresis, our patient developed recurrent rejection episodes and early-onset signs of allograft failure and cirrhosis. During the overall clinical course, histologies of representative liver biopsies showed repeated cell rejection infiltrates with signs of interface hepatitis, cholangitis, lympho-plasmacytic infiltrates, and progressive fibrosis. Careful reassessment of his case revealed that Wilson's diagnosis was not entirely correct, but instead that the culprit was recurrent LKM-positive autoimmune hepatitis, initially masked by Wilson's disease. Later, our patient was started on steroids and azathioprine, and the results have not been determined yet.",,"Kroemer, A.;Doenecke, A.;Schnitzbauer, A.;Kirchner, G.;Farkas, S.;Loss, M.;Geissler, E.

1749,Ten Chinese pediatric patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD, MIM #277900) is an autosomal recessive disease that causes systemic copper deposition and multi-organ damage. Hepatic manifestations predominate in pediatric patients. Untreated WD causes progressive liver and neurological deterioration. Early treatment is the most effective way to prevent these serious consequences. Objectives and Methods: We present our experience of managing 10 pediatric WD patients. Data on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, ultrasound findings, liver biopsies, genetic studies, treatment and outcomes were examined. Results: Our patients were between the ages of 2-18 at the time of diagnosis. 1 patient presented with hepatic failure. Seven of them had abnormal liver functions detected incidentally. Two of them were diagnosed by sibling screening. The most consistent abnormal liver function was an alanine transaminase elevation ranging from 60 to 419 IU/l (<58). All ceruloplasmin levels were <0.1 g/l (0.21-0.59). The mean urinary copper excretion was 4 mumol/day (<1.0). 1 patient was initially treated with penicillamine and another trientine. Zinc treatment was started in 7 patients. All followed well. Conclusion: Our patients represented a group of asymptomatic WD patients who were diagnosed and treated very early. Positive results can be expected with good treatment compliance. One way to diagnose these presymptomatic patients is to monitor for abnormal liver function.",,"Hui, J.;Chiang, G. P. K.;Yuen, Y.

1750,Hypersomnia in Wilson's disease,"Background and significance: Wilson's disease (WD) shows wide heterogeneity in symptoms. In this case report, we present hypersomnia as an unusual symptom in an unusual case of WD. Case: A 48-year-old female patient presented with cognitive impairment for 2 years. His complaints of fatigue, decreased concentration, and depression started 3 years ago. There was no family history of psychiatric or other neurological disease. No abnormality was detected in the neurological examination. Moderate elevations in liver function tests were found, but viral hepatitis markers were negative. The diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin level, increased urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum copper level. The Kayser-Fleischer ring could not be detected. Brain MRI revealed increased T1 signal lesions in both globus pallidus. Electroencephalography showed diffuse slow waves of the bilateral hemisphere without epileptiform discharge. Liver biopsy showed the presence of nuclear glycogen, a cytoplasmic brownish pigment, and minimal periportal fibrosis in hepatocytes. His complaints gradually improved 8-10 months after the start of D-penicillamine treatment. Within a year of her resolution, she became more sleepy and hyper-drowsy. He spent more than 2/3 of the day sleeping. After administering methylphenidate 20mg, he became almost awake and gradually improved his negativism. Results or comments: Hypersomnia was the main symptom in this patient. Although the neurological presentation of WD without Kayser-Fleischer rings has already been reported, the absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and the unusual clinical symptom suggest this pat is a highly exceptional WD patient.",,"Kim, S.",2011,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000327701,0,0,
1751,Wilson's disease presenting with episodic hypersomnia,"Case: A 48-year-old female patient was admitted for 2 years of variable cognitive impairment. His complaints of fatigue, decreased concentration, and depression started 3 years ago. He developed behavioral changes, emotional lability, restlessness, and agitation. There was no specific family history. No abnormality was detected in the physical and neurological examination. A moderate elevation of liver function tests was found, but all viral hepatitis markers and VDRL were negative. Neither toxic nor infectious disease was detected. The initial diagnosis of WD was based on decreased ceruloplasmin level, increased urinary copper excretion, and decreased serum copper. Kayser-Fleischer (CF) ring was not detected. Brain MRI revealed increased T1 signaling in both globus pallidus. EEG showed diffuse slow waves without epileptiform discharge. Liver biopsy was performed 3 years after onset of symptoms and showed the presence of cytoplasmic brownish-pigmented nuclear glycogen in hepatocytes and minimal periportal fibrosis, but no signs of hepatitis or other liver disease. EM changes included mitochondrial swelling and crista fusion. No evidence of hepatic encephalopathy was found. His blood ammonia level was normal. His complaints gradually improved 8-10 months after the start of D-penicillamine treatment. Within a year of her dissolution, she became more sleepy and sleepier episodically.

1752,IPS technology and its implications for gene and cell therapy,"The generation of exogenous factor-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells opens a new era of possibilities for regenerative medicine. Potentially, once safety concerns are overcome, different strains derived from patient-specific iPSCs can be used for transplantation purposes, changing the way we perceive medicine today. However, patients with genetic diseases will need to correct the mutation, otherwise functional impairment will remain. The same can be said for other acquired diseases in which viruses can access cells through a particular receptor, for example AIDS. To overcome these problems, there is increasing interest in applying zinc finger technology to either correct mutations or knock out genes. But this technology has its limitations and is long. In this context, gene therapy of iPSCs or their differentiated progeny using clinically validated vectors could be a valuable possibility. Here, we describe the generation of iPSCs from a Chinese patient with Wilson's disease whose product carries the R778L Chinese hotspot mutation in the ATP7B gene, a liver enzyme responsible for the export of copper to bile and blood. These iPSCs were pluripotent and could easily be differentiated into functional hepatocytes, showing abnormal cytoplasmic localization of mutated ATP7B and defective copper transport. Importantly, gene correction using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector expressing codon-optimized-ATP7B can reverse the functional defect. In the future, hepatocytes from genetically corrected iPSCs may also be an option for autologous transplantation in Wilson's disease in the future. In particular, we also provide proof of principle that our experimental model based on iPSCs can be used to screen for compounds aimed at correcting the abnormality.",,"Pei, D.",2011,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mt.2011.85,0,0,
1753,Zinc therapy in neurological Wilson's disease in pregnancy: case report and review of the literature,"Objective: To report our experience in the administration of zinc therapy during pregnancy in a patient affected by neurological Wilson's disease in parallel with the literature review on this subject. Methods: We treated a patient affected with neurological Wilson's disease by reducing zinc doses during pregnancy, as the exact dose was not adhered to in this condition. Throughout pregnancy, the patient underwent bimonthly clinical and laboratory evaluations, including a comprehensive assessment of copper balance. Results: Urinary copper excretion and serum zinc levels were below the recommended effective therapeutic ranges in all assays. However, serum free copper levels were always within the therapeutic range and both liver and neurological functions were fairly stable throughout pregnancy, confirming good adherence to the reduced therapeutic program and supporting its efficacy. The development of the fetus, which was monitored periodically by ultrasound studies, resulted in normal results and eventually the patient gave birth to a full-term, healthy baby. Conclusions: Consistent with the literature, we confirmed that zinc therapy is safe and effective in pregnancy. In addition, our data provide further evidence that serum ""free copper"" levels will be more sensitive than urinary copper excretion to monitor adherence to zinc therapy and to evaluate the efficacy of such therapy.",,"Bianchi, M.

1754,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare, congenital, autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism secondary to ATP7B gene mutations. This gene encodes an ATPase protein responsible for billiard copper excretion. This causes copper to build up in the liver and later in other organs such as the brain. Since the first reports in the 1990s, more than 400 mutations have been identified in various populations worldwide. Neurological symptoms appearing in the second or third decades are the first presentation in about half of patients and can be highly variable. Most cases have a neurological clinical picture with a wide variety of combinations of dysarthria, tremor, gait disturbances, dystonia, and parkinsonism. The diagnosis of WD can be suspected in all patients with chronic progressive movement disorder of unknown etiology, mainly if it started in the second or third decade of life. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of individuals with WD is important since early treatment stops disease progression and can reverse established liver and brain damage to some extent. The first step in the diagnosis of WD is a reasonable clinical suspicion. No single test is conclusive, and there is no universally accepted biochemical ""gold standard"" here. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and the combination of the results of various tests. The main diagnostic procedures in WD are: slit lamp examination, serum ceruloplasmin level, urinary copper excretion (UCE), penicillamine loading UCE, hepatic copper concentration, MR Imaging, and genetic testing to detect ATP7B gene mutations. In this presentation, diagnostic criteria in Wilson's disease will be discussed. The goal of pharmacological treatment of Wilson0s disease is to restore copper balance. The main drugs used are chelating agents such as d-penicillamine and trientine or zinc salts to limit the gastrointestinal absorption of copper. Orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant hepatic impairment and in patients with chronic, severe hepatic impairment unresponsive to pharmacological therapy.",,"Barbosa, E.

1755,Efficacy and safety of D-penicillamine and trientine for the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic copper storage disorder that causes liver failure and neurological deterioration. Current guidelines support the use of chelating agents (dpenicillamine, trientine) in the first-line treatment of symptomatic patients, but optimal regimens still need to be established. Clinical data on larger cohorts comparing these chelators are limited. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of d-penicillamine and trientine in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients and Methods: A total of 350 WD patients in European tertiary care centers and patients contributed by the EUROWILSON database research group were analyzed retrospectively. Chelator-based medical regimens were analyzed for efficacy, adverse events, and reasons for discontinuation using the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Treatments shorter than 6 months were censored. Results: There were hepatic symptoms in 221 (63.1%) patients and neuropsychiatric symptoms in 119 (34%) patients, respectively. Patients were initially treated with d-penicillamine (n = 309) or trientine (n = 41). Drug changes were common in both groups, and a total of 514 analyzes resulted in treatment (d-penicillamine n = 350, trientine n = 164). Transplant-free actuarial survival (median follow-up: 16.5 years) was similar (death: d-penicillamine n = 7/350, trientine n = 3/164; progression to liver transplantation: d-penicillamine 12/350, trientine 2/164). In the d-penicillamine group, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were more frequent (p = 0.045) and occurred even after decades of treatment. For the latest available time point of a 48-month follow-up, hepatic deterioration occurred at only 8/514 treatments (d-penicillamine n = 3, trientine n = 5, p = ns). However, neurological deterioration was less frequent in the d-penicillamine group (7/350 treatments) compared to trientine (12/164, p = 0.005), while improvement was similarly noted in symptomatic neurological patients (d-penicillamine 84/139 ; trientine 42/79, p = ns). Interestingly, hepatic recovery from symptomatic patients was observed more frequently for trientinin (64/86, p < 0.05) for d-penicillamine (211/235). Conclusion: Treatment with chelating agents was effective in most patients and resulted in a comparable and favorable actuarial survival without transplantation. The main limitation of D-penicillamine therapy was the higher rate of adverse events. Neurological deterioration was rare under chelation therapy and was more frequent in patients treated with trientine, contrary to our expectations.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Schots, M.;Gotthardt, D.

1756,Wilson's disease with autoimmune hepatitis. a case report,"Wilson's disease [WD} - an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in individuals with mutant ATP7B genes occurs in all ethnic and geographic populations and has a prevalence of 30 per million worldwide. WD may present clinically as liver disease, progressive neurological disorder, or psychiatric disease. The spectrum of liver disease encountered in patients with WD can be highly variable, from asymptomatic with only biochemical abnormalities to acute liver failure. As de novo genetic diagnosis is currently expensive and not universally available, a combination of clinical signs and biochemical testing is usually required to establish the diagnosis if WD is present. We describe a 19-year-old female patient who presented with classic WD and various features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The patient was initially diagnosed with AIH and was treated with standard corticosteroid therapy [prednisolone 60 mg daily], which initially resulted in clinical improvement but then worsened. The diagnosis of WD was made 4 months after the initial diagnosis of AIH. The subsequent diagnosis of WD and the addition of penicillamine [1 g daily] resulted in excellent improvement and normalization of liver function tests. In this case we assume that simultaneous WD and AIH cannot be excluded. Therefore, comprehensive screening for WD is necessary in patients with AIH, especially when the response to steroid therapy is poor. Conversely, in patients suffering from WD with the overlapping properties of AIH, a combination of steroids and penicillamine may be beneficial.",,"Vashakidze, E.;Gegeshidze, T.;Buachidze, T.",2011,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-010-9241-z,0,0,

1763,Neurological Wilson's disease,"Despite a long history, Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, remains a commonly misdiagnosed imported disease. Mutations in ATP7B cause abnormal copper metabolism and subsequent toxic copper accumulation. Clinical manifestations of neurological Wilson's disease include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, and choreoathetosis. Among neurodegenerative diseases, it is unusual for misdiagnosis and delay in treatment to be clinically significant because treatments, if given appropriately, can prevent and cure Wilson's disease. If left untreated, Wilson's disease progresses to liver failure or severe neurological disability and death, while those who are properly treated have a normal life expectancy.

1766,Review article: Current management of acute liver failure,"Aliment Pharmacol Ther 31, 345-358 Abstract Background Acute liver failure is a devastating clinical syndrome with a consistently high mortality rate despite advances in critical care. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a life-saving treatment in selected cases, but effective use of this limited resource requires an accurate prognosis due to surgical risks and the need for subsequent lifelong immunosuppression. Purpose To review the etiology of acute liver failure, discuss the evidence behind critical care management strategies, and examine possible treatment alternatives to OLT. Methods Literature review using Ovid, PubMed and recent conference abstracts. Conclusions Paracetamol remains the most common etiology of acute liver failure in developed countries, while acute viral etiologies predominate elsewhere. Cerebral edema is a major cause of death and its prevention and prompt recognition are vital components of critical care support seeking to provide multi-organ support and 'buy time' to allow for organ regeneration or psychological and physical evaluation before acquiring a donor. organ. While artificial liver support systems do not improve mortality in acute liver failure, most other interventions have limited evidence base to support their use. Conclusion Acute hepatic failure remains a truly difficult condition to manage and requires early recognition and transfer of patients to specialist centers that provide intensive, multidisciplinary input and, in some cases, OLT. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Craig, D.

We conducted a retrospective review of the medical notes of 16 (17%) of 96 children diagnosed with WD between 1981 and 2006. Children were 6.6 to 15 years old. Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parent choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine during penicillamine loading (one)], 13 of 16 were converted from penicillamine to trientine due to penicillamine reactions: four had hematuria, four had bone marrow suppression three, neutropenia three. Trientine was discontinued in three of them due to allergic rash, low copper excretion, and one due to compatibility problems requiring transplantation. Seventy-five percent of the children presented with chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were noticed in eight of 16, Wilson Ferenci's score range was between 4 and 10 (nl < 4). Laboratory indices remained relatively stable. Consistent with previous reports, trientine was mainly used as secondary therapy when serious adverse events occurred with penicillamine. While the available evidence is of low quality, trientine appears to be as effective as penicillamine and small population studies show a lower side-effect profile.",,"Taylor, R.

1768,Copper complexing agents as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"The notion that a copper dysfunction plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on a range of observations from animal models as well as in vitro and clinical studies. However, there is still considerable debate as to whether copper excess or deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that excess copper contributes to Alzheimer's disease, but experimental evidence in transgenic mouse models suggests otherwise, and at least one clinical study shows that cognitive decline is positively correlated with low copper levels. We recently reported on the deregulation of the ceruloplasmin-copper association, which is typical for AD patients, from the elevation of the pool of non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper, i.e., 'free' copper. This phenomenon may provide an explanation for the contrasting results obtained in clinical trials. Several clinical trials have been undertaken to investigate an anti-metal effect that counteracts the progression of AD. Some have produced encouraging results showing that ""metal protein attenuating compounds"" can indeed positively alter disease progression.

1769,Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as markers of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disease (Review),"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality due to the hemodynamic and metabolic complications of liver cirrhosis. During CLD, the extracellular matrix goes through a remodeling process that leads to the formation and deposition of new collagen. Tissue remodeling is regulated by fine molecular mechanisms including proteases, inhibitors and growth factors. The main role in matrix degradation is played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a class of zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes, and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). The concept of monitoring has gained importance for the clinical management of CLD, as advances in diagnostic techniques have led to more precise and less invasive methods. In the current state of our knowledge, liver biopsy still represents an important procedure for staging liver disease. However, despite its importance, liver biopsy has some limitations: The risk of underestimating a disease is most significant, as hepatic lesions are often located irregularly within the liver. In line with the limitations of liver biopsy, the clinical needs for early detection of progressive fibrosis require the development of additional noninvasive techniques. In this review, we discuss the key issues related to this important clinical necessity. We also focus on the role of MMPs and TIMPs in the pathogenesis of CLD and their possible use as noninvasive serum markers for inflammation and fibrosis in this pathology.",,"Consolo, M.;Amoroso, A.;Spandidos, D.

Treatments such as copper chelation therapy or dietary supplementation with zinc can improve the effects of the disease, but if left untreated it results in hepatitis, neurological complications and death. Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising new treatment for Wilson's disease that has been demonstrated in both an animal model and clinical trials. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that TTM acts as a novel copper chelator that forms a complex with copper accumulated in the liver. We used X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence imaging to monitor the molecular form and distribution of the complex in the liver and kidneys of an animal model of human Wilson's disease.

The redox activity of copper is potentially harmful. With some inherited disorders of copper metabolism, serious imbalances in copper homeostasis can occur. Copper is obtained from the diet by intestinal absorption and then distributed throughout the body. The regulation of intestinal copper absorption to maintain whole-body copper homeostasis is currently poorly understood. This review evaluates recent findings regarding the molecular mechanism of intestinal copper uptake.

1774,Wilson's disease. [Check],"Wilson's disease is an inherited disease that causes copper accumulation in tissues, especially in the liver and brain. The genetic defect is in the gene encoding ATPase type P (ATP7B). Inheritance is autosomal recessive. More than 500 mutations that cause Wilson's disease have been identified so far. The most common mutation in Central Europe is the H1069Q mutation. The manifestation of Wilson's disease is usually hepatic or neurological. The hepatic form is manifested by acute or chronic hepatitis, steatosis or cirrhosis. Neurological involvement usually manifests itself with tremor, rigidity, dysarthria, dysphagia and muscle contracture after the age of 20 and motor disturbances (tremor, speech disorder, writing problems) that can progress to severe extrapyramidal syndrome. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory investigations (neurological symptoms, liver disease, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, high serum free copper concentration, high urinary copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Confirmation of the diagnosis is by hepatic copper concentration on liver biopsy or genetic examination. Untreated, the disease leads to the death of the patient. Treatment is based on chelating agents (D-penicillamine, trientine) that reduce the copper content by urinary excretion, or agents that inhibit the absorption of copper from food (zinc, ammonium-tetrahiomolybdenum). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease should also be treated. Penicillamine or zinc is used in the Czech Republic. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. It is clear that families of affected patients (all siblings) should be screened.",,"Bruha, R.;Marecek, Z.;Martasek, P.;Nevsimalova, S.;Petrtyl, J.;Urbanek, P.;Kalistova, H.;Pospisilova, L.",2009,,,0,0,

[Chinese],"Purpose To investigate the clinical character and therapeutic effect of late-onset Wilson's disease and to provide some evidence for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods The clinical character, changes in copper metabolism and therapeutic effect of 8 patients with late-onset Wilson's disease were analyzed. Ceruloplasmin level was measured by nephelometry, and copper contents in serum, urine and liver were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Initial treatment was sodium dimercaptosulfonate, followed by D-penicillamine and/or zinc. Results Patients with late-onset Wilson's disease comprised 7.0% of all easily misdiagnosed patients with early-stage liver disease symptoms such as loss of appetite or nausea. Most patients with late-onset Wilson's disease had normal blood routines and aminotransferase levels, and all patients had Kayser-Fleisher rings. There was a significant difference between liver function and copper metabolite test. The mean urinary copper content on the first day after sodium dimercaptosulfonate administration was 4 072 cups/24 hours; this was 18.1 times pretreatment and 2.5 times that of D-penicillamine. No significant adverse reactions were observed. The prognosis was generally good. Conclusion Sufficient attention should be paid to late-onset Wilson's disease, which is not rare and easy to misdiagnose.

1778,liver disease during pregnancy,"Liver diseases during pregnancy can be classified as liver disorders that occur only in the setting of pregnancy and liver diseases that occur coincidentally with pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia/eclampsia, hemolysis syndrome, liver tests and low platelet count (HELLP), acute fatty liver of pregnancy and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are pregnancy-specific disorders that can cause elevated liver tests and liver dysfunction. Chronic liver diseases such as cholestatic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease and viral hepatitis can also occur during pregnancy. Management of liver disease in pregnancy requires collaboration between obstetricians and gastroenterologists/hepatologists. Treatment of pregnancy-specific liver disorders usually includes delivery of the fetus and supportive care, while management of chronic liver disease in pregnancy is directed towards optimizing the control of the liver disorder.

Chelating agents bind to toxic metal ions, forming complex structures that are easily excreted from the body and remove them from intracellular or extracellular spaces. 2,3-Dimercaprol has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning, but its serious side effects have prompted researchers to develop less toxic analogues. Hydrophilic chelators such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid effectively promote renal metal excretion, but have poor access to intracellular metals. More recently, newer strategies have been reported to address these disadvantages, such as combination therapy (use of structurally different chelating agents) or co-administration of antioxidants. In this review, we present an update of current chelating agents and the various strategies available for the treatment of heavy metals and metalloid intoxications.

1780,Cognitive profile and structural findings in Wilson's disease: A neuropsychological and MRI-based study.,"Background: Systematic studies on the neuropsychological profile of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) are scarce. Objective: To examine the profile of cognitive deficits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with WD. Patients and Methods: Twelve patients with confirmed WD (age at onset and assessment, 13.7+/-11.2 and 21.7+/-5.3 years, respectively; MF ratio, 7:5) constituted the study sample who received copper removal therapy. Neuropsychological tests measuring mental speed, motor speed, sustained attention, focused attention, verbal category fluency, verbal working memory, response inhibition, planning, concept formation, ability to switch sets, verbal and visual learning, and memory were applied. Phenotypic details and observations were documented on MRI of the brain performed within six months of the neuropsychological assessment. Results: Neuropsychological evaluation revealed cognitive deficits in multiple domains in all but one patient with normal MRI. Percentage of patients in deficit range in various areas included: motor speed: 73%; verbal working memory, sustained and focused attention: 50%; verbal learning: 42%; visual-constructive ability, verbal memory, mental speed: 33-34%; verbal fluency, ability to change sets, visual memory, verbal memory: 25-27%; and verbal recognition: 17%. MRI was normal in three patients and revealed variable abnormalities in the remainder: cerebral atrophy in 3 patients; brain stem atrophy in 2; signal changes in basal ganglia in 9; and brain stem signal changes 5. None of them had subcortical white matter changes. Two patients with normal MRI showed cognitive deficits. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the complex cognitive and brain changes observed in MRI in WD.

1783,Clinical application of liver MR imaging in Wilson's disease,"Objective: To determine whether there is a relationship between liver MRI findings and clinical signs and severity of liver dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease. Materials and Methods: Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated liver MR images of 50 patients with Wilson's disease. The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was waived. MR images were evaluated focusing on hepatic contour abnormalities and the presence of intrahepatic nodules. Using Fisher's exact test, MR findings were compared with clinical presentations (neurological and non-neurological) and liver dysfunction categorized by the Child-Pugh classification system (A, B, and C). Follow-up MR images of 17 patients were available. Results: Liver contour abnormalities and intrahepatic nodules were observed in 31 patients (62%) and 25 patients (50%), respectively. Each MR finding showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the three groups of Child-Pugh classifications (A, n = 36; B, n = 5; C, n = 9), excluding Splenomegaly (p = 0.243). . . The mean age of the patients with positive MR finding was higher than the patients with negative MR finding. Intrahepatic nodules, surface nodularity, and gallbladder fossa enlargement were more common in patients with Child-Pugh class A (n = 36) neurological presentation. On follow-up MR images, the intrahepatic nodules resolved (n = 8, 47%), were stable (n = 5, 29%), or aggravated (n = 4, 24%).

1787,Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. [German],"Hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are autosomal recessive inherited metabolic diseases that can lead to liver cirrhosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload resulting from increased duodenal iron absorption, whereas copper overload in Wilson's disease results from impaired biliary excretion of copper. Particularly in hemochromatosis, but also in Wilson's disease, the last decade has seen tremendous growth in our understanding of the pathophysiology of both diseases. Hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms may occur in hemochromatosis. Extrahepatic symptoms include cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, arthritis and endocrine dysfunction. Hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms are typical in Wilson's disease. While genetic testing for a homozygous HFE C282Y mutation (or a compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutation) is very helpful in hemochromatosis, genetic analysis of the Wilson gene ATP7B is limited by the presence of a large number of individual mutations. Hemochromatosis is effectively treated with phlebotomy, while Wilson's disease is treated medically with chelators (D-penicillamine and triethylenetetramine) or zinc salts. Liver transplantation is a therapeutic option for both diseases and shows excellent long-term results in Wilson's disease, but less favorable in hemochromatosis. Adequately treated disease has a very good prognosis for both diseases, especially when the diagnosis is made early in the disease course. Â© 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.",,"Merle, U.;Weiss, K.

Early studies suggested that garlic, a component of the daily diet, may play a role in the treatment of HPS by altering nitric oxide production. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of oral garlic supplementation on arterial blood gas parameters and overall morbidity and mortality in patients with HPS. METHODS: Twenty-one and 20 HPS patients were randomly assigned to receive oral garlic supplements or placebo, respectively, and evaluated monthly for a period of nine to 18 months. RESULTS: After nine months, garlic supplementation was supplemented with a 24.66% increase in basal arterial oxygen levels (83.05 mmHg vs. 66.62 mmHg; P<0.001), with only a 7.37% increase (64.05 mmHg versus 68.75 mmHg; P =0.02) was associated. among subjects in the placebo group.

Patients and Methods Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients with an International Diagnostic Score of 4 or higher were diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The phenotypes, genotypes and post-diagnosis period of these patients were analyzed. Results Twenty-six patients had the ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson's disease. Four patients had a single mutant chromosome. Our patients had 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871 delC (40%) and 6 new mutations (13%). The first clinical finding was hepatic form in 22 patients, neurological form in 5 patients, and hemolysis in 3 patients. The hepatic form was diagnosed around age 13, followed by neurologic complication with a time delay of 9 years. Therefore, some patients, especially those with the neurological form, did not pass early diagnostic tests, including ATP7B analysis. In the post-diagnosis period, 3 patients were hospitalized due to recurrent liver disease and 2 patients committed suicide. One female patient died of acute hepatic failure due to encephalopathy after fertilization treatment, and 2 male patients recovered from long-term hepatic failure without encephalopathy after non-compliance with drug therapy. King's Scores for the liver transplant were below the threshold in both cases. Conclusion Ceruloplasmin determination and ATP7B analysis may be recommended for patients with liver injury of unknown etiology to minimize delayed diagnosis.

1792,Electroencephalography in the stable treatment phase of Wilson's disease. [German],"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. In addition to hepatic and extrapyramidal motor clinical symptoms, patients with Wilson's disease also exhibit subclinical disorders of other central nervous pathways. Reports of abnormalities detected in EEG recordings are inconsistent and infrequent. Methods: In this study, electroencephalography was performed in 49 patients (32 neurological forms, 17 non-neurological forms) with Wilson's disease who were on long-term drug therapy. Attention was paid to general slowing, focal abnormalities, and epileptiform activity. EEG results were correlated with clinical manifestations through a neurology score for Wilson's disease. Results: EEG recordings yielded normal results in almost 80% of all investigated patients presenting with a prolonged course of the disease. Mild, sustained slow activity occurred in six patients, and intermittent rhythmic delta activity was seen in two patients with the neurological form of Wilson's disease. The median alpha-rhythm frequency difference between the neurological and non-neurological form (9.27/s and 9.63/s, respectively) was insignificant. Epileptiform activity was detected only in one patient with incidental epilepsy. Results: Patients with Wilson's disease show normalized electroencephalographic traces over the course of the disease. Abnormal changes appear to result from additional disturbances or secondary complications. In this regard, electroencephalography has proven helpful in differential diagnosis, which is primarily carried out throughout the course of the disease. © 2010 Georg Thieme Verlag KG.",,"Gunther, P.;Baum, P.;Villmann, T.;Hermann, W.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1253441,0,0,

[Portuguese, English]","Objective: To describe clinical symptoms and laboratory findings in the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with Wilson's disease. Methods: This is a descriptive and retrospective study of a series of 17 children and adolescents with Wilson's disease hospitalized from 1985 to 2008 in the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais Hospital das Clinicas Pediatric Hepatology Ambulatory, Brazil. Collected by data. during revision of medical charts and clinical follow-up. Results: Patients were 2.8 to 15.1 years old, with a mean age of 8.8+/-0.9 years. The main presentation of the disease was hepatic (53%), followed by the asymptomatic form diagnosed by family screening. Kayser-Fleischer ring was seen in 41% of patients. Ceruloplasmin was altered in 15 of 17 patients and urinary copper ranged from 24 to 1000 mcg/24 hours (median: 184 mcg/24 hours). Treatment was provided with D-penicillamine in all cases. Mild side effects were observed in five children without the need to discontinue or change the medication. Clinical and laboratory responses to treatment with normalization of aminotransferase levels were demonstrated in 14 patients after a median of 10.7 months. Despite being treated, three patients died (one due to fulminant hepatitis and two due to severe hepatic failure). Conclusion: Wilson's disease is rare in the pediatric group. The main presentation in children is liver disease. A diagnosis can be made with decreased ceruloplasmin levels and increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion, but requires a high level of suspicion.

1794,Current status and new developments in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive, copper accumulation and toxicity disorder that affects approximately 30 per million people. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for the biliary excretion of copper and leads to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical features and findings, such as increased urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated copper concentrations in liver tissues and Kayser-Fleischer rings, biochemical and immunological markers, magnetic resonance imaging neuropathological study. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited.",,"Kiranmayi, G. V.

1795,Wilson's disease: Current concepts in diagnosis and treatment. [Croatian],"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disorder that results in copper deposition in the liver, brain, and cornea. The incidence in most populations is estimated to be 1:30000-80000. The Wilson disease gene, now called ATP7B, located on chromosome 13 (13q14.3) was cloned in 1993. Clinical phenotypes include hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases or a combination thereof. A combination of clinical features, various laboratory parameters, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are required to make the diagnosis. Mutation analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis and becomes a part of the diagnostic algorithm, especially in patients whose clinical and biochemical features are uncertain. Family screening of first-degree relatives should be performed. Early recognition of the disease is very important, as treatment prevents severe liver damage and/or lifelong neurological disabilities. The goal of treatment is to reduce tissue copper concentration, either by increasing its urinary excretion or by reducing its intestinal absorption. Treatment includes copper chelators such as penicillamine and trientine, as well as zinc salts. Liver transplantation is the treatment option in cases of acute liver failure or treatment-resistant and severe advanced liver disease. It is not indicated primarily in patients with a neuropsychiatric presentation.",,"Kalauz, M.;Telarovic, S.;Ljubic, H.",2010,,,0,0,

The HFE gene encodes a protein that is closely involved in intestinal iron absorption. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the HFE gene mutation, its role in iron metabolism in patients with Wilson's disease, and the interaction of treatment in copper and iron homeostasis. Methods: The records of 32 patients with Wilson's disease were analyzed for iron and copper indices, HFE gene mutations, and liver biopsy. Results: Twenty-six patients were negative for HFE gene mutations and did not show significant changes in iron metabolism. The HFE mutation was significantly associated with increased hepatic iron content (P < 0.02) and transferrin saturation index (P < 0.03). After the treatment period, iron indices were significantly reduced only in the HFE gene wild type. Conclusions: HFE gene mutations may be an addiction factor in iron overload in Wilson's disease. Our results showed that drug dose adjustment could prevent further iron overload caused by overtreatment in wild-type HFE-only patients. © 2009.",,"Sorbello, O.;Sini, M.;Civolani, A.;Demelia, L.",2010,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2009.06.012,0,0,
1798,Risks of copper and iron toxicity during aging in humans,"Copper and iron are essential but also toxic metals. These are known to be essential, but their toxicity is not well known, apart from genetic overload diseases, Wilson's disease, and hemochromatosis. However, their toxicity is so generalized in the population that they are an emerging public health concern in diseases of aging and the aging process itself. Both metals are transition elements, and the resulting redox properties have been used during evolution in the development of oxidative energy production. However, both contribute to the production of excessively harmful oxidant radicals. Evolution overstocked copper and iron stores during the reproductive years because they are essential to life. However, oxidant damage from these excess metal stores accumulates as we age, and natural selection loses its effect after age 50 because subsequent diseases do not contribute to reproductive fitness. Excess copper and iron can contribute to all diseases of aging such as Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and others. One very disturbing study found that those with the highest one-fifth of copper intake in the general population lost cognition at more than three times the normal rate if they also ate a relatively high-fat diet. Inorganic copper in drinking water and supplements is processed differently than food copper and is therefore more toxic. Trace copper in drinking water, less than one-tenth of what is allowed in human drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency, greatly ameliorated an Alzheimer's-like disease in an animal model. In the final section of this review, I will provide advice on how to reduce the risks from copper and iron toxicity. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Brewer, G.

1809,Transition metals copper and iron in neurodegenerative diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases constitute a worldwide health problem. Metals such as iron and copper are essential for life, but they are also involved in various neurodegenerative mechanisms such as protein aggregation, free radical production, and oxidative stress. The role, pathogenic mechanisms, and possible therapeutic significance of Fe and Cu are discussed in relation to four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Metal-mediated oxidation with Fenton chemistry is a common feature for all these disorders and becomes part of a self-reinforcing damage mechanism that leads to neurodegeneration. The interaction between metals and proteins in the nervous system appears to be a crucial factor for the development or absence of neurodegeneration. This review also relates to therapeutic strategies tested primarily using metal chelating drugs. Metal accumulation in the nervous system observed in these diseases may be the result of compensatory mechanisms to improve metal availability for physiological processes. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",,"Rivera-Mancia, S.;Perez-Neri, I.;Rios, C.;Tristan-Lopez, L.;Rivera-Espinosa, L.;Montes, S.",2010,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2010.04.010,0,0,

For example, in pulmonary fibrosis, scar tissue-like foci form in the lungs and inhibit patients' ability to breathe. These conditions represent an important source of morbidity and mortality. More than 150,000 people in the US have some form of fibrotic lung disease, and the 5-year mortality rate for these diseases can be as high as 80%. Despite this great unmet medical need, there is no FDA-approved treatment.

1812,Effect of copper on early development: prenatal and postnatal considerations,"Copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient whose need increases during pregnancy and lactation. These represent critical times of growth and development, and the fetus and newborn are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies of this nutrient. Genetic mutations that predispose offspring to deficient Cu stores can be life-threatening, as observed in children with Menkes disease. In the last decade, severe Cu deficiency, once thought to be a rare condition, has been reported with increasing frequency in the literature. Secondary Cu deficiencies can be induced in a variety of ways, including excessive zinc or iron intake, certain medications, and bariatric surgery. Premature and low birth weight babies may be born with low Cu stores. A number of mechanisms may contribute to the teratogenicity of Cu, including decreased activity of selected cuproenzymes, increased oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide availability, altered iron metabolism, abnormal extracellular matrix protein crosslinking, decreased angiogenesis and altered cell signaling, among others. In addition to the brain, heart and vessels, tissues such as lungs, skin and hair, and systems including the skeletal, immune and blood systems are adversely affected by suboptimal Cu during development. In addition, persistent structural, biochemical and functional adverse effects are noted in the offspring, even if Cu supplementation is initiated after birth, supporting the concept that adequate Cu nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is critical for normal development. Although Cu-containing IUDs are an effective method to increase intrauterine Cu concentrations and reduce the risk of pregnancy, high amounts of dietary Cu are not considered to pose a direct developmental risk.

Subjects and methods: A 13-year-old boy who presented with cirrhosis, arthralgia, hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy and his 11-year-old sister who was asymptomatic but had hepatomegaly with elevated transaminases were studied. Mutation analysis and mRNA analysis of the ATP7B gene were performed in both patients and their parents. Results: Studies were consistent with WD and liver disease resolved after standard therapy for WD.

But it was another metal that rose above the Jerusalem landscape during the International Zinc Biological Society's (ISZB; http://www.iszb.org/) meeting held in Mishkenot Sha'ananim, a whisper away from the Old City. walls. On December 1-5, 2009, more than 100 scientists gathered to discuss their research on the biology of this metal. Zinc is a double-edged sword. Zinc supplementation accelerates wound healing and growth and supports an effective immune response. On the other hand, zinc deficiency leads to growth retardation, impaired learning and memory functions and is linked to mood disorders. However, uncontrolled increases in zinc concentrations at the cellular level can lead to neuronal cell death and may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders. Through regulation of various intracellular signaling pathways, zinc can accelerate cell growth and possibly contribute to cancer. However, despite the physiological and clinical significance of this metal, research on the molecular basis of these effects is still in its infancy.

1820,Wilson's disease: a review. [Spanish],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which leads to abnormal metabolism of copper and accumulation of this element in various organs and tissues. Its diagnosis is based on the combination of the clinical picture with various biochemical tests, none of which are in themselves a diagnosis of the disease. Currently, there are effective treatments for EW that rely on the application of chelating agents to promote the mobilization and excretion of copper from sites of accumulation. Zinc is also used to inhibit the absorption of copper from the gut. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with fulminant hepatitis and patients with decompensated cirrhosis. This review covers the following aspects of Wilson's disease: biochemical, genetic, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic.",,"Herrera, Y. P. E.;Ruiz, L. M. M.;Gutierrez, J. C. R.",2010,March,,0,0,
1821,Resectable multiple hepatocellular carcinoma due to Wilson's disease with neurological complications: A case report. [Japanese],"54-year-old woman with Wilson's disease was on D-penicillamine therapy for 24 years. A hypervascular liver tumor was detected at S6 and a diagnosis of hemangioma was made at that time. After seventeen months, the number and size of liver tumors increased. There were more than 4 tumors and the maximum size of the tumor was above 5 cm. Liver function was assessed as Child-Pugh Grade A. These tumors were diagnosed as multiple HCC and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was performed. Six weeks later, CT showed viable lesions and all tumors were present at S5-6. Neurological symptoms were stable and therefore all tumors were removed by hepatic resection (S5-6). Pathological examination showed liver cirrhosis and all tumors were moderately differentiated HCC. No copper accumulation was observed in the rhodamine dye. The postoperative course was good, and both liver function and neurological signs have remained stable since then. No tumor was observed in the 14-month period postoperatively.

1822,"Clinical features of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome in undiagnosed Wilson's disease: two case reports","Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by toxic copper accumulation mainly in the liver and brain. The hepatic manifestation of WD is diverse and may include asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or acute/fulminant liver failure. The characteristic of acute liver failure in WD is the accompanying acute intravascular hemolytic anemia, which may represent the first clinical symptom of WD in some patients. The diagnosis of acute Wilson's liver failure is difficult as similar symptoms can be seen in other clinical conditions. In pregnant patients with unrecognized WD, hepatic failure with hemolysis can be interpreted as low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Patients: We describe two women who developed the clinical features of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and HELLP syndrome. Further diagnostics in both confirmed WD.

However, little research has been published on the role of anatomic-functional diagnostic methods in evaluating the course of the disease. Objective: To evaluate and compare the role of brain MRI and Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in evaluating brain involvement in Wilson's disease and to correlate these findings with clinical pictures. Methods: Eighteen patients with established Wilson's disease were included. The clinical picture was neurological type (nWD) in 11 patients (61.1%), and hepatic type (hWD) in 7 patients (38.9%). All patients underwent clinical assessment, cognitive assessment, ophthalmic slit lamp examination, biochemical tests including urinary copper and serum ceruloplasmin levels, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy (only in 5 patients), brain MRI, and Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT. Results: Brain MRI was abnormal in 11/18 patients (sensitivity 61.1%). It was abnormal in 9/11 nWD patients (sensitivity 81.8%) and 2/7 of hWD patients (sensitivity 28.6%). Brain Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT was abnormal in 15 of 18 patients (sensitivity 83.3%). The scan was abnormal in 10/11 (sensitivity 90.9%) patients with nWD and 5/7 (sensitivity 71.4%) patients with hWD. There was a good correlation between the clinical presentation of the disease and the radiological and SPECT findings. Conclusion: Brain SPECT has higher sensitivity than brain MRI in detecting brain damage in Wilson's disease. There was also a good clinical-anatomical correlation, but in some cases it was not yet clear in explaining some clinical aspects.",,"El-Sayed, M. A.;Salem, S.;Taha, A. E. H.;Kassem, A. E.

1829,Multi-element (Trace metals) analysis in serum and urine samples by dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled mass spectrometry,"Objective: Trace metal analysis plays an important role in occupational monitoring, assessment of exposure levels in poisoning, and also in assisting certain clinical diagnoses (Wilson's disease). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with cell reaction/collision eliminating isobaric and polyatomic interferences has improved sensitivity and specificity in analysis. This study evaluates the performance of the Perkin-Elmer ELAN DRC II instrument for serum (Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Se, Zn) and urine (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb) analysis. , Se, Zn) samples are prepared for clinical service promotion. Methods: Fresh gravimetric preparations of standard (3-5 points; 20X dilution of PE Multi-element Calibration Standard) for calibration of ICP-MS were tested in each batch run with analyzes performed in standard or DRC (NH3) mode. Uncertainties (within-run, total laboratory CVs) were evaluated from daily triplicate analyzes of quality control reagents (urine:Bio-Rad; serum:Seronorm) over a 5-day period. Detection limits were evaluated with replicates (n=10) of blank samples. Tmuo evaluates linearity, serial dilutions (5 points) were analyzed with calculated recoveries. A comparison of serum/urine copper and serum zinc levels as measured by ICP-MS and available laboratory atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was made. Results: Calibration curves were linear with zero couplings typically reaching r2 0.990 - 0.999. The inconsistency of within-run results gave a CV of < 10% for all elements in both serum and urine. The calculated total laboratory CVs were low except for Al, Mn, Se, which had >15% CV, indicating a reasonably wider variance of these elements from day-to-day calibration of these elements in each run. In standard mode, sensitivities were typically <0.1mug/L and were further improved with DRC mode. Linearity was verified for each element - from 0.01-200 mug/L to 5 orders of magnitude. Comparative data with a limited sample size (n=30) showed reasonably similar serum/urine copper (serum y=1.05x + 1.14, rs 0.88; urine y=1.07x - 0.08, rs 0.96) and serum zinc (y=) showed. 1.31x - 1.45, rs=0.85) levels with ICP-MS and AAS.

1830,Factors predicting neurological deterioration after chelation therapy in patients with Wilson's disease,"Background: There is a lack of information on the proportion of hepatic Wilson's patients who worsen on chelation therapy. There is also little information about the factors that predict neurological deterioration. In this cohort study, we aimed to investigate what percentage of patients with hepatic Wilson's disease developed neuroimpairment on dpenicillamine. Our aim was to identify any prognostic factors that could predict neurological deterioration after initiation of chelation therapy. Methods: We included newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients aged 3-18 years with hepatic or combined hepatic with neurological findings. We excluded fulminant Wilson and other causes of chronic liver disease. Assessment of liver status was performed using the Child, MELD score and New Wilson scoring index. We examined putative predictive factors such as age, gender, and mode of presentation, namely hepatic and combined hepatic plus neurologic. All patients were followed for up to 2 years during d-Penicillamine therapy. Results: One patient had clinical neurologic involvement with liver symptoms (10%). Four out of 10 patients (40%) had CNS lesion lesions in the MRI brain at baseline evaluation. Neurological worsening in 3 (30%) of 10 patients during the follow-up period. Factors such as MELD score and INR were significantly abnormal in neurologically deteriorating patients who started chelation therapy (p=0.032 and 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: One-third of Wilson's disease presenting with hepatic or combined hepatic with neurological findings worsens during d-penicillamine therapy. Factors such as the MELD score and INR at the time of diagnosis are the factors that predict neurological deterioration in patients who are started on chelation therapy.",,"Reddy, N. R.;Puri, A.

1831,Effect of D-penicillamine on liver fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease is a copper metabolism disorder characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of the ATP7B protein and decreased biliary copper excretion in hepatocytes. Excessive copper accumulation leads to liver damage. D-penicillamine can primarily inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the appearance of scar lesions in the liver. We studied this phenomenon in our patients. METHODS: Pathology slides taken from the explant livers of 26 patients who were diagnosed with Wilson's disease and underwent liver transplantation between 2000 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their history of D-penicillamine use before transplantation. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation was classified as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3) and reviewed by an unbiased hepatopathologist. RESULTS: 69% (18/26) of 26 patients (20 males, 6 females) with Wilson's disease and a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years had been using D-penicillamine for 6 months to 6 months before liver transplantation. He had a story. 9 years (mean, 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis were seen in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18) of patients, grade 2 in 44% (8/18) and grade 1 in 11% (2/18) of patients. In the group without D-penicillamine (8 patients), fibrosis grades were grade 3 (62%), grade 2 (25%), and grade 1 (12%); Grade 2 and 3 inflammation was present in 87% of patients. The degree of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than in the non-D-penicillamine group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine may decrease the rate of liver fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Kazemi, K.;Geramizadeh, B.;Kakaei, F.;Nikeghbalian, S.;Malekhosseini, S.

1832,Spermidine/spermine astyltransferase is responsible for the metabolism of triethylenetetramine and other polyamine analogs in humans.,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper II chelator traditionally used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, and a number of its structural analogues are currently in clinical trials for cancer. However, the metabolism of TETA has never been fully investigated, which is crucial for its further development in cancer therapy. The two main metabolites of TETA in humans are N1-acetyl-TETA (MAT) and N<sup>1</sup>, N<sup>10</sup>-diacetyl-TETA (DAT). Traditionally, acetylation of the drug is thought to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2). The FDA requires that the pharmacological properties of any drug metabolized by acetylation should be investigated in a population with a different NAT2 phenotype. However, our recent clinical study showed no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and metabolite profiles of healthy volunteers with the fast or slow NAT2 acetylation phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesize that the enzyme responsible for TETA acetylation is spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT), which has never been considered a drug-metabolizing enzyme, rather than NAT2. To pinpoint the enzyme responsible for TETA metabolism, we performed in vitro drug metabolism experiments. TETA and MAT (as substrate) and acetyl-coenzyme A were incubated with human liver microsome and cytosol from 5 individuals in the presence or absence of pentamidine or acetaminophen, separately. The formation of MAT from TETA and DAT from MAT was detected and quantified using our previously published LC-MS method. Both the liver microsome and the cytosol can catalyze the biotransformation of TETA and MAT. The metabolic rate in the microsome and cytosol varies in each individual. Metabolism rates in the microsome and cytosol also differed between individuals (Km range 223 - 909 M, V<inf>max</inf> range 96 - 482 pg/min/mg protein). x Pentamidine, a specific inhibitor for SSAT, can inhibit the reaction and increase Km by over 30%. Acetaminophen, a specific inhibitor for NAT2, did not show any inhibitory effect. The same experiments were performed on rat liver microsome and cytosol and similar results were obtained except for Km and V<inf>max</inf> values. TETA and two other polyamine analogs, diethylnorspermin and diethylspermin, all of which are under investigation for cancer therapy, were incubated with pure whole recombinant human SSAT protein and formation of acetylated metabolites was found. The identification of SSAT, which has never been considered as a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, as the enzyme that catalyzes the activation of polyamine analogs, has an important place in the clinic, especially in clinical trial situations. Many polyamine analogs have been developed as potential cancer drugs, and many of them are being investigated in clinical trials, including TETA. Finding the right enzyme to study their biotransformation (i.e. SSAT rather than traditional NAT2) is crucial to understanding their pharmacology, which is essential for overall drug study.",,"Lu, J.;Li, M.;Xu, H.;Tingle, M.;Cooper, G.

1833,Wilson France: a national database for Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disease with effective treatment when started early. Improving knowledge about this disease for better access to diagnosis and treatment is a priority of the French National Center for Expertise. This national organization created a database. Objective: To improve knowledge of WD with an epidemiological study on the French cohort. Methods: We enrolled all patients followed by all French centers working with the National Center for Specialization. Results: Since 2006, 281 patients (aged 1-73 years) were included in the Wilson France database (sex ratio: 1). The mean age at diagnosis was 19. Initial symptoms were neurological for 36% of patients, liver for 38%, kidney for 11%, psychiatric or haematological. 15 percent were diagnosed after family screening. Kayser-Fleischer ring was seen in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms at diagnosis, 55% of hepatic presentations, and 26% of presymptomatic forms. Mean coeruloplasminemia was low (0.08 g/L), but 5% of patients had normal values (>0.2 g/L). Mean urinary copper was elevated in 96% of patients. Genetic analysis was inconclusive in 15.9% of families (only one mutation was found or none at all). D-Penicillamine was the first treatment in 85% of the cases, and at the end of a mean follow-up of 15 years, D-Penicillamine was administered to 44.4% of the patients, Trientine to 14.4%, and zinc, chelator and zinc combination to 26.7%. for 5.6%; Liver transplantation was performed in 5.6% of the patients. Discussion: The database included approximately 1/3 of Wilson's disease patients in France.

1834,Elevated liver enzymes in a 6-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A leads to a presymptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease.,"We report a 6-year-old boy with severe hemophilia A (inversion of intron 22 of the FVIII gene) who repeatedly had moderately elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) on routine control. No common cause for hepatitis (hepatitis B or C, CMV, EBV) was found, but further evaluation showed decreased serum ceruloplasmin concentration. 24-hour urinary copper excretion was significantly increased. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established by demonstrating compound heterozygosity for ATP7B gene mutations (R1041W and N1270S); parents were heterozygous. Except for elevated transaminases, no signs of liver dysfunction, no neurological signs, and Kayser-Fleischer ring were detected; An enlarged liver but a normal parenchymal structure was seen on ultrasound. Treatment with D-penicillamine and vitamin B6 was initiated and monitored by measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion and transaminases. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that causes copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea and can lead to hepatic and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. Even a mild but stable elevation of transaminases can indicate Wilson's disease. Presymptomatic diagnosis offers the possibility of early treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc acetate. Therefore, plasma ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion should be investigated in cases of chronic elevation of liver enzymes.",,"Hainmann, I.;Woltering, T.;Greiner, P.;Superti-Furga, A.;Zieger, B.",2010,,,0,0,
1835,Wilson's disease presenting as hepatic hydrothorax in a young woman,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism with hepatic or neurological presentation. Histopathological findings of liver involvement range from steatosis to end-stage cirrhosis. WD manifesting as acute or fulminant hepatic failure, hemolytic crisis, neuropsychiatric symptoms and, rarely, decompensated cirrhosis has been described. This is the first case of WD presenting as worsening dyspnea secondary to right hepatic hydrothorax. Case Report: A 20-year-old white woman presented with the complaint of progressive dyspnea for six months. He had no history of significant alcohol abuse or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination revealed mild jaundice, right pleural effusion, ascites, and peripheral edema. Kayser-Fleischer rings were not seen on slit lamp examination. Laboratory results revealed mildly elevated transaminases and bilirubin, low albumin, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. Computed tomography showed massive hydrothorax on the right with mediastinal shift, ascites, and liver cirrhosis. Echocardiogram was normal. A right-sided chest tube was placed, resulting in high-output (>15 L) drainage of transudative fluid and relief of symptoms. Further evaluation was notable for a low serum ceruloplasmin level of <10 mg/dl and a high 24-hour urinary copper (Cu) level of 270 cups. Liver biopsy showed micro- and macro-vesicular steatosis with active cirrhosis, but could not quantitatively measure Cu due to lack of sufficient samples. Rhodanine staining was positive for Cu in one of the nodules. While waiting for the biopsy results, the patient developed tremors and worsening liver function. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed increased signal intensity in agreement with lenticular Cu deposition in the globus pallidus. A diagnosis of WD was made. Trientene and Zinc treatment was started and she was transferred to a liver transplant center where she underwent a successful liver transplant. Discussion: Only 3% of 50% of patients with WD presenting with liver disease have hepatic decompensation at presentation. Hepatic hydrothorax is an even rarer complication and is defined as a significant pleural effusion, usually > 500 mL, in a patient with cirrhosis in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease. Pathophysiology involves leakage of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural space through embryological defects, which are more common in the right hemidiaphragm. Decompensated cirrhosis due to WD can be managed with medical therapy. Patients with failed treatment and hepatic hydrothorax will require liver transplantation. A high index of clinical suspicion is required for early diagnosis and medical treatment.",,"Ghayam, S.;Ponugoti, S.;Pawa, S.",2010,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2010.320-7,0,0,
1836,Late-onset neurological Wilson's disease without CF rings or characteristic MRI findings,"Objective: To report an unusual case of genetically confirmed Wilson's disease (WD) presenting as late-onset parkinsonism without CF rings or characteristic brain MRI abnormalities. Background: The age of onset of WD is variable but usually occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decades. A neurological presentation is rare after 40 years and has not been reported without CF rings or characteristic brain MRI findings. In conclusion, screening for WD in patients presenting with movement disorder is not routine after this age, and it remains unclear what the upper limit for the age of neurological phenoconversion is. Methods: Case Report. Results: A 50-year-old male patient presented with complaints of tremor in his left hand, stiffness in his left arm, insomnia and anxiety for 15 months. Examination showed predominantly left-sided parkinsonism with rest tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. There were no CF rings. Quetiapine and olanzapine were used briefly to treat anxiety after the onset of motor symptoms, but were discontinued at least 2 months before admission. Parkinsonism was then unresponsive to ropinirole, pramipexole and only minimally responsive to levodopa up to 200 mg TID. The investigation included a normal brain MRI and normal EEG. Two years later, an unexpectedly low serum ceruloplasmin of 4.1 was found as part of a research project. Repeated studies in a commercial laboratory were ceruloplasmin 7.4 mg/dL (25-63), serum copper 28 g/dL (70-150), urine copper 65 g/24 hours (3-35). Iron studies and LFTs were normal. No CF rings were seen on the official ophthalmologic examination. ATP7B gene sequencing (Mayo Clinic) revealed 2 different known pathogenic WD mutations (compound heterozygous). The patient was treated with zinc for 6 months without improvement. A liver biopsy showed increased copper without cirrhosis, and a repeated slit lamp examination at an academic medical center did not reveal CF rings. Current treatment is Trientine. Results: The diagnosis of WD was made incidentally after finding low serum ceruloplasmin as part of a research project. This case suggests that late-onset WD is more common than previously thought and extends the range of phenotypic expression to include parkinsonism presenting in advanced adulthood without CF rings or MRI abnormalities. WD screening with serum ceruloplasmin should be routine in elderly patients presenting with parkinsonism, tremor or dystonia.",,"Molho, E.

1837,Novel angiogenesis inhibitor tetrathiomolybdate enhances tumor cell killing efficacy of oncolytic virus,"Oncolytic viruses (OV) are modified viruses specifically designed to lyse cancerous cells while leaving the surrounding tissue intact. Although effective in killing tumors, OV therapy has shown limited effectiveness against glioma in clinical trials. The tumor microenvironment potentially inhibits OV invasion and dissemination; In particular, angiogenic and inflammatory responses following OV vaccination have been shown to significantly limit OV efficacy. Copper promotes angiogenesis and its physiological level has been shown to inhibit wild-type HSV infection and replication. The aim of our current project is to determine whether the copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate can be used to increase overall OV efficacy in malignant glioma. Tetrathiomolybdate has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Wilson's disease and is currently being evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Previous findings indicate that the anticancer effects of OV can be significantly enhanced by pretreatment with an angiostatic agent. Tetrathiomolybdate's angiostatic and immunosuppressive properties make it an ideal candidate for improving OV therapy. To confirm this, we tested whether copper inhibits OV-mediated glioma cell killing and may be effective against tetrathiomolybdate. We found that copper at physiological concentration in serum can significantly inhibit glioma cell killing and virus replication. This inhibition of cell killing by OV incubated with copper was observed in many different OVs tested. Viral replication and cytotoxicity assay data showed that tetrathiomolyb-date-mediated copper chelation was able to rescue copper-inhibited viral replication, resulting in enhanced tumor cell killing effect. Based on these results, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of combining tetrathiomolybdate with OV against a U251T3 model of subcutaneous glioma. We found a significant increase in the antitumor response of animals treated with tetrathiomolyb-date plus OV compared to animals treated with OV alone. Collectively, our results suggest that the combination of tetrathiomolybdate and OV elicits a robust efficacy profile compared to OV alone, and that simultaneous administration of tetrathiomolybdate to patients may improve OV efficacy.",,"Yoo, J.

1838,Wilson's diseases: 1-year general experience of a single center,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for the biliary excretion of copper and leads to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. WD has a wide range of clinical manifestations. Affected children may be completely asymptomatic and diagnosis may be problematic. The purpose of this study is to present our one-year single center experience with WD that underlies its different presentations. Patients and methods: In the last 12 months (April 2009 to April 2010), 5 patients (3 males) met the diagnostic criteria for WD. Evaluation included a detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory tests (urinary copper excretion, serum ceruloplasmin levels), genetic analysis, and liver biopsy. 3 patients presented with isolated liver disease, 1 patient with mixed neurologic and hepatic involvement, and 1 patient with acute liver failure. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was performed in all 3 patients with cirrhotic liver. Results: The median age at diagnosis of WD was 10.8 (range, 7-16). At diagnosis, all patients had liver manifestations of the disease: cirrhosis (2), chronic hepatitis (2), and fulminant liver failure (1). Two patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. 1 of the symptomatic patients showed typical neurologic symptoms, first with behavioral changes and worsening in school work that degenerated into spasticity with lack of motor coordination, drooling, dysarthria, dystonia, and disease deepening. Kayser Fleischer ring was positive in the patient who had only neurological findings at the time of diagnosis. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were decreased in all patients, with a median value of 9.2 mg/dl (range 2-16), lower levels in cirrhotic patients. Urinary 24-hour copper excretion increased in all patients >75 cups/24 hours before (median value 360 cups/24) or >1400 cups/24 hours after penicillamine loading. Genetic analysis showed double eterozygosis in 3/5, other 2 patients had only 1 recognized mutation. It proved to be diagnostically important, the copper content in all patients was greater than 250 mug/g hepatic dry weight. We started zinc treatment (zinc acetate) by adding a copper chelator drug as Trientine to all patients who had only neurological symptoms at the time of diagnosis. None of the 3 cirrhosis patients improved with treatment and avoided liver transplantation. Zinc acetate treatment was started in 2 asymptomatic patients and was well tolerated. In these 2 patients, liver function tests improved after 3 weeks of treatment, reaching normal values at 2 months for both. Liver transplantation indication was chronic (2/3) or fulminant, acute in liver failure (1/3). Median follow-up after liver transplantation was 1 year, 1 patient died due to perioperative complications (66% patient survival). Copper metabolism returned to normal in all patients. None of the transplanted patients with specific liver disease required chelation therapy after liver transplantation, and none developed neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease. Conclusion: Detection of WD in children is quite difficult due to the low incidence, but our 1-year experience shows a higher frequency than reported in the literature. The most important examination is liver biopsy with evaluation of liver copper. Genetic analysis can be helpful in doubtful cases. Ceruloplasmin, hemoglobin, ALT, ALP and plasma albumin differed significantly between fulminant and non-fulminant WD and can be used as indirect markers in the assessment of emergency OLT. It is important to be aware of the different manifestations of Wilson's disease in the pediatric population, to make timely appropriate assessments to facilitate early diagnosis, provide appropriate treatment, and avoid the risk of underestimation.",,"Pietrobattista, A.;Candusso, M.;Alterio, A.;Sartorelli, M.;Francalanci, P.;Comparcola, D.;Nobili, V.;Torre, G.",2010,October,,0,1,
1839,Hepatocellular cancer in neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is extremely unusual in Wilson's disease with cirrhosis. It is assumed that liver copper is a protective factor against carcinogens. Patients presenting with neurological Wilson's disease are rarely monitored for tumors. Case report: A 30-year-old man was diagnosed with neurological Wilson's disease 4 years ago based on clinical features, the presence of a CF ring, elevated urinary copper levels, and a positive penicillamine challenge test. Liver function tests were normal. He was treated aggressively with D-penicillamine and Zinc, with significant improvement in neurology and lightening of the CF ring. Six months ago, discomfort in the right upper quadrant was investigated. A 10 cm hepatocellular cancer was detected in the right posterior sector of the liver. HCV RNA, HBsAg, Anti HBc, HBV DNA, ANA were all negative. We performed a segment VII/VIII resection where the patient recovered uneventfully. A moderately differentiated HCC in the setting of cirrhosis was confirmed in histology. Interestingly, liver copper levels were very low, possibly due to aggressive chelation therapy. Discussion: Liver copper is protective in Wilson's disease. Reports of HCC in Wilson's disease are extremely rare, especially in those presenting with neurological Wilson's disease and without hepatic manifestations. In previous reports, hepatitis may co-exist or have not been excluded. Hepatitis B and C are excluded in the present case. We hypothesize that aggressive chelation therapy clears the liver of protective copper that leads to carcinogenesis.",,"Shah, S.",2010,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-2574.2010.00165.x,0,0,
1840,CD8 T cell lymphopenia and functional asplenia in an infant with ZEB2 mutation and impaired neural crest development associated with Mowat Wilson syndrome (MWS),"Introduction: We report abnormal immune findings in a patient with zinc finger protein deficiency and MWS. Case Description: A 2.5-year-old male with Hirschprung's disease and MWS was admitted for evaluation for asplenia. MWS was diagnosed at birth by genetic testing showing the chromosome 2q22.3 mutation and ZEB2 deficiency. A small spleen was seen at 2 days of life and PCN prophylaxis was started. No history of serious infection was reported, except for enterocolitis at the age of 1 year. the patient never received a live viral vaccine. Immunoassay revealed CBC with slightly elevated eosinophil count. Peripheral smear confirmed asplenia. Serum immunoglobulins showed low IgA and IgM, but normal IgG and IgE. The oxidative burst test was normal. Serological vaccine responses showed 2 out of 7 levels of protective antibodies to Prevnar vaccine and an indeterminate response to tetanus. Lymphocyte phenotyping revealed low levels of CD3+ T cells, low levels of CD3+CD8+ T cells (3.9%; lower limit of normal 16.0%), but normal levels of CD3+CD4+ T cells. B cell, Natural Killer cell and HLA-DR measurements were found to be appropriate. T cells showed adequate response to mitogen and antigen stimulation. Four weeks after revaccination (Prevnar 13, DTaP), protective antibody levels were demonstrated for all 13 pneumococcal serotypes, tetanus, diphtheria, and hemophilus. Repeated lymphocyte phenotyping again showed low CD3+ T cells and low CD3+CD8+ T cells. Evaluation was negative for occult viral infection. Discussion: ZEB2 is the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene responsible for the embryonic development of neural crest cells. CD8 homeostasis has not been defined, but abnormalities in CD8 cell expression have been reported in MHC Class I deficiency, ZAP 70 deficiency, and IL-7 deficiency. Since CD3+CD4+ cells are found in normal numbers, IL-7 perturbations are not seen in our patient; There is no evidence of MHC Class I deficiency. ZAP 70 deficiency, another zinc finger deficiency, presents with T cell dysfunction, which is not seen in this patient. Neurological disorders have been associated with immunodeficiency such as ataxia telangiectasia, ADA deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Patients with MWS (impaired neural crest development) should be evaluated for evidence of immunological abnormalities, including asplenia.",,"Shroff, P.;Potocki, L.;Chinen, J.;Hanson, I.

1841,An unexpected novel antioxidant-like activity for the classical copper chelating drug penicillamine.,"Penicillamine (beta, beta'-dimethylcysteine) is widely used clinically as a copper chelating drug for the treatment of copper overload in Wilson's disease. In this study, we found that penicillamine provided significant protection in human fibroblasts against cytotoxicity induced by tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ, an important toxic metabolite of the widely used wood preservative pentachlorophenol), while other copper chelators such as BCS (batcouproin disulfonate) and trientine did not. . The autooxidation process of TCHQ giving reactive tetrachlorosemiquinone (TCSQ) radical was investigated by ESR and UV-visible spectral methods. Interestingly and surprisingly, the formation of the TCSQ radical was found to be significantly retarded by penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, penicillamine disulfide (the oxidized form of penicillamine), N-acetylpenicillamine, BCS, and trientine had no detectable effect on TCHQ autooxidation. HPLC-MS studies have shown that the TCSQ radical is reduced to TCHQ by penicillamine, which is simultaneously oxidized to its corresponding disulfide form. These data suggest that penicillamine's protective effects on TCHQ-induced cytotoxicity are due not to copper binding but to reduction of the reactive TCSQ radical to the much less reactive TCHQ. This is the first report showing an unexpected novel antioxidant-like activity for the classical copper chelating amino thiol drug and may be highly relevant to the biological activities of penicillamine.",,"Zhu, B.

1842,Copper impairs nuclear receptor function in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the Cu-carrying P-type ATPase (ATP7b) that causes excessive hepatic copper accumulation and is associated with steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The animal model of Wilson's disease (Atp7b-/-) has reduced expression of several hepatic nuclear receptor signaling pathways, including decreased FXR:RXR target gene expression. Methods: DNA binding was measured by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) with: in vitro translated FXR and RXR proteins synthesized with copper (CuSO4) and/or zinc (ZnSO4) (1-40 µM); Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells treated with 75 µM CDCA, +/- metals (5 µM CuSO4 and/or 40 µM ZnSO4) for 16 hours; and nuclear extracts from control and Atp7b-/- mice. Total RNA was harvested from HepG2 cells (as noted above) and gene expression measured by real-time PCR [bile salt export pump (BSEP, Abcb11), metallothionein (Met) 2, FXR and TNFalpha]. Results: In vitro translation of RXR with 4-40 mM CuSO4 resulted in complete loss of FXR:RXR binding to the SHP and BSEP promoters, and the addition of 40 µM ZnSO4 to the reaction resulted in rebinding to the SHP and BSEP promoters. Protein expression of FXR and RXR was not decreased by metal in the in vitro translation reaction (measured by Western blot and addition of S35-methion). Binding of FXR to BSEP and SHP promoters in liver nuclear extracts is decreased in Atp7b-/- mice; however, binding of the NFkappaB (non-zinc finger transcription factor) or SP1 (non-nuclear receptor zinc finger transcription factor) complex was not different between control and Atp7b-/- mice. In HepG2 cells, CuSO4 treatment reduced CDCA induction of BSEP mRNA expression by 80% (P<0.05); this was restored to 40% (P<0.05) of CDCA treatment alone by adding ZnSO4 to cultures containing CuSO4 and CDCA. Met2 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells increased significantly in 2- (P<0.05, CDCA treatment), 7- (P<0.05, CuSO4 treatment) and 50-fold (P<0.01, CDCA+CuSO4+ZnSO4 treatment). FXR and TNFalpha mRNA expression did not change with CuSO4 treatment. Furthermore, treatment of HepG2 cells with CuSO4 abolished nuclear extract binding to the BSEP promoter. Conclusions: Copper impairs nuclear receptor binding activity and decreases hepatic target gene expression. DNA binding experiments in excess copper models suggest that copper displacement of zinc in the zinc finger of nuclear receptors promotes the pathology of Wilson's disease and that the addition of excess zinc may ameliorate the adverse effects of copper on nuclear receptor activity.",,"Wooton-Kee, C.

1843,Iron and the HFE gene in Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Wilson's Disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes liver failure and progressive neurological deterioration in untreated patients. Animal studies and several case reports have suggested hepatic iron overload or changes in iron processing in WD. In line with these findings, a significantly higher frequency of HFE mutations has been reported in small series of WD patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate iron metabolism and HFE gene frequencies in WD patients, as well as to analyze the effects of chelation therapy. Patients and methods: Data of 143 WD patients treated at Heidelberg university hospital between 1968 and 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical presentation parameters, liver function and iron metabolism were recorded. EDTA Blood samples of the patients were analyzed for changes in the HFE gene (H63D; C282Y) using standard RT-PCR techniques. Results: In contrast to previous reports in our large population of WD patients, the frequencies of HFE gene mutations (HFE mutations in 143 patients: 120 wild-type, 3 C282Y-heterozygous, 1 C282Y-homozygous, 16 H63D-heterozygous, 2 H63D-homozygous, and 1 H63D/C282Y- compound-heterozygous) were 2.1% for C282Y and 7.3% for H63D, consistent with frequencies obtained for the general population. Mutations in the HFE gene were not predictive of an early clinical manifestation or a fulminant clinical course of Wilson's Disease. To further elucidate the role of decreased coeruloplasmin (CP) levels and lack of ferro-oxidase activity, patients were subgrouped according to CP levels. High ferritin and low transfer (p<0.05) were seen in patients with significant hypoceruloplasminemia (CP < 0.1 g/l). In our cohort, different treatment regimens (D-penicillamine, trientine, zinc or combination therapy with a chelating agent and zinc) did not alter the parameters of iron metabolism. decreased ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin. HFE-gene mutations may be additional risk factors for a clinically significant iron overload in individual cases, but allele frequencies indicate no association between WD and hereditary HFE-associated hemochromatosis. The effects of chelation therapy on iron metabolism for WD appear to be insignificant and of no clinical significance in most cases.",,"Pfeiffenberger, J.;Gotthardt, D.;Seessle, J.;Herrmann, T.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1844,Changes in lipid metabolism in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that leads to toxic copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other tissues. The development of hepatic steatosis is a common symptom in the early stages. Animal models (ATP7b-/- and LEC rats) show changes in lipid metabolism as serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels decrease. Changes in lipid metabolism in humans have so far not been extensively studied in WD, but previous studies have suggested an effect of specific WD treatment. The reduction of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) under zinc therapy raises the question of whether this therapy is atherogenetic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 251 WD patients treated at Heidelberg university hospital between 1990 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were subgrouped by sex, treatment (DPA, trientine or zinc) or symptoms (hepatic, neurological, mixed, and asymptomatic) for analysis of disease course and laboratory values (including serum lipid profile, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, lipoprotein). . a), serum bile acids, adiponectin and leptin). The occurrence of vascular events under treatment and the prevalence of coronary heart disease were recorded. Results: Serum lipids in treated and untreated patients were not statistically different between men and women. Interestingly, cholesterol levels were decreased in untreated patients with a median of 158 (66-319) mg/dl, with a median of 194 (123-243) mg/dl in neurologic or mixed 186 (145-244) mg/dl in hepatic patients or asymptomatic patients. patients 195 (173-294) mg/dl. These differences diminished under at least 12 months of treatment. Contrary to previous studies, we did not observe a decrease in total cholesterol or HDL under zinc therapy or chelator-based therapy. Vascular events were rare and did not differ statistically between treatment groups or between patients with different symptoms. However, serum lipoprotein (a) was considerably higher in neurologically affected patients than in patients with persistent liver disease. CONCLUSION: Only minor changes were found in the serum lipid profile of WD patients, which decreased under treatment. Unlike animal models of the disease, the amount of triglycerides and cholesterol did not decrease. Our data suggest that medical treatments for WD do not have a significant atherogenetic effect.",,"Seessle, J.;Gohdes, A. M.;Gotthardt, D.;Pfeiffenberger, J.;Stremmel, W.;Weiss, K.

1845,Toronto Western Hospital Wilson's disease study: Perspectives from an adult urban outpatient center,"Objective: To review the clinical experience for adult patients with Wilson's disease (WD) in an urban outpatient setting. Methods: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with WD was performed. Results: 59 charts were identified; Based on Leipzig scores, 44 possibles (score >= 4) and 10 possibles met criteria for WD (scores 2-3). In the review, 6 cases were excluded (1 possible, 5 possible). The presentation characteristics of the 48 included patients are shown in Table 1. At review, the median time to treatment was 11.5 years (range 0.1-42 years). D-penicillamine (DP) was the most common initial therapy (48%), followed by zinc (23%), trientine (15%), DP and zinc (6%) and 8% unknown (started as part of treatment). a double-blind study). In the review, zinc was the most common regimen (65%), followed by DP (17%), trientine (12%), and dual therapy (6%). Adverse effects were most pronounced for DP (41%) compared to zinc (19%) or trientine (10%). Overall, liver biopsy and/or imaging showed the presence of portal hypertension in 63% of patients and cirrhosis in 53%. Liver biopsy (n=31) also identified fibrosis in 94% of patients, inflammatory activity in 68%, and steatosis in 65%. Where evaluated, 10 patients had EM mitochondrial changes and 13 glycogenated nuclei. The median liver copper concentration was 4.11muM/g (range 0.22-20.43). During the follow-up, hepatic encephalopathy developed in 3 patients and jaundice developed in 2 patients. 2 patients developed ascites (one was initially asymptomatic) and 1 variceal bleeding was documented. During the review, there was one death and one transplant. Neurological WD patients (n=21) presented with a median of 4 neurological symptoms consistent with WD. In the examination, 14 patients had fewer neurological symptoms, 2 had the same number, 4 more findings (1 patient lost follow-up). Neurological symptoms developed in three patients with a non-neurological presentation, of whom 1 returned to baseline. Eleven patients had at least one documented episode of neurologic regression during treatment. Signal abnormalities were seen in the basal ganglia (62%), brain stem (50%), white matter tracts (38%), and thalamus (28%) of the patients who underwent MRI (n=26). Eight patients (31%) had normal brain MRIs. Of the patients (n=11) who had a second MRI, 36% saw nearly complete recovery.

1846,Symptomatic Wilson's disease during long-term zinc maintenance monotherapy after initial penicillamine copper removal: experience in 30 patients,"The outcome of specific zinc monotherapy for symptomatic Wilson's disease may be unfavorable, especially in the case of advanced liver disease (Hepatol 2009;50:1442-52). Initial copper removal with penicillamine may improve outcome, but available data are scarce and long-term follow-up is not available. Here we report our experience with such an approach in 30 symptomatic patients during (median) 29 (0.5-48) years of follow-up (FU). Presentation was specific hepatic, specific neurologic, or combined in 14, 3, and 13 cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 14 (range 7 to 37). The initial duration and dose of penicillamine was 2 (0.5-21) years and 873 (162-2000) mg. and the following zinc corresponds to 23 (0.5-42) years and 175 (68-279) mg. Of 27 patients with hepatic or combined presentation, 3 had decompensated cirrhosis at baseline, 11 had compensated cirrhosis, and 13 had less severe disease. One in 3 patients with initial decompensated cirrhosis developed into compensated cirrhosis and remained so during 23 years of FU, 1 was transplanted 0.5 years later and one initially recovered but died from complications of cirrhosis 12 years later. Of 11 patients (median FU 31 years) with baseline compensated cirrhosis, 1 died 2 years after penicillamine-induced myelinolysis, 3 died of liver disease complications after 17, 20, and 30 years of treatment, and 7 died after FU for a median 29 years. remained stable. Of the 13 patients with less severe liver disease, 9 deteriorated, 5 compensated and 1 decompensated cirrhosis (the latter compensated after trientine addition). Progressive liver disease was associated with longer follow-up (median 31 vs 26 years, P=0.03), but not clearly explained by dose or duration of treatment or decoppering efficacy (based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion and serum non-ceruloplasmin) at the end of FU bound copper concentration). Of 16 patients with a first neurological or combined presentation, 7 had neurological symptoms improved, 4 remained stable, and 5 worsened (including 1 death from pneumonia). Neurological symptoms developed in 3 patients with specific hepatic presentation, and hepatic disease developed in one patient with specific neurologic presentation during follow-up. Major adverse events occurred only during penicillamine: glomerulonephritis (n=2) and death from myelinolysis (n=1). In conclusion, hepatic Wilson's disease tends to progress during long-term zinc monotherapy, even after initial penicillamine copper removal, although the short-term clinical outcome is generally satisfactory.",,"Ras, J.;Houwen, R.;Linn, F.

1847,Therapeutic plasma exchange as a bridge to liver transplant in a pediatric patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of impaired copper metabolism that results in copper accumulation primarily in the liver, but ultimately in many organs and tissues. A small number of patients with WD initially present with fulminant liver failure, hypercuprema, and intravascular hemolysis. Therapeutic goals for these patients include rapid removal of copper by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and preparing the patient for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Here we report a pediatric patient treated with TPE as a bridge to OLT. Case Report: The patient was a 6-year-old male with WD who presented with fulminant liver failure. He was recently diagnosed on the basis of 1480 lg/day copper excretion in the urine and was taking trientine as chelation therapy. The patient had jaundice with elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy, and moderate direct antiglobulin test negative anemia. TPE was started as a stabilization tool until OLT became possible. A total of 5 single volumes (1500 mL) of TPE were performed over eleven days using a Cobe Spectra cell separator (CaridianBCT, Lakewood, CO) with fresh frozen plasma as replacement fluid. Urinary and serum copper levels were unreliable markers of copper stores due to transfusion and chelation therapy. In addition, there was an unexpected temporary improvement in the mental status of the patient who was diagnosed with autism after the first TPE. OLT was performed 15 days after last application and 12 days after initiation of TPE. The post-transplant course was uneventful. Currently, 5 months after transplantation, the patient continues on chelation therapy and is well. Conclusions: TPE was a successful adjunctive therapy to connect this patient with WD and fulminant hepatic failure to OLT. Clinical studies investigating the role of TPE in WD are needed to further determine whether this therapy can be applied broadly.",,"Morgan, S. M.;Zantek, N.

1848,"New dermatological manifestations of Mowat-Wilson syndrome, including photosensitivity and dyspigmentation","The authors update on a previously reported patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) with unusual dermatological features, including photosensitivity and skin dyspigmentation.<sup>1</sup> Hirschsprung's disease, hypospadias, an 18-month-old Afro-Caribbean male The child was referred to the dermatology department with visual delay, microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and dysmorphic facial features. Since birth, he has exhibited persistent skin dispigmentation with patchy macular hypo- and hyperpigmentation covering the face and neck, upper extremities, trunk, perineum, and right ankle. He had no previous history of inflammation or eczema. Following the original report, her parents described photosensitivity since age 2, with sunburn-like erythema occurring within minutes of sun exposure despite applying high factor sunscreen. Investigations including lupus serology and porphyria screening were normal. The patient is currently awaiting the official phototest. Genetic analysis previously identified a heterozygous truncated mutation in exon 8 of the ZEB2 (formerly ZFHXIB; Zinc finger homeobox 1B) gene confirming MWS. MWS was first described in 1998 and included the characteristic facial dysmorphism, deep learning difficulties, epilepsy, Hirschprung's disease, and other congenital abnormalities mapped to a locus on chromosome 2q21-q23.<sup>2</sup> In 2001 the causative gene, ZEB2 <sup >3</sup> More than 100 pathogenetic heterozygous mutations or deletions have subsequently been identified.<sup>4</sup> The unique evolving facial ZEB2 encodes Smad-interacting protein (SIP1), a ubiquitous transcription factor .

1849,Efficacy and tolerance of zinc in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Purpose and Study: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of zinc acetate in the treatment of Wilson's Disease (WD) in children. Methods: This multicenter study included 26 WD patients treated with zinc acetate. Clinical and biological data were collected through a questionnaire: age and symptoms at diagnosis of WD, age at initiation of zinc therapy, efficacy on biological parameters, side effects. Results: 23 patients (88%) were asymptomatic at presentation and mostly diagnosed during familial examination; 23 patients (88%) had liver disease and one patient (4%) had neurological symptoms. Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 15% of the cases. The diagnosis of WD was made at a median age of 8 years (0.8 - 16.1). The percentage of WD patients treated with zinc ranged from 8.5% to 61.5%, according to the centre. D-penicillamine was associated in 18 patients (69%), trientine was associated in 4 patients (15%), and 3 drugs were given in 3 patients (11%). Zinc treatment was started at the time of diagnosis in 12 cases (46%) as a single drug in 8 cases. The median age at the start of zinc therapy was 10.8 years (2.3-12.3) and 2.6 years after diagnosis of WD. In children who were given only zinc, it was started at the age of 7 (2.3 - 11.1), 5 months after the diagnosis of WD. Zinc was started at the recommended dose in 11 children and gradually increased in 15 patients. Doses above the recommended dose were used in 5/6 patients under 5 years of age, 10/19 patients between 6-15 years of age and 1/1 patient over 16 years of age. Median ALT and urinary copper values returned to normal at 5 months after the initiation of treatment. Afterwards, urinary copper values remained below 50mg/24 hours in all patients, but compliance was poor in one patient. Epigastralgia (n = 4), vomiting and diarrhea (n = 1), leukopenia (n = 1), and transient increase in serum lipase (n = 1) were observed.

1850,Wilson's disease in children: single-center experience with analysis of 114 children over an 18-year period.,"Objective and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare, autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder with a highly variable clinical manifestation in childhood. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 114 children with WD to determine the clinical presentation, diagnostic course, and outcome. Methods: Medical reports of 114 children (63 males) diagnosed with WD between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Physical examination, laboratory tests and liver biopsies of the patients were evaluated. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.5+/- 3.2 years (1.5-16 years). Most of the parents (81, 71.1%) were consanguineous. Eighty-seven (76.3%) patients were diagnosed symptomatically and 12 of them were ill. A diagnosis was made with family screening in 27 patients who presented with acute liver failure. A total of 80 patients were admitted with hepatic, 5 patients with neurological and 17 with both hepatic and neurologic features. Hepatomegaly was the most common clinical finding in 41 patients, while splenomegaly, jaundice 26, 25 and 24 ascites in patients, Kayser-Fleischer rings in 63 (57.8%) of 109 patients, and serum ceruloplasmin levels below 20 mg/dl in 97 (85.1%) of 114 patients evaluated. Copper excretion was above 80mg/24 hours in 85 of 102 patients (83.3%). Liver copper (250mg/g dry weight) was found in 53 of 79 (67.0%). The most common findings were cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. liver biopsy (23/79, 29.1% for e ah). All patients with acute liver failure died, except for one patient who received a liver transplant. Ninety-seven non-fulminant WD patients were treated with D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate at the time of diagnosis, and 5 with trientine and zinc sulfate. A total of 6 children were converted to trientine due to penicillamine adverse reactions (2 nephrotic syndrome, 2 impaired liver function, 1 Stevens-Johnson reaction, 1 allergic rash). Five patients underwent liver transplantation during follow-up. Seventy-six non-fulminant WD patients were followed for 5.0+/- 3.7 years (3 months-14 years). Five patients died during follow-up due to end-stage liver disease. Eighteen patients who did not comply with chelation therapy had poor results. Conclusion: Wilson's disease in children can occur in different forms and requires extensive research for diagnosis. Drug therapy is beneficial for stable or improved course of non-fulminant disease. Fulminant WD is nearly fatal without liver transplant.",,"Yuce, A.;Uslu, N.;Balamtekin, N.;Demir, H.;Saltik Temizel, I.;Baysoy, G.;Usta, Y.;H, O. zen;Gurakan, F.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000383075.98243.67,0,1,
1851,Re-evaluation of Wilson's disease diagnostic criteria in children with mild liver disease.,"Objective and Study: Wilson's disease (WD) is a difficult diagnosis, especially in children. Early diagnosis is desirable to prevent disease progression. The aim of our study is to reevaluate the conventional diagnostic criteria and Ferenci's diagnostic score (1) in children with WD with mild liver disease. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 43 consecutive children (28 males, age range: 1.1-20.9 years) with WD and 58 age- and sex-matched patients with liver disease other than WD. Both groups were asymptomatic with hypertransaminasemia as a common manifestation of liver disease. In all WD patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis and/or liver copper content. Results: ROC analysis for ceruloplasmin at a cutoff value of <20 mg/dl, sensitivity (95.4% CI, 84.5-99.4%) and specificity 84.4% (95% CI, 72.5-92%) ,6) showed. The optimal basal urinary copper diagnostic threshold was found to be >40 mcg/24 hours (sensitivity 78% [95% CI, 62.4–89.4%] and specificity 87.9% [95% CI, 76.7–95%]). Urinary copper had only 15.4% sensitivity after penicillamine loading. Liver copper .250 mcg/g dry weight had a sensitivity of 96.7% [95% CI, 82.8–99.9%] and a specificity of 95.8% [95% CI, 78.9–99.9%]. Ferenci's diagnostic score showed 93% positive and 91.6% negative predictive values, respectively. Conclusion: As recommended in recent AASLD guidelines, urinary copper excretion above 40 mcg/24 h instead of 100 mcg/24 h suggests WD (2). Instead, penicillamine challenge testing should not be performed in asymptomatic patients. Ferenci's diagnostic score shows good diagnostic accuracy. Diagnosis of WD requires multiple tests and a high index of suspicion (Table presented).",,"Ranucci, G.;Nicastro, E.;Vajro, P.;Vegnente, A.;Iorio, R.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.mpg.0000383075.98243.67,0,0,
1852,Extracorporeal liver support therapy,"ENTRANCE. Extracorporeal liver support therapy is in its infancy, but is valuable as a detoxification treatment option for patients with cirrhosis with rapid deterioration in liver function. We report the use of Prometheus, a novel extracorporeal liver support system that allows removal of protein-bound and water-soluble toxins by fractionated plasma separation and absorption (FPSA) in a patient with Wilson's disease (WD) who develops rapidly worsening liver function. METHODS. A 26-year-old female patient diagnosed with WD since 17 years of age was initially treated with penicillamine in an irregular pattern. Therapy was discontinued. Now, 2 years later, he developed acute decompensated liver failure with hepatic encephalopathy with MELD 29. Liver transplantation (LT) was the treatment option for this patient. However, in this case, the rapid and unfavorable development of liver failure with renal failure in our country and the unknown waiting time for emergency liver donor caused us to use Extracorporeal liver support therapy. RESULTS. After 5 hours and 30 minutes of treatment, we reduced bilirubin to less than half, increased urine output, and the next day the patient went to a stable liver transplant with improved kidney function. RESULTS. Acute liver failure due to WD is often fatal without emergency LT. This case report highlights the discontinuation of chelant therapy in a patient with WD. As the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy, LT was the only treatment option, but even if we cannot find a donor, we can use Extracorporeal liver support therapy as a very useful bridge for a short time. The results of two studies presented at the last EASL 2010 Congress showed that treatment with extracorporeal devices may not provide a survival advantage to patients with severe hepatic impairment despite positive dialysis effects. However, the results in a small subset of patients are promising, such as hepatorenal syndrome type 1 or severely ill patients with a MELD score above 30.",,"Marinho, A. D.;Pais, T.

1853,Is anesthesia management safe in spinal anesthesia in a pediatric patient with Wilson's disease-a case report,"Wilson's disease, characterized by cirrhosis, extrapyramidal symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, is a rare inherited disease of human copper metabolism. Wilson's Disease involves the loss of the ability to deliver copper from the liver to the bile and to incorporate copper into hepatic ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulation occurs in various organs and tissues, especially in the liver, brain, kidney and cornea. Clinical findings in Wilson's disease may develop tremor, dysarthria, rigid dystonia, seizures, psychiatric disorders, acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. A 6-year-old female patient was operated on for contracture of the hip joint. He was diagnosed with Wilsons disease at the age of 2.5 and was treated with zinc sulfate and D-penicillamine. Spinal anesthesia was applied with 0.5% bupivacaine at L3-L4 level. To provide spinal anesthesia, this patient was sedated with midazolam. No complications were encountered during the operation and in the postoperative period. We concluded that spinal anesthesia can be successfully administered to Wilson's patients and spinal anesthesia is preferred to general anesthesia since most of the anesthetic agents are metabolized by the liver and may increase hepatic toxicity. With close clinical and biochemical follow-up of the patients, it is possible to minimize the complication rates.",,"Pradeep Kumar, K.;Padmaja, K.;Subramanyam, G.;Muralidhar Rao, J.;Kishore, K.;Srinivas, P.;Jagadesh, G.",2010,September-October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0b013e3181f3582c,0,0,
1854,High plasma copper/zinc ratios in patients with schizophrenia,"Introduction: Copper and zinc are neuroactive substances that can be synaptically released during neuronal activity. These metals have been associated with diseases with neuropsychopathological components, including Alzheimer's disease, Menkes disease, Wilson's disease, Pick's disease, stroke, seizures, and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to examine plasma copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) levels in patients with schizophrenia and to compare Cu/Zn ratios with matched healthy subjects. Materials and methods: Forty schizophrenic patients (35 men and 5 women; mean age 32.77 years) and 50 (41 men and 9 women; mean age 31.44 years) healthy controls were recruited. Exclusion criteria included another concomitant psychiatric disorder, pregnancy and medical disorders, or drugs known to affect trace element metabolism. Fasting blood samples were taken from the antecubital vein between 07:00 and 09.00 hours. Plasma copper and zinc levels were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Two-tailed t-test was used to determine statistical differences. Differences were considered significant at the p<0.05 level. Results: The mean Cu or Zn levels and Cu/Zn ratios for each of the two groups are shown below: Cu (mug/dl) =65+/-3 or 145+/-28, control or patients, respectively, p<0.005 . Zn (cups/dl)=81+/-4 or 67+/-2, control or patient, respectively, p<0.05. Cu/Zn ratio=0.87+/-0.04 or 2.07+/-0.38, control or patients, respectively, p<0.05. Conclusion: Patients with schizophrenia had a significantly higher Cu/Zn ratio than healthy individuals. These results suggest that Cu and Zn may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",,"Mansouri, N.;Farzin, D.",2010,September,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03233.x,0,0,
1855,Gait disturbance in a patient with Wilson's disease 18 years after disease onset,"Objective: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that causes excessive copper accumulation in and outside the liver. A wide range of neurological symptoms, including dystonia, parkinsonian features, cerebellar and bulbar manifestations, are very common and can severely affect a patient's quality of life. Although gait disturbance is a very prominent neurological finding in Wilson's disease, the features of gait abnormalities have not been described in detail in the literature. We describe gait abnormalities in a patient with clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease for 18 years who has been treated with different anticopper agents since the first diagnosis in 1992. Methods: This 51-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Illness at age 33, after 2 years of history of severe tremor of arms and head, resulting in significant impairment in ability to work. The irritable and aggressive behavior was present at the onset of the disease and worsened in the first years after diagnosis. He reported marked improvement of symptoms after switching treatment from D-penicillamine to zinc sulfate in the late 1990s. Although D-penicillamine was restarted, this time as the gait disturbance persisted and the patient was attached to a gait frame to adequately overcome the gait disturbance. Recent urinalysis showed that copper was effectively eliminated under D-penicillamine. Results: On neurological examination, the patient revealed a complex gait disorder that included severe (gait-specific) dystonia, apraxia of gait, and freezing of gait (FOG), respectively. He used a simple cue to cure his gait disorder as he walked sideways along the wall. Otherwise, no significant impairment of leg motility or prominent dystonic features were observed in the sitting or lying position. In this patient, some frontal findings were positive, but no pyramidal findings. Conclusion: This is an illustrative case showing a specific pattern of gait abnormality with a combination of FOG and dystonia. While dystonia is well known in patients with Wilson's disease, FOG is unusual and may reflect involvement of different neuroanatomical structures beyond basal ganglia pathology.",,"Brugger, F.;Felbecker, A.;Kagi, G.;Hagele-Link, S.;Tettenborn, B.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5575-7,0,0,
1856,Insist on anti-copper therapy in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease is a genetically determined deficiency of copper metabolism. If left untreated, it usually leads to death several years after the development of clinical symptoms. Copper-consuming drugs should be continued throughout the patient's life after diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson's disease often discontinue treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate drug adherence (defined by us as persistence in treatment) among Wilson's disease patients prescribed different copper-inhibiting drugs and how this translates to clinical improvement and overall well-being. Methods: Our study is based on a retrospective analysis of information from self-filled questionnaires given to patients admitted to the Wilson's disease clinic. The following data were obtained from each patient: medication prescribed, duration of treatment, continued treatment, subjective assessment of health status. Visual analog scale of well-being (VAS) and EQ-5D questionnaire were also used. Results: Responses were obtained from 120 subjects, but only 104 questionnaires are available for further processing. Fifty-five percent of the patients were treated with d-penicillamine and the remainder were treated with zinc sulfate. The mean duration of treatment was 10.3 (SD +/- 4.4) years. Our analysis did not reveal differences in persistence or differences in efficacy of the above drugs with d-penicillamine or zinc sulfate treatment (75.0% versus 73.0%, respectively). However, we discovered that regardless of the drugs used, continued drug therapy resulted in significantly better self-assessment outcomes: ""total improvement"": 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the persistent and non-persistent group, p=0.003; ""partial recovery"": 53.8% versus 30.8%, p=0.045, respectively; ""deterioration"": 0.0% versus 42.3%, p<0.0001, respectively. Patients who continued on treatment achieved higher VAS scores than those who did not (76 vs. 67, p=0.05). Conclusion: Persistence in anti-copper therapy is a major factor affecting long-term clinical outcome in Wilson's disease.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Maselbas, W.;Chabik, G.;Czlonkowski, A.",2010,June,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-010-5575-7,0,1,
1857,Complex neuropsychiatric symptoms in adolescent Wilson's disease: The need for multidisciplinary care,"Objective: To describe a young adult case with Wilson's disease (WD), a severe neuropsychiatric disease that significantly impairs quality of life. Advocating early detection of these symptoms and multidisciplinary care. Background: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport and metabolism that affects 1 in 30,000 people. Children and young adults apply to pediatric services mainly because of hepatic dysfunction. A large proportion of these patients will have unrecognized and unreported comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our center has developed a multidisciplinary team for WD management. This is a case that highlights the importance of this approach. Methods: Description of case history, MR imaging, treatment process and clinical outcome. Results: A 19-year-old female patient with a 9-year history of genetically proven WD was treated with penicillamine in our multidisciplinary WD clinic. Despite stable liver disease on penicillamine, direct questioning revealed a significant two-year history of social anxiety and low mood. Paranoia was detected in the psychiatric evaluation. He had a slight tremor. Worsening depression led to his hospitalization for psychiatric symptoms, and antidepressant treatment with venlafaxine was started. During his inpatient treatment, Parkinsonism developed and levo-dopa was started. This has cured her movement disorder, but she remains in need of intense psychiatric support. A multidisciplinary WD team of hepatologists, neurologists and psychiatrists enabled the identification, appropriate diagnosis and prompt management of the patient's prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are not uncommon in children and young adults with WD. All clinicians who manage children or youth who present with liver disease and are diagnosed with WD should screen for neuropsychiatric symptoms at diagnosis and during ongoing management. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we are able to further identify previously undiagnosed comorbidities that require immediate intervention.",,"Hedderly, T.;Hinnell, C.;Moriarty, J.;Jarosz, J.;Hindley, P.;Dhawan, A.;Sherwood, R.;Samuel, M.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1858,A retrospective study of the characteristics of Wilson's disease in a North Indian tertiary care institute.,"Purpose: To examine the clinical profiles, laboratory findings, brain imaging and response to treatments of Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive systemic disorder of copper metabolism due to a defect in copper transport by hepatic lysosomes with secondary pathology resulting from copper overload in the liver, brain, kidney, and skeletal system. Methods: Wilson's disease cases were retrieved from hospital records from December 2004 to December 2009. A total of 32 cases were diagnosed. The study was performed to see clinical features, presence of CF ring, laboratory parameters, biochemical levels and brain imaging. Results: A total of 32 cases were diagnosed with Wilson's disease. 22 were male and 10 were female. 28 cases were younger than 15 years and 4 were adults. At the time of diagnosis, the youngest patient was 6.5 years old and the oldest patient was 32 years old. The mean duration of disease before diagnosis is 6 months in children (<15 years) and 2 years in adults (>15 years). The most common presentations were dystonia (90%), parkinsonism (82.5%) in children, both 73.4% and tremor 60%, while in adults the most common presentations were parkinsonism (75%), dystonia (50%) and tremor. 50% of adult patients. Sialorea was present in 60% of children and 25% of adult patients. There was unclear voice in 80% of the cases. Dysphagia was present in 44% of children and 25% of adult patients. There was no CF ring in 3 children. Brain CT was performed in all cases, the most common abnormality was bilateral symmetrical hyperlucency of the basal ganglia in 13 cases (40.6%). MRI brain was performed in 24 cases. 4 had normal MRI brains. Abnormalities were observed in 20 cases, the most common being basal ganglia (62.5%), thalamus in 45%, and brainstem hyperintensities in 31.5%. 4 patients were using zinc only and 28 patients were using both zinc and D-penicillamine. Of the 28 cases, 10 discontinued D-penicillamine (2 due to side effects and 8 due to unaffordability). All but one child have an excellent response to treatment. Conclusion: Wilson's disease was more common in children. Dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor, sialorrhea and unclear voice were the most common features. CF ring was present in 91% of cases. Bilateral symmetrical hyperintensities of the basal ganglia were the most common MRI abnormality. Zinc is the safest to start with.

1859,Successful treatment of Wilson's disease dystonia with botulinum toxin,"Objective: To present a case of WD dystonia successfully treated with botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections. Background: Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration or Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. Neurological manifestations mainly include akinetic-rigid and dystonic syndromes, tremor and ataxia. The disease, which was previously defined as a fatal neurological and hepatic familial disease, has different drug treatments today. However, the treatment of WD with neurological symptoms is currently a challenging issue. Methods: A 38-year-old female patient was diagnosed with WD in 1985. He was first treated with penicillamine, which was changed to trientine in 1988 for lupus-like syndrome. In 2007, he developed a progressive Parkinson's syndrome and dystonia that required ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and zinc therapy. He improved clinically, but due to permanent bilateral leg dystonia, we tried 1000 U BTA (Dysport) and botulinum toxin in the bilateral extensor hallucis longus, flexor hallucis brevis, abductor hallucis and abductor digiti quinti muscles under EMG guidance. Results: After two weeks, he noted a functional improvement that allowed comfortable wearing of the shoe and reduced symptoms, reduced spasm, reduced pain, and healing of contractures. Two additional injections of 500 U BTA were given at four-month intervals with good effect. No adverse events were reported. He is now neurologically stable. Conclusions: BTA injections into the affected muscles should be considered as a treatment option in the management of WD dystonia, which can be followed by significant functional improvement and reduction of systemic drugs. Significant improvement began in our patient 2 weeks after the injections and lasted for about 4 months.",,"De Fabregues, O.;Palasi, A.;Callen, A.;Hernandez-Vara, J.;Alvarez-Sabin, J.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1860,Treatment of Wilson's disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate: experience in 3 cases with neurological symptoms.,"Purpose: To report on our experience with TTMo at WD. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. The disease, which was previously defined as a fatal neurological and hepatic familial disease, has different drug treatments today. However, neurological deterioration and serious side effects have been reported with penicillamine and trientine, which necessitate the use of other drugs such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTMo). Methods: These 3 patients with WD with neurological impairment were treated with TTMo 120 mg/day for 8 weeks. All patients were clinically evaluated with the UWDRS neurologic subscale and VAS for WD, video, and neuroimaging before and 6 months after treatment. Drug side effects were evaluated with hematological and biochemical measurements and clinical follow-up. Conclusions: Different causes of TTMo therapy: neurological deterioration with penicillamine, intolerance to conventional therapy, and neurological presentation of WD. Efficacy: No patient had neurologic deterioration. All patients had clinical improvement with a mean reduction in UWDRS of 34 points (64% improvement) and a VAS of 14 points (47% improvement) for WD. It was well tolerated in 2 cases, 1 case took longer than 8 weeks of treatment, 1 case had elevated transaminases causing dose reduction and transient suppression. Enhanced neuroimaging in 2 cases. Subsequent clinical evolution: 2 moderate neurological sequelae and 1 mild case, 1 unrelated death. Conclusions: Treatment of WD with neurological symptoms is a challenging issue. There is interest in penicillamine and trientine as first-line treatment choices. TTMo is an effective therapeutic alternative that is well tolerated, although its contraindications need clarification.",,"De Fabregues, O.;Palasi, A.;Gamez, J.;Callen, A.;Hernandez-Vara, J.;Duero, M.;Auge, C.;Alvarez-Sabin, J.",2010,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.23162,0,0,
1861,"Copper metabolism and inherited copper transport disorders: Molecular mechanisms, screening and treatment.","In this review, we discuss genetic disorders involving altered copper metabolism specifically associated with Menkes disease (MD), occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and Wilson's disease (WD). The genes responsible for MD and WD are ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Both proteins encoded by these genes are responsible for the transport of copper from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus. However, the pathology of MD is completely different from that of WD, that is, MD is characterized by a copper deficiency while WD is caused by a toxic excess of copper. The reason for this difference is related to the specific cell types in which the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins are expressed. ATP7A is expressed in almost all cell types except hepatocytes, while ATP7B is mainly expressed in hepatocytes. MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of MD such as neurological disorders, connective tissue disorders and hair abnormalities can be explained by the abnormally low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard of care therapy for MD is parenteral administrations of copper-histidine. Neurological degeneration can be prevented in newborns when treatment is started before two months of age, but delayed treatment is much less effective. Also, copper-histidine treatment does not improve the symptoms of connective tissue disorders. Therefore, systems for mass screening of newborns for MD should be implemented. At the same time, new treatments targeting connective tissue disorders need to be developed. OHS is a milder form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. OSH patients are typically treated similarly to MD patients, although no formal trials have been conducted for OSH. WD is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. The liver and nervous systems are typically most severely affected. However, numerous other symptoms can also be observed, making early diagnosis difficult. Chelation agents and zinc are effective in the treatment of WD, but ineffective in patients with fulminant liver failure. Some patients with neurological diseases react poorly to chelating agents; Here again, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Screening newborns or infants for WD can lead to timely diagnosis and treatment. Patients with WD may be at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma despite treatment. Understanding the relationship between WD and hepatocellular carcinoma will provide clues to help prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with WD.

Objective To systematically evaluate the current treatment literature in newly admitted patients with a presymptomatic, hepatic or neurologic presentation of Wilson's disease. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases. Original studies of the clinical efficacy of d-penicillamine, trientine, tetrathiomolybdate, or zinc monotherapy as initial therapy in Wilson's disease are included. A descriptive analysis of relevant published data was performed. Results One randomized trial and 12 observational studies met inclusion criteria. These studies were highly heterogeneous and generally had low validity. However, based on available data, patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease are probably most effectively treated with d-penicillamine. For the treatment of presymptomatic and neurological patients, zinc appears to be preferred over d-penicillamine, as in these subgroups, the tolerance profile favoring zinc, but no significant difference in clinical efficacy was observed. Conclusions There is no high-quality evidence to predict the relative therapeutic effects of current drugs in Wilson's disease. Therefore, multicenter prospective randomized controlled comparative studies are needed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Wiggelinkhuizen, M.;Tilanus, M. E. C.;Bollen, C. W.;Houwen, R. H.

1868,Pregnancy and Wilson's disease. [Portuguese],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder with an affected gene (ATP7B) located on chromosome 13. It has been shown to affect copper transport leading to hepatic accumulation and deposition in other organs, particularly the brain, kidney, and cornea. The worldwide prevalence of Wilson's disease is around 30 per million. About 60-70% of all cases are diagnosed between the ages of 8 and 20. Clinically, the condition may present with hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease. Diagnosis is based on a high level of suspicion and a combination of both clinical and laboratory findings. The gold standard examination for diagnosing Wilson's disease is liver biopsy with determination of hepatic copper levels. Treatment is lifelong pharmacological therapy or liver transplantation. There are three drugs currently available, penicillamine and trientine (chelating agents), and zinc. Tetrathiomolybdate is another chelating agent currently under evaluation. With the increase in the effectiveness of these treatments, the reproductive ability of women with Wilson's disease has improved and therefore pregnancy is becoming more common. The course of the disease does not seem to be affected by pregnancy, but the question remains as to what is the most appropriate treatment during pregnancy, as the safety of these drugs during this period cannot be guaranteed.

1870,Fulminant and subfulminant hepatitis: causes and treatment. [French],"Fulminant hepatitis is an emergency because within a few hours the physician must find the cause of the hepatitis (unidentified in 15 to 20% of cases), rule out any contraindications for liver transplantation, confirm that it is indicated, and prevent and/or treat complications associated with liver failure. Viruses (especially hepatitis viruses A and B), drugs and toxic agents are the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis and their rates vary from country to country. Hepatitis viruses, which were the leading cause between 1995 and 1996, lagged behind drugs and especially paracetamol, which is now the leading cause of this disease in Europe and the United States. Other rarer causes exist: other viruses (eg, herpes virus HSV1 or 2, hepatitis virus E, parvovirus B19, and chickenpox-herpes zoster), Wilson's Disease, acute Budd-Chiari and Reyes syndromes, autoimmune hepatitis, neoplastic infiltrating liver, hypoxic hepatitis, heat stroke, acute pregnancy-associated steatosis and HELLP syndrome. The prognosis is mainly determined by the neurological status, but is also very quickly affected by damage to other organs. Liver transplantation has revolutionized the prognosis of fulminant hepatitis, increasing survival from 10-20% (all causes combined) to 75-80% at 1 year and 70% at 5 years. These patients can only be treated in specialized centers with access to liver transplantation and different modern methods of liver resuscitation (hypothermia, artificial liver support, albumin dialysis, monitoring of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion, etc.) - all from the onset of the disease .

1875,Genetics and Treatment of Dystonia,"Torsion dystonias encompass a large collection of etiological subtypes, which are usually divided into primary and secondary classes. Tremendous advances have been made in uncovering the genetic basis of dystonia, including the discovery of a gene in exon 5 of the DYT1 gene encoding TorsinA that causes early-onset primary torsion dystonia. Although the exact function of TorsinA is not understood, evidence suggests aberrant localization and interaction of the mutated protein; this can result in an abnormal response to stress or interference with cytoskeletal events and development of neuronal brain pathways. Breakthroughs include the discovery of a genetic modifier that protects against clinical expression in DYT1 dystonia, and the identification of the gene that causes DYT6, THAP1. The authors review genetic etiologies and discuss phenotypes, as well as counsel patients regarding disease prognosis and progression.

1878,Reduced expression of ATP7B affected by Wilson's disease-causing mutations is rescued by the pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is primarily caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7B, a protein localized in the trans-Golgi network that facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment involves reducing circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients have neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of ameliorating defects caused by some WD mutations by drug therapy aimed at improving protein folding and restoring protein function. This required systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of different WD-associated ATP7B missense mutations. Except for p.S1363F, all tested mutations (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V, and p.S1363F) resulted in decreased ATP7B protein expression, while reporter RNA abundance was unaffected. Retention of mutant ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression, and normalization of localization and homology modeling after culturing the cells at 30 degrees C indicated that these proteins were misfolded. Four different mutations exhibited residual copper export capacity, while other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression of most ATP7B mutants. Conclusion: These findings may enable new treatment strategies in WD by directly increasing the protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity.

1884,Copper compounds in anticancer strategies,"The chemical properties of copper allow it to be involved in many biological functions such as electron transfer, catalysis, and structural shaping. The ability to switch between +1 and +2 oxidation states is one of the traits utilized by organisms throughout the evolutionary process. Because copper is potentially toxic to cells, a precisely controlled mechanism has also evolved for processing copper. On the other hand, many copper complexes were synthesized and their anticancer activities were tested in vitro and in vivo. Their ability to kill cancer cells is primarily related to the induction of an oxidative stress, but their ability to inhibit the proteasome, a protein complex whose proteolytic activity is required by several cellular processes, has recently emerged. It has been generally described that the toxic effects of copper complexes lead to cell death through necrosis or activation of the apoptotic process. There is growing evidence about the ability of certain copper compounds to induce alternative non-apoptotic programmed cell death. Since copper is indispensable for the formation of new blood vessels, a different antitumor approach based on the application of angiogenesis, copper sequestering agents has been tried and its efficacy is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The proven necessity of copper for angiogenesis, together with the apparent sensitivity of several cancer cell lines to copper toxicity, opens up a new perspective in anticancer strategy: exploiting the tumor's need for copper to deposit toxic amounts of metal inside their cells.

Correlations with pre-treatment and post-treatment brain MRI,"Introduction: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on Wilson's disease (WD) show that there is no correlation between neurological and neuroimaging features. There are few reports of long-term follow-up with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different treatment modalities. Methods: Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent pretreatment and posttreatment brain MRI scans to assess the range of abnormalities and evolution over these different periods. All patients underwent at least two MRI scans at different intervals up to 11 years after treatment initiation. MRI findings were associated with clinical picture, clinical severity, duration of neurological symptoms, and two different drug treatments. Patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: d-penicillamine (DP), zinc (Zn), and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to DP. Results: Pretreatment MRI scans showed bilateral and symmetrical hypersignal density lesions in the basal nucleus, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and cerebral white matter in all patients on T2 and proton density-weighted images. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disorders, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea, and athetosis. Results: Neurologically, there was no evolutionary difference between the DP-only group and the Zn-treated group. Analysis of MRI scans at longer intervals after initiation of therapy revealed a trend for worsening neuroimaging without neurological correspondence in patients treated with Zn. The neuroimaging evolution model was more favorable for the DP-only group. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,"Leiros Da Costa, M. D. D.;Spitz, M.;Bacheschi, L. A.;Leite, C. C.;Lucato, L. T.;Barbosa, E.

1889,Carlecortemcel-l: Ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood cell graft for allogeneic transplantation,"Background: The success of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is mostly affected by the dose of cells infused and its application is limited by the size of the recipient. It is not possible to find a single UCB unit large enough for reliable vaccination for most adults and older children. One strategy for increasing the number of progenitor cells present is to expand the unit ex vivo. The main challenge of ex vivo expansion systems is how not to deplete the self-renewing cell population by directing them to differentiate into stable progenitors. Purpose: Copper modulates essential cell functions such as survival, proliferation and differentiation. Reduction of cellular copper under ex vivo culture conditions resulted in preferential proliferation of early progenitors and increased inoculation abilities. The result of a Phase I study of carlecortemcel-1, a product derived from ex vivo expansion of UCB progenitors in the presence of a copper chelator and early-acting cytokines, and the study design for the current pivotal study are presented. Methods: A literature review using PubMed and the manufacturer's investigative brochure. Conclusions: Early results suggest that carlecortemcel-1 infusion is safe and may be associated with favorable non-relapse mortality rates. A very important global study is currently underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this product from central production facilities. Â© 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

1891,Anti-copper treatments in Alzheimer's disease: New concepts,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The Last Metal Hypothesis states that the interaction of Amyloid beta (Abeta, the main component of senile plaques) with transition metals is at the root of AD neurodegeneration. This hypothesis is based on in vitro studies showing that metals (copper, zinc) accelerate aggregation and precipitation in Abeta plaques, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction and accelerated amyloidogenesis. Recently, we identified a specific marker of 'copper disease' in AD patients, termed 'free' copper, consisting of an increase in serum copper not dependent on ceruloplasmin. Several patents have been issued in recent years and many clinical trials have been undertaken to investigate an anti-metal effect that counteracts the progression of AD. Some have produced very encouraging results. However, these anti-metal agents have also shown adverse effects. This study aims to review 'old' and 'new' attitudes towards the use of anti-copper complexing agents or biological molecules that induce or maintain a copper malabsorption state, such as zinc compounds. 'old' clinical trials may pursue new ways of planning 'modern' ones. Â© 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Squitti, R.;Zito, G.",2009,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/157488909789104802,0,0,
1892,Pharmacological treatments for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia,"Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, mainly seen in neonates, can cause kernicterus and death. Conventional treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia consists of phototherapy and exchange transfusion. However, phototherapy has several known disadvantages and exchange transfusion is associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. These deleterious effects indicate the need to develop alternative pharmacological treatment strategies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. In general, these strategies aim to lower the plasma concentration of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) by inhibiting production, stimulating hepatic clearance, or interrupting the enterohepatic circulation of pigment. To be considered for routine clinical use, an alternative treatment strategy must be less invasive and at least as effective and safe as phototherapy. Various pharmacological treatments such as metalloporhirins, clofibrate, bile salts, laxatives and bilirubin oxidase may meet these criteria in the future, but none have been sufficiently evaluated to allow routine application. This review aims to discuss the latest status and future perspectives in the pharmacological treatment of neonatal jaundice. Â© 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Cuperus, F. J. C.;Hafkamp, A.

1893,Drug development for orphan diseases in the context of personalized medicine,"Orphan diseases are diseases that have fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States and are the limiting point for a drug to be profitable. Because there are thousands of orphan diseases in total (about 20 to 30 million Americans have orphan diseases), these patients are denied drug development rights by the pharmaceutical industry. Orphan drugs make up a large part of personalized medicine. Orphan diseases are often so rare that a doctor may only observe 1 case or less per year. Appropriate treatment is therefore a personalized encounter between doctor and patient. Academic physician-scientists have tried to fill this therapy gap by working to develop orphan drugs. However, there are many deterrents, including career deterrents, lack of funding and the multiple specializations required. Positive developments include the establishment of the National Rare Diseases Organization, the Orphan Drug Act, the development of a grant program to fund orphan drug development, the creation of the National Institutes of Rare Diseases Health, and orphan drug legislation in other countries. Progress has increased, but the 300 orphan drugs and devices approved over the past 25 years are still just a drop in the bucket compared to thousands of orphan diseases. I believe we should do better. I present 2 of my own examples of the pros and cons of orphan drug development, and I conclude this article by making suggestions on how we can succeed both in developing more orphan drugs and in saving the pharmaceutical industry from impending economic collapse.

1894,Metal chelators coupled with nanoparticles as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neuro-degenerative disease characterized by progressive and irreversible memory loss followed by complete dementia. Despite the high prevalence and great economic and social burden of the disease, no explanatory etiology or viable treatment is available. Great efforts have been made to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to develop more effective therapeutic agents. However, the existence of the blood-brain barrier, which limits the entry of many potential therapeutic agents into the brain, greatly hinders success. Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is one of the few valuable tools to overcome this hurdle, and its application as a potential AD treatment is promising. This review discusses current studies of nanoparticle delivery of chelating agents as possible therapeutics for AD because several metals are over-available in AD brain and may play a role in disease development. Specifically, a novel approach involving the transport of iron chelating agents into and out of the brain by nanoparticles was highlighted. This approach may provide a safer and more effective way to simultaneously reduce several toxic metals in the AD brain. It may also provide insight into the mechanisms of AD pathophysiology and may prove useful in the treatment of other iron-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Hallervorden-Spatz Syndrome. It is important to note that using nanoparticle-mediated transport to facilitate toxic excretion from diseased sites in the body could advance nanoparticle technology, which is currently focused on targeted drug delivery for disease prevention and treatment. The application of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in the treatment of AD is in the very early stages of its development and therefore further studies are warranted.

1897,Hypoglycemia and endocrine effects of inborn errors of metabolism in adults. [French],"Congenital errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare diseases that are mostly inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. They may be associated with endocrine dysfunction, most commonly carbohydrate metabolism disorders (hypoglycemia, diabetes). In a patient diagnosed in childhood, the endocrinologist may be directed to screen for these complications. In some rare cases, it should precede the diagnosis of an endocrine disorder, often associated with a multisystemic involvement. This range is new, in adulthood it is not yet very well known. The long-term consequences of IEM on fertility and bone metabolism are still poorly understood. The diagnostic orientation is based on several specific laboratory investigations including blood lactate, free fatty acids and 3-hydroxy-butyrate, ammonia, carnitine and acylcarnitines, amino acid and urine organic chromatography. Hyperinsulinism, glycogenosis, fatty acid s-oxidation, carnitine cycle and glycosylation (CDG syndrome) disorders, fructose intolerance, tyrosinemia, organic aciduria may explain hypoglycemia. This diagnosis should be considered in the face of unexplained adult hypoglycemia. Diabetes is associated with iron overload, mitochondriopathy, and thiamine-sensitive diabetes. The clinical spectrum of some forms of IEM transitions from hypoglycemia in childhood to diabetes in adulthood. Mitochondriopathies can be associated with all kinds of endocrine disorders, most commonly diabetes and dysthyroidism. Hypothyroidism is encountered in mitochondriopathies, cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria. Hypogonadism is almost constant in galactosemia, common in CDG syndromes, cystinosis, and iron overload.

1902,Chelation therapy for neurodegenerative diseases,"Increasing evidence indicates that transition biometals have a central role in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Indeed, when examining the molecular basis for this heterogeneous group of diseases, it has become increasingly clear that biometals and non-physiological Al are frequently involved in the initiation and progression of pathology, either by affecting the conformation of specific proteins or exacerbating local oxidative stress. The apparently critical role played by metal dyshomeostasis in ND makes chelation therapy an attractive pharmacological option. However, classical metal chelation approaches based on strong metal ligands have only been successful in the rare cases where extraordinary brain metal accumulation occurs due to certain defects in metal metabolism. In contrast, metal-targeted approaches using medium-strength ligands appear to be more appropriate in combating major ND, although their utility is still questioned. Here we report an investigation of the latest evidence supporting the use of various metal ligands and even functionalized nanoparticles for the treatment of the most common ND. The beneficial neuropharmacological effects of metal-targeting agents are most likely due to local metal redistribution rather than major metal removal.

1903,Long-term specific zinc monotherapy in symptomatic Wilson's disease: experience in 17 patients.,"Specific monotherapy with zinc in symptomatic Wilson's disease is controversial. Seventeen symptomatic patients with Wilson's disease were treated with zinc alone. The mean age at diagnosis and onset of treatment was 18 (range 13 to 26), and approximately half of them presented as adolescents. Presentation was hepatic only, neurological only, and combined in seven, five, and five patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 14 years (range 2-30). At baseline, of the 12 patients with liver disease, two had decompensated cirrhosis, five had compensated cirrhosis, and five had less severe disease. Both patients with decompensated cirrhosis were compensated after the initiation of treatment. Of the five patients with initial compensated cirrhosis, two progressed to the decompensated state and three remained stable. Three out of five patients with moderate or mild liver disease remained stable, while two improved. Except for decreased bilirubin levels, there were no significant changes in liver biochemistry or function during long-term follow-up. Nine out of 10 neurological patients improved markedly and one worsened. Only two patients with a neurological presentation developed liver disease during zinc therapy. Only two patients with hepatic presentation developed mild neurological symptoms. Based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion (213 +/- 38 vs. 91 +/- 23 +/- cups: P = 0.01) and serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper concentrations (11 +/- 2 vs 7 = 1 cup/ dL: P = 0.1) at the end of follow-up, the efficacy of decoppering was less in the hepatic-only group than in the neurological group. The predicted zinc dose and 24-hour urinary zinc excretion tended to be less in the hepatic-only group. Conclusion: The outcome of zinc therapy alone is generally good in cases of neurological disease. A less satisfactory outcome in liver disease may be related to less efficient copper removal.

1904,Analysis of multiple elements in the urine of patients with Wilson's disease during penicillamine therapy. [Chinese],"Purpose: To analyze the concentrations of 21 elements in the 24-hour urine of patients with Wilson's disease (WD) during penicillamine therapy. Methods: Forty patients with WD (WD group) treated with penicillamine and a hypo-copper diet were recruited, and 12 more healthy subjects were recruited as the control group. Concentrations of 21 elements of Cr, Fe, Co, Se, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Be, Al, V, Ni, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ti, Th, U, Ca and Mg in 24 hours urine, determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: For 7 essential trace elements (Cr, Fe, Co, Se, Mn, Cu, and Zn), the concentrations of Mn, Cu and Zn in the 24-hour urine of the WD group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 and P < 0.01). For the 12 non-essential trace elements (As, Be, Al, V, Ni, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ti, Th, and U), the As concentration in the 24-hour urine of the WD group was significantly higher than that of the control group. (P < 0.05). For the 2 macro elements (Ca and Mg), the Ca concentration in the 24-hour urine of the WD group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In patients with WD on penicillamine treatment and hypocopper diet, 24-hour urine Cu concentration increases and that of Mn, Zn, As and Ca changes.",,"Jiao, X. T.;Liu, X. Q.;Huang, L.

1905,Chiral toxicology: Same thing just different,"Although chiral substances share identical molecular formulas, atom-atom connections, and bond distances, they cannot be superimposed, such that they have a unique architecture. Therefore, in the environment of living systems where specific structure-activity relationships (e.g. enzymes, receptors, transporters and DNA) may be required for action, the physiochemical and biochemical properties of racemic mixtures and individual stereoisomers can differ considerably. In drug development, enantiomeric selection has yielded both success and failure to maximize clinical effects or reduce drug toxicity. Genetic polymorphisms that become more complex in drug regulation, stereoselective metabolism of chiral compounds may also affect pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity. Optically pure pharmaceuticals may undergo racemization in vivo, negating single enantiomer benefits or causing unexpected effects. Appropriate chiral antidotes should be selected to provide therapeutic benefit and minimize side effects. Enantiomers can have different carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. Environmental toxicology provides several examples where compound bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity show chiral dependence. In forensic toxicology, chiral analysis has been applied to illicit drug preparations and biological samples, with the potential to aid in determining cause of death and aid in the accurate interpretation of substance abuse and ""doping"" screenings.

1906,Dermatological manifestations in Wilson's disease,"Background: As no data on the skin and mucosal manifestations of patients with Wilson's disease have been published so far, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of mucosal and skin manifestations in childhood Wilson's disease and to identify the specific dermatological findings, if any. have any. Methods: 37 children aged 4-17 years with Wilson's disease were included. Full skin, scalp, mucous membranes and nails were examined. Results: Twenty-six (70.3%) of the children had at least one dermatological finding. Twenty-five (67.6%), five (13.5%) and nine (24.3%) had at least one skin, mucosal and nail finding, respectively. The most common dermatological diagnosis in Wilson's patients is xerosis (45.7%). The presence of dermatological findings was not associated with drug use, severity of the disease, or malnutrition. Disease duration was not different in patients with and without dermatological findings. However, the frequency of skin manifestations alone was high in relatively newly diagnosed patients (<2 years). Conclusion The dermatologist should be aware of the various dermatological manifestations of Wilson's disease, because a careful and objective examination of the skin, mucous membranes, nails and hair may be indicative of a diagnosis of Wilson's disease, especially in early cases.

1908,Wilson's disease: experience with 71 patients followed for twenty years at a Tertiary Center in Saudi Arabia,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare but treatable condition that often presents diagnostic dilemmas. Objectives: This study presents the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (a tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) over two decades of experience with patients with WD to demonstrate various patterns, treatments and outcomes. Patients and Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD; The mean+/-SD age at presentation was 16.8+/-10.7 (Range: 2-49) years; 40 (56.3%) were male; Those referred to our center were reviewed and analysed. Results: The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurologic and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 14 (19.7%) and 18 (25.4%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) of these were asymptomatic cases diagnosed by the family. scanning. WD was positive in the family in 41 (57.7%) patients, and there was consanguinity between the mother and father in 26 (36.6%) patients. Kayser Fleiser Ring (KFR) was absent, suspicious and present in 32 (45.1%), 3 (4.2%) and 36 (50.7%), respectively. CFR was positive in 10 (71.4%), 11 (28.2%) and 15 (83.3%) patients with neurological, liver and mixed conditions, respectively. The mean follow-up was 92.2+/-72.9 (range: 1-320) months. The mean age at the end of follow-up was 25.3+/-12 (Range: 4-62). Hepatoma was detected in 5 (7%) patients. Penicillamine treatment was given to 58 (81.7%) patients, zinc to 32 (45.1) patients, and zinc and trientine to 11 (15.5%) patients. Liver transplantation was performed in 16 (22.5%) patients. and one died on the waiting list (1.4%). Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow-up, 45 (63.4) and 16 (22.5%) were followed up or out of follow-up, respectively. Liver status remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%) of 32 patients with neurological involvement, and neurological status improved in 11 (34.4%). Results: This is the largest reported cohort from the Middle East. The WD presentation and the outcome of WD are very diverse. The diagnosis of WD still mainly depends on clinical, radiological and laboratory evidence of abnormal copper metabolism.

1909,Long-term specific zinc monotherapy in symptomatic Wilson's disease: experience in 17 patients.,"Although zinc inhibits intestinal copper absorption in Wilson's disease, its use as specific therapy is controversial, especially in symptomatic patients. We treated 17 symptomatic Wilson patients with zinc alone. Presentation was specific hepatic, specific neurologic and combined at 7, 5, and 5 points. Median follow-up was 14 years (range 2-30). Liver disease was classified as follows: decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B/C), compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), moderate (abnormal liver biochemistry and radiology, no cirrhosis), or minor (abnormal liver biochemistry only). The mean elemental zinc dose was 147 +/- 12 mg/day at baseline (range 67-270) and 199 +/- 20 mg/day (90 - 360) at follow-up (P=0.03), with no differences across the range. presentation modes. Side effects were rare except for gastrointestinal complaints. Reversible agranulocytosis was observed in one patient using concomitant anti-epileptic drugs. Of 12 patients with liver disease at baseline, 2 had decompensated cirrhosis at baseline and both were compensated after zinc initiation. Two of the 5 patients with initial compensated cirrhosis progressed to the decompensated state after 16 resp. 18 years and 3 remain constant. Three out of 5 patients with moderate or mild liver disease remain stable and 2 recover. Two out of 5 patients with a specific neurological presentation at baseline developed moderate liver disease. Compensated cirrhosis after 4 breaths. 5 years of treatment. In the hepatic group, no significant changes in liver biochemistry or function occurred, except for improved bilirubin levels. In the neurological group, neurological symptoms improved markedly in 9 of 10 patients and worsened in 1 patient. MRI brain improved in 4 cases, remained stable in 4 cases, and worsened in 2 cases. Elevated serum free copper levels returned to normal (<0.15 mg/L) within one year of zinc in 15/17 patients, with no difference between hepatic or neurological patients. In contrast, adequate 24-hour urinary copper excretion was achieved more frequently in neurological patients than hepatic patients (<100 µg/24 hours at the end of follow-up in 5/5 specific neurologic patients, 2/5 patients with combined presentation, but only 1/ 7 points with specific hepatic presentation ). 24-hour urinary copper excretion (mean +/-SEM) 494+/-167 at baseline versus 1149+/-798 (median 390 vs. 405) in neurological and special hepatic patients, then 157+/-29 vs. It was 256+/-46. At 1 year and 100+/-25 vs 225+/- 37 cups/24 hours (P<0.01) follow-up. Results: The outcome of specific zinc therapy in the case of neurological disease is generally satisfactory.

1910,The role of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and copper in cancer: impact on the COX-2 pathway,"Introduction and Aim: Copper is a trace element that has been associated with cancer for several years; however, its precise role in cancer is still controversial. Ammonium Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a drug developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease and is currently being studied as it has been shown to have a significant effect on cancer. So far, due to clinical studies and animal models, TM is known to regulate VEGF, IL-1alpha, and IL-8, but little has been done in Vitro to elucidate its effects and mechanism(s) of action. In this study, we determined the effects of TM and copper on the known cancer-associated Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway. Methods: Gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN45 and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma TTn; In this study, cancer types corresponding to the two main causes of cancer-related deaths in the world were used. These cells were treated with TM and copper by evaluating their viability and chemo-sensitivity by the non-radioactive MTS/PMS method. COX-2 mRNA expression was evaluated by RT and Real Time PCR and protein expression was evaluated by Western Blot. PGE2 was assessed by ELISA. Results and Discussion: Increasing copper concentrations decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, which translated as stress and ultimately toxicity for cells. Concomitantly, there was an increase in the COX-2 pathway, determined by an increase of COX-2 mRNA (up to 4.5-fold) and protein (up to 2.5-fold), followed by an increase of PGE<inf>2</inf>. We show for the first time that high concentrations of TM cause no toxicity on cell lines different from breast cancer. Moreover, TM significantly reduced the COX-2 pathway in TTn. Despite the opposite effects of copper and TM on COX-2, treatment with both showed higher upregulation of COX-2 than copper-induced regulation alone. Conclusions: Excess copper (as well as the need for angiogenesis) may have a role in cancer because it causes stress and toxicity and regulates the COX-2 pathway. Here we explain that TM is non-toxic in Vitro as previously described in In Vivo. TM can downregulate the COX-2 pathway under usual cell culture conditions; however, TM failed to reduce COX-2 upregulation caused by excess copper. This leads us to believe that a) TM may be useful in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal cancers, b) TM has a different biochemical mechanism than simple copper chelation, and c) this mechanism is likely inhibited by excess copper binding to TM, rendering it unusable. and renders it biologically inactive.",,"Sanchez-Siles, A.

1911,Comparative study of morning urine copper-zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children.,"Introduction and Aims: Although 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, accurate and timely collection poses practical difficulties. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic value of morning urine copper/zinc (Copper/Zinc) ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion in children with Wilson's disease (WD). Methods: From July 2005 to June 2007, morning urine and 24-hour urine were collected from 96 patients hospitalized to investigate liver disease at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Each patient was reassessed according to the WD Scoring system and assigned to one of three groups with suspected WD and WD without WD. Thus, 24, 6 and 64 cases were assigned to each group, respectively. Urine copper and zinc concentration were determined simultaneously using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: There was a good correlation between morning urine copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (r=0.758, P<0.001). The morning urine copper/zinc ratio was significantly higher in the WD group than in the non-WD group (median 0.370 vs. 0.051, Z-value -6.502, P= 0.00), as well as 24-hour copper excretion (median 87.1). vs 24.2, Z-value -6.208, P= 0.000). The area under the ROC curve is comparable between morning urine copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (0.953 vs 0.934). The sensitivity and specificity of the morning urine copper/zinc ratio was 86.4% and 92.2%, using a cut-off value of 0.17; With a cut-off value of 50.8ug, the sensitivity and specificity of 24-hour copper excretion were 90.9% and 93.7%, respectively.

1912,Comparison of urinary copper/zinc ratio with 24-hour urinary copper excretion for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children: A prospective study.,"Background: While 24-hour urinary copper excretion is valuable for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD), accurate, timed collection poses practical difficulties. In a preliminary study, we found that the morning urine copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) ratio was a promising substitution parameter. This study aims to compare the diagnostic value for WD with 24-hour urinary copper excretion in children presenting with hepatic findings. Methods: From July 2005 to June 2007, 24-hour urine and morning urine samples were obtained from consecutive liver patients admitted to our unit. Each patient was independently scored by two pediatricians using the WD scoring system, which includes clinical data and routine laboratory results. The ATP7B gene was sequenced in patients with acute liver failure or with a WH score of 2 to 3, and therefore each child was divided into either the WD or non-WD group. Copper and zinc concentration were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer by a technician without clinical diagnostic knowledge. SPSS was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 94 patients, including 26 WD cases and 68 non-WD cases, whose morning urine specimens and 24-hour urine specimens were accurately collected, were recorded. 14 were grouped by combining clinical data and genetic study. There was a good correlation between morning urine Cu/Zn ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (r=0.758, P=0.000). Morning urine Cu/Zn ratio in the WD group (median 0.37, range 0.07-12.74) compared to the non-WD group (median 0.05, range 0.01-1.23, Z=-6.502, P=0.000); 24-hour Cu/Zn ratio (WD group, median 0.39, range 0.04-10.7; non-WD group, median 0.06, range 0.00-0.45; Z=-6.020, P=0.000) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion (WD group) it was. , median 87.1ug, range 18.3-1180.5ug; non-WD group, median 24.2ug, range 1.4-357.9ug; Z=-6.208, P=0.000). There was no significant difference in 24-hour zinc excretion between the two groups (WD group, median 399ug, range 17-1641ug; non-WD group, median 359ug, range 6.4-7287ug; Z=-2.100, P=0.834). Area under the ROC curve was comparable between morning urine Cu/Zn ratio, 24-hour urinary Cu/Zn ratio, and 24-hour copper excretion, with median and 95% CI 0.953 (0.909-0.998), 0.977 (0.834-0.897), and 0.934 (0.867- 1,000) respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the morning urine Cu/Zn ratio were 90.9%, 79.7%, 62.9%, and 96.2%, and 81.8%, 95.3%, 87%, and 93.8%, with a cutoff value of 0.1. with a deduction of 0.2, respectively.

Methods: Morning urine and 24-hour urine were collected from 96 patients over the age of three admitted to a tertiary pediatric liver service. Each patient was reassessed according to the WD Scoring system and assigned to one of three groups: WD, suspected WD, and non-WD. 24, 6, and 64 suspected cases of WD and non-WD, respectively, were assigned to WD. Urine copper and zinc concentration were determined simultaneously using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer. Results: Morning urine copper/zinc ratio and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were well correlated (r=0.758, P < 0.001). The medians of morning urine copper/zinc ratio, 24-hour urine copper/zinc ratio, 24-hour copper excretion, and 24-hour zinc urinary excretion were 0.370, 0.394, 87.1, and 398.7 in the WD group, and 0.051, 0.061, 24.2, and 358.9 in those without.

1914,Re-evaluation of diagnostic criteria for Wilson's disease in a cohort of predominantly asymptomatic children.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a challenging diagnosis, especially in children. A prompt diagnosis is necessary to prevent disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the traditional diagnostic criteria and Ferenci diagnostic score [1] in children with WD. Patients and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 43 children with WD (28 boys, median age 6.1 years, range 1.1-20.9) and 58 children with liver disease other than WD (36 boys, median age 7.1 years, range 2-16). Thirty-five (81%) children with WD were asymptomatic (30 with isolated hypertransaminasemia, 5 detected by family screening). Cupruria was assessed before (basal cupruria [BCu]) and after (penicillamine challenge test cupruria [PCTCu]) penicillamine 500 mg orally every 12 hours x 2 . Results: Ceruloplasmin, BCu and PCTCu differed significantly between WD and controls (P<0.0001, P<0.0001 and P<0.03, respectively). ROC analysis for ceruloplasmin at a cut-off value of <=20 mg/dl, sensitivity of 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.5-99.4%), and specificity 84.4% (95% CI, 72%, 5-92,6) showed. With a cutoff value of <=10mg/dl, sensitivity and specificity were 65.9% (95% CI, 50-79.5%) and 96.5% (95% CI, 88-99.6%), respectively. The BCu threshold of >=100 cups/24 hours showed 65.8% sensitivity (95% CI, 49.4-79.9%) and specificity 98.2% (95% CI, 90.7-99.9%), whereas >=40 cups/24 hours sensitivity % 78 (95% CI, 62.4-89.4%) and specificity was 87.9% (95% CI, 76.7-95%). The ROC area for PCTCu was not significant (AUC 0.63, P=0.051), and in our cohort this test showed only 15.4% (95% CI, 4.3-34.8%) sensitivity and 94.8% (95% CI, 85.6-) specificity. 98.9%). Finally, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Ferenci score [1]: sensitivity 96.7% (95% CI, 83.3-99.9%) and specificity 93.3% (95% CI, 77.9%) at the recommended score of >=4. -99.1). %), with an ROC area of 0.95%, P<0.0001. Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of ceruloplasmin and BCu, considered as single tests, was high in a cohort of predominantly asymptomatic children with WD. We observed optimal sensitivity and specificity for BCu with a cut-off value of >=40 cups/24 hours as recommended. according to the latest guidelines.

Direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative and lysed red cells were found in the peripheral blood film. He was treated with transfusion. When admitted to our institute, the girl showed moderate hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia confirmed: coagulation screening, PT ratio 1.63 (0.84-1.16) and PTT ratio 1.44 (0.80-1.21), as well as decreased coagulation factors (II, V, VII, X) ) and showed antithrombin consistent with liver disease. Infectious diseases were excluded and autoimmunity tests were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed increased liver volume with inhomogeneous echo structure. Cupraemia 107 cups/dL (85-165), ceruloplasmin 9.2 mg (18-70) and Kayser-Fleischer ring at 360 degrees were present. Suspicion of WH was confirmed by Ferenci's diagnostic scoring system [1], suggesting WD with a high probability of 5 points. Liver biopsy was not performed due to coagulation values. The patient was treated with zinc acetate (25 mg 3 times a day). In the follow-up after 11 months, clinical and laboratory data improved (PT 80%; PTT 34 sec (23-38), INR 1.16, ATIII 94.4% (80-120)). Genetic analysis was planned for the mutation in ATP7B. Most experience at Wilson is that the treatment of disease in symptomatic patients comes from the use of chelating drugs. In contrast, one theory that is gaining ground maintains that the pathogenesis of Wilson's disease is related to free copper in plasma rather than accumulation of the element in body tissues. The goal of treatment is to normalize the concentration of free copper in the blood. Zinc inhibits copper absorption by inducing the production of metallothionein, which binds selectively to copper in intestinal mucosal cells.

1916,Zinc versus d-penicillamine therapy in children with Wilson's disease and liver presentation,"Background: Zinc-based drugs appear to be as effective as d-penicillamine in the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease, but there are very limited data on their effectiveness in patients with hepatic symptoms. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of zinc and d-penicillamine treatment in a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with Wilson's disease and liver presentation. Material and Methods: We analyzed 27 children with Wilson's disease before and after one year of treatment (14 patients, aged 11.7+/- 3.3 years and 13 patients receiving zinc and 13.4+/- 3 years of age with d-penicillamine). 13 patients with 2). treatment was not changed during the observation period. Wilson's disease, Ferenci et al. scoring system and mutation analysis review. Patients with acute and fulminant hepatic failure were not included in this study. Results: Pretreatment ALT levels were slightly lower in zinc patients than in penicillamine patients (197+/-120 IU/L versus 114+/-105 IU/L, mean +/-SD). We did not find any differences in AST, INR, and GGTP between groups at baseline. After one year of treatment, there was no difference in ALT levels between the zinc and penicillamine groups (56+/-22 IU/L and 50+/-18 IU/L, respectively), but the decrease in ALT was significant (p<0.05). ) in zinc patients, not penicillamine patients. AST activity was significantly decreased in both groups. Conclusions: Penicillamine causes a greater reduction in ALT than zinc therapy and may therefore be more effective in children with Wilson's disease and liver presentation.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Schmidt, H.;Houwen, R.;Socha, P.",2009,June,,0,1,
1917,Diagnosis and management issues in copper deficiency-associated myeloneuropathy,"Background: Copper deficiency is a rare but underrecognized cause of myelopolyneuropathy. We present a case with B<inf>12</inf> deficiency and discuss the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Case Report: A 59-year-old male patient presented with a 14-month history of progressive sensory ataxia and spastic paraparesis. Initial blood tests showed low B<inf>12</inf>/folate. Ataxia progressed despite monthly intramuscular replacement therapy. Further investigations confirmed hypocupraemia and low ceruloplasmin with normal serum zinc. MRI brain showed only minor ischemia. MRI spine was normal. Neurophysiology showed axonal sensori-motor polyneuropathy. Imaging, normal non-invasive liver studies, normal 24-hour urine copper, and absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings excluded Wilson's disease. Treatment with oral copper picolinate does not result in any significant clinical change. The cause of copper deficiency has not been explained. Discussion: The largest series (13 patients) on this subject describe typical clinical features and in these cases, copper replacement stopped clinical deterioration. It is important to exclude Wilson's disease, which may show similar serum copper measurements. Since zinc inhibits copper absorption, supplementation with a zinc-free preparation should be made. Even in the presence of low B<inf>12</inf>, copper deficiency should be considered in patients presenting with myeloneuropathy. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent neurological deterioration.",,"Chowdhury, F. A.;Sherwood, R.;Moran, N.;Dhawan, A.;Samuel, M.",2009,April,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2008.167387,0,0,
1918,Childhood and adolescence obesity and Wilson's disease,"Introduction and Aim: Childhood and adolescence obesity commonly causes elevated transferases and hepatic steatosis and is thought to be associated with elevated acute phase proteins. However, steatosis is also found in several metabolic diseases in childhood, including Wilson's disease. An algorithm would be valuable for a detailed differential diagnosis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from 291 obese (body mass index higher than 97%) children and adolescents admitted to liver or obesity outpatient clinics in the last 6 years (2003-2008). Standard anthropometric and laboratory parameters, virology, haptoglobin, alpha-1-antitrypsin and serum ceruloplasmin were analyzed. Penicillamine challenge tests were performed in 22 patients and 14 liver biopsies in patients with elevated transferases despite a weight reduction trial (except in emergencies). Genetic analysis and slit lamp examination were performed. Results: 41 (14.08%) patients had elevated transferase levels. The mean ceruloplasmin (normal range 0.220-0.605 g/L) was 0.263 g/L (0.139 - 0.388 g/L); 9/41 (22%) subjects had values below the reference range. 1-4 in 22 patients. A penicillamine challenge test was performed with mean values of 19mug, 698mug, 802mug and 819mug on days. 13 children had values in the midrange between 800-1590 mg, and 2 tests had values above 1590 mg. Liver histology revealed steatosis in 8 patients, steatohepatitis in 1 patient, fibrous changes in 4 patients, and cirrhosis in 2 patients, respectively. Following a multistage approach, we discovered 2 cases of Wilson's disease in this group. In addition, 3 asymptomatic homozygous relatives with Wilson's disease and 4 heterozygous carriers were discovered. Recognizing the problems in diagnosing Wilson's disease, we present an algorithm to systematically search for disease in obese children with elevated liver enzymes. Contrary to the available pediatric literature, we cannot confirm the observation of elevation of acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin and alpha-1-antitrypsin) in obese children and adolescents. Conclusions: Currently, there are insufficient data to estimate the incidence of Wilson's disease in obese children with liver disease. Our data indicate a higher incidence than currently estimated. All children or adolescents with liver disease should be extensively investigated for Wilson's disease. Early diagnosis should aim to provide early treatment before irreversible organic damage develops.",,"Spindelbock, W.;Spindelboeck, W.;Deutschmann, A.;Lackner, K.;Weitzer, C.;Erwa, W.;Hauer, A.;Ferenci, P.;Deutsch, J.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1919,Evaluation of the efficacy of D-penicillamine treatment in children with Wilson's disease,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of long-term D-penicillamine therapy in children with Wilson's disease. Methods: We studied 53 children aged 6 to 17 years (mean age 12 years) with Wilson's disease. Male 25 (47%), female 28 (53%). Hepatic form was found in 41 (77%) children, and mixed form was found in 12 (27%) children. All children were treated with D-penicillamine, the mean dose was 17.87 mg/kg/day. We evaluated changes in liver size, serum transaminase level (ALT, AST), and urinary copper excretion during long-term treatment with D-penicillamine (cuprenil). Results: Before starting treatment, liver size increased in 21 (39.6%) children (0.5-2 cm from the costal arch), 3 (14%) children with mixed Wilson's disease. During treatment, liver size decreased in all children, and liver size returned to normal in 15 (28%) children. The mean serum ALT level before the start of treatment ranged from 112.8 UI/L (normal 5-40), 44 UI/L at 6 months of treatment, and ranged from a minimum (23.7 UI/L) to a maximum (76.6 UI/L) over the next 5 years. /L), the mean level was 44.8 UI/L. The mean serum AST level before the start of treatment was 79.74 UI/L (normal 5-42), 42.14 UI/L at 6 months, and 31 UI/L at 5 years. In the D-penicillamine challenge test, urinary copper excretion prior to initiation of therapy was 286 ug/day (normal to 50 ug/day), 1961 mg/day (normal 600-800). At 6 months of treatment, this level was 971.5mug/day, 965mug/day at 1 year, 685.4mg/day at 2 years, and 524mug/day at 5 years. Thus, the mean level of urinary copper excretion at one year fell to the upper limit of the norm and remained no higher than 700mug/day during the 5-year observation period thereafter. Results: Positive changes were noted in all children during treatment with D-penicillamine (cuprenil): liver size decreased; serum transaminase levels and urinary copper excretion were decreased.",,"Zubovich, A.;Strokova, T.;Kaganov, B.;Pavlovskaya, E.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1920,EuroWilson: First European prospective study of Wilson's disease,"Objectives and Methods: To establish a European database of Wilson's disease and to evaluate the feasibility of pediatric clinical trials. Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2005 and November 30, 2008 were entered using a secure Web-based protocol. A previously validated score was used to confirm diagnoses. Results: 353 cases (176 women) aged 0.25-56.1 (mean 20.4, median 17.6) years were recruited from 321 families. The apparent incidence (in cases/million population/35 months) was higher in central Europe (eg, Poland 2.78, Austria 2.53) than in the west (eg, France 0.56, UK 0.48, Spain 0.32). Patients homozygous for the common mutation H1069Q were older (27.8+/-12.2 years, n = 65) (19.3+/-12.5 years). Patients <18 years (N = 181, females = 88) had a more homogeneous geographic spread. Country-to-country differences in the percentage of pediatric cases likely indicate that adult case detection is variable, eg Poland 18%, UK 86%. 2 non-EU countries, Turkey and India, contributed to 27 and 16 pediatric cases, respectively. The mean (median) BMI SDS was 1.8 (2.06) in 81 subjects whose height was measured. The median diagnostic score was 6 (range 4-10); KFrings were available at 50; ceruloplasmin was measured in 172 and >0.18 g/L in 34; Urine copper was measured in 161 and penicillamine loading in 66; 105 had a liver biopsy, but only 78 had a liver copper assay, of which 11 had results <250 µg/g; In 82, 2 mutations were identified, of which 26 were homozygous (9 for H1069Q). The severity of liver disease was variable: 5% had hepatic encephalopathy, 32% had severe and 18% mild liver disease, 38% had abnormal LFT and only 7% had no hepatic abnormality. Neurological abnormalities were present in 21% and were severe in 5%, and there was no correlation with the severity of liver disease. There was a wide variety of initial treatments and doses. Results: This first prospective study of WD shows: (1) higher incidence in Eastern Europe; (2) diagnosis is difficult due to the lack of sensitivity in each diagnostic parameter and the selective use of tests, but is supported by a scoring system; (3) relatively high BMI SDS at diagnosis; (4) wide phenotypic and genotypic variation; (5) Hepatic failure is rare in patients younger than 18 years, but 93% of cases have some liver abnormalities and 21% have some neurological abnormalities; (6) It will be necessary to include cases from non-EU countries to establish pediatric RCTs.",,"Tanner, S.;Dhawan, A.;Socha, P.;Loudianos, G.;Lszl, S.;Parker, S.;Vegnente, A.;Houwen, R.;Sarles, J.;Deutsch, J.",2009,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181aa06ea,0,0,
1921,Successful treatment of fulminant Wilson's disease with plasma exchange,"Background: Treatment of fulminant Wilson's diseases still carries a high mortality rate without liver transplant. There is no acceptable treatment other than liver transplant. Few case reports have successfully treated fulminant Wilsons disease by plasma exchange. Case Report: Here, we present a case of a 14-year-old boy admitted to our hospital with fulminant Wilson's disease, including low AST and AlT and Alkaline phosphatase, high bilirubin 38 mg/dl, INR 3.1, creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, grade. Hematological picture consistent with II hepatic encephalopathy, mild ascites, positive Kayser Fleischer ring, low ceruloplasmin, high serum copper, and hemolysis. In addition to conservative treatment, she was treated with 5 sessions of plasma exchange with improvised synthetic function, and at the end of the last plasma exchange session, she was removed from the liver transplant list and treatment for Wilson's disease was started. He has improved markedly over the past year and has become asymptomatic with an almost normal synthetic function. Now it's just D-Penicillamine and Zinc. Conclusion: Successful treatment of WD with plasma exchange and other supportive measures has been described. This case is another example. This may be due to the removal of excess copper as the crucial defective agent rather than the removal of other agents as this treatment has not been successful in other etiologies of FHF.",,"Jarrad, A.;Hammoudi, S.;Saed, R.;Obed, A.;Al Bashir, A.",2009,July,,0,0,
1922,"Wilson's disease in children; Six years of experience, 2001-2008","Objectives: To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children with Wilson's Disease admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children, a large tertiary pediatric center. Methods: Patients diagnosed with Wilson's Disease between 2001 and 2008 were identified from clinical databases and a retrospective chart review was performed. Results: Eleven patients with a mean age of admission 12 (7-17 years) were identified. Nine of 11 patients had a hepatic presentation such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, pale stools, or hematemesis. Three of these patients had overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from encephalopathy to paresthesia. Five of the nine patients presenting with liver decompensation exhibited Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia. Eighteen percent (2/11) presented with isolated neurological complaints (developmental delay and ataxia in one, paraesthesia in the other). These children presented at a younger age (mean 7 years) compared to the group average of 12 years. Five of the 11 children (45%) presented Kaiser Fleischer rings. Only one case had a positive family history of Wilson's Disease; There was a history of consanguinity in this family. Family screening revealed that two separate children were asymptomatic carriers. The mean (range) laboratory values at presentation were as follows: ceruloplasmin 115 mg/L (27 - 253 mg/l), 24-hour urinary copper excretion 13.7 µmol (0.290-60.5), INR 1.9 (0.9) -4.3), total bilirubin 85 (4-361), albumin 29 (23-48), AST 238 (44-1083), alkaline phosphatase 251 (20-824), WBC 10.7 (3.7-25.2), hemoglobin 101 g/l (54-134) ) and platelets 205 (88-460). The new Wilson Disease severity index was calculated for each patient and ranged from 3 to 16 (on a possible scale of 0 to 20). One in three patients who scored 11 or above and were therefore predicted to require a liver transplant improved with medical treatment. Children were treated with a combination of chelating agents, including penicillamine, trientine, and/or zinc. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at a mean of 2.5 years (0.14-5.8) after diagnosis. None of the children died. Three patients underwent liver transplantation (two immediately after diagnosis and one patient five years later). A recently diagnosed patient is currently awaiting a transplant. Despite chelation therapy, neuropsychiatric symptoms developed in two patients. Conclusions: Children with Wilson's Disease show a variety of clinical manifestations, are more likely to respond to chelation therapy, and sometimes require liver transplantation. The new Wilson's Disease index should be used with caution as it does not reliably indicate the need for transplantation.",,"Avinashi, V.;Ling, S.",2009,,,0,1,

These side effects developed within one to six months after penicillamine was started. Withdrawal of penicillamine therapy and initiation of treatment with Trientene resulted in improvement of neuropsychiatric features and improvement of status dystonicus features as well as resolution of thrombocytopenia. We would like to recommend that patients with Wilson's disease be followed closely to investigate these side effects once initiation of penicillamine therapy, and suggest that possibly trientene will be a safer alternative and possibly even better service to penicillamine therapy in a subset of Wilson's disease patients. as initial therapy.",,"Viswanathan, S.;Puvanarajah, S.

1924,"Clinical presentation, diagnosis and long-term outcomes of 35 patients with Wilson's disease","Objective: Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive disease. Subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver, brain and other tissues produces clinical manifestations of hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological and other disorders. We describe the clinical features, management, and follow-up of a cohort of 35 patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: We reviewed the medical records and brain imaging of 35 patients with Wilson's disease followed at the Tunisian National Institute of Neurology. Diagnosis of the disease was based on the presence of abnormal biochemical tests: increased urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels. Results: The median age of onset was 18.9 (range 4-56). The observation period was up to 7.5 years. The most common symptoms at presentation were tremor (42.8%), dysarthria (22.8%) and behavioral disorders (17.1%). Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 45.7% of them. Cerebral imaging was abnormal in 62.5% of patients. Signal abnormalities in brain gray matter and brain atrophy were observed in 25%. One patient had severe subcortical white matter abnormalities that are unusual features in Wilson's disease. The patient's clinical symptoms remained stable with D-penicillamine or improved during the observation period in 65.7% of cases, and worsened in 6 of 35 patients. Conclusion: Diagnosis of Wilson's disease can be difficult in the absence of typical symptoms and in asymptomatic siblings. D-penicillamine is a safe and effective long-term treatment for patients with Wilson's disease. If treatment is started early enough, a normal quality of life can be expected.",,"Ellini, S.;Ammar, N.;Larnaout, A.;Hentati, F.;Zouari, M.",2009,October,,0,0,
1925,Essential tremor? Wilson's disease?,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism associated with degenerative changes in the basal ganglia. The Wilson disease gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 and encodes the copper-bearing P-type ATPase expressed in the liver and kidney. Clinical symptoms include tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders, etc. Neurological symptoms such as predominant liver disease or complicated by mixed forms. Neurological abnormalities are seen in 40-50% of patients, and resting or postural tremor is the first clinical finding in half of them. Case report: She had used misolin and propranolol for ineffective tremor in her hands who had tremors for ten years. His father and uncle had a family history of essential tremor. Physical examination was normal except for postural tremor. Her mental status and school performance were normal. Although there was no family history of Wilson's disease, plasma ceruloplasmin level was low (16 mg/dl), and urinary copper level was high (62 micrograms) in 24-hour urine collection. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral hyperintense lesions in the globus pallidus and putamen on T2-weighted images. He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and began treatment with a diet high in penicillamine, zinc, B vitamins, and low copper.

1926,"Liver cirrhosis, dystonia, polycythemia and hypermanganesemia - A new metabolic disorder","We present a novel set of clinical features in a 12-year-old girl born to consanguineous parents, consisting of hypermanganeseemia, cirrhosis of the liver, extrapyramidal motor impairment, and polycythemia. Blood manganese levels were >3000 nmol/L (normal range <320 nmol/L), and MRI showed signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia consistent with manganese deposition. An older brother with the same phenotype died at age 18, suggesting a potentially fatal autosomal recessive disease. This disorder is probably caused by a defect in manganese metabolism with deposition of manganese in the liver and basal ganglia, similar to copper deposition in Wilson's disease. To assess the genetic basis of this syndrome, we searched for two candidate genes: ATP2C2 and ATP2A3, which encode manganese-bearing calcium-ATPases, SPCA2 and SERCA3, respectively. Genotyping of the patient and family for microsatellite markers surrounding ATP2C2 and ATP2A3 excluded these genes. The patient was found to be heterozygous for both gene loci. Despite the unknown pathophysiology, we were able to develop a successful treatment regimen. Chelation therapy with disodium calcium edetate in combination with iron supplementation is the treatment of choice, significantly reducing blood manganese levels and improving clinical symptoms.

1927,Tetrathiomolybdate protects against cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis due to bile duct ligation.,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a potent copper chelating drug, was originally developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Our working hypothesis is that the fibrotic pathway is copper dependent. As the major route for copper elimination is biliary excretion, a bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model was used to test the potential protective effects of TM. TM was given at a daily dose of 0.9 mg/mouse via intragastric gavage 5 days before BDL. All animals were sacrificed 5 days after surgery. Plasma liver enzymes and total bilirubin were significantly decreased in TM-treated BDL mice. TM also inhibited the increase in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 seen in BDL mice. Cholestatic liver injury was markedly attenuated by TM treatment as demonstrated by histology. Hepatic collagen deposition was significantly reduced and paralleled by significant suppression of hepatic smooth muscle alpha-actin and fibrogenic gene expression in TM-treated BDL mice. Although the endogenous antioxidant ability was enhanced, oxidative stress, hepatic glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, as demonstrated by malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals, were not attenuated by TM treatment, suggesting that the protective mechanism of TM may be independent of oxidative stress. In summary, TM attenuated BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis in mice, in part by inhibiting TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 secretion. The protective mechanism appears to be independent of oxidative stress. Our data provide further evidence that TM may be a potential treatment for hepatic fibrosis.",,"Song, M.;Song, Z.;Barve, S.;Zhang, J.;Chen, T.;Liu, M.;Arteel, G. E.;Brewer, G. J.;McClain, C.

1928,"Wilson protein expression, copper excretion, and sweat production in sweat glands of patients with Wilson's disease and controls","Background: In Wilson's disease, copper is not adequately excreted into the bile due to the absence or malfunction of the Wilson protein copper ATPase in the excretory pathway of hepatocytes. Copper is found in sweat. It is not known whether Wilson's protein plays a role in the excretion of copper through sweat. The aim of this study was to investigate Wilson protein expression in sweat glands in controls and patients with Wilson's disease and to examine its effect on sweat excretion of copper. Methods: Immunofluorescence analysis of Wilson protein was performed in skin samples from normal rat, LEC rat and human skin biopsies. Pilocarpine-induced sweat gland stimulation by iontophoretic transfer, adapted from the methods used for cystic fibrosis sweat testing, was used for sweat induction. Sweat volume, sweat copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper were analyzed in 28 Wilson patients and 21 controls. Results: Wilson protein is expressed in human and rat sweat gland epithelium. The copper concentration in sweat was not significantly different between controls and Wilson's patients. Wilson's patients produce significantly less sweat than controls. Sweat production is partially reversible in Wilson patients receiving medical treatment for Wilson's disease or after a liver transplant. Conclusion: Wilson patients show a decreased sweat production with unchanged sweat copper concentration. Wilson protein may play an important role in physiological sweat production.

We propose that measurement of water proton spin-lattice relaxation rate constants before and after chelation can be used as an alternative approach to monitor the presence of free copper ions in blood serum.

1932,Effect of D-penicillamine on liver fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is a copper metabolism disorder characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of the ATP7B protein and decreased biliary copper excretion in hepatocytes. Excessive copper accumulation leads to liver damage. D-penicillamine can primarily inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the appearance of scar lesions in the liver. We studied this phenomenon in our patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pathology slides taken from the explant livers of 26 patients who were diagnosed with Wilson's disease and underwent liver transplantation between 2000 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their history of D-penicillamine use before transplantation. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation was classified as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3) and reviewed by an unbiased hepatopathologist. RESULTS: 69% (18/26) of 26 patients (20 males, 6 females) with Wilson's disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years had a history of D-penicillamine use between 6 months and 6 months prior to liver transplantation. there was. 9 years (mean, 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis were seen in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18) of patients, grade 2 in 44% (8/18) and grade 1 in 11% (2/18) of patients. In the group without D-penicillamine (8 patients), fibrosis grades were grade 3 (62%), grade 2 (25%), and grade 1 (12%); Grade 2 and 3 inflammation was present in 87% of patients. The degree of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than in the non-D-penicillamine group (P < .05).

1933,liver disease during pregnancy,"Abnormal liver tests occur in 3-5% of pregnancies for many potential causes, including incidental liver disease (most commonly viral hepatitis or gallstones) and underlying chronic liver disease. However, most liver dysfunctions in pregnancy are related to pregnancy and result from 1 in 5 liver diseases specific to the pregnant condition: they are divided into 2 main categories based on their association with or without preeclampsia. The liver diseases associated with preeclampsia are preeclampsia itself, hemolysis (H), elevated liver tests (EL) and low platelet count (LP) (HELLP) syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are not associated with preeclampsia. While still mysterious, there have been recent interesting advances in the understanding of these unique pregnancy-related liver diseases. Hyperemesis gravidarum is persistent, dehydrating vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy; 50% of patients with this condition have hepatic dysfunction. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is itching and elevated bile acids in the second half of pregnancy, accompanied by elevated aminotransferases and mild jaundice. Maternal therapy is symptomatic with ursodeoxycholic acid; But for the fetus, this is a high-risk pregnancy that requires close fetal monitoring and preterm delivery. Severe preeclampsia itself is the most common cause of hepatic tenderness and liver dysfunction in pregnancy, with 2-12% of cases further complicated by hemolysis (H), elevated liver tests (EL) and low platelet count (LP) - HELLP syndrome. Immediate delivery is the only definitive treatment, but many maternal complications can occur, including abruptio placentae, renal failure, subcapsular hematomas, and hepatic rupture. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a sudden, devastating disease that occurs almost exclusively in the third trimester; Microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes causes acute liver failure with coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis and prompt delivery are important for maternal and fetal survival. Copyright Â© 2007, American Society for Liver Disease Research.",,"Hay, J.

1934,Liver ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion induces and trades the multi-specific metal transporter Atp7b into bile duct ducts: possible preferential transport of iron into bile.,"Both Atp7b (Wilson's disease gene) and Atp7a (Menkes' disease gene) have been reported to trade in copper. Atp7b is transported to the bile duct ducts and Atp7a to the plasma membrane. Whether liver ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion modulates Atp7b expression and trafficking has not been reported. In this study, we report for the first time that the very specific metal transporter Atp7b is significantly induced and trafficked by both liver ischemia-only and liver ischemia-reperfusion, as assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses. Although hepatocytes also stained for Atp7b, intense Atp7b staining was found localized in bile duct canaliculi. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of bile copper, iron, zinc, and manganese found a corresponding significant increase in biliary iron. In our attempt to determine whether the observed increased biliary iron transport is the result of altered bile flow, lysosomal trafficking, or glutathione bile transport, we measured bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione content. There was no significant difference in bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity and glutathione between control livers and livers exposed to ischemia-reperfusion. Therefore, we conclude that induction of liver ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion and transport of Atp7b to bile duct ducts may contribute to preferential iron transport into bile.

Wilson's disease can occur under a variety of clinical conditions. The complex clinical presentation causes the diagnosis to be based on a high index of suspicion. We present an atypical case of this disorder in a 22-year-old woman in whom the initial clinical presentation (oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea symptoms and galactorrhea) suggested the presence of prolactinoma or other forms of hyperprolactinemia. Her clinical condition improved significantly after diagnosis and administration of zinc sulfate therapy.

Because both conditions are associated with varying degrees of hemolysis, WD in the EbetaT setting may remain masked and, as a result, remain undiagnosed for a long time.

Similarly, it can regulate changes in iron, copper and zinc exchange concentrations during lactation. For iron, this regulation is mediated by the transferrin receptor DMT1 and ferroportin, while mammary gland copper metabolism is regulated by Ctr1, ATP7A, and ATP7B. Zinc homeostasis is complex, involving both zinc importers (Zip3) and zinc exporters (ZnT-1, ZnT-2, and ZnT-4). Both transcriptional and post-translational regulation can delicately regulate protein abundance and the cellular localization of these transporters, their uptake, intracellular trafficking, and secretion of iron, copper, and zinc. Control of mammary gland intake and milk secretion of iron, copper and zinc protects both the mammary gland and the breastfed infant against the deficiency and excess of these nutrients.

1944,Mild zinc deficiency and dietary phytic acid accelerate the development of fulminant hepatitis in LEC rats.,"Introduction and Aim: Restriction of copper intake delays hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, which are animal models of Wilson's disease. Zinc uptake is suggested to develop hepatitis in the disease; but this has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mild zinc deficiency on the development of hepatitis and to determine the relationship between copper, zinc and iron absorption and liver levels. Methods: Male LEC and F344 (wild-type atp7b) rats were fed a low-zinc, phytate-containing or control diet. Onset of hepatitis (Experiment 1) and absorption rates of copper, zinc and iron and hepatitis indices at 4 weeks (Experiment 2) were observed. Results: The onset of fulminant hepatitis in LEC rats was much earlier in the low zinc and phytate groups (mean 94.6 +/- 2.74 days and 82.8 +/- 3.56 days, respectively) than in the control group (136 +/- 2.11). daily) with worse hepatitis indices. Hepatic copper levels were much higher in LEC rats than in F344 rats, but not drastically different between dietary groups, with no obvious changes in copper absorption. Liver levels and intestinal absorption of zinc and iron were lower in the phytate group than in the control group. Conclusion: Mild zinc deficiencies caused by a low zinc or phytate diet accelerate the onset of hepatitis without increasing copper absorption in LEC rats, and zinc and iron metabolism may play a role in earlier jaundice initiation in LEC rats.

The tremor in the upper extremities appeared one year after the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made three years after the first symptoms appeared, based on the neuropsychiatric picture, the detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and the results of diagnostic tests showing chronic liver disease and copper excess. Proton spectroscopy study was also performed with ATP7B genotyping and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The patient became asymptomatic two years after initiating penicillamine therapy and remained non-symptomatic controlled for eight years of follow-up without any specific treatment for BPAD.

1949,Hereditary metabolic disease of the liver,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Elucidating metabolic pathways for copper and iron has improved our understanding of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis. Some inherited liver diseases are now characterized by protein folding mutations, including Gaucher disease, cystic fibrosis, and ZZ alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. Studies now focus on the relationships between glycogen storage disease, hepatic adenoma formation, and transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. Continuing progress in the diagnosis, natural history and treatment of hereditary liver diseases is the subject of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: A better understanding of the metabolic pathways for iron and copper has led to the investigation of factors that alter the phenotypic expression of Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis. Hepcidin plays a key role in modulating iron uptake in iron overload disorders, and new studies illuminate hepcidin regulation. Studies on the natural history and hepatocellular transformation for glycogen storage diseases require tumor surveillance and possible early transplantation. A better understanding of genetic and non-genetic modifiers in ZZ alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and other protein misfolding disorders will improve our ability to manage these patients.

1950,Consensus recommendations for managing elevation of asymptomatic persistent nonviral alcohol-associated aminotransferase levels. Diagnostic procedures and recommendations for monitoring,"persistent increase in nonviral alcohol-non-associated aminotransferase levels may have many causes that differ in prevalence and clinical significance. The most common cause in the general population is steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis, which can progress to cirrhosis. While the treatment of steatosis and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis consists of changing lifestyles, the effectiveness of drug therapy has not yet been determined. Other much less frequent (but not uncommon) causes of persistent non-viral alcohol-related elevations in aminotransferase levels are celiac disease and hemochromatosis, while autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency. Rare. Given that some of these conditions are susceptible to treatment, early detection is important. No epidemiological data are available to assess the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels associated with toxicity of drugs or other xenobiotics, including herbal products. Created by a panel of experts based on a systematic review of scientific evidence, the current document is primarily aimed at physicians working in General Medicine and Transfusion Centers, representing the first contact of people with generally elevated aminotransferase levels. The document includes recommendations for diagnosing causes of persistent non-viral alcohol-related increases in aminotransferase levels, taking into account frequency and response to therapy.

Chronic damage results in a progressive accumulation of scar proteins (fibrosis), which increasingly alters tissue structure and function, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Efforts to modulate the fibrogenesis process have focused on understanding the biology of heterogeneous liver fibroblast populations. Fibroblasts are derived from sources inside and outside the liver. Fibroblasts expressing alpha smooth muscle actin (myofibroblasts) can be derived from transdifferentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells. Other fibroblasts arise from portal tracts within the liver. At least some of these cells in the diseased liver originate from the bone marrow. In addition, fibrogenic fibroblasts can also be produced through the liver epithelial (hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cell)-mesenchymal transition. Whatever their origin, it is clear that fibrogenic fibroblast activity is sensitive (and may be active) to the cytokine and chemokine profiles of liver-resident leukocytes such as macrophages. They can also be a component that drives tissue regeneration. Understanding the complex intercellular interactions regulating liver fibrogenesis is of increasing importance due to the predicted increases in chronic liver disease and the current paucity of effective treatments.

Then, single-pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) was initiated for 5 days to increase copper removal with the development of encephalopathy and oliguria. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was administered using the PRISMA machine, with blood flow at 100 ml/min and dialysate flow at 2 L/hr for 8 hours, then 1 L/hr. A 5% albumin dialysate was made by replacing 1 L of 25% albumin with 1 L of Hemosol BO in a 5 L bag. Single-pass albumin dialysis resulted in decreases in serum copper (154 to 59 cups/dL), conjugated bilirubin (37 to 23 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1305 to 729 units/L), and creatinine (1.1 to 0.9 mg/dL). . ) as well as reduced blood transfusion requirements. Interruption of SPAD was followed by three plasmapheresis procedures for further copper removal.

1960,Liver Transplant for Wilson's Disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by decreased biliary copper excretion, resulting in liver damage and failure, and accumulation of copper in the tissues. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be life-saving in Wilson patients presenting with fulminant liver failure and in patients who do not respond to medical therapy. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with OLT in patients with Wilson's disease. Between September 2001 and April 2007, 25 OLTs were performed in 24 patients (7 females and 17 males) with Wilson's disease mean age 15.6+/- 9.9 years (range, 5-51 years). Six patients underwent transplantation with accompanying fulminant liver failure and 18 with chronic advanced liver disease (n = 8) or without accompanying neurological signs (n = 10). We performed 3 full-size, deceased donor OLTs and 22 living donor OLTs. Eight patients had a family history of Wilson's disease. We detected Kayser-Fleischer ring in 18 patients. Prior to OLT, all patients had low serum ceruloplasmin (mean 27.8 mg/dL) and elevated urinary copper excretion (mean 4119 cups/day). After successful OLT, all patients had a significant reduction in urinary copper excretion (median, 37.1 cups/day). The mean follow-up time was 21.7 +/-19.8 months (range, 2-60 months). One patient required retransplantation 12 days after the first OLT because of primary graft dysfunction. 5 of 24 patients died within 4 months of surgery. The 19 survivors (79%) remained well with normal liver function and no disease recurrence. In conclusion, OLT was a curative procedure for Wilson's disease in patients presenting with fulminant hepatic failure and other patients with end-stage hepatic failure. After OLT, serum ceruloplasmin level increased to the normal range, urinary copper excretion decreased, and neurological signs improved. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A recent development is the identification of the Cu chaperone as a potential biomarker of CCS; Although its reliability has not yet been determined. This appears to be the most promising potential biomarker responding to both Cu deficiency and excess. The potential to identify a set of biomarkers using high-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics is only now being studied. A combination of these technologies along with a range of innovative metal detection techniques is essential for the search for robust copper biomarkers to be successful.

1965,"Clinical presentation, diagnosis and long-term outcomes of 29 patients with Wilson's disease. [Spanish]","Objective: To analyze the clinical features, treatment and follow-up of a cohort of 29 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) in the Murcia region. Patients and method: We reviewed the medical records of 29 cases of WD (mean age, 20.3 +/- 13.4 years) diagnosed in the last 16 years. Results: The most common reason for consultation was the discovery of an elevated transaminase level in almost half of the patients, followed by tremor or dystonia in 17% of patients, respectively. A Kayser-Fleischer ring was observed in 17/29 (58.6%) of patients (100% of patients with pure neurologic involvement and 35% of patients with pure clinical liver disease; p < 0.001). Ceruloplasmin and unrelated blood copper levels were significantly superior in patients with neurological symptoms and patients with liver cirrhosis at diagnosis. Patient clinical symptoms remained stable on D-penicillamine or trientine or improved in 18 (62%) of 29 patients and worsened in 11 (38%) of 29 patients during the observation period. Conclusions: In our region, patients with WD are diagnosed with liver disease at a younger age and in most cases. Patients with neurological disease or cirrhosis of the liver had high levels of free copper, not associated with ceruloplasmin and copper. The disease evolved favorably in all patients except those diagnosed with liver disease or advanced neurological disease. Copyright © 2008 Aran Ediciones, SL",,"Rodrigo Agudo, J.

1967,Epilepsy in inherited metabolic disorders,"Introduction: Studies on neurometabolic diseases are still in a long initial stage. The catalog of these diseases continues to grow; Some known clinical syndromes have been subdivided into a number of variants after the genes that cause them have been identified, and new metabolic disorders have also been discovered that exacerbate or contribute to forms of epilepsy not previously classified as cerebral metabolic disorders. Results: This review presents the basic principles underlying the recognition and treatment of epilepsy caused by neurometabolic diseases. These disorders are divided (for pure simplicity) into epilepsy occurring in newborns, children and adolescents, and adults, and it is recognized that there is considerable overlap between these chronological stages. Current analytical methods and therapeutic approaches are summarized, both from an overview and in the context of each clinical syndrome, recognizing that each patient has unique characteristics and that, in general, antiepileptic drugs offer little benefit compared to more specific types of treatment (for example, special diets or vitamins ) when specified. We also include a general approach and therapeutic recommendations for fulminant epilepsies of neurometabolic origin, emphasizing the importance of identifying all relatives of the proband who may be potential carriers of a genetic disorder in the diagnostic and genetic counseling process. Particular emphasis is placed on disorders with curative treatment and the importance of follow-up by specialist professionals. Conclusion: It is expected that within a few years it will be possible to know the metabolomic profile of these diseases (possibly by non-invasive methods), thus facilitating the correct diagnosis and making it possible to determine and diagnose the response to treatment.

1968,Efficacy of tetrathiomolybdate in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a powerful anticancer drug developed for Wilson's disease. We found multiple potent results from lowering copper levels with TM in mouse disease models, using serum Cp as a surrogate marker of copper status, and targeting Cp values of 20% to 50% from baseline. We found effective results of TM treatment in mouse models of fibrosis; inflammation; damage from exogenous agents such as acetaminophen and doxorubicin; and immune-modulated diseases such as concanavalin A hepatitis, collagen II-induced arthritis, and the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes. In the current study, we examine TM efficacy in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). We found that clinical scores of neurological damage were significantly inhibited by TM treatment, regardless of whether treatment was initiated before MS-inducing antigen administration or after symptoms from antigen administration developed. We also found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) treatment produced a marked increase in oxidant damage, as measured by urinary isoprostane levels, and TM potently and significantly suppressed these isoprostane increases. Finally, we found marked increases in inflammatory and immune-related cytokines in this model, and we found that TM strongly and significantly suppressed these increases. © 2008.",,"Hou, G.;Abrams, G.

1973,Medical measures against nuclear threats: Radionuclide corporatization agents,"Exposure to radionuclides emitted by a radiodistribution device or deposited as fallout after a nuclear power plant accident or explosion of an improvised nuclear device can result in internal contamination of a significant number of individuals. Internalized radionuclides can cause both acute and chronic radiation damage and increase an individual's risk of developing cancer. This damage and risk can be mitigated by the use of incorporation agents that reduce internal contamination. Unfortunately, most effective agents contain only a limited range of radionuclides, and some are formulated to complicate administration in situations of mass injury. There is a need for new radionuclide decorporation agents, reformulation of existing agents, and/or expansion of labeled indications for existing treatments. Researchers developing new or improved coupling agents should also understand the regulatory pathway for these products. The first workshop in nearly half a century to focus solely on radionuclide separation brought together researchers and scientific managers from academia, government, and industry, as well as senior regulatory officials and U.S. Food and Drug Administration personnel. Meeting attendees reviewed the latest developments in the development of incorporation agents and considered the future of the field. Â© 2008 by the Radiation Research Society.",,"Cassatt, D.

1974,Delusional disorder and alcohol abuse in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) or hepatolenticular degeneration is a rare copper metabolism disorder that results in copper accumulation in the brain, liver, kidneys and cornea. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms may occur due to copper deposits in the brain. While psychiatric symptoms can range from mood disorders, behavior and personality disorders to cognitive impairment, psychotic symptoms are rarely reported. The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of WD presenting with non-persecutory delusional disorder and alcohol abuse in the absence of neurological symptoms. Case summary: A 34-year-old male patient with no previous psychiatric or alcohol abuse history presented with jealousy and delusions of alcohol abuse when he discontinued his WD treatment. Although the patient did not have any symptoms or neurological findings before, he had been receiving WD treatment for 3 years after the disease was diagnosed in the family precautionary examination due to the development of symptomatic WD in his older brother. After 3 months of follow-up, the patient's psychiatric symptoms were adequately controlled. Conclusion: Although WD is rarely associated with alcohol abuse and jealousy delusions, this disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these psychiatric symptoms.

1981,Single-center experience with liver transplantation for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism presenting with prominent hepatic and neurological manifestations. While the indication for neurological manifestations is discussed, there is an established place for liver transplantation in the presence of liver disease. Between 1993 and 2005, liver transplantation was performed in 11 patients due to Wilson's disease in our institution. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the patients. The pathology of the explanted livers was analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups according to the development of the disease. Postoperative data collected included patient and graft outcome, complications, neurological status, and copper metabolism. Six men and five women were transplanted at an average age of 29.7 years (range 15-48 years). Three patients had fulminant presentation, two patients had established disease decompensation, and six patients had chronic disease. Neurological features were evident in five patients. Pathological analysis of the explanted graft showed cirrhosis in all patients. Five patients who were acute in fulminant and chronic presentations also showed explant necrosis. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 56.8 months (range 10 to 129 months). Two patients were retransplanted. One patient died of severe sepsis. Two patients with severe neurological dysfunction showed a significant remission of symptoms. Liver transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for both acute and chronic presentations of Wilson's disease. Acute presentation is associated with the presence of necrosis in the explanted liver. In our series, there was a significant improvement in neurological features after transplantation.

Methods: We compared patients with Wilson's disease (n = 18) with healthy subjects of the same age (n = 15) as the control group. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (ceruloplasmin, urinary and liver copper concentrations). P wave dispersion, a measure of the heterogeneity of atrial depolarization, was measured as the difference between the duration of the longest and shortest P waves in 12-lead electrocardiography. Results: All patients were asymptomatic on cardiological examination and had sinus rhythm on electrocardiography. Left ventricular and left atrial diameters, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular mass index were similar in both groups. Patients with Wilson's disease had a significantly higher P wave distribution compared to controls (44.7 +/- 5.8 vs. 25.7 +/- 2.5, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Cardiologically asymptomatic Wilson patients had an increase in P wave dispersion, possibly representing an early stage of cardiac involvement. © 2008 WJG.

1983,"Chelators that control metal metabolism and toxicity pathways: Applications in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment.","Chelating drugs and chelator metal complexes are used for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer cells and normal cells need essential metal ions such as iron, copper and zinc for growth and reproduction. Chelators can target the metabolic pathways of cancer cells through the control of proteins involved in the regulation of these metals, as well as other molecules involved in cell cycle control, angiogenesis, and metastatic suppression. Other targets are inhibition of specific proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase involved in DNA synthesis, inhibition of free radical damage to DNA caused by iron and copper catalytic centers, inhibition of microbial growth in immunocompromised cancer patients, and radioactive and other cancer-causing toxic metals. Chelating drugs and metal ions can affect the metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin, mitosantrone, bleiomycin, and hydroxyurea (HU). Although many experimental chelators have been shown to be effective as anti-cancer agents, only a few have reached clinical testing or application, such as dexrazoxane, deferoxamine (DFO), and triapine. In many experimental models, deferiprone (L1) has been shown to be effective in cancer prevention and treatment and inhibition of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. New anticancer drugs can be developed using new protocols of chelators and chelator complexes with platinum and other metals, as well as chelator combinations with known anticancer drugs.

1984,Trientine versus tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Initial management of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, used for years in most patients, causes neurological deterioration in up to half of such patients, and half of those who do get worse never get better. Ideal for maintenance therapy, zinc is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for these types of patients and it did well in open-label studies. Trientine, another commercially available copper inhibitor approved for patients with penicillamine intolerance, has not been tested in such patients. Here we report a double-blind trial of trientine versus TM in a neurologically presenting Wilson disease patient. Design and Methods: The study was a double-blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc or trientine plus zinc for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they presented with neurological symptoms from Wilson's disease and were not treated for a longer period of time. 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed in hospital for 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semiquantitative neurological and speech examinations to assess possible neurological deterioration. They also had weekly blood and urine tests done. They continued on zinc maintenance therapy upon discharge from the hospital and returned at annual intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients entered the trientine arm and 6 reached the criteria for neurological deterioration, while 25 patients were recruited to the TM arm and only 1 worsened (p < 0.05). Side effects were seen in one patient using trientine, and in 7 patients receiving TM. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the Trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 showed neurological deterioration at baseline, 2 patients in the TM arm died. Neurological and speech recovery was good for 3 years in patients who did not deteriorate or die. Comment: TM is a superior choice to trientine for the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. Â© 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Askari, F.;Lorincz, M.

These metals can be toxic in excessive amounts, especially in certain genetic disorders. Homeostasis of these trace elements results from a tightly coordinated regulation by different proteins involved in uptake, excretion, and intracellular storage/traffic processes. Through the Fenton reaction, Cu and Fe in a non-protein binding condition can produce various reactive oxygen species that damage tissues or cells. Abnormal metabolism of Zn, Cu and Fe can lead to various chronic pathogenesis such as diabetes or diabetic complications. These pathogenic conditions appear to be common in Zn and Cu deficiency as well as Cu and Fe overload.

A previously healthy Indian man afflicted with acute hepatitis E developed acute liver failure after a 5-day treatment with herbal medicine. Pressure on health authorities and education of the general population should help prevent such preventable deaths. Physicians have a responsibility to persuade their patients affected by acute liver disease not to take medications for symptomatic relief, especially herbal remedies, until recovery.

1988,Copper transport systems play a role in multidrug resistance and drug transport.,"Copper is an essential trace element and several copper-containing proteins are indispensable for processes such as oxidative respiration, neural development, and collagen remodeling. Copper metabolism is delicately regulated by various transporters and chaperone proteins. Copper Transport Protein 1 (CTR1) selectively takes copper into cells. Three chaperone proteins, HAH1 (human atx1 homolog 1), Cox17p and CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase) then transport copper to the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, respectively. Defects in the copper transporter ATP7A and ATP7B are responsible for Menkes disease and Wilson's disease, respectively. These proteins transfer copper to the Golgi apparatus via HAH1 and transfer copper to cuproenzymes. They also prevent cellular damage caused by excessive copper accumulation by mediating copper outflow from the cell. There is increasing evidence that copper transport mechanisms may play a role in drug resistance. We and others have found that ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in drug resistance to the anti-tumor drug cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP). The relationship between the expression of ATP7A or ATP7B in tumors and CDDP resistance is supported by clinical studies. In addition, the copper uptake transporter CTR1 has also been reported to play a role in CDDP susceptibility. Furthermore, we recently found that the effect of ATP7A on drug resistance is not limited to CDDP. Correlating sensitivity to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38) using an ex vivo drug sensitivity assay, the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA), expression of ATP7A in human surgically resected colon cancer cells. Cells overexpressing ATP7A contain several proteins, including SN-38, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11), vincristine, paclitaxel, etoposide, doxorubicin (Dox). resistant to anticancer drugs. and mitoxantrone. The mechanism by which ATP7A and copper metabolism modulates drug transport appears to involve modulation of drug cellular localization via modulation of the vesicle transport system. In ATP7A overexpressing cells, Dox accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, in parental cells, Dox is localized in nuclei where target molecules of Dox, topoisomerase II and DNA are located. Disruption of the intracellular vesicle transport system by monensin, a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ionophore, resulted in Dox relocating from the Golgi apparatus to nuclei in cells overexpressing ATP7A. These data suggested that ATP7A-related drug transport is dependent on the vesicle transport system. Therefore, copper transport systems play important roles in copper metabolism as well as drug transport. It is therefore likely that the components of copper metabolism include target molecules for modulation of drug potency, not only of anticancer agents, but also of other drugs.

1991,Treatment of seizures in kidney and liver failure,"Introduction: Kidney and liver diseases cause seizures, and epilepsy patients may suffer from such diseases that alter their antiepileptic drug (AED) metabolism. Purpose: To review how seizures may result from metabolic disorders, treatments, or comorbidities related to kidney or liver diseases, and how the choice of AED may be affected by these conditions. Results: Seizures occur in renal failure due to toxin accumulation and complications such as sepsis, bleeding, malignant hypertension, pH and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Hemodialysis leads to acute imbalance syndrome and dementia. Peritoneal dialysis can cause hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma. Immunosuppression after kidney transplantation is neurotoxic and causes posterior leukoencephalopathy, cerebral lymphoma, and infections. Some antibiotics increase the risk of status epilepticus by lowering convulsive thresholds. The most commonly used AEDs in uremia are benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, phenytoin and phenobarbital. When treating epilepsy in renal failure, the choice of AED depends on the seizure type, but doses should be adjusted, particularly in the case of water-soluble, low molecular weight, low protein bound, low apparent volume of distribution AEDs. Liver failure leads to reduction in ammonium levels and intestinal bacterial activity, reversal of cerebral edema and encephalopathy and seizures, which are treated with intracranial hypertension. Phenytoin and benzodiazepines are generally ineffective. Seizures caused by post-hepatic immunosuppression can be treated with phenytoin or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may result from D-penicillamine-dependent pyridoxine deficiency. Porphyria seizures can be treated with gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Liver disease alters the pharmacokinetics of the AED and requires readjustment of doses. Small liver metabolized AEDs such as gabapentin, oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam are theoretically more adequate. Conclusions: Effective seizure treatment in kidney and liver diseases requires adequate diagnosis of these disorders and their comorbidities, as well as good knowledge of AEDs metabolism, pharmacokinetic changes in such diseases, careful use of concomitant medications, and monitoring of serum levels of AEDs.",,"De Lacerda, G.

1992,Hereditary liver disease. [German],"Elevated liver enzymes are common in clinical practice, and occult inherited liver diseases may play an important role in explaining these abnormalities. In hereditary hemochromatosis, the C282Y mutation leads to amplification of intestinal iron absorption despite high body stores of total iron. The number of gene mutations corresponding to enzymes during hemebiosynthesis can lead to porphyria, a heterogeneous group of inherited metabolic disorders. Different mutations in Wilson's disease cause a functionally abnormal ATP7B transport protein responsible for impaired biliary copper excretion. Heterogeneous mutations were found in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, resulting in varying clinical expression patterns. In patients with Dubin Johnson Syndrome, altered sequences of the MRP gene correspond to impaired biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin. As more therapeutic options are created, early and adequate diagnosis can help improve the prognosis of affected patients. The size of this overview is not large enough to cover all hereditary liver diseases. Therefore, we have selected cases and diseases that have been recently diagnosed and treated in our practice. © 2008 Schattauer GmbH.",,"Teubner, A.;Habeck, J.

1993,Approach to Wilson's disease in children: analysis of patients diagnosed and treated in the last 10 years at the Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases in Wroclaw (Poland).,"Introduction: Wilson's disease (degeneration hepato-lenticulatis) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease. The sequela of impaired elimination is copper accumulation with progressive deterioration of their function in the liver, brain, kidneys, cornea and other organs. Wilson's disease can take several clinical forms: hepatic, neurological, or others. The hepatic form is the most common form in children and adolescents and is the only form observed in our patients. Signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease are often nonspecific: asthenia, anemia, dyspeptic symptoms, joint pains with abnormal liver function tests. Purpose of the study: The aim of the study is to analyze the patients (age, gender, clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms, diagnosis) treated in our department in the last 10 years. Materials and methods: Descriptive retrospective study; Between 1997 and 2007, 8 children with Wilson's disease were recruited to the Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in Wroclaw, Poland. Results: We treated 8 children (4 girls and 4 boys) aged 7-17 years with Wilson's disease, all in hepatic form. None of the children had a Kayser-Fleischer ring. During the differential diagnosis of chronic hepatitis in 6/8 patients or acute fulminate liver failure in 2/8 patients, the disease was diagnosed with a decrease in serum ceruloplasmin level and an increase in copper urinary excretion. Treatment with D-penicillamine in 7 patients or liver transplant in one patient, respectively, was effective in all children. Conclusions: Wilson's disease should be considered in any child with liver abnormalities of an unexplained nature; In these children, serum ceruloplasmin level and urinary copper excretion should be measured. Urinary copper excretion may also be helpful after D-penicillamine administration. The absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings does not exclude the diagnosis of Wilson's disease and is typical for children. Siblings of a patient with Wilson's disease must be screened.

1995,Use of molecular adsorbent recirculation system for the treatment of acute decompensated Wilson's disease,"Acute decompensated Wilson's disease presenting as fulminant liver failure is a life-threatening condition for which liver transplantation is the ultimate cure. It is listed as a status 1 indicator according to the United Network for Organ Sharing classification. A large amount of copper released during an attack causes hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. Conventional chelating therapy, which attempts to remove copper from the patient, is unsatisfactory because there is not enough time for these drugs to act and patients are often oliguric. The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculation System (MARS) is a modified form of dialysis that removes putative albumin-related toxins associated with liver failure. Extracorporeal albumin dialysate is believed to absorb circulating copper molecules trapped in the patient's circulation. We present 2 patients with acute decompensated Wilson's disease treated with MARS. In the first case, the patient was started on MARS when conventional treatment failed. A significant amount of copper was removed from his circulatory system and his condition later stabilized. The treatment bought him extra time, and he eventually made the transition to a liver transplant. In the second case, the patient was started on MARS treatment in the early stages of his illness and his condition stabilized shortly after treatment. He was able to return to his hometown for a liver transplant. In both cases, MARS was used as a way of preventing deterioration rather than saving destruction. In conclusion, MARS may benefit patients with acute decompensated Wilson's disease if started early in the course of the disease. © 2008 AASLD.",,"Chiu, A.;Tsoi, N. S.;Fan, S.

However, to date, eye movements in WD patients have rarely been studied and data on this subject are scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate reflexive and voluntary eye movements in WD patients. We examined horizontal saccadic and smooth tracking eye movements using infrared oculography in 50 patients with WD, 29 neurologically symptomatic (WDn) and 21 asymptomatic (WDa) and 29 healthy controls. Compared with the WDa group (317 ms and 9.1, respectively) and controls (318 ms and 9.7, respectively), we found a statistically significant increase in mean antisaccadic latency (378 ms) and mean antisacadic error rate (22.5) in the WDn group. . In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean latency of prosaccades and the size of the gap effect. Patients with neurological signs also had abnormally smooth follow-up – increased number of saccadic intrusions (mean: 8.6) and decreased gain (mean: 0.69) compared with WDa patients (4.1 and 0.83, respectively) and controls (2.2 and 0.91, respectively).

[Japanese]","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disease and also abnormal copper (Cu) metabolism occurs due to the dysfunction of the ATP7B enzyme, so that excess Cu content accumulates in the tissues. Ionic Cu binds with metalthionine and causes cell damage by oxidative oxygen. In fact, unless the Cu deposits in the tissues need to be removed, the tissues are damaged because they have a hereditary structure. Among the seven cases where D-penicillamine and zinc acetate were administered alternately every week, continuously at the onset of childhood dysarthria, athetosis, and the like, all cases resolved after treatment with Cu-chelating agents. However, the four cases that stopped using these drugs in adulthood were severe slurred speech, dystonia, ataxia, cirrhosis of the liver, renal tubular damage, etc. In four cases, symptoms recurred, but despite treatment with the same dose of Cu-chelating agents and concomitant physical and language therapies, symptoms did not improve, but to no avail.

2003,Triethylenetetramine and its metabolites: levels of copper and zinc excretion in the urine of healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a selective Cu<sup>II</sup>-chelator used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure in diabetes. Despite decades of clinical use, information on its pharmacology in human subjects remains incomplete. Here, we first used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect and identify the major metabolites of TETA in human plasma and urine, and then we used this method to measure the concentrations of TETA and its metabolites in the urine of healthy and diabetic subjects. TETA was administered orally in increasing doses (300, 600, 1200 and 2400 mg). Twenty-four hour urine collection was performed on participants before and after dosing. Two major metabolites of TETA were detected in human urine, N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N<inf>1</inf>,N<inf>10</inf>-diacetyltriethylenetetramine, the latter being novel. Both metabolites were confirmed by LC-MS with synthetic standards. The proportion of unchanged TETA excreted as a fraction of total urinary drug-derived molecules was significantly higher in healthy subjects than in matched diabetic subjects, consistent with a higher rate of TETA metabolism in diabetic subjects. TETA-induced increases in urinary Cu excretion in non-diabetic subjects were more closely related to parent drug concentrations than in diabetic subjects, whereas in contrast, urinary Cu, TETA, and MAT summation were more closely related. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MAT may play an important role in the molecular mechanism by which TETA removes Cu<sup>II</sup> from the systemic compartment in diabetic subjects.

Pretreatment with the iron chelators desferal, clioquinol, VK-28 and M30 was neuroprotective in both models. To determine the specificity of chelation neuroprotective activity, we examined the effect of D-penicillamine, a relatively specific copper chelator, in a mouse model of MPTP-induced dopamine depletion. Our studies show that D-penicillamine used for copper removal in Wilson's disease is relatively weak in preventing MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity compared to iron chelators studied previously. The results suggest that iron rather than copper chelation may be more effective and specific for the prevention of MPTP-induced dopamine depletion and dopamine neurodegeneration. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",,"Youdim, M.

Wilson's disease is the most common metabolic cause of fulminant liver failure in children over 3 years of age. The aim of this study was to find the main clinical and pathological manifestations of Wilson's disease in children in Tehran. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study was performed in mofid children's hospital. Thirty-five patients suffering from Wilson's disease were studied. Ceruloplasmin level below 20mg/dl and urinary copper excretion level above 100mug/24h were considered as inclusion criteria. Results: Twenty patients were male and 15 were female, and the mean age was 9 years. Most of the patients were in the 8-9 and 10-11 age groups, with 37% and 20%, respectively. Liver involvement was confirmed in 100% of the patients. Jaundice was observed in 20 patients (57%), abdominal enlargement in 20 patients (57%), and encephalopathy in 9 patients (26%). Serum copper decreased 100% and low serum ceroloplasmin 100% in patients, urinary copper excretion increased 97%, AST & ALT increased 100%, PT increased 94%, 100% anemia, leukopenia was found in 14 patients.

2007,Perspectives for gene therapy of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper overload disorder due to mutations of the Wilson's disease gene ATP7B. The disease typically presents with hepatic and/or neurological symptoms in late childhood or young adults. Fatal without medical treatment or liver transplant The long-term outcome of Wilson's disease depends on adherence to effective treatment. Gene therapy may represent an alternative curative future therapy, as current medical treatment options are not effective in all Wilson's patients and adherence is an issue. Studies of adenoviral and lentiviral gene transfer in a rat model of Wilson's disease may prove that viral gene transfer is therapeutically effective and can reverse clinical symptoms. However, both approaches are more or less restricted to transient expression of the transgene. Gene therapy approaches may become more efficient than standard medical treatment for Wilson's disease in the future, as a variety of tactics can be used to overcome these current limitations. This review discusses both current vectors and strategies for liver-directed gene therapy as well as prospective developments, although there is still a long way to go before gene therapy can be used for the safe treatment of Wilson's disease in humans.

2011,"Reversible precipitation of bovine serum albumin by metal ions and synthesis, structure and reactivity of novel tetrathiometallate chelating agents.","Independent research is an essential component of any undergraduate chemistry program. This article reports the findings of two of the many undergraduate research projects led by Ed Stiefel, in the hope that the results will be inspiring and useful to the scientific community. Neurological disorders associated with insufficient copper in Menkes disease and excess copper in Wilson's disease are well known; however, recent evidence suggests that copper may also play a role in other disorders such as Alzheimer's, angiogenesis and prion diseases. However, the precise role of copper is unclear. This study examines the role of copper and zinc in the formation of protein deposits and the chelation and removal of metal ions to reverse the process. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein forms a precipitate after the addition of about 6 copper(II) atoms or 8 zinc(II) atoms. Other metal ions such as Ca(II), Al(III), Ni(II) and Co(II) did not precipitate BSA even when the metal ion/BSA ratios were greater than 1000. Copper and zinc protein precipitates returned to solution after addition of chelating agents, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or tetrathiometallates [(MS<inf>4</inf><sup>2 -</sup>), where M = Mo, W]. Two new choline and acetylcholine tetrathiomolybdate and tetrathiothungstate chelating agents were synthesized and characterized.

2015,"Role of thiols, dithiols, nutritional factors and interacting ligands in mercury toxicology","Mercury has been known for centuries as a toxic substance. While the clinical features of acute mercury poisoning are well defined, chronic low-dose exposure to mercury has been poorly characterized and its potential role in various chronic disease states is controversial. Low molecular weight thiols, ie molecules containing sulfhydryl such as cysteine, emerge as important factors in the transport and distribution of mercury in the body due to the phenomenon of ""Molecular Mimicry"" and its role in the molecular transport of mercury. Chelation agents such as the dithiols sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are the preferred treatments for mercury toxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a disulfide, and its metabolite dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, have also been shown to have chelating properties when used appropriately. Although N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) have been suggested in the past for the treatment of mercury toxicity, a review of the available evidence suggests that these agents may actually be counterproductive. Zinc and selenium have also been shown to exert protective effects against mercury toxicity, most likely mediated by the induction of the metal-binding proteins metallothionein and selenoprotein-P.

2021,Smad-interacting protein-1 (Zfhx1b) acts upstream of Wnt signaling in the mouse hippocampus and controls its formation,"Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1) [Zinc finger homeobox (Zfhx1b)] is a transcription factor involved in the occurrence of Mowat-Wilson syndrome in humans. Sip1 expression in the dorsal telencephalon of mouse embryos has been documented from E12.5. We specifically inactivated the gene in cortical precursors. This resulted in the absence of the entire hippocampal formation. Sip1 mutant mice exhibited death of differentiated cells and decreased proliferation in the putative hippocampus and dentate gyrus region. Expression of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 was ectopically activated, while the activity of the non-canonical Wnt effector, JNK, was down-regulated in the embryonic hippocampus of mutant mice. In cortical cells, Sip1 protein was detected on the promoter of the Sfrp1 gene, and both genes showed a mutually exclusive expression pattern suggesting that Sfrp1 expression is negatively regulated by Sip1. Therefore, Sip1 is essential for the development of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus and can modulate Wnt signaling in these regions.

These syndromes in WD rarely occur in isolation. Clinical rating scales focusing on parkinsonism or ataxia or dystonia alone, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), and the Dystonia Rating Scale (RSD), are not sufficient to accurately reflect it. Motor impairment of WD patients. The aim of the study was to develop a new rating scale for WD because, to our knowledge, no scale has been designed before for clinical rating in WD. Materials and methods: In 2004 the EuroWilson consortium was formed to create a European WD database. Consortium members from Poland, Germany and France prepared a new scale using clinical rating scales such as UPDRS, ICARS and RSD. The drafts were discussed in detail several times at the first international neurological meeting of EuroWilson, held in Paris in September 2004 and in Warsaw in November. Results and conclusions: The new scale for WD consists of 3 parts, including: Consciousness, a historical review based on the Barthel scale (2-11 items), and neurological exam (12-35, items). The maximum score for the first part is 3 points, 39 points for the second part and 143 points for the last part. The initial reliability of the scale was evaluated on the basis of 6 patients (on DVD) and 8 investigators. Inter-rater agreement was high.

Metal overload, mainly in the liver and basal ganglia, leads to hepatic but also extrapyramidal motor as well as psychiatric clinical symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, copper metabolism parameters, ophthalmic examination, and liver biopsy. A radio-copper test can identify patients even with inconsistent lab results. Additional neurophysiological examination and MRI are recommended for initial evaluation and follow-up. Genetic analysis can be helpful to identify asymptomatic relatives of the index patient. Depending on the stage of the disease, chelating drugs and zinc are possible for treatment, but should be given for life without longer interruptions. With early diagnosis and subsequent treatment, the prognosis of Wilson's disease is excellent and the need for liver transplantation can often be avoided.

Our aim was to validate the 3 published scoring systems for deciding between chelation therapy and liver transplantation in patients with chronic decompensated and fulminant WD. The end-stage liver disease (MELD) score model, as well as the WD prognostic index (WPI) and its recently revised version (RWPI), were evaluated as predictors of the safety of chelation therapy. A group of 14 adult patients with clecompensated chronic WD who improved on penicillamine treatment were compared with 21 patients with fulminant WD. The diagnosis of WD was based on increased urinary copper excretion and was confirmed by high liver copper content and/or mutation analysis of the WD gene. MELD score, WPI and RWPI were calculated for all patients with WD. The accuracy of the MELD score, WPI, and RWPI for predicting response to chelation therapy in patients with decompensated chronic WD was 0.968, 0.980, and 0.993, respectively. None of the decompensated chronic WD patients had a MELD score >30, RWPI >11, or WPI >7. RWPI showed the highest accuracy and lowest false negatives when compared to WPI and MELD.

2036,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper affinity caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13. This gene encodes the P-type ATPase known as Wilson's ATPase, which functions to transport copper across intracellular membranes in hepatocytes. The copper transport action directly supports the production of copper-incorporated ferroxidase ceruloplasmin, as well as the excretion of copper into the bile. As a result, in Wilson's disease serum copper concentrations are low and hepatic retention of copper develops, leading to liver damage. Wilson's disease may present as hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease; clinical phenotypes are highly variable. Other organ systems may also be involved. Younger children and older adults may present with this disease, although the usual age range for clinical presentation is 5-45. Clinical investigations include liver function tests, brain imaging, serum ceruloplasmin and copper, basal 24-hour urine copper measurement, and hepatic parenchymal copper concentration. Genetic diagnosis is complex and is best used in family studies or in populations known to have a limited repertoire of mutations. Treatment is usually very effective and consists of lifelong administration of a chelator (D-penicillamine or trientine) or pharmacological doses of zinc. Liver transplantation is mandatory in patients presenting with fulminant liver failure (coagulopathy, encephalopathy, massive intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, elevated aminotransferases, subnormal alkaline phosphatase) or whose liver disease does not respond to usual therapy.

2040,"Wilson's disease-A practical approach to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up","Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive, copper accumulation and toxicity disorder that affects approximately 30 per million people. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for the biliary excretion of copper and leads to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, hemolytic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical features and signs, such as increased urinary copper excretion, decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated copper concentrations in liver tissues, and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited. Wilson's disease is treatable and early diagnosis is important: The goal of treatment is to reduce copper accumulation by increasing urinary excretion of copper or decreasing its absorption from the gut. Medical treatments include penicillamine, trientine, zinc, and tetrathiomolybdate.

Five (71.4%) of the drugs dispensed for pediatrics did not have a market authorization and the remaining (28.6%) were used off-label. For pulmonary arterial hypertension, 19 (70.3%) of 27 patients were treated with Bosentan. According to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, Bosentan has a good level of evidence and a significant benefit: grade of recommendation A. Results: Most orphan drugs distributed to pediatrics and adults were unlicensed. A specific pharmacovigilance program and a risk management plan throughout the lifecycle should be implemented for the efficacy and safety of orphan drugs.

2049,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, resulting in impaired copper excretion through the bile. Subsequent copper deposition, first in the liver but eventually in the brain and other tissues, produces multifaceted clinical manifestations that can include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other disorders. Genetic testing is impractical due to the large number of mutations identified, so accurate diagnosis relies on the judicious use of a range of laboratory and other diagnostic tests. Life-long palliative therapy with increasingly stable drugs or, if necessary, liver transplantation can successfully ameliorate or prevent the progressive deterioration and eventual death that would otherwise inevitably occur. This article discusses the epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic testing, and treatment of Wilson's disease.

2050,Hereditary metabolic disease of the liver,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The last decade has seen remarkable growth in our understanding of the pathophysiology of Wilson's disease as we continue to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of genetic hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Continued progress in improving the molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology, and management of these prototypical inherited metabolic diseases will be the focus of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis involve copper and iron deposition and defects in metal transport in hepatocytes, respectively. In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hepatocytes accumulate defective alpha-1 antitrypsin that is misfolded. As a more complete picture of the molecular biology of transport-related proteins and genes developed, so did our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these disorders and the observed diversity of phenotypes. Finally, elucidating the cellular basis of these diseases will provide new insights into the clinical management of these disorders. SUMMARY: Recent developments detailed in this article have important implications for the future diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Recent discoveries link molecular defects with changes in the functional mechanism of the cell, providing new avenues to advance the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",,"Fink, S.;Schilsky, M.

2051,Gastrointestinal drugs during pregnancy,"Management of the pregnant patient presents unique challenges to the treating physician. Current Food and Drug Administration classifications do not necessarily reflect clinical experience or recent literature. Ideally, the lowest-risk drug should be used, taking into account the patient's condition, stage of pregnancy, and level of efficacy appropriate for dose adjustment. Any treatment decision should be fully discussed with the patient and a multidisciplinary team, including the obstetrician and, if appropriate, the pediatrician. This review will cover drugs commonly used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Most drugs can be categorized as 'low risk' or 'avoidable'. Because of the obvious risk of teratogenicity or side effects, the following drugs should never be used during pregnancy: bismuth, castor oil, sodium bicarbonate, methotrexate, ribavirin, doxycycline, tetracycline, and thalidomide.

2053,"Copper and human health: strategies for modeling biochemistry, genetics, and dose-response relationships","Copper (Cu) and its alloys are widely used in domestic and industrial applications. Cu is also an essential element in mammalian nutrition. Because both copper deficiency and copper excess produce adverse health effects, the dose-response curve is U-shaped, although the exact form is not yet well characterized. Many animal and human studies on copper have been conducted to provide a rich database from which data suitable for modeling the dose-response relationship for copper can be extracted. This review considers possible dose-response modeling strategies, including those based on comparative dose and categorical regression. Evaluating the usefulness of biologically based dose-response modeling techniques in understanding copper toxicity has been difficult at this time, as the mechanisms underlying copper-induced toxicity have not yet been fully elucidated. A dose-response modeling strategy has been proposed for copper toxicity in relation to both deficiency and excess. This modeling strategy was applied to a large number of studies on copper-induced toxicity, standardized for the severity of adverse health outcomes and selected on the basis of criteria reflecting the quality and relevance of individual studies. The use of a comprehensive database on copper-induced toxicity is essential for dose-response modeling, as there is insufficient information from any study to adequately characterize copper dose-response relationships. The dose-response modeling strategy envisioned here was designed to determine whether existing toxicity data for copper excess or deficiency can be used effectively to define the limits of the homeostatic range in humans and other species. This strategy will determine which techniques are most appropriate for this purpose, considering alternative techniques and low-dose extrapolation (including categorical regression, comparison dose, and determination of observed no-effect levels) to determine a point of departure. This analysis also serves to identify areas where additional data is needed to better define the characteristics of dose-response relationships for copper-induced toxicity with respect to excess or deficiency.

2058,Three cases of atypical Wilson's disease: Evaluation of the Leipzig scoring system in diagnosis.,"Introduction/Purpose: In the absence of any neurological finding, the diagnosis of this condition may pose a dilemma. In 2001, experts from the 8th International Conference on Wilson's disease (WD) and Menkes disease in Leipzig, Germany proposed a scoring system that could facilitate the diagnosis of WD. Methods/Results: Three patients were defined as having atypical WD because they presented after the age of 40. Two of the three patients presented with established cirrhosis and none of them had any neuropsychiatric symptoms. All three patients met the Leipzig diagnostic criteria recommended by EASL prior to confirmatory mutation analysis. Patient A died of liver failure despite treatment. Patients B and C remained with stable liver disease on chelation therapy. Conclusions: We believe that these patients represent a group that is likely to be missed in the diagnostic investigation of liver disease due to a combination of atypical features, such as onset in advanced age, presence of other confounders for liver disease, and sometimes absence of Kayser. -Fleischer rings.

2059,Liver cell death and anemia in Wilson's disease contains acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide,"Wilson's disease is caused by the accumulation of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in cells, resulting in cirrhosis of the liver and sometimes anemia. Here we show that Cu<sup>2+</sup> triggers hepatocyte apoptosis through acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) activation and ceramide release. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of Asm prevented Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and protected rats genetically predisposed to Wilson's disease from acute hepatocyte death, liver failure, and premature death. Cu<sup>2+</sup> induced the secretion of activated Asm from leukocytes, leading to ceramide release and phosphatidylserine exposure in erythrocytes, events also prevented by inhibition of Asm. Phosphatidylserine exposure resulted in immediate clearance of affected erythrocytes from the blood in mice. Accordingly, individuals with Wilson's disease showed elevated plasma Asm levels and a constitutive increase in ceramide- and phosphatidylserine-positive erythrocytes.

2061,Onset of psychiatric disorders and Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive pathology that results from loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B or WDNP) secondary to a change (over 60 currently identified), insertion, or deletion of the ATP7B gene located on the chromosome. 13q14.3-q21.1, involving a decrease or absence of copper transport in the bile and its accumulation in the body, especially in the brain. Wilson's disease is transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13. Heterozygous prevalence is evaluated as 1/90 and homozygous as 1/30,000. Consanguineous marriage, which is common in socially geographically isolated populations, increases the prevalence of the disease. Toxic amounts of copper accumulated in the liver from early childhood and perhaps earlier remain concentrated in the body for years. Therefore, cytological and histological changes can be detected in biopsies before clinical or biological symptoms of liver injury appear. The accumulation of copper in the liver is due to a defect in the biliary excretion of the metal and is always accompanied by a deficiency of ceruloplasmin; Protein synthesized from a transferred ATP7B gene that causes retention of copper ions in the liver. Detectable cellular abnormalities are of two types: liver lesions resulting in acute liver failure, acute hepatitis, and finally central nervous system lesions responsible for advanced cirrhosis and neurological and psychiatric disorders. In approximately 40-50% of patients, the first manifestation of Wilson's disease affects the central nervous system. Although copper is distributed in the liver first to the blood and then to other tissues, it has disastrous results only in the brain. Therefore, it can cause either a progressive neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. Wilson's disease begins as a hepatic, neurological or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of patients. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease may be psychiatric and according to the literature, they account for only 10% of cases. The disease may present with isolated behavioral problems, irrational syndrome, schizophrenic syndrome, or manic-depressive syndrome. Damage to the central nervous system may be more severe, so several differential diagnoses are discussed: *a late-onset psychotic disorder *a depressive state *mental confusion disorder. The clinical syndrome is complex. Indeed, it is polymorphism that predominates in the description of the psychiatric manifestations of the disease. This can lead to biased diagnostic navigation, especially as heavy sedative therapy may be required to suppress behavior problems. Clinically, Wilson's disease usually occurs between the ages of 10-20. It is rarely masked after the age of 40. Initial manifestations are hepatic (40% of cases), neurological (35%) or psychiatric (10%). The initial disorder may eventually take a haematological, renal, or mixed form in about 15% of cases. We have detailed the main clinical elements. In approximately 40-50% of patients, the first manifestation of the disease affects the central nervous system, where it can cause either a progressive neurological disease or psychiatric disorders. The ophthalmologic disorder is dominated by the Kayser-Fleischer ring, which represents a green or bronze colored ring around the cornea. It occupies the upper pole of the cornea, then the lower pole and stretches around the entire perimeter. It is usually only visible when viewed with a slit lamp. It disappears within 3-5 years on average following copper chelation therapy. Kayser-Fleischer ring has been described in exceptional cases of prolonged cholestasis, with the exception of Wilson's disease. At the hematological level, hyperhemolysis results from the toxicity of ionic copper, which is largely released in plasma with hepatocellular necrosis. Other manifestations may be found in the following organs: renal, osteoarticular, cardiac, endocrine, cutaneous, and teguments. Until 1952, diagnosis was based solely on clinical symptomatology. It can henceforth be clearly indicated by the description of a ceruloplasmin plasma concentration of less than 200 ml/l and a Kayser-Fleischer ring, even in the absence of any symptoms. Hepatic copper increases continuously during disease (3 to 25 mumol/g dry weight). On the other hand, the absence of a decrease in plasma ceruloplasmin does not make it possible to exclude the diagnosis. Conversely, there may be a decrease in ceruloplasmin except in Wilson's disease (nephritic syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, or severe hepatic failure). Kayser-Fleischer's ring is semi-constant among patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations (therefore, its absence is a very strong argument against the diagnosis). On the other hand, it may be absent during hepatic forms, and its absence in this case is not an argument against the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal abnormal signals of gray nuclei. If there is a family history of the disease, a genetic study is performed with contact analysis. Left untreated, Wilson's disease causes tissue lesions that are always fatal. Treatment is based on regulation of copper chelation, which improves prognosis, and zinc, which traps copper in a non-toxic form. Severe psychiatric disorders observed during Wilson's disease may require sedatives, but caution should be exercised because of possible neurological or liver side effects. Lithium appears to be an interesting treatment and, since it is not metabolized in the liver, it is theoretically indicated in patients with cirrhosis stage, given the scarcity of extrapyramidal symptoms and hepatic dysfunction. Although rare, it is important to approach Wilson's disease in psychiatry because psychiatric symptoms can prevent somatic disorders and help diagnose. We emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of pathology, the outcome of which is fatal in the absence of specific treatment. Â© 2007 L'Encephale, Paris, 2007.",,"Benhamla, T.;Tirouche, Y.

2062,WILSON's disease in childhood and adolescence. Diagnosis and treatment. [German],"The first requirement to diagnose WILSON'S disease is to think about it. Neurologists do a better job at this than pediatricians. The main clinical picture in children refers to the liver, in addition, acute hemolysis can occur. Neurological manifestations can only be seen normally in adolescents. Diagnosis is based on low serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, increased serum transaminases, elevated 24-hour urine copper excretion, and increased copper content of liver tissue. However, pitfalls in this diagnostic puzzle may arise. Haplotype analysis allows diagnosis in presymptomatic siblings of an index patient. Lifelong treatment with chelators such as penicillamine or trientine is mandatory, while zinc is an alternative in presymptomatic cases and after several years of copper detoxification with penicillamine.

2063,The LEC rat: a useful model to study oxidative stress and inflammation-related liver carcinogenesis.,"Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress is a mechanism of several diseases, including cancer. Oxidative stress can be defined as a shift of the imbalance between the production of cellular oxidant species and antioxidant capacity towards the former. Lipid peroxidation is one of the processes that occur during oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation products such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) are closely associated with carcinogenesis as they are potent mutagens and have been suggested as modulators of signaling pathways related to proliferation and apoptosis, the two processes involved in cancer development. The mechanisms by which oxidative stress causes tumor formation are still under investigation. The need for suitable in vivo models that can reflect inflammation-associated human carcinogenesis is clear. In this context, the mutant strain Long Evans Cinnamon-like (LEC) rat provides a promising model for investigating the relationship between oxidative stress-induced hepatitis and hepatocarcinogenesis, as it has been shown to enhance copper accumulation and oxidative-related spontaneous liver tumor formation. stress. In this review, findings related to oxidative stress and liver pathologies in LEC rats are discussed; We focus on the proposed mechanisms for HNE carcinogenesis.

Certain metabolic diseases respond to certain treatments and must be diagnosed early, especially in emergencies where rapid administration of treatment can prevent fatal consequences or irreversible neurological damage. The main diseases causing acute neurological syndrome in adults are urea cycle disorders, homocysteine metabolism disorders and porphyria. More rarely, Wilson's disease, amino acid diseases, organic aciduria or pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, beta oxidation disorders, or biotin metabolism may be involved. Most emergencies can be screened accurately with simple tests (serum ammonia, homocysteine, lactate, urine profiles, acylcarnitine pattern, amino acid and organic acid chromatography). The main treatable diseases for chronic conditions are Wilson's disease, homocysteine, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Refsum's disease, vitamin E deficiency, Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and neurotransmitter metabolism disorders.

2065,Effect of penicillamine and zinc on iron metabolism in Wilson's disease,"Aim. The physiology of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown, and little data are available on the true presence and progression of iron accumulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate parameters of iron metabolism, including hepatic iron concentration and urinary pro-hepcidine in follow-up liver biopsies and serum. Tools and methods. Twenty-three Wilson's disease patients receiving long-term treatment were included in the study. Results. Hepatic iron content was significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared to zinc-treated patients. Despite the normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism, serum and urinary pro-hepcidine concentrations were significantly higher in Wilson's disease patients than in healthy volunteers. Results. Long-term penicillamine therapy appears to be responsible for a more pronounced accumulation of iron in the liver. This observation may justify a revision of long-term Wilson's disease treatment modalities with penicillamine. The finding that serum and urinary pro-hepcidin is significantly increased in patients with Wilson's disease compared with healthy volunteers suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, although this needs to be confirmed by a study of hepatic hepcidin expression in these patients. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",,"Medici, V.;Leo, V.

However, neurological and psychiatric symptoms are common and may be the first clinical findings.

2071,Wilson's disease: an update. [Korean],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport that results in copper accumulation mainly in the liver, brain, and cornea. WD is the most common inherited liver disease with a prevalence of 1:37,000 in the pediatric population in Korea. Mutations in the ATP7B gene result in failure of biliary excretion of copper and defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. More than 300 mutations in the ATP7B gene have been identified so far. Mutations differ between ethnic groups. p.R778L (37% allele frequency), p.A874V (13%), p.L1083F (8%), and p.N1270S (6%) are common major mutations in Korea. Conflicting results have been reported regarding genotype/phenotype correlations of the most common mutations in various countries. There does not seem to be a correlation between the R778L mutation and age of onset or clinical manifestations in Korean patients. None of the laboratory parameters alone allow a definitive diagnosis of WD. In a nationwide WD study, 550 Korean patients had low serum ceruloplasmin (<20 mg/dL), high 24-hour urine copper (>100 micrograms), high hepatic copper content (>250 micrograms/g dry liver), and Kayser-Fleischer rings. found in 96%, 86%, 88% and 73%, respectively. The combination of any two of the above 4 laboratory findings is strong support for the diagnosis of WD. In the last few years, genetic testing has been playing an increasingly important role in diagnosing WD. Direct DNA sequencing confirmed WD in 98% of Korean patients. Two mutations were detected in 70% of the patients with characteristic biochemical and clinical findings of WD, and one mutation in 28%. Genetic testing through haplotype analysis or mutation analysis is the only reliable tool to distinguish heterozygous carriers from affected asymptomatic patients. Among chelators and zinc, the agents of first choice in specific clinical situations of WD are still a matter of debate. Because of the frequent side effects and initial neurological deterioration of penicillamine therapy, penicillamine therapy has been replaced by the less toxic trientine or zinc in the last few years. Trientine or tetrathiomolybdate is increasingly recommended as first-line therapy for neurological WD. Currently, liver transplantation is not recommended as the primary treatment for neurological WD. Recently published data indicate that initial zinc therapy in asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients and maintenance zinc therapy in patients after prolonged chelation is safe and effective. More research and new guidelines are needed on the appropriate management of patients with WD.",,"Seo, J. K.",2006,Sep,,0,0,

2076,B<inf>6</inf>-responsive disorders: A model of vitamin addiction,"Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of more than 100 enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the body, many of which are involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters. Insufficient levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, especially epilepsy. There are several different mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) inborn errors that affect pathways of vitamin B<inf>6</inf> metabolism; (ii) innate errors that lead to the accumulation of small molecules that react with and inactivate pyridoxal phosphate; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) celiac disease, which is thought to cause malabsorption of vitamins B<inf>6</inf>; (v) renal dialysis leading to increased losses of vitamin B<inf>6</inf> from the circulation; (vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of vitamins B<inf>6</inf>; and (vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes. The latter is a highly variable pyridoxine response, from 90% in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (delta-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency) to 50% in homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency) to 5% in ornithinemia with gyrate atrophy (ornithine delta). indicates the degree. -aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High doses of pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can have harmful side effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this should be considered in treatment regimens. However, in some patients, particularly infants with persistent epilepsy, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate may be life-saving, and in other infants with congenital metabolic disorders, B<inf>6</inf> treatment may be extremely beneficial.

2077,Zinc requirements and the risks and benefits of zinc supplementation,"An adult human contains 2-3 g of zinc, about 0.1% of which is replenished daily. On this basis, and based on estimates of the bioavailability of zinc, dietary recommendations are made for apparently healthy individuals. Absence of chemical, functional and/or physical manifestations of zinc deficiency is considered an indicator of proficiency. More specific data are rarely available. Changing food preferences and availability and new food preparation, preservation and processing technologies may require reassessment of historical data. Conservative estimates suggest that 25% of the world's population {large or equal to slope} is at risk of zinc deficiency. Most of those affected are poor and consume foods rich in zinc absorption inhibitors and/or contain relatively small amounts of bioavailable zinc, while seldom consume foods rich in zinc with high bioavailability. In contrast, among the relatively affluent, food choice is an important factor influencing the risk of zinc deficiency. An additional problem is the risk of chronic zinc toxicity caused by excessive consumption of zinc supplements, especially among relatively wealthy individuals. High zinc intake relative to copper can cause copper deficiency. A major unresolved challenge for maximum health benefit is the proximity of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and reference dose (RfD) for safe zinc intake. Current recommendations do not take into account the multiple dietary factors that affect the bioavailability of zinc and copper and the possibility of toxicity from zinc supplements. Therefore, the current assumed range between safe and unsafe zinc intakes is relatively narrow. Currently, the assessment of zinc nutrition is complex, involving a range of chemical and functional measurements that have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. This approach needs to be developed for early detection of zinc deficiency or excess. The increasing number of associations between zinc status and apparently normal health conditions and diseases in which supplemental zinc may be effective to prevent certain conditions points to the pharmacology of zinc compounds as a promising area. For example, the relationships between zinc and diabetes is an area where research can be fruitful. In our opinion, a multidisciplinary approach will most likely result in success in this fertile field for translation research. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",,"Maret, W.;Sandstead, H.

2079,Non-surgical potentially reversible dementias. [Spanish],"purposes. In this study, we review potentially reversible dementias. While the article mainly summarizes the causes that require treatment by medical means, causes of a surgical nature will be discussed in a second article. These articles try to avoid misdiagnosis and labeling in patients with a high potential to improve their cognitive impairment and to guide us to a more appropriate treatment. Development. Dementia is a public health problem mainly in countries with long life expectancy. It is seen in 3-11% of patients over 65 years of age and 20-50% in patients over 85 years of age. Most (50-70%) have Alzheimer's type dementia, followed by the vascular type (20%); There is a smaller percentage of cases of so-called subcortical dementia, as well as cases suggesting reversibility due to medical and/or surgical conditions. These latter cases are not easy to recognize and the incidence ranges from 0% to 37%, depending on the series. Once diagnosed, it's still difficult to say whether they will actually be reversible. Deficiencies, metabolic disorders, chronic diseases, toxins, etc. The most common causes, such as these, should be identified as early as possible with clinical observation and laboratory use. Results. While the potential for improvement in patients with reversible dementia is still a matter of debate, this brief review guides us in our investigation of its causes and management, as late diagnosis and treatment is likely to be the cause of poor progress. . © 2005, Revista de NeurologiA.",,"Barquet-Platon, E.

2081,"Chronological changes in tissue copper, zinc and iron in toxic dairy rat and effects of copper loading","The toxic milk (tx) mouse is a rodent model for Wilson's disease, an inherited copper overload disorder. Here we evaluated the effect of copper accumulation on zinc and iron metabolism in the tx mouse. Copper, zinc and iron concentrations in the liver, kidney, spleen and brain of control and copper-loaded animals were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Copper concentration increased dramatically in the liver and was also significantly higher in the spleen, kidney, and brain of control tx mice in the first few months of life compared to normal DL mice. Hepatic zinc increased with age in the tx mouse, but zinc concentrations in other organs were normal. Liver and kidney iron concentrations were significantly lower at birth in tx mice, but increased rapidly at 2 months of age, comparable to control mice. Iron concentration in the spleen was significantly higher in tx mice but lower in 5-day old tx offspring. Copper loading studies showed that normal DL mice that received 300 mg/l of copper in their diet for 3 months maintained normal liver, kidney, and brain copper, zinc, and iron levels. Copper loading of tx mice did not increase already high liver copper concentrations, but spleen and brain copper concentrations increased. Despite a significant elevation of copper in the brain of copper-loaded tx mice, no behavioral changes were observed. The livers of copper-loaded tx mice had a lower zinc concentration than control tx mice, while the kidneys had twice the iron concentration, suggesting increased erythrocyte hemolysis in copper-loaded mutants. © Springer 2006.",,"Allen, K.

2084,Hepatic fibrosis treatment: reversing the underlying disease process,"Cirrhosis is considered an irreversible final stage of all liver diseases. Available information indicates that fibrosis is part of the dynamic liver repair process. Understanding this repair process will provide better approaches to stopping, healing or reversing fibrosis. The diagnosis of cirrhosis is currently made by liver biopsy and can be confirmed by imaging in most advanced cases. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard but has several limitations: sampling error, size of the biopsy, and both interobserver and interobserver discrepancies. Therefore, many patients may be incorrectly staged for the degree of fibrosis at their initial biopsy and subsequent reexamination. While a 1-stage reduction between consecutive biopsies is a result of sampling error, a reduction of at least 2 stages in cirrhosis more likely indicates reversal of cirrhosis. There are several reported cases of cirrhosis associated with different liver diseases. Resolution of fibrosis in most of these diseases is associated with successful treatment of the underlying etiology (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, iron overload, Wilson's disease, alcohol withdrawal, metabolic syndrome in fatty liver disease, and decompression of biliary obstruction). . Another important feature of cirrhosis reversal is successful control of inflammation (eg, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis B, C, and D).",,"Servin-Abad, L.;Schiff, E.

The most important part of the diagnostic process is often the act of viewing metabolic liver disease as a possible cause of symptoms. There are a number of possible phenotypes of chronic liver disease, and a number of metabolic diseases may explain them. A logical approach is to first define the phenotype and then consider indicators that may suggest metabolic disease. These may include family history, association of symptoms with feeding or fasting, and possible dietary triggers. The specific diagnosis will usually depend on the logical selection of laboratory tests, having defined the phenotype and considering potential metabolic causes.

This autosomal recessive disorder is caused by a copper metabolism disorder due to a mutation in the ATP7B transporter. Due to the inhibition of the release of copper into the bile, an excess of copper accumulates in the body. Since effective treatment is available, it is very important to recognize this disease in the presymptomatic or early stages, when it is reversible. Diagnosis is usually easy, but available tests (measurement of ceruloplasmin and blood, urine, and liver copper levels) can be misleading. There is no single test with 100% sensitivity in screening, and no test provides 100% specificity when used alone. Diagnosis is currently based on a combination of clinical findings and results of laboratory tests.

2091,Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper overload. A key feature of this disease is its wide phenotypic and genotypic variability. It is caused by mutations of the ATP 7B gene located on chromosome 13, which encodes the hepatic copper transport protein. More than 300 mutations of this gene have been identified. This protein enables copper to be transported in hepatocytes, combined with apoceruloplasmin, and excreted from the bile. Clinical signs are heterogeneous in presentations dominated by neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms, as well as at the age of first symptoms. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment with chelators or zinc are essential for prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in cases of fulminant hepatitis, end-stage liver cirrhosis and should be considered in treatment-resistant neurological forms. Regular follow-up with monitoring of adverse effects of treatment and compliance is essential. Any discontinuation of treatments will involve re-emergence or re-exacerbation of symptoms over a highly variable but sustained manner. Such relapses are often brutal and can be extremely serious, especially since the response to subsequent treatment is often poor. © Masson.",,"Woimant, F.;Chaine, P.;Favrole, P.;Mikol, J.;Chappuis, P.",2006,June,,0,0,

Management of liver failure is challenging and often requires the concerted efforts of many specialists. Critically ill patients with hepatic impairment encompass a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from acute hepatic failure in a patient with no previous history of liver disease to acute chronic hepatic failure. The initial assessment and management of acute liver failure is reviewed in the pre-transplant setting with an emphasis on the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema. Current management of complications from decompensated chronic liver disease, such as portal hypertensive bleeding; infection, renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy are discussed.

The effect caused by the drug depends on the affinity of the drug molecule for its specific receptor. For chiral receptors such as receptor proteins, the chirality of the interacting molecule plays an important role in defining the molecule's biological activity towards receptor affinity and subsequent drug action. The biological activity of a racemate is in most cases the contribution of an active enantiomer, while the other enantiomer may be an undesirable commodity. In some cases, different enantiomers may have different activities. Therefore, a recent trend in drug development is to use the active enantiomer as a drug to avoid unnecessary or unwanted component loading into the body.

Regardless of treatment, all LEC rats exhibited higher locomotor activity, less habituation to the startle response, or a lower PPI compared with Wistar rats. The copper content of all brain regions studied, with the exception of the medulla oblongata of LEC rats, was significantly lower than that of Wistar rats. Also, lower norepinephrine content and higher dopamine and serotonin content were observed in the striatum and nucleus accumbens region of LEC rats compared to Wistar rats. Although copper supplementation did not affect brain copper content, it reduced PPI in both Wistar and LEC rats. In contrast, d-penicillamine supplementation decreased both brain copper content and locomotor activity and increased startle amplitude only in Wistar rats.

2106,Genetic disorders of copper metabolism. [Japanese],"Genetic disorders of copper metabolism, mainly in Menkes disease and Wilson's disease, were reviewed. Menkes disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7A gene and is X-linked. In this disease, copper absorption in the intestine is impaired and copper deficiency occurs. Clinical features such as neurological degeneration, connective tissue abnormalities and hair abnormalities appear at 2-3 months of age. The serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin are significantly low, while the copper concentration in cultured fibroblasts is very high. The currently accepted treatment is parenteral administration of copper. Neurological degeneration can be prevented when treatment is started in the neonatal period. Wilson's disease, which is caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, has an autosomal recessive inheritance and has a high prevalence rate. This disease is associated with the toxic effects of copper, which accumulates in many tissues, including the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. Copper and ceruloplasmin serum levels are significantly low, while copper concentration is very high in the liver. Diagnosis is made by signs of increased urinary copper excretion and copper accumulation in the liver. Gene analysis can also be used for diagnosis. All patients should be treated with chelating agents or zinc. However, some patients with neurological conditions respond poorly to these treatments. In addition, these treatments are ineffective in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Liver transplantation is now accepted in these patients. In these patients, discomfort can be prevented by early treatment with chelation agents or zinc. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment is very important for Menkes disease and Wilson's disease.",,"Kodama, H.",2006,January,,0,0,
2107,Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper excess. This disease is caused by mutations of the ATP7B gene chromosome 13. The discovery of the gene provided a better understanding of the relationship of cytosolic copper trafficking with ceruloplasmin synthesis. Symptomatic patients may present with hepatic, neurological or psychiatric forms. Clinical and phenotypic evidence provide only hypothetical arguments for this disease that can be routinely evaluated by molecular analysis. This disease can be effectively treated with chelation and zinc therapy.

[Japanese],"We experienced a 45-year-old female patient who could be diagnosed with Wilson's disease. The patient, who was admitted to our hospital in 1998 due to general weakness, was diagnosed with idiopathic portal hypertension. However, the patient suffered from progressive neurological disability since July 2004 and was admitted to our hospital in August 2005. Laboratory data showed a decrease in serum ceruloplasmin and an increase in 24-hour urine copper. Liver biopsy showed copper deposition in hepatocytes. The patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. His brother was also diagnosed with Wilson's disease due to the copper-related marker, the presence of Kayser-Fleisher rings, and copper deposits in hepatocytes.

2109,Clinical and neuropathological report of Menkes disease. [Chinese],"Objective: To review the clinical and autopsy neuropathological changes of a Menkes disease patient who was mistakenly diagnosed with Wilson's disease and to reveal the clinical and neuropathological differences between these two diseases. Methods and Results: An 8-year-old girl had progressive lower extremity weakness, multiple joint deformities, claw-like ulnar drift deformity in both hands, osteoporosis, lead-tube stiffness in the extremities, tremor, dysphasia, and mental retardation. High palatal arch, gingival bleeding, epistaxis and urinary retention etc. there was. Physical examination: The patient cannot perform alternating motion test of both hands, heel-knee-tibia test, finger-nose test and shows pyramidal symptoms. Laboratory examination: serum ceruloplasmin was 0.02 mumol/L. Clinical diagnosis: hepatolenticular degeneration (also called Wilson's disease) complicated by osteopathy. Treated with D-penicillamine (0.3 g), oral administration 3/day. Signs and symptoms progressively worsened. He died at the age of 16. Autopsy neuropathological results: cerebral parenchyma showed extensive atrophy, bilateral subcortical white matter of frontoparietal lobe showed severe atrophy, degeneration and cavitation. Optical microscopic observation: No obvious changes were seen in the basal ganglia tissue. Irregular vascular lumen and endangium contraction can sometimes be found. In the cortex neurons of the granular cell layer, it was markedly reduced and the white matter showed extensive demyelinating degeneration with vesiculation. Massive astrocytes, phagocytes, ectopic neurons and satellite cells proliferated without perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Neuron loss and necrosis were not observed in the caudate nucleus head, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus, but satellite cells around the neurons increased significantly. There were many activated microgliocytes. Residues can be found in neurons in the tail of the caudate nucleus. Opaski cells and Alzheimer type II cells were not seen. The characteristic changes in the cerebellum are as follows: residual Purkinje cells presented obvious abnormal dendritic afforestation (referred to as ""weeping willow""), increased perisomatic processes and focal axonal swelling (""torpedoes""); and Purkinje cells accumulating in the granular cell layer. Conclusion: 1) Menkes disease can be seen in women and can start in childhood or early adulthood. 2) There is significant massive white matter degeneration, necrosis and cavitation. The basal ganglia that remain quite well are inconsistent with clinical signs and symptoms. Neurons were markedly reduced in the cortex granular cell layer. Abnormal dendritic tree growth occurs in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. These are all characteristic signs of Menkes disease.",,"Gao, J.;Guo, Y. P.;Gao, S. F.;Zhang, Z. X.;Huang, H. F.;Ren, H.

His general cognitive functions were below his age and he was diagnosed with dysphasia. The boy was transferred to a special class for children with learning problems. Three months later, he was referred to us again because of acute epigastric pain. The only abnormal laboratory finding was a slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase level. Although symptoms resolved within a few days, transaminase levels remained above normal for the next 6 months. Further diagnostic studies revealed low serum ceruloplasmin concentration and high 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The hepatic copper concentration in the liver biopsy was high (2900 µg/g dry weight), confirming the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Brain MRI showed slight changes in white matter. The patient's asymptomatic sister was also diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Both siblings began penicillamine therapy and a copper-restricted diet. The copper content of the household water was found to be above average and a new plumbing system was installed. One year after the start of treatment, transaminase concentrations returned to normal and both siblings were symptom-free. After 2 years of therapy, the patient was able to return to his regular school.

The first case is a 22-year-old male patient who had a 15-year history of the disease and was diagnosed with Wilson's disease as a result of the examinations. Alpha-fetoprotein level was found to be high and a 3.5 cm liver mass was seen on computed tomography. A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made. Radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation were successfully performed. The second case is a 24-year-old female patient who presented with fulminant hepatitis. Copper excretion and ceruloplasmin levels in the urine were suggestive of Wilson's disease. No improvement was observed despite chelation therapy. Plasma exchange therapy was applied for seven days. His clinical condition improved and transplantation was no longer necessary. In conclusion, although hepatoma is rarely seen in Wilson's disease, patients should be examined regularly in order to make a diagnosis at a treatable stage.

Initially, the neurological symptoms were misinterpreted as a side effect of haloperidol, but the consulted neurologist suggested an additional diagnostic procedure confirming Wilson's disease. The clinical manifestation of this disease, which improved with neuroleptic and chelation therapy, was psychiatric symptomatology and abnormal involuntary movements. An interdisciplinary approach with a good collaboration of psychiatrists and neurologists is very important for Wilson's disease because early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical for prognosis. This case reminds us that involuntary movements can be a side effect of antipsychotics as well as clinical manifestations of some diseases such as Wilson's, Huntington's and Fuhr's diseases.

2114,Hereditary metabolic liver disease,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The past decade has seen significantly improved understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of genetic hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. This year, further progress has been made in the molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology and management of these inherited metabolic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Both Wilson's disease and genetic hemochromatosis involve defects in the transport of heavy metals and their accumulation in hepatocytes. In alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, defective alpha1-antitrypsin intrahepatocyte accumulation occurs. As a more complete picture of the molecular biology of transport-related proteins and genes developed, so did our understanding of their interactions. The molecular genetics of these diseases explain the different phenotypes seen. Finally, elucidating the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases has led to new ideas in their clinical management. SUMMARY: Recent developments detailed in this article have important implications for the future. Recent research has gracefully shifted the paradigm in our understanding to one that focuses on defects in the genetic machinery of the cell and how better understanding of these defects can lead to potential new treatments. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,"Schilsky, M.

2116,Comparison of lowering copper levels with tetrathiomolybdate and zinc in mouse tumor and doxorubicin models,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has demonstrated excellent efficacy in animal models of cancer and injury models that produce fibrotic or inflammatory damage to the lung, heart, and liver, possibly by reducing copper levels and availability. Trials in human patients are ongoing. If TM's effectiveness really lies in lowering copper levels, other anticancer drugs should be equally effective. Zinc is a copper inhibitor drug with proven efficacy in Wilson's disease, a copper toxicity disease. In this study, the efficacy of zinc was compared with TM in a mouse tumor model and a doxorubicin model of heart damage and hypothesized that the 2 drugs would have equivalent efficacy when copper availability was reduced to an equivalent extent. Zinc had no effect on inhibiting the growth of a tumor that was markedly inhibited by TM, and zinc was found to be less effective than TM in preventing cardiac damage from doxorubicin. This study demonstrates that the mechanism of action of TM in protecting against doxorubicin toxicity is due to its anticopper effects, as copper supplementation abolishes the protective effect of TM. It is further hypothesized that the differences between TM and zinc may be due to the mechanism of action where TM binds copper already present in the body, but zinc does not. Â© 2006 Mosby, Inc.

2119,Metabolic liver diseases. [Croatian],"The most common metabolic liver diseases are Wilson's disease (WD), hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to its accumulation in the body and results in a range of possible hepatic, neurological and psychiatric sequelae. Hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disease in white people of northern European descent. The features of iron overload are often unrecognized and are only diagnosed in the setting of advanced disease. If left untreated, WD and hemochromatosis are fatal. On the other hand, patients who are detected early and undergoing copper/iron reduction therapy, including penicillamine/phlebotomy, may have a normal life expectancy. Given the genetic basis of the condition, counseling and screening of the patient's first-degree relatives is vital.

Exposing samples to an X-ray beam is the basis of X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). This technique provides excellent trace element sensitivity; and the opportunity to image whole cells and quantify elements on a cell-by-cell basis, due to the large depth of penetration of hard X-rays. In addition, because samples prepared for XFM do not require sectioning, they can be examined close to their native, hydrated state by cryogenic approaches. Until a few years ago, XFM was not widely available to the biomedical community and rarely offered a resolution better than a few microns. This changed drastically with the development of the third generation synchrotrons. Recent examples of basic imaging of cells and tissues demonstrate the maturation of the XFM imaging technique in an elegant and informative way to gain insight into cellular processes.

2121,Wilson's disease: an update for clinical biochemists,"Wilson's disease (WH) is a member of a family of genetic disorders characterized by dysregulated copper metabolism. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, and mutations lead to dysfunction of the p-type ATPase ATP-7B, an important copper-transporting protein. The result is copper deposition in sensitive tissues, particularly in the liver and basal ganglia of the brain, which can lead to symptomatic hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric disease. Patients with liver disease tend to present in the first two decades of life, while those with mainly neurological symptoms tend to present later. Presentation with fulminant liver failure due to hepatic decompensation may require liver transplantation. Hemolytic disease is a rare complaint. Although laboratory research has traditionally focused on the measurement of free and total copper and ceruloplasmin in serum, and copper levels in urine with and without penicillamine loading, recent reports suggest that genotyping studies may have a role in the diagnosis and characterization of WD. Studies of radiocopper uptake have fallen out of favor, but a new approach using stable isotopes shows promise. Treatment focuses on limiting copper accumulation using Penicillamine. Zinc Acetate or Trientine offers alternatives if penicillamine is not tolerated. Although untreated WD is inevitably fatal, the prognosis is generally good once diagnosed, and this is what warrants a high index of clinical suspicion in cases of unexplained liver or neurologic disease in children or adults younger than 45 years. years old.",,"Chaloner, C.",2006,,,0,0,

2126,Extrapyramidal symptoms in Wilson's disease are associated with olfactory dysfunction.,"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized primarily by copper deposition in the liver and brain. Because copper deposition in the brain leads to disturbances in basal ganglia function, neurological type patients typically present with hypo- and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal symptoms, and Parkinsonism is very common. Although there are numerous reports of olfactory defects in primary neurodegenerative disorders, olfactory function has not been investigated in metabolic disorders with extrapyramidal features. Twenty-four patients with Wilson's disease participated in the study. All patients were treated pharmacologically. These consisted of only patients with liver disease (asymptomatic: including mild enzyme elevation in subjects: individuals; n = 11) and/or with neurological symptoms at the time of testing (n = 13). Twenty-one patients underwent both [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). ). The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was assessed using a clinical score system ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). Psychophysical tests were performed on all patients using ""Sniffin' Sticks"", which included olfactory threshold, discrimination and identification tests. The results of this study revealed that Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms showed significant olfactory dysfunction compared to hepatic-type patients. Individuals who are more severely affected neurologically also present with a more pronounced lack of smell. Interestingly, long-term treatment with penicillamine had no significant effect on olfactory function. Olfactory function was not significantly correlated with the presence of MRI-visible lesions in the basal ganglia or any regional glucose metabolism as measured by [18]FDG-PET. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the underlying pathological changes associated with a marked increase in copper content in this brain region, along with degeneration and loss of neurons in the basal ganglia, play a role in olfactory deficit.

2127,Clinical and genetic profile in Wilson's disease: A case report with family pedigree. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in copper accumulation in many organs. Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring represents a typical symptom in Wilson's patients. ATP7B, the gene product of the Wilson disease gene, is expressed in hepatocytes and plays a critical role in copper transport and secretion. Mutations involving this gene leading to amino acid substitutions reduce the ATPase enzyme's affinity for copper and prevent copper from being transported from hepatocytes to the bile duct. More than 200 mutations have been identified in 21 coding exons of the Wilson disease gene ATP7B, the most common European being His1069Gln (30-60% in European patients). Wilson's disease may present with a variety of clinical symptoms, usually liver and neuropsychiatric disease. Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (prevalence 1:00000) is based on a combination of clinical and neurological symptoms (Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring, MRI), a multi-parametric clinical chemistry panel (ceruloplasmin, 24-hour copper excretion in urine, serum). copper) and molecular genetic analysis of ATP7B gene mutations. Symptomatic patients are treated with the chelating agents D-penicillamine or trientine, and in the second phase, usually zinc. Life-long treatment is necessary and provides a near-normal life expectancy. Here we report the long-term follow-up of a 30-year-old Wilson patient who exhibited compound heterozygosity of His1069Gln - Asn1270Ser mutations in the ATP7B gene diagnosed by LightCycler real-time polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing of exon 18. Molecular family-pedigree analysis over four generations revealed seven additional carriers of heterozygous mutations. Treatment of the index patient with the high-dose chelating agent D-penicillamine (1500 mg/day) in combination with zinc (150 mg/day) can normalize copper encephalopathy and significantly reduce neurological symptoms. The Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring was permanent. Wilson's disease should be considered if there is any liver disease of unknown cause or neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Early diagnosis and treatment protect patients and their presymptomatic siblings from devastating organ damage. However, the diagnosis of Wilson's disease may be missed if only established clinical and laboratory tests are used as diagnostic criteria. We report the diagnosis of the disorder using genetic analysis of ATP7B in a presymptomatic sibling who escaped diagnosis during family screening 18 years ago.

Molecular analysis of ATP7B was performed; revealed that the two siblings shared the same compound heterozygous mutations (G943D and 2299delC).

We aimed to describe and correlate brain MRI abnormalities with clinical features in WD. Methods: MRI evaluation was performed in 100 patients (57 males, 43 females; mean age 19.3+/-8.9 years) using standard protocols. All but 18 patients were using copper removing agents. Their histories, clinical findings and disease severity scores were noted. Results: Mean disease duration and treatment duration were 8.3+/-10.8 years and 7.5+/-7.1 years, respectively. Brain MRI was abnormal in all 93 symptomatic patients. The most prominent observations were atrophy of the cerebrum (70%), brain stem (66%), and cerebellum (52%). Signal abnormalities were also noted: putamen (72%), caudate (61%), thalami (58%), midbrain (49%), pons (20%), cerebral white matter (25%), cortex (9%), medulla (12%) and cerebellum (10%). Characteristic T2-W globus pallidal hypointensity (34%), ""Giant panda's face"" sign (12%), T1-W striatal hyperintensity (6%), central pontine myelinosis (7%), and bright clostral sign (4%) are also detected. MRI changes correlated with disease severity scores (P<0.001) but not with disease duration. Conclusion: MRI changes were universal but varied and included nearly all structures of the brain in symptomatic patients. A fair correlation between MRI observations and various clinical features provides an explanation for the variable manifestations of the disease. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"Sinha, S.;Taly, A.

The study was carried out on 20 newborn rats reared from 40 female and six male rats. Daily 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> DPA doses were given to the experimental and control groups as<sup>-1</sup> and saline intraperitoneally (ip). Body and lung weights were determined to assess neonatal maturation. Serum Cu levels were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and ceruloplasmin (Cp) activities were measured spectrophotometrically. Neonatal lung tissue elastin, desmosine (DES) and isodesmosine (IDES) levels were measured by HPLC. The results showed that DPA treatment caused a decrease in skin elasticity and a decrease in body and lung weights in newborns in the experimental group. When compared with the control group, serum Cu levels and Cp activity were found to be significantly lower in both mothers and newborns of the experimental groups. Lung DES, IDE and elastin values of newborns in the experimental group were decreased compared to the control group. In conclusion, our findings suggest that 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> DPA, a dose used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystinuria, causes disease. delayed neonatal maturation, decreased perinatal DES-IDES crosslinks and pup lung elastin levels. Another conclusion to be drawn from this study is that even low levels of Cu depletion due to DPA administration cause a change in cross-linking in lung elastin during the perinatal period.

2137,The importance of molecular genetic analysis in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. [Check],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper (Cu) transport with a frequency of 1:40,000 live births. The disease is caused by a deficiency of the copper-transporting ATPase - ATP7B (13q14.3-q21.1). The disorder manifests itself as a chronic liver disease and/or neurological disorder due to copper deposition in various tissues, mainly liver and brain. The most common manifestation of WD is between 8 and 20 years of age. Diagnosis includes determination of serum ceruloplasmin and Cu, detection of Cu in 24-hour urine collection, testing with penicillamine, liver biopsy to determine Cu content in liver dry weight, and DNA diagnosis, if available. Interpretation of biochemical findings changes due to DNA analysis of mutations. There is no definite relationship between the genotype and the phenotype of the patient yet. Treatment of the disease is evolving and is now accepted as standard therapy for hepatic from childhood with chelates and zinc. In the last stage, the solution will be liver transplantation. The group included 22 children aged 5 to 17 years. Group 1 (12) consisted of heterozygotes for WD, siblings or offspring of patients with WD confirmed by DNA diagnosis. Group 2 (10) were patients with hepatic form of WD, confirmed by DNA diagnosis and assessment of hepatic dry weight copper content. The control group consisted of 11 children aged 4-16 years. In 4 probands of group 1, 33.3%, the authors found that the blood ceruloplasmin level fell below 0.2 g/l (ranging from 0.12 to 0.43 g/l). They demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) for CP in serum among heterozygotes for WD; namely among children of mothers with WD and siblings of probands with WD. Threshold levels of copper were determined in the baseline urine collection of 4 children (ie 0.6 mumol). In the test with penicillamine, the copper level in the 24-hour urine collection of 11 heterozygotes did not exceed 12.5 mumol. In 7 children of group 2, the authors demonstrated a serum ceruloplasmin level of less than 0.2 g/l, ie 70% (between 0.03 and 0.22 g/l). For copper, all 24-hour urine collections contained residues as high as 0.6 mumol (between 0.8 and 2.67 mumol). Contrary to expectations, levels higher than 1.6 mumol were detected in only 4 children. A statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in urinary excretion of 24-hour copper between the control group of healthy children and probands with WD was also discovered according to the gender of the individuals investigated. In the test with penicillamine, the urinary Cu residue was less than 20 mumols (indicated as an extreme level for WD) in 8 probands. Urinary copper excretion after penicillamine administration does not contribute to the differentiation of heterozygotes and patients with WD. An important screening method is the determination of copper content in hepatic dry weight. However, the authors assume that the interpretation of these findings in terms of DNA diagnosis of mutations will change in the near future. According to these results, Kayser-Fleischer ring examinations are not very important in early childhood liver forms. They discovered that in a proband with the IVS12+1G>A/G1355C genotype, the more severe the form of mutation shown in a WD patient, the more severe the clinical course of the disease can be expected. Severe mutation in heterozygotes can mimic WD. The authors recorded an episode of anxiety disorder in a girl with the genotype H1069Q/W779X. Children with the H1069Q allele showed minimal brain damage, graphomotor insufficiency, and mildly abnormal EEG at baseline activity without clinical correlation.",,"Prochazkova, D.;Konecna, P.;Vrabelova, S.;Kozak, L.;Dastych, M.;Hrstkova, H.",2005,,,0,0,

2139,Wilson's disease in children: 37 years of experience and a revised King's for liver transplant,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare liver-derived copper metabolism disorder. The prognostic criteria defined by our group in 1986 to predict death without transplantation have not been universally validated. The clinical features of 88 children were reviewed, 74 retrospectively and 14 prospectively. Retrospectively obtained data from patients who died or survived long-term chelation were used to evaluate the validity of our old scoring system and to design a new prognostic index. was evaluated in 14 patients who were subsequently recruited prospectively. Using the old scoring system, 5 children with a score of >= 7, the cutoff for death without transplantation, survived, while 4 children with a score of <= 7 died (sensitivity 87% and specificity 90%). At the time of presentation, a new index based on serum bilirubin, international normalized ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and white cell count (WCC) set a cut-off score of 11 for death and proved to be 93% sensitive and 98% specific, % with a positive result. Predictive value of 88. When the new index was evaluated prospectively in 14 patients, it predicted the need for transplantation only in 4 patients who needed it, although 1 child who got 11 points with medical treatment survived. In conclusion, the new Wilson Index is more sensitive and specific than the old scoring system in predicting mortality without transplantation, but needs to be validated in a larger number of patients.

2140,"Wilson's disease, the first manifestation of polyneuropathy",Background: Recognition of Wilson's disease (WD) is sometimes difficult due to its various manifestations. Peripheral neuropathy is rarely reported in the context of WD. Purpose: To report an unusual patient with WD whose initial manifestation was peripheral neuropathy. Design: Case report. Setting: Neurology department in a tertiary referral center. Method: Personal observation. Conclusion: A 17-year-old man who was eventually diagnosed with WD was presented with polyneuropathy at least 6 months before he developed the more typical symptoms of WD. Electrophysiological and pathological studies suggested a mixed type of neuropathy. WD treatment resulted in clinical and electrophysiological improvement.

2145,Liver transplantation for Wilson's disease: The burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders,"retrospective analysis of data on liver transplantation for Wilson's disease (WD) was performed among the Italian Liver Transplant Centers. Thirty-seven cases were identified. The main indication for liver transplantation was chronic advanced liver disease in 78% of patients. Mixed hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were recorded as 32.3%. Eight patients presented with fulminant hepatic failure; 44.8% were receiving medical treatment. Patient and graft survival at 3 months, 12 months, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years post-transplant was 91.8%, 89.1%, 82.9%, 75.6% and 58.8%, and 85.3%, 83.0%, 77.1%, respectively. %, 70.3% and 47.2%. Neurological symptoms improved significantly after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), but the survival of patients with mixed liver and neuropsychiatric involvement was significantly lower than patients with liver disease alone (P = 0.04). WD, characterized by hepatic involvement alone, is a rare but good indication for liver transplantation in which specific medical therapy has failed. Patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations have a significantly shorter life expectancy, although liver transplantation has a positive effect on neurological symptoms. In conclusion, a combination of liver and neuropsychiatric conditions deserves careful neurological evaluation, which should contraindicate OLT in the case of severe neurological impairment.

2148,Role of animal models in the study of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions,"Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are a major problem due to their largely unpredictable nature. If we better understand the mechanisms of these reactions, they may be predictable. Their unpredictable nature also makes mechanistic studies, especially prospective clinical studies, very difficult. Animal models are vital to most biomedical research and are almost the only way to test key hypotheses of DHRs, such as the involvement of reactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRs are also unpredictable in animals. For example. However, sulfonamide-induced DHRs in large breed dogs appear to be valid as they are very similar to DHRs that occur in humans. the incidence is only ~0.25% and large breed dogs are difficult to use as animal models. Two more practical models are penicillin-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat and nevirapine-induced skin rash in rats. Toxicity in these models is clearly immune-mediated. In other models, such as amodiaquine-induced agranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the drug induces an immune response, but no clinical toxicity. This finding suggests that regulatory mechanisms generally limit toxicity. Many of the key features of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as memory and tolerance, are quite different, suggesting that the mechanisms are also significantly different. More animal models are needed to examine the various mechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, progress in understanding such responses would likely be slow. Copyright ©2003.

2149,"The basis, toxicology and chelation therapy of zinc and copper","Both zinc and copper are essential minerals required for a variety of cellular functions. While these metals are essential, they can be toxic in excessive amounts, especially in certain genetic disorders. Zinc and copper homeostasis results from a coordinated regulation by different proteins involved in the uptake, excretion and intracellular storage/traffic of these metals. Apart from the zinc transporter (ZnT) families and Cu-ATPase, metallothionein is an important storage protein for zinc and copper. Metallothioneins are intracellular polypeptides with a remarkable ability to bind metallic ions. These proteins bind both essential metals essential to the organism and toxic metals (for example, cadmium or lead). Metallothioneins play a critical role in maintaining zinc and copper homeostasis. In this review, we outline the toxicity of zinc and copper and the potential treatment of zinc or copper toxicity with zinc or copper-specific chelators, as well as a strategy for upregulating metallothionein. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Cai, L.;Li, X.

2150,Hepatic Wilson's disease: Initial treatment and long-term management,"This article is based on the experience of 320 patients with Wilson's disease between 1954 and 2000. These patients were at The Boston City Hospital between 1954 and 1955, and University College Hospital London between 1955 and 1957; Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1967-87 and The Middlesex Hospital London, 1988-2000. Wilson's disease is not strictly a gastroenterological disease, but a genetically determined metabolic disease mediated by failure of biliary copper excretion. Mutation carried on chromosome 13q14.3: contains a copper-transporting ATPase (ATPase 7B); More than 250 mutations are known. The first organ affected is the liver, then many other tissues, primarily the brain, as well as the eyes, kidneys, bone marrow and osteo-skeletal system. This article is about the hepatic form of the disease. Liver disease can be acute, subacute or chronic; may be progressive or apparently self-limiting. Up to 10% of patients may also have hemolysis, which may subsequently lead to the formation of pigment gallstones. The management of liver disease is not discussed in this article, which is strictly limited to the therapeutic options available for copper elimination and the long-term well-being of the patient. It should be noted that all close relatives of the patient should be screened for the presymptomatic stage of the disease, so if they are found to be homozygous carriers for the mutation, preventive treatment can be started.

2151,"Inhibitory effects of trientine, a copper chelating agent, on the induction of DNA strand breaks in kidney cells of Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats.","The effects of treatment with trientine, a specific copper chelating agent, on copper accumulation and induction of DNA strand breaks were investigated in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model for human Wilson's disease. At 12 to 18 weeks of age, copper accumulated in the kidneys of LEC rats in an age-dependent manner. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, their renal copper contents did not increase and were maintained at the same levels as in 4-week-old LEC rats. Estimation of the amounts of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) by the comet assay showed that in a significant population of DNA from SSBs, LEC rat renal cortex cells were induced at approximately 12 weeks of age, and the amounts of SSBs increased in an age-related condition. At 12 to 18 weeks. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, the observed number of cells with DNA damage was reduced, suggesting that stimulation of DNA SSBs was inhibited and/or SSBs were repaired during treatment with trientine. The results show that SSBs of DNA in LEC rat kidney cells are induced before clinical signs of liver injury appear, and treatment of LEC rats with trientine reduces the number of DNA strand breaks.

2152,Homozygosity for a large partial gene deletion of the C-terminal end of ATP7B in a Wilson patient without hepatic and neurologic manifestations.,"We identified partial gene deletion of ATP7B in a patient with hepatic-onset Wilson's disease. The deletion involved exon 20, which contains large portions of the side introns. Breakpoints were determined and the size of the deletion was determined as 2144 bp. The deletion is predicted to result in a mutated protein product containing 45 abnormal amino acids after transmembrane domain 7 and lacking transmembrane domain 8 as well as the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. This is the first time a partial gene deletion has been demonstrated in ATP7B. The patient presented at the age of 10 with liver manifestations, including severe jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, ascites, and spider nevi. Liver biopsy showed early signs of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Kayser-Fleischer ring was present but no neurological findings. All symptoms disappeared with penicillamine treatment. This indicates that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of ATP7B is not essential for its neurological function. Large deletions in ATP7B may be an overlooked cause of Wilson's disease. Patients homozygous for the deletions may be valuable for understanding the function of various regions of the ATP7B protein. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Moller, L.

The aim of this study is to raise awareness of a possibly underdiagnosed syndrome. Clinical recognition of the syndrome in infants and children with and without HSCR is important for patient selection for cytogenetic and molecular analysis. Methods Clinical features of four Italian patients are reported. FISH and mutation analyzes were performed. Evaluation of psychomotor development was done using the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (DDTS II). Results. All four patients presented with mutations of the ZFHX1B gene; patients 1, 3 and 4 showed novel mutations that have never been described before. The clinical features of our patients were compared with the literature. The most common malformations were HSCR (62.8%), congenital heart diseases (50.7%), and corpus callosum agenesis (45.6%). Hypospadias was present in 46.2% of the patients. Seizures were very frequent (75.0%). Results. Mowat-Wilson syndrome can be well recognized as classical genetic syndromes for distinct facial phenotype, associated malformations, seizures, microcephaly, and severe mental retardation.

The diagnosis was made on the basis of copper metabolism examination with significant 24-hour urine copper levels, neurological status, head CT, liver involvement and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring. All patients underwent complex EMG examination: Blink reflex (BR), cranial and spinal motor Magnetic Evoked Potentials (MEPs), and Nerve Conductive Velocities (NCVs) of the limbs. The first 3 patients (2 women and 1 man) were examined before starting d-penicillamine therapy, and the last patient, a 25-year-old woman, had 12 years of WD evolution after 2 years of Cuprenil therapy. All patients had normal NCVs and spinal MEPs. BR and cranial MEPs were abnormal in 3 untreated patients. On permanent therapy, the patient showed nearly normal parameters, except for decreased cranial MEP amplitudes. While our results are preliminary and insufficient for fixed outcome and statistical analysis, they suggest that by applying specific electrophysiological methods, we can identify clinically latent dysfunctions of the central motor neuron, pyramidal pathways, and brain stem in WD. There is evidence that some parameters of these tests may be additionally useful in monitoring treatment.",,"Klissurski, M. G.;Muradyan, N.;Novachkova, S.;Vassileva, E.;Ishpekova, B.",2005,,,0,0,
2155,Risks and benefits of drug use during pregnancy,"Environmental teratogenic factors (eg alcohol) can be avoided. We are focusing our analysis on human teratogenic drugs that are not used frequently during pregnancy. Previous human teratogenic studies had serious methodological problems, for example, the concept of the first trimester is outdated, as environmental teratogens cannot induce congenital abnormalities in the first month of pregnancy. In addition, teratogens often cause specific congenital abnormalities or syndromes. Finally, the importance of chemical structures, administrative pathways and treatment reasons has not been taken into account in the evaluation of medicinal products. On the other hand, recall bias was not limited in general in epidemiological studies called case-control. These biases explain that the teratogenic risk of drugs is exaggerated, while the benefit of drug use during pregnancy is underestimated. Therefore, there is a need for a better balance between the risk and benefit of drug treatments during pregnancy. Of course, we must do our best to reduce the risk of teratogenic drugs as much as possible, but it is worth emphasizing the preventive effect of drugs on congenital abnormalities due to maternal diseases (eg diabetes mellitus and hyperthermia).

2156,Zinc supplementation reduces hepatic copper accumulation in the LEC rat: a model of Wilson's disease.,"The effect of dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on copper (Cu)-induced liver injury was investigated in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats (LEC), a model for Wilson's disease (WD). Four-week-old LEC (N=64) and control Long-Evans (LE) (N=32) female rats were divided into two groups; one group was given a Zn supplemented diet (group I) and the other a normal rodent diet (group II). LEC rats were killed at 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 20 weeks of age; LE control mice were sacrificed at 6, 12, 18 and 20 weeks of age. In LEC rats fed the Zn-supplemented diet, the Cu concentration in the liver was decreased compared to LEC rats fed the normal diet for 6 to 18 weeks. Metallothionein (MT) concentration in the livers of LEC rats in group I increased at 12 to 20 weeks of age, while hepatic MT concentration in LEC rats in group II decreased after 12 weeks. Hepatocyte apoptosis as determined by TUNEL was reduced in Zn-supplemented LEC rats at all ages. Cholangiocellular carcinoma was only observed at week 20 in LEC rats in group II. These results suggest that Zn supplementation may reduce hepatic Cu concentration and delay the onset of clinical and pathological changes of Cu toxicity in LEC rats. Although the actual mechanism of protection is unknown, it may be explained by the sequestration of dietary Cu by intestinal MT induced by high dietary Zn content.

2157,Genetic disorders of copper transport - Diagnosis and new therapy for Wilson's disease patients. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease and Menkes' disease are inherited genetic disorders of copper metabolism. Every disease results from the absence or dysfunction of homologous copper-bearing ATPases found in the trans-Golgi cell network. Wilson ATPase transports copper to the hepatocyte secretory pathway for incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion in the bile. Therefore, patients with autosomal recessive Wilson's disease present with signs and symptoms resulting from impaired biliary copper excretion. Menkes ATPase transports copper across the placenta, the gastrointestinal tract, and the blood-brain barrier, and the clinical features of this X-linked disease are due to copper deficiency. Despite the striking differences in the clinical presentation of these two diseases, the respective ATPases function in exactly the same way inside the cell. The different clinical features of each disease are the results of tissue-specific expression of these ATPases. In Wilson's disease, impaired excretion of copper through the bile causes this metal to accumulate in the liver. When hepatic storage capacity is exceeded, cell death occurs and copper release into the plasma results in hemolysis and copper deposition in extrahepatic tissues. Affected patients usually present in the first or second decade of life with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis or acute liver failure. Copper deposition in the cornea causes Kayser-Fleischer rings. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are more common in adults and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairment as a result of copper deposition in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by a decrease in serum ceruloplasmin, an increase in urinary copper, and an increase in hepatic copper concentration. Many different mutations occur in the genes of patients with Wilson's disease. Copper chelation drugs and zinc are effective in most cases. New treatment guidelines now advise doctors to start giving patients zinc.",,"Aoki, T.",2005,,,0,0,

HD has attracted the most clinical and research interest, in part because of the availability of definitive genetic testing, but commercial genetic testing is available for many other conditions, including SCAs. Genetic testing is useful in some trinucleotide repeat disorders, but the impact of testing on the patient and family should be evaluated. Basal ganglia degeneration occurs in many of these conditions and may explain some behavioral changes, particularly deficits in impulse control, motivation, and executive function, along with motor symptoms. As many of the conditions discussed may present with similar motor and behavioral symptoms, a careful family history, examination, and selected use of laboratory tests may be required if diagnosis is made. Psychiatric symptoms are common in these disorders and can cause disability comparable to that caused by the movement disorder itself.

2163,Wilson's disease: high prevalence in a mountainous region of Crete,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes the copper-transporting P-type ATPase. Its worldwide incidence is 0.56% with a gene frequency and a carrier frequency of 1 in 90 to 30 cases per million. The increasing number of Wilson's disease patients on the island of Crete has prompted us to examine the spectrum of mutations. A small village close to the city of Heraklion where many patients have been referred over the last 25 years. To estimate the incidence of the disease, we first investigated the number of births in the village and the number of WD patients since 1978. Six out of 90 births, the highest prevalence of WD ever reported, were diagnosed as having WD. Analysis of the whole gene in three patients with Wilson's disease and in the relatives of a child who died from WD led to the detection of 4 different point mutations. Two of these were missense (p.I1148T and p.G1176R) and separated together in cis in the same patient; this patient's other allele carried a nonsense mutation (p.Q289X). This is the first report in the literature of three mutations segregating together in the same WD patient. The fourth mutation identified was a novel frameshift mutation (c.398delT) with documented co-segregation.

2164,The role of copper in tumor angiogenesis,"Copper stimulates the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and is required for the secretion of various angiogenic factors by tumor cells. Copper chelation reduces the secretion of many of these factors. Serum copper levels are upregulated in many human tumors and correlate with tumor burden and prognosis. Copper chelators reduce tumor growth and microvascular density in animal models. New orally active copper chelators have driven clinical trials and there are several studies in progress. A unifying mechanism of action by which copper chelation inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and tumor secretion of angiogenic factors has not yet been elucidated, but possible targets include copper-dependent enzymes, chaperones, and transporters.

2167,"Copper, oxidative stress and human health","Copper (Cu), a redox-active metal, is an essential nutrient for all species studied to date. Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in the concept that marginal deficits of this element can contribute to the development and progression of a number of disease states, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Deficiencies of this nutrient during pregnancy can cause major structural malformations in the conceptus and permanent neurological and immunological abnormalities in the offspring. Excessive amounts of Cu in the body can also pose a risk. Acute Cu toxicity can cause a range of pathologies and in severe cases, death. Chronic Cu toxicity can cause liver disease and serious neurological defects. The concept that elevated ceruloplasmin is a risk factor for some diseases is debated. In this article, we will review the recent literature on the potential causes of Cu deficiency and Cu toxicity and the pathological consequences associated with the above. Finally, we will review some of the potential biochemical lesions underlying these pathologies. Given that oxidative stress is a feature of Cu deficiency, the role of Cu in the oxidative defense system will be of particular interest. The concept that excess Cu may be an accelerating factor in Alzheimer's disease is discussed. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Uriu-Adams, J. Y.;Keen, C.

The effect of oral zinc (Zn) acetate treatment on the development of acute hepatitis and the biochemical parameters of Cu-induced liver injury were investigated in 5-week-old LEC rats (n = 52). Methods: Rats receiving 50 or 80 mg/ml/day Zn acetate by gavage and control rats receiving 0.02 g/ml glucose solution daily by gastric intubation were killed 1, 2, or 8 weeks after the start of treatment. Results: Treatment with Zn acetate resulted in prevention of acute hepatitis: 10 out of 13 untreated rats developed signs and symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis between 6 and 7 weeks of treatment. Tissue metallothionein (MT) was significantly increased in treated rats and positively correlated with Zn concentrations in the liver. After both short-term and long-term experiments, control rats had a significantly higher concentration of iron in their liver and kidneys compared to supplemented rats. The amounts of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were significantly lower in untreated rats. Conclusions: Zn acetate prevents acute hepatitis by increasing tissue MT concentrations, decreasing Cu absorption and interfering with Fe metabolism. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.",,"Medici, V.;Sturniolo, G.

2175,"Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc from the time of diagnosis in pediatric patients: Single hospital, 10-year follow-up study.","Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited copper metabolism disorder characterized by the inability of the liver to excrete copper and the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, cornea and kidney, resulting in chronic degenerative changes. It is generally accepted that 'presymptomatic' patients diagnosed with WD in childhood, defined as those with liver disease, although still asymptomatic, should be treated prophylactically, as indicated by increased serum concentrations of transaminases. Here we present our results in 22 children treated with continuous oral zinc therapy for 10 years. Zinc sulfate was administered at a dose of 25 mg elemental zinc twice daily up to 6 years of age, 25 mg three times daily between 7 and 16 years of age, or until the child reached a body weight of 125 lb. then mg three times a day. Five years after the start of zinc therapy, we noted highly significant reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and urinary copper excretion, but white blood cell counts did not change significantly. Six of the 22 patients continued to show higher-than-normal ALT concentrations, and only 1 patient showed an ALT concentration greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Further reductions in ALT, AST, and urinary copper excretion were observed at the end of the 10-year follow-up, but these reductions were not statistically significant. Only 1 patient continued to show abnormal ALT levels. Again, the white blood cells did not show any significant changes. All histological scores (steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis) were significantly reduced after treatment. Hepatic copper content was also significantly reduced in all patients, although it remained higher than normal. Removal of toxic copper was confirmed by disappearance of Kayser-Fleischer rings in 3 patients. Zinc did not have a negative effect on growth. The efficacy of zinc in WD in presymptomatic pediatric patients has been established in previous studies, and our study significantly adds to previous findings, as it included a large number of very young children, from 11 younger than 6 years old and 20 younger than 10 years old. The excellent clinical results in all patients, combined with the improvement in hepatic histological findings in the vast majority, convincingly demonstrate that zinc therapy can effectively and safely control the disease and prevent its progression for 10 years. Improvement of histological findings was reported in 3 patients treated in a previous study, but our data are numerically much more relevant. In particular, histological study of the liver revealed that copper concentration decreased with treatment, suggesting that oral zinc not only inhibited further accumulation of copper but also promoted at least partial depletion of its stores. The lack of adverse effects of zinc on growth indicates that our patients received adequate anticopper therapy to prevent damage from copper toxicity, but received sufficient copper for proper growth and development. In conclusion, our findings suggest that zinc is the treatment of choice in presymptomatic pediatric patients with WD. Â© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A central feature of management is the selection of anticancer drugs or drugs for various stages and classes of disease. Doctors should no longer rely on penicillamine as the primary choice for treating this disease. In fact, our recommendation is to use penicillamine infrequently. We recommend the combination of trientine and zinc for the initial treatment of hepatic failure presentation. We recommend tetrathiomolybdate and zinc for the initial treatment of neurological/psychiatric presentation. If tetrathiomolybdate is not available, our second choice is zinc alone. For maintenance therapy (usually 2-4 months after the first treatment), trientine with zinc is recommended as a second choice for presymptomatic patients and pregnant patients. Monitoring recommendations are provided for both efficacy and safety for these various anticancer drugs.

The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate transaminase levels after penicillamine and zinc treatment in children with Wilson's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 109 patients with Wilson's disease (median age at diagnosis, 7.2 years; range, 1 to 18 years), treated for at least 12 months, and observed in 11 Departments of Pediatrics over the past 20 years, were studied. Clinical, laboratory and histological features at the time of diagnosis and first treatment were recorded. Efficacy parameters were normalization of serum transaminase level and improvement of clinical and/or laboratory findings. One hundred and two patients had clinical or laboratory findings of liver disease. RESULTS: Of 87 patients, 56 (64%) received penicillamine-normalized serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels within a median of 17 months (2 to 96 months). Of 29 patients with persistent hyper-ALT, 17 (59%) switched to zinc; only four of these had normalized ALT over zinc over an average period of 38 months (range 7 to 48 months). Of the 22 patients given zinc alone, 11 (50%) normalized ALT over a median period of 6 months (range, 1 to 36 months). Five of 11 patients with persistent hyper-ALT switched to penicillamine.

All subjects were checked five times: serum, RBC, hair, and 24-hour urine were collected simultaneously for assays at 0, 2, 4, week 8, and week 12 during the Zn supplementation period. RESULTS: (1) Zn contents in serum, RBC and hair increased significantly after 2 to 4 weeks of supplementation and decreased 4 weeks after discontinuing supplementation, but were still higher than before supplementation. The Zn content in 24-hour urine increased significantly after supplementation and fell to the same level as before supplementation 4 weeks after stopping supplementation. (2) Serum, RBC, and Cu content in hair increased significantly after 4 weeks of supplementation and decreased 4 weeks after discontinuing supplementation. The Cu content in 24-hour urine did not change significantly during the experiment. (3) RBC superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were consistently decreased after 2 weeks of supplementation and were not recovered 4 weeks after supplementation was stopped. RBC glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities were significantly increased after 4 weeks of supplementation. Lipid peroxide (LPO) content increased significantly after 2 weeks of supplementation.

2196,Wilson's disease and its pharmacological treatment. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease is an inherited copper toxicosis caused by putative defective copper carrying ATPase in the liver. Due to impaired bile secretion, copper remains in the liver and causes chronic liver lesions such as fatty metamorphosis, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. In the latter stage, extrapyramidal syndromes may develop with or without symptomatic hepatic lesions. Acute liver injury associated with hemolysis and deep jaundice may be the first sign. Most patients show hypoceruloplasminemia, which is used as a screening test for the disease. Numerous mutations in the ATP7B gene have been reported. Therefore, genetic diagnosis can be of limited use in the presymptomatic diagnosis of siblings when mutations are identified in an index patient. The introduction of penicillamine has revolutionized the treatment of patients. Another chelator, trientine, is now available for those with penicillamine intolerance. Tetrathiomolybdate and zinc acetate are additional alternatives currently being tested. Hypoceruloplasminemia and further reduction after chelation therapy may be associated with iron overload. This complication is closely associated with impaired transport of iron ions due to ferroxidase deficiency. Incompatibility and teratogenicity are other major concerns because any treatment with the agents listed above is a lifelong regimen. Despite the various side effects of penicillamine, its teratogenicity is negligible. These data suggest that penicillamine is the first drug of choice for this disease.

2197,Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis,"Wilson's disease (WD) and hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are two inherited disorders with potentially devastating and life-threatening complications. Their outstanding treatability makes diagnosis critical in adolescence or young adulthood. WD is the result of abnormal copper homeostasis causing copper overload and organ damage. Chelation therapy can be highly effective in preventing the symptoms of WD. HH is caused by improper absorption of dietary iron, typically as the result of a specific C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. End-organ disease resulting from iron deposition is variable and includes progressive damage to the liver, pancreas, skin, heart, and pituitary. It is important to allow therapeutic phlebotomy to begin before complications begin.",,"Neimark, E.;Schilsky, M. L.;Shneider, B. L.",2004,February,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.admecli.2003.11.011,0,0,

The remarkable variability of phenotypic expression of mutated genotypes makes screening recommendations and establishing the prognosis for these liver disorders in young adults problematic. Diagnosis and management of the young adult with metabolic liver disease is discussed, with emphasis on maintaining quality of life and the balance between the importance of early intervention and the stigma of a diagnosis of potentially life-threatening liver disease.

2200,Treatment of Wilson's disease with penicillamine and zinc salts: a follow-up study. [Chinese],"OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the liver and later in the brain and other organs. Penicillamine acts as a reducing chelator. Zinc salts induce metallothionein synthesis in cells. Thus, these two drugs are theoretically synergistic for the treatment of the disease. However, both drugs can have some adverse interactions. In this study, the effect of treatment with combined penicillamine and zinc salts was evaluated based on follow-up observations of 21 patients with Wilson's disease. METHODS: Use of penicillamine [10-30 mg/(kg.d)] and zinc (22.5 mg, 3 times daily) combined therapy, hospitalization or follow-up study by telephone or mail communication. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, all 21 patients were suffering from chronic liver disorder. Among them, 13 patients (62%) responded to liver dysfunction treatment, 5 patients (24%) died, and 3 patients (14%) dropped out of our follow-up study. Of the 5 patients who died, 3 died within 40 days of treatment, one received only 8 mg/(kg.d) penicillamine, and one died after discontinuation of treatment by their parents. Neurological symptoms disappeared or significantly improved after treatment in 11 of 12 patients with neurological involvement. One patient discontinued the follow-up study. The patient with renal tubular acidosis responded well to treatment. Routine urinalysis was followed up in 6 of 7 patients with hematuria. Hematuria disappeared in one patient, became less severe in 1 patient, and remained unchanged in 4 patients. Penicillamine hypersensitivity was detected in one patient. After drug treatment, leukocyte and thrombocyte were found to be decreased in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Combined therapy with penicillamine and zinc salts was effective in treating patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Li, M.;Zhang, Y. H.;Qin, J.",2003,Feb,,0,0,
2201,What have we learned from CDNA microarray gene expression studies about the role of iron in MPTP-induced neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease?,"Numerous hypotheses exist regarding the etiology and mechanism of dorsal raphe dopaminergic neurodegeneration in MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and 6-hydroxydopamine in Parkinson's disease and its animal models. The advent of cDNA microarray gene expression, in which the expression of thousands of genes can be evaluated globally, has demonstrated that the mechanism of neurodegeneration by MPTP is a complex set of vicious circles. One is the alteration of genes associated with iron metabolism, a transition metal closely associated with inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species and inducing oxidative stress. cDNA gene expression analyzes support the established hypothesis of oxidative-induced neurodegeneration involving iron deposition in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) parkinsonian brains. Regulation of cellular iron metabolism has been further enhanced by the recent discovery of two iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, which control the level of iron in the cell. When cellular iron level increases, IRP2 is degraded by ubiquitination and no more iron is accumulated. The opposite happens when the iron level inside the cell is low. Knockout IRP1 and IRP2 mice demonstrated that brain iron deposition in the second mice preceded the neurodegeneration, ataxia, and bradykinesia observed in these animals. Indeed, MPTP treatment resulting in iron accumulation in the SNCP abolishes IRP2 with an increase in alpha-synuclein. Iron chelators such as R-apomorphine and EGCG, which protect against MPTP neurotoxicity, inhibit IRP2 loss and increase alpha-synuclein. The presence of iron together with alpha-synuclein in SNPC may be detrimental to dopaminergic neurons. Since then, iron has been shown to cause aggregation of alpha-synuclein into a neurotoxic agent. The use of iron chelators that penetrate the blood-brain barrier as neuroprotective drugs is envisaged.",,"Youdim, M. B. H.",2003,,,0,0,

It is involved in modulation of pain and cognition. Elevated blood levels have been reported in patients with acute and chronic pain and Wilson's disease. An accidental observation led us to investigate nociceptin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Plasma nociceptin level was measured by radioimmunoassay, aprotinin was used as protease inhibitor. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by laboratory, ultrasound, and other imaging modalities and confirmed by fine needle biopsy. Results were compared with healthy controls and patients with other chronic liver disease. Results: Although nociceptin levels were elevated in patients with Wilson's disease (14.0+/-2.7 pg/mL, n=26), primary biliary cirrhosis (12.1+/-3.2 pg/mL, 17=21), and liver cirrhosis (12.8+). A ten-fold increase was found in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (105.9+/-14.4 pg) compared to healthy controls (9.2+/-1.8 pg/mL, n=29, P<0.001 each). /mL, n=29, P<0.0001). Elevated plasma levels were found in all hepatocellular carcinoma patients, including those with normal alpha fetoprotein and those with pain (104.9+/-14.9 pg/mL, n=12) and those without (107.7+/-14.5 pg/mL, n=6). . Conclusion: A very high nociceptin plasma level appears to be an indicator for hepatocellular carcinoma.

2209,Tetrathiomolybdate for the treatment of acute hepatitis in an animal model for Wilson's disease,"Introduction/Aims: Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a potent copper chelating agent that has been shown to be effective in Wilson's patients with neurological symptoms. Here, we explore the potential use of TTM in the treatment of acute hepatic copper toxicosis in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an authentic model for Wilson's disease. Methods: After the onset of acute hepatitis, LEC rats were treated once with 10 mg of TTM/kg. After 1 and 4 days, liver toxicity parameters and the intracellular distribution and binding of copper and iron were examined. Results: TTM rapidly cured acute hepatitis in 11 of 12 rats. Hepatic copper was decreased by its removal from polymers of cytosolic metallothionein and lysosomal metallothionein. The remaining lysosomal copper forms a metallothionein-copper-TTM complex. However, in a nearly moribund rat, TTM caused severe hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome. Conclusions: TTM is effective in the treatment of acute hepatitis in LEC rats when administered before the animals moribund. TTM appears to act by removing putative reactive copper associated with lysosomal metallothionein polymers. The remaining lysosomal copper appears to be inactivated by forming a complex with TTM. In addition, TTM removes copper from cytosolic copper-containing metallothionein. As a result, metallothionein is degraded and the uptake of copper-metallothioneine into lysosomes and the formation of copper associated with the metallothionein polymer are reduced.

2211,Genotype-phenotype correlations for a wide range of mutations in the Wilson disease gene (ATP7B),"Wilson's disease (WND) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene and exhibits significant allelic heterogeneity. In this study, we report the results of molecular analyzes of 20 previously undescribed WND families. Combined with our previous results, the cohort includes 93 index patients from 69 unrelated families. Twenty different mutations accounted for 86% of WND chromosomes. The most common were p.H1069Q (35%), p.R969Q (12%), c.2530delA (7%), p.L936X (7%), p.Q289X (7%), and P.I1148T (3 %). Here we also present a detailed phenotypic assessment for patients whose molecular results have been previously reported. Thirty cases were homozygous for 9 different mutations, 13 for p.H1069Q and 7 for p.R969Q. Mutations of p.H1069Q and p.R969Q appeared to give milder disease as patients showed disease onset at a later age and were associated with milder severity when present in trans people with severe mutations. Predicted nonsense and frameshift mutations were associated with earlier disease onset and lower ceruloplasmin values as well as severe phenotypic expression. WND can be treated with copper chelation therapy, especially if the disease is diagnosed before irreversible tissue damage occurs. Our results regarding the impact of predicted nonsense and frameshift mutations are particularly important for early medical intervention in presymptomatic infants and children with these genotypes. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Panagiotakaki, E.;Tzetis, M.;Manolaki, N.;Loudianos, G.;Papatheodorou, A.;Manesis, E.;Nousia-Arvanitakis, S.;Syriopoulou, V.;Kanavakis, E.",2004,2022-12-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.30345,0,0,

[Japanese],"27-year-old man who is currently a smoker was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 13, due to slurred speech and tremors. He had been on D-penicillamine therapy for 14 years when he was admitted to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Pulmonary function tests showed airflow obstruction, and areas of low attenuation were recorded on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest.

Striking elastosis was also evident in the bronchial wall. Although the accidental coexistence of both Wilson's disease and juvenile emphysema cannot be ruled out, it is thought that the long-term administration of D-penicillamine, a known lathyrogen, may have caused juvenile emphysema in this case. Therefore, patients taking D-penicillamine in such a situation should be advised to quit smoking.",,"Usuki, J.;Suzuki, M.;Sakakibara, K.;Enomoto, T.;Azuma, A.;Yoshimura, A.;Kida, K.;Kunugi, S.;Fukuda, Y.;Kudoh, S.",2004,,,0,0,

Copper accumulated in the livers of LEC rats aged 4 to 13 weeks in an age-dependent manner. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, their hepatic copper contents did not increase and were maintained at the same levels as in 10-week-old LEC rats. When amounts of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) were estimated by a comet assay, SSBs of DNA were induced and the amounts of SSBs increased in a significant population of LEC rat liver cells at around 8 weeks of age. 8 to 15 weeks. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, the observed number of cells with DNA damage was dramatically reduced, suggesting that DNA stimulation of SSBs was inhibited and/or RCCs were repaired during treatment with trientine. The results show that treatment of LEC rats with trientine reduces the number of DNA strand breaks observed, although the copper content in the liver remains high.

2224,Postural tremor in Wilson's disease: A magnetoencephalographic study.,"The following study included 5 Wilson's disease (WD) patients with right-sided postural forearm tremor (4-6 Hz) and addressed the question of whether the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in tremor generation. We investigated cerebromuscular coupling using a 122-channel whole-head neuromagnetometer and surface electromyogram (EMG). Postural tremor was observed in the 45-degree continuous stance of the right forearm. Data were analyzed using dynamic imaging of matched sources (DICS), revealing cerebromuscular coupling between EMG and cerebral activity. Consistent sources were superimposed on individual high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Phase delays between EMG and cerebral areas showing the strongest consistency were determined by Hilbert transform of both signals. In all patients, postural tremor was associated with a strong correlation between the tremor EMG and the frequency of activity tremor or double tremor in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1). Phase delay values between S1/M1 activity and EMG revealed efferent and afferent components in the corticomuscular junction. Taken together, our results suggest that postural tremor in WD is mediated through a pathological oscillatory drive from the primary motor cortex.

With regard to the use of dopaminergic agents, the dopamine agonist pergolide can be preserved during pregnancy for the treatment of PD, Segawa's disease and RLS. The use of levodopa and ropinirole should be limited during pregnancy due to possible teratogenic effects. Amantadine is contraindicated during pregnancy [54]. Data on Selegiline are controversial; animal studies indicate possible serotonergic effects [52] and teratogenic effects [53].

It can lead to chronic liver disease and occasionally hemolytic anemia due to impaired copper excretion. The gene responsible for copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers was recently identified and found not to be associated with the human Wilson's disease gene ATP7B. While our understanding of copper metabolism in mammals has improved thanks to genetic molecular technology, the diversity of gene mutations associated with copper metabolism in animals will help identify genes responsible for non-Wilson copper toxicosis in humans. This review article discusses our knowledge of normal copper metabolism and current research on pathogenesis, molecular genetics, and copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, other animals, and humans. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

2231,Metals in our minds: Therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders,"Background Abnormal interactions of copper or iron in the brain with metal-binding proteins (such as amyloid-beta peptide [Abeta] or neuromelanin) leading to oxidative stress have emerged as important potential mechanisms in brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Although a controlled trial of desferrioxamine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has some promising results, concerns about toxicity and brain conduction have limited trials with conventional chelators. Testing the therapeutic significance of metal dysregulation in neurodegenerative disorders remained challenging. Recent developments Clioquinol has been identified as a prototype metal-protein attenuating compound (MPAC). In a blinded, controlled 9-week study of a mouse model of AD, oral clioquinol reduced brain Abeta by 49% without systemic toxicity. Copper and zinc concentrations in the brain were increased by approximately 15% in mice treated with clioquinol. Two other studies in mice showed that raising brain copper concentrations through diet or genetics can reduce amyloid load and increase survival. A recent placebo-controlled study in 36 patients with AD found that clioquinol (250-750 mg daily) decreased Abeta<inf>1-42</inf> plasma concentrations, increased plasma zinc concentrations and - moderate dementia - cognitive decline for 24 weeks. slowed down. Two recent experiments also demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of iron chelation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Where is next? Experimental and transgenic-animal studies of metal-protein interactions are convincing, but do not provide definitive answers as to causation or whether this strategy protects against neurodegeneration in humans. The finding that clioquinol can modulate plasma amyloid and cognition concentrations in patients with AD should be interpreted with caution, but is an important first step. Clioquinol was withdrawn in Japan due to concerns over its association with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy; therefore, any additional studies with this drug will likely be small and closely monitored proof-of-concept studies. The development of optimal second-generation MPACs is a desirable goal and may allow further insight into the importance of metal-protein interactions in several neurodegenerative disorders.",,"Doraiswamy, P.

2234,Inhibition of essential cytokines by tetrathiomolybdate in a bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis,"Tetrathiomolybdate is an anticancer drug with a unique mechanism of action. Tetrathiomolybdate complexes copper to protein and itself, rendering copper unavailable for cellular uptake. It was originally developed for Wilson's disease and is now being developed as an antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of cancer. Many angiogenic cytokines require normal copper levels, and low copper levels reduce cytokine signaling while meeting cellular copper requirements. Since tetrathiomolybdate inhibits bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, cytokines of fibrosis and inflammation may likewise be copper-dependent. The basis for this inhibition was evaluated herein by examining the effects of tetrathiomolybdate on lung pathophysiologically important cytokines in the bleomycin mouse model of pulmonary injury. Results in mice injected with bleomycin endotracheally confirmed that tetrathiomolybdate treatment was effective in reducing fibrosis. This effect was associated with significant inhibition of bleomycin-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta expression in lung homogenates. These effects have been shown to be independent of each other. This indicates that tetrathiomolybdate therapy can be effective even when the fibrosis is in a more chronic stage in which inflammatory cytokines play a diminishing role. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha suggests that diseases of tumor necrosis factor alpha overexpression are also potential targets of tetrathiomolybdate therapy. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Conditions such as neuroferritinopathy and Friedreich's ataxia are associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism, and as the brain ages, iron accumulates in areas affected by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. High concentrations of reactive iron can increase neuronal sensitivity induced by oxidative stress, and iron accumulation can increase the toxicity of environmental or endogenous toxins. By studying the accumulation and cellular distribution of iron during aging, we should be able to increase our understanding of these neurodegenerative disorders and develop new therapeutic strategies.",,"Zecca, L.;Youdim, M.

Studies on the use of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate as an alternative chelating agent for the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease are still in the experimental stage. Published experience with the simultaneous use of trientine, another chelating agent, and zinc, which inhibits the intestinal absorption of copper, is promising but limited.

2242,Copper deficiency myelopathy produces a clinical picture like subacute combined degeneration.,"Background: Copper deficiency is known to cause ataxic myelopathy in ruminants. Copper deficiency as a cause of progressive myelopathy in adults is not well recognized. Objective: To describe the clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological, and imaging features of 13 patients with copper deficiency-related myelopathy. Methods: The records of patients with copper deficiency-related myelopathy were reviewed. Clinical features, laboratory investigations, and responses to therapeutic intervention are summarized. Results: 13 such patients were found, 11 of whom were in the 15-month period. All patients presented with dorsal column dysfunction and marked gait difficulty reflecting sensory ataxia due to lower extremity spasticity. All patients had polyneuropathy. Elevated or elevated normal serum zinc levels were seen in 7 of 11 patients for whom this information is available. Somatosensory evoked potential studies in eight patients showed impaired transmission in the central proprioceptive pathways. Three patients had dorsal column signal changes on spine MRI. The first clue to diagnosis was a very low ceruloplasmin level; Further tests of copper metabolism excluded Wilson's disease. In most patients, the cause could not be explained. Oral copper supplementation improved normal or near-normal copper levels in 7 of 12 patients for whom adequate follow-up data were available; parenteral supplementation restored normal levels in 3 other patients. Copper supplementation prevented further neurological deterioration, but the extent of actual improvement was variable. Conclusions: Unrecognized copper deficiency appears to be a common cause of idiopathic myelopathy in adults. The clinical picture is strikingly similar to the subacute combined degeneration syndrome associated with vitamin B<inf>12</inf> deficiency.

2249,DNA link-based diagnosis of Wilson's disease in asymptomatic siblings,"Background and objectives: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by defects in the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13q14 and manifested as hepatolenticular degeneration as a result of copper deposition. No information is available for WD patients in India on the mutation in the ATP7B gene and the haplotypes using associated markers. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify presymptomatic siblings of individuals affected by WD in families with more than one child, using a PCR-based molecular diagnostic test. Methods: Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood of patients, siblings, and first-degree relatives. Repeat markers flanking the WD locus were amplified by PCR using fluorescently labeled primers. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on the ABI 377 DNA sequencing system. The genotypes of the samples were determined using Genescan software. Haplotypes were determined based on separation of alleles in the families studied. Results: Among the 15 families affected by WD with more than one child, 4 cases were identified in which younger siblings shared the same genotype as the patient in the three markers analyzed. In addition, eight different haplotypes were detected in four patients. Interpretation and conclusion: Siblings of WD patients with the same genotype in markers associated with the WH locus were presymptomatic individuals. The presence of eight different haplotypes in four patients suggested mutational heterogeneity at the WD locus. The test assists clinicians for therapeutic intervention in cases of suspected WD by copper chelating agents before the appearance of overt clinical symptoms.",,"Gupta, A.;Neogi, R.;Mukherjea, M.;Mukhopadhyay, A.;Roychoudhury, S.;Senapati, A.;Gangopadhyay, P.

The mortality of a fulminant Wilsonian crisis without emergency orthotopic liver transplantation is 100%. We present an 18-year-old female patient with fulminant hepatic failure due to Wilson's crisis. Methods: A molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) was used to remove albumin-bound toxins and eliminate waiting until an organ was viable. Results: A total of 18 MARS sessions and 4 plasma exchange sessions were performed. Bilirubin levels and hepatic encephalopathy improved under MARS treatment. A total of 75 mg of copper was removed until serum copper levels were within the normal range. Copper elimination was measured in 15 MARS applications that removed a total of 12.9 mg of copper. Four plasma exchange sessions with a total plasma exchange of 11 liters removed 12 mg of copper. Urinary copper elimination with penicillamine was 50 mg. Conclusion: MARS was an effective method for stabilizing a patient with Wilson's crisis, contributing to the elimination of copper and saving time for liver transplantation. The risk of high-urgency transplantation can be avoided. Liver support was easy in the hands of nephrologists familiar with extracorporeal therapy. Copyright © 2003 S.

2253,Tetrathiomolybdate treatment protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a drug developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease, produces an antiangiogenic effect by lowering systemic copper levels. Several angiogenic cytokines appear to depend on normal copper levels for activity. In both animal tumor models and cancer patients, TM treatment has proven effective in inhibiting the growth of tumors. We hypothesized that the activities of fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines are also modulated by the presence of copper in a similar fashion to angiogenic cytokines. As a first step in assessing whether TM plays a therapeutic role in diseases of inflammation and fibrosis, we examined the effects of TM in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Oral TM treatment resulted in dose-dependent reductions in serum ceruloplasmin, a surrogate marker of systemic copper levels. Significant reductions in systemic copper levels were associated with significant reductions in lung fibrosis as determined on the basis of histopathological findings and biochemical measurement of fibrosis. The protection afforded by TM was also reflected in significantly reduced bleomycin-induced body weight loss. In the next phase of this study, we will try to identify the mechanisms by which TM confers this therapeutic benefit.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Ullenbruch, M. R.;Dick, R.;Olivarez, L.;Phan, S.

The set includes 5 tests that reflect different aspects of movement disorders: resting tremor, postural tremor, hitting the target, tapping with the index finger, and spiral staining. The tests showed significant differences between neurological WD and volunteers, especially for tasks that describe active control. We found no difference between subgroups in neurological WD, while we often found mild movement disorders in non-neurological WD.

TM is a potent, fast-acting, non-toxic anti-copper agent. Copper appears to be essential for the activity of many angiogenic factors, which led to the trial of TM as an antiangiogenic, anticancer drug. Positive results have been obtained in several animal tumor models, and results are encouraging in early clinical trials. TM may be a more global antiangiogenic agent than most agents in development because many angiogenic factors appear to be somewhat copper-dependent. The main toxicity of TM is over-treated bone marrow suppression.

2256,Diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease 38 years of treatment experience in a private outpatient clinic. [German],"Wilson's disease, an inherited autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by more than 200 different mutations in the gene encoding a copper-bearing ATPase 7B (locus 13q14.3). Hepatic manifestations became evident mostly in the first, neurological and psychiatric second or third decade of life, rarely later. Genotype-phenotype correlations probably exist. Diagnosis includes laboratory tests (Cu-metabolism), molecular genetics and, if necessary, liver biopsy. Treatment should be continued for life without interruption during pregnancy. Trientine, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate have been used with success as well as D-Penicillamine, which has been the drug of choice for many years. Monitoring (copper balance, side effects) - at least once or twice a year - is required. Cerebral MRI and FDG-PET appear to be a useful tool in practice for long-term therapy. The value of continuing care for Wilson patients (38,10 without hepatic or neurological signs) in a specialized outpatient clinic since 1964 has been proven. 31 patients who were consistently treated with D-Penicillamine tolerated the drug well with few side effects. Even if the prominent neurological symptoms resolved, some patients had symptoms almost completely resolved. All patients without clinical signs remained asymptomatic. Trientine and zinc are an effective alternative therapy if D-Penicillamine intolerance occurs. Recurrent hepatic decompensations were observed in 2 female patients. One of them eventually required a liver transplant. While taking the drug, 19 pregnancies were carried to full term without complications or fetal damage (17 with D-Penicillamine, 2 with Trientine and zinc).

2257,Copper-Lowering Therapy with Tetrathiomolybdate for Cancer and Fibrosis and Inflammatory Diseases,"Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and is a possible Achilles heel for cancer. However, antiangiogenic agents have been somewhat disappointing in cancer therapy, perhaps because they target a single angiogenic factor and there is too much redundancy in the angiogenic systems. Copper is required for high levels of angiogenesis, and many angiogenic factors have a requirement for copper. Thus, copper-inhibiting drugs offer greater global inhibition possibilities. Our group developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease. Penicillamine worsens neurologically in approximately 50% of these patients, and most never recover. Only 2 (3.6%) of 55 patients worsened when treated with TM. Because TM exhibits desirable efficacy, speed, and safety properties, we have studied it as an antiangiogenic agent. If copper is reduced to medium, we hypothesize that cellular requirements for copper are met, but that angiogenic cytokine signaling is inhibited. TM demonstrated strong inhibition of cancer growth in five rodent models, encouraging results in a canine study of advanced and metastatic cancer, and encouraging results in a phase 1/2 study of advanced and metastatic cancer in 42 patients. Finally, we hypothesized that the fibrosis pathway involving transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and connective tissue growth factor could be inhibited by copper-lowering treatment with TM. This pathway is overactive and irregular in many fibrosis diseases. In animal studies, TM completely inhibited bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, concanavalin A-induced hepatitis, and carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. We found that TM inhibited transforming growth factor beta and the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1-beta. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Brewer, G.

2262,Excess dietary histidine reduces liver copper level and serum alanine aminotransferase activity in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats.,"Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats spontaneously develop fulminant hepatitis associated with excessive accumulation of Cu in the liver: thus, they are considered an animal model of Wilson's disease. In this study, we investigated the ability of excess dietary histidine to reduce excessive hepatic Cu accumulation in LEC rats by comparing them with Fischer rats. The results clearly showed that excessive histidine diet significantly stimulated urinary Cu excretion and significantly reduced liver Cu content by 47.5% in LEG rats. Serum Cu content in LEC rats was not affected by excess dietary histidine. We also compared the effects of excess dietary histidine on some liver antioxidant enzyme activities, liver and serum lipid levels, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC and Fischer rats. Dietary histidine decreased the total and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activities in the liver of both strains. In LEC rats, liver cholesterol content decreased and serum cholesterol and phospholipid levels increased when fed an excessive histidine diet. When fed the basal diet, serum alanine aminotransferase activity was higher in LEC rats than in Fischer rats, but a significant decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC rats was observed when fed an excessive histidine diet. These results suggest that excess dietary histidine is effective in removing Cu ions from the liver of LEC rats. Therefore, it may be useful in preventing or treating liver injury in LEC rats and patients with Wilson's disease.",,"Xu, H.;Sakakibara, S.;Morifuji, M.;Salamatulla, Q.;Aoyama, Y.",2003,2022-09-01 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/BJN2003939,0,0,

2269,Wilson's disease: The importance of measuring serum caruloplasmin by non-immunological methods,"Wilson's disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in any child, adolescent, or young adult with liver injury without any other explanation, particularly when hemolysis is present. However, it can also occur in adolescents or young adults with neurologic symptoms limited to the motor system. The first diagnostic screening test is the estimation of serum ceruloplasmin and total serum copper concentrations by calculation of serum ceruloplasmin unbound ('free') copper. Copper-containing serum ceruloplasmin is best determined by measuring oxidase activity, since the immunonephelometric method measures both ceruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo-form. The diagnosis can be confirmed by increased urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient should be screened, and where suspicion persists, a search for the Wilson gene on chromosome 13q14.3 can be used. Life-long follow-up studies are best conducted in a specialist centre. Compliance with chelating therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by determining serum 'free' copper that should be maintained at or near 1.6 mumol/L (10 cups/100 mL). The side effects of treatment are detected by estimation of urinary total protein, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, coagulation factors and liver function tests.",,"Walshe, J.

We also investigated the change in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and determined the biochemical profile in blood and metal levels in urine. We showed that the Zn-treated group had higher levels of MT in hepatic and intestinal cells compared to both the untreated and basal groups. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in the Zn-treated group compared to the untreated and basal groups, whereas Cu and Fe concentrations were decreased. Antioxidant enzyme activities in the Zn-treated group did not change significantly compared to those in the basal group, except for hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity. Moreover, the biochemical data in the blood of the Zn-treated group clearly reveal no liver damage. These observations suggest that Zn plays an important role, not only in its ability to compete with other metals at the level of absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to a reduction in hepatic and renal Cu and Fe accumulations, but also in the induction of MT as a free radical. scavenger.

2274,"Copper toxicity, oxidative stress and antioxidant nutrients","Copper (Cu) is an integral part of many important enzymes involved in a number of vital biological processes. Although normally bound to proteins, Cu can be released and become free to catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Data from in vitro and cell culture studies largely support the capacity of Cu to initiate oxidative damage and interfere with important cellular events. Oxidative damage has been associated with chronic Cu overload and/or excessive Cu exposure from accidents, occupational hazards and environmental contamination. In addition, Cu-induced oxidative damage is implicated in disorders associated with abnormal Cu metabolism and neurodegenerative changes. Interestingly, Cu deficiency in the diet also increases cellular susceptibility to oxidative damage. A number of nutrients have been shown to interact with Cu and alter its cellular effects. Vitamin E is generally protective against Cu-induced oxidative damage. While most in vitro or cell culture studies show that ascorbic acid exacerbates Cu-induced oxidative damage, results from available animal studies suggest that the compound is protective. High intakes of ascorbic acid and zinc may protect against Cu toxicity by preventing excessive Cu intake. Zinc also removes Cu from the binding site, where it can cause free radical formation. Beta-carotene, alpha-lipoic acid and polyphenols have also been shown to reduce Cu-induced oxidative damage. More studies are needed to better understand the cellular effects of this essential, but potentially toxic, trace mineral and its functional interactions with other nutrients.

2275,Animal models of copper-associated liver disease,"Recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to identify genetic defects responsible for Wilson's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis, and copper toxicosis in Long Evans Cinnamon rats, poison dairy mice, and Bedlington terriers. The Wilson disease gene is localized on human chromosome 13 and encodes ATP7B, a copper-bearing P-type ATPase. A Wilson disease-like genetic defect occurs in Long Evans Cinnamon rats and toxic dairy mice. Familial copper storage disorders in Bedlington and West Highland white terriers are associated with copper accumulation with liver damage resulting in early subclinical disease and cirrhosis. The canine copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers has been mapped to the canine chromosome region CFA 10q26. Recently, a mutated MURR1 gene was discovered in disease-affected Bedlington terriers. Idiopathic childhood cirrhosis is biochemically similar to copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, but clinically much more severe. Both conditions are characterized by neurological damage and absence of Kayser-Fleisher rings and normal ceruloplasmin levels. A recent study has added the North Ronaldsay sheep to its list of promising animal models for studying Indian childhood cirrhosis. Morphological similarities between the two conditions include periportal to panlobular copper uptake and liver changes ranging from active hepatitis to panlobular pericellular fibrosis and cirrhosis. Certain copper-related disorders, such as chronic active hepatitis in the Doberman pinscher and hepatitis of the Skye terrier, are characterized by copper retention secondary to the underlying disease, thus similar to primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Copper-related liver disease is increasingly recognized in Dalmatians. Copper-related liver diseases in Dalmatians and Long Evans Cinnamom rats share many morphological features. Fulminant hepatic failure in Dalmatians is characterized by high serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and severe necrosis of hepatocytes of the centrilobular areas (periacinar, zone 3). Macrophages and surviving hepatocytes contain copper positive material. Liver disease associated with periacinar copper accumulation has also been described in Siamese cats. Many questions remain to be answered regarding copper metabolism, genetic background, pathogenesis and treatment of copper-related liver diseases in mammals. This review describes the similarities between clinicopathological features of spontaneous copper-related diseases in humans and pets.

2276,Pathogenesis and treatment of Wilson's disease. [Hungarian],"The authors review the pathogenesis, symptoms, and diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disease. It is caused by defective hepatic excretion of copper. The disease is fatal if left untreated. Prevention of serious permanent damage depends on early diagnosis and diagnosis followed by appropriate lifelong anticancer therapy. The goal of treatment for Wilson's disease is to eliminate copper with chelators (D-penicillamine, triethylene tetramine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and to prevent the absorption and accumulation of copper by zinc salts (zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc gluconate).",,"Nagy, J.;Vincze, Z.;Folhoffer, A.;Horvath, A.;Csak, T.;Zelko, R.",2003,,,0,0,
2277,Wilson's disease. [Croatian],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction results in toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms accompanying this disease. Patients usually present between the ages of 10 and 40 with liver disease, neurologic disease of the movement disorder type, or behavioral abnormalities, often a combination of these. Because Wilson's disease is effectively treated, it is extremely important that physicians learn to recognize and diagnose the disease. Laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by a decrease in serum ceruloplasmin, an increase in urinary copper content, and an increase in hepatic copper concentration. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as over 200 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are compound heterozygous. Treatment for Wilson's disease should be lifelong. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective treatment for most patients. Another chelating agent that has been successfully used as initial therapy is trientine. The search for new anticancer drugs for Wilson's disease results in two excellent new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for initial therapy (which is still an experimental drug until now). Liver transplantation is indicated for the fulminant form and in patients with severe disease who do not respond to optimal medical therapy.

[Japanese],"In this study, we present an individual with Wilson's disease associated with olfactory paranoid syndrome and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The first symptom of this female patient was olfactory paranoia at the age of 17. Olfactory paranoia, sialorrhea, dysarthria, and finger tremor developed at age 20, although this psychiatric symptom was well controlled under pharmacological therapy for two years. A year later, rigidity developed. It is also found in the extremities. At the age of 23, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was detected in hematological examinations. Since his extrapyramidal symptoms were progressive, he was referred to our department for evaluation of his neurological status. Based on (1) the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, (2) extrapyramidal manifestations, and (3) decreased serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, Wilson's disease was diagnosed. T2 and FLAIR images of brain MRI showed hyperintense lesions in the putamen, thalamus, and pontine tegmentum. Diffusion-weighted images also showed hyperintense lesions in the thalamus and pontine tegmentum. Chronic hepatitis with copper accumulation was detected in the liver biopsy sample. She has not exhibited olfactory paranoia and ITP exacerbation since D-penicillamine therapy was started. Gait disorder also improved.

2280,"Rare, but important chronic liver diseases. [German]","Presence of steatosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These findings are similar to those with alcoholic liver disease. However, alcohol does not play a significant role in the case of NASH. Risk factors for the development of NASH are obesity and diabetes. Most patients are clinically asymptomatic. This means that the diagnosis of NASH is a diagnosis of exclusion: viral, autoimmune, metabolic, and toxic liver disease must be excluded. The disease has a benign clinical course. The risk of cirrhosis is low. So far, there is no established treatment. Preliminary reports suggest a positive effect of weight loss and ursodeoxycholic acid. Wilson's disease, a copper storage disorder with decreased biliary copper excretion, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Most patients with Wilson's disease become symptomatic between the ages of 6 and 15. Serum ceruloplasmin levels and serum copper concentrations are decreased in approximately 90% of patients. Copper excretion increases. Histological examination of liver biopsy specimens reveals fatty infiltration, Mallory bodies, and ballooned glycogen nuclei, which are abnormalities also found in alcoholic liver disease. The definitive diagnostic parameter is the quantitative determination of liver copper content (> 250 micrograms/g dry weight). Untreated Wilson's disease is always fatal. Lifelong treatment with anti-copper drugs is essential, D-penicillamine is first-line therapy. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The frequency of the disease is high. The first symptoms can usually be found at the age of 20-50 years. Up to 50% of patients develop arthralgia. Most organs are involved, mostly the liver. The organ is usually enlarged, transaminases are always moderately elevated. Laboratory findings reveal a marked increase in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. More than 80% of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The first-line treatment of HD is phlebotomy. Treatment lasts for life. When serum ferritin falls below 50 microgram/l, the frequency of phlebotomy should be reduced (4-12 per year). The risk of HCC is very high if the patient already has cirrhosis.",,"Maier, K.

2282,Appropriate administration schedule of D-penicillamine based on urinary copper excretion for pediatric Wilson's disease patients. [Japanese],"The aim of this study was to increase the amount of copper excreted from D-penicillamine (DP) administration in pediatric Wilson's disease (WD) patients. After the administration programs were adjusted, the appropriate time for DP administration was investigated by measuring urinary copper excretion. Subjects were three brothers with pediatric WH. The initial daily dose of DP was 5 mg/kg/day and was gradually increased to a maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg/day. DP was administered 2 hours after the morning and evening meals until the maintenance daily dose was reached. After reaching the maintenance daily dose of DP, the appropriate time to take DP both in the morning and in the evening was investigated. Three schedules of DP administration were compared: 2 hours after meals; 30 minutes before meals (while fasting); and 1 hour before morning and 1.5 hours before dinner (direction 1). Urinary copper excretion achieved at each dose schedule was compared. Little difference was found in urinary copper excretion in the first two programs, namely 2 hours after meals and 30 minutes before meals. When DP was administered 30 minutes before meals, urinary copper excretion [cups/day] was 1173 in the first sibling, 918 in the second, and 875 in the third. However, when administered according to DP direction 1, urinary copper excretion increased significantly to 1701 in the first sibling, 2701 in the second, and 3808 in the third. It is known that the efficiency of urinary copper excretion with DP application depends on the preservation of its chelating ability after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Our results show that excretion is lower when DP is administered 2 hours after meals or 30 minutes before (with fasting) as recommended in the package insert. Therefore, direction 1 is recommended for WD patients to achieve better copper excretion efficiency.

2287,"Wilson's disease. Clinical presentation, treatment and evolution in 21 cases. [French]","Objective - Wilson's disease is characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms with frequent extrapyramidal and intellectual presentations. They have an insidious evolution leading to late diagnosis and less therapeutic efficacy in advanced forms. Methods - We present 21 cases of Wilson's disease with neurological complications, emphasizing the clinical semiology, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic issues in our country. Results - The mean age at disease onset was 17.6 years with a female prevalence (8/13). Symptoms were mostly neurological (71.4%) at first, followed by psychiatric (19%) or hepatic (19%). The most common neurological signs were dystonia (81%), dysarthria (76%), tremor (76%) or motority disorders (71.4%) in members. Sometimes there was sialorrhea or handwriting disorders. Kayser-Fleischer ring was present in 19 patients. Eighteen patients had clinical and/or biological liver involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical studies with low blood copper, decreased ceruloplasmin and very high copper in urine. Brain computed tomography shows cortical and/or subcortical atrophy (37%) and/or low density (35%) of central gray nuclei. Treatment was based on D-penicillamine and/or zinc sulfate depending on the availability of drugs. Evolution was favorable in 18 patients (85%) and not good in 42.8% of cases. Six of the initial patients evolved poorly after many years of follow-up. Finally, a very good outcome was achieved in only 12 patients (57%). In the family examination conducted among 17 patients, 13 family cases emerged. The only predictive factor of poor evolution was therapeutic nonadherence (P = 0.006). Conclusions - Neurological manifestations are traditional during Wilson's disease, but are often overlooked. We should suspect the disease when handwriting disorders or school failure are encountered in children, and when neurological symptoms are encountered in a patient with liver disease in adults. Even if purely psychiatric symptoms are given, we should not hesitate to think about it and we better know that we should look for neurological ones.

The current scheme of disease treatment is detailed and established. It aims to remove the excess of toxic copper ions from the organism as quickly as possible. The application of conventional and recently introduced chelating agents during the initial phase of therapy usually results in rapid excretion of tissue copper deposits and maintenance of copper metabolism balance.

2290,Copper metabolic defects and liver disease: Environmental aspects,"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for many biological processes. Cu homeostasis is generally well maintained by established controls on intestinal absorption, biliary excretion, and intrahepatic storage. Copper deficiency disorders are rare. Acute Cu toxicity sometimes occurs in accidental poisoning with Cu sulfate. Chronic Cu toxicity in the form of liver cirrhosis and damage to other organs is classically seen in Wilson's Disease (genetic abnormality of Cu metabolism) and the putative environmental disorder Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (ICC). The clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of ICC are described. Evidence linking ICC to environmental Cu (i) greatly increased hepatic Cu; (ii) early introduction of Cu-contaminated milk boiled or stored in brass vessels; (iii) dramatic reduction in ICC across the country coinciding with the change in supply vessels; and (iv) persistence of prolonged remission after drug discontinuation in patients treated with D-penicillamine. Although a genetic predisposition is strongly suspected, the nature and role of a second factor in the causation of ICC remains unclear. Scattered reports of an ICC-like disease (Idiopathic Cu Toxicosis, Endemic Tyrolean Infantile Cirrhosis) from the West suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic or both) may lead to the same end-stage liver disease - 'echogenetic' disorders. © 2002 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",,"Pandit, A.

A female patient was admitted to the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague with fulminant liver failure treated with acute liver transplant. Only 9 of 18 patients with chronic liver disease at diagnosis met Sternlieb diagnostic criteria.

METHODS: Twenty-three in vitro models of cultured HLD skin fibroblasts were constructed to observe intracellular exchange of microelements (Cu2+, Zn2+, etc.) before and after addition of GDD-containing rabbit serum. RESULTS: After treatment with serum containing GDD for 24 hours, the intracellular Cu2+ content decreased from (80.94 +/- 34.76) ng/mg (46.90 +/- 22.14) to ng/mg, while that of Zn2+ P < 0.01 ( 140.43 +/- 33.81) ng/mg to (151.43 +/- 37.83) ng/mg, P < 0.01.

Large amounts of copper excreted in the urine (3555 mg/12 hours and 5180 mg/12 hours after d-penicillamine challenge, respectively) confirmed the diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed due to the rapid deterioration of the patient's general condition (hemolysis, diathesis hemorrhagic, ascites, encephalopathy increased in 3-day clinical observation). A diagnosis of ischemic type biliary lesion (ITBL) II stage was made after transplantation. The woman is still being treated with Prograf and Urso-Falk.

2298,Hepatic copper concentration in children undergoing living-associated liver transplantation for Wilsonian fulminant liver failure.,"Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with the fulminant form of Wilson's disease (WD) with end-stage liver failure. To evaluate whether living-associated liver transplantation (LRLT) can restore copper metabolism in WD patients, we examined two children who underwent LRLT for fulminant liver failure. They were 7 and 13 years old when LRLT was performed. Serum ceruloplasmin levels, serum copper levels, urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper concentrations were measured. Serum ceruloplasmin levels (16.7 +/- 1.2 mg/dL) and serum copper levels (67.0 +/- 1.4 cups/dL) were lower than the normal range after LRLT in case 1. LRLT, but not normalized (status 1, 191.2 +/- 182.2 cups/day; status 2, 140.0 +/- 156.7 cups/day). In both cases, hepatic copper concentrations were slightly elevated after LRLT (case 1, 158.8 +/- 44.6 cups/g dry weight; case 2, 147.0 cups/g dry weight) but did not exceed 250 cups/g dry weight. LRLT is a curative procedure in Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant liver failure or advanced cirrhosis. However, this study shows that copper metabolism conditions in WD patients undergoing LRLT are similar to those in heterozygous genetic carriers. Because in vivo donors are parents carrying the abnormal gene, LRLT cannot completely restore copper balance in WD patients.",,"Komatsu, H.;Fujisawa, T.;Inui, A.;Sogo, T.;Sekine, I.;Kodama, H.;Uemoto, S.;Tanaka, K.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1399-0012.2002.01074.x,0,0,

2300,Wilson's disease. [Spanish],"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. It usually occurs in the 2nd and 3rd decades with a prevalence of 1.40.000. Transmission as an autosomal recessive disease is linked to the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1. It begins with neurological, psychiatric or hepatic symptoms and can affect other systems. Laboratory tests show elevated serum-free copper as well as elevated 24-hour urine copper excretion and decreased serum ceruloplasmin. Brain scans show putamen abnormalities. Sometimes a liver biopsy with high copper levels is required to confirm the diagnosis. Its treatment is based on low dietary copper intake and drugs such as penicillamine, zinc, trientine and tetrathiomolybdate. Cases with severe hepatic impairment respond to liver transplantation. Untreated patients die from liver dysfunction and severe neurological deterioration. Treatment can control copper toxicity and improve symptoms, especially when administered early.

2304,Addition of Wilson's disease mutations to the zinc-bearing P-type ATpase of Escherichia coli: P634L mutation in the 'hinge' motif (GDGXNDXP) impairs formation of the E<inf>2</inf>P state,"ZntA, a bacterial zinc-carrying P-type ATPase, is homologous to two human ATPases mutated in Menkes and Wilson's diseases. To investigate the roles of bacterial ATPase residues homologous to those involved in human diseases, we added several point mutations to ZntA. Mutants P401L, D628A and P634L correspond to Wilson's disease mutations P992L, D1267A and P1273L, respectively. The D628A and P634L mutations are located in the C-terminal portion of the phosphorylation site in the hinge motif, which is conserved in all P-type ATPases. P401L is located close to the N-terminal portion of the phosphorylation domain, while the H475Q and P476L mutations affect the heavy metal ATPase-specific HP motif in the nucleotide binding domain. All mutants show reduced ATPase activity corresponding to 0-37% of wild-type activity. Mutants P401L, H475Q, and P476L are weakly phosphorylated by both ATP and P<inf>i</inf>. Dephosphorylation rates are slow. The D628A mutant is inactive and cannot be phosphorylated at all. In contrast, mutant P634L with six residues apart in the same domain shows normal phosphorylation by ATP. However, phosphorylation by P<inf>i</inf> is virtually absent. In the absence of added ADP, the P634L mutant dephosphorylated much more slowly than the wild type, while in the presence of ADP the rate of dephosphorylation is faster than the wild type. We conclude that the P634L mutation affects the conversion between the E<inf>1</inf>P and E<inf>2</inf>P states, so that the mutant promotes E<inf>1</inf> or E. <inf>1</inf>P status.",,"Okkeri, J.;Bencomo, E.;Pietila, M.;Haltia, T.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02810.x,0,0,

Results: There was no significant difference in nighttime sleep duration, but WD patients had a significantly higher number of nocturnal awakenings compared with RG. Fifty-nine percent of WD patients reported being awake for more than 30 minutes, often during the night. The number of nighttime awakenings was associated with nightmares and palpitations only in the WD group. WD patients complained of not feeling rested after sleep, frequent naps, and fatigue significantly more frequently than RG. Also, sleep paralysis and cataplexy occurred more frequently in WD patients than in RG. Conclusion: The sleep patterns of the treated patients with WD were different from the reference group.

2309,Cardiac involvement in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that results in pathological copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other tissues. One of the reported symptoms is cardiac involvement. Methods: We studied 42 patients with Wilson's disease (19 men and 23 women, mean age 34+/-10 years) and 42 healthy volunteers of the same age and sex. All subjects underwent full echocardiographic examination; 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring was performed in 23 patients with Wilson's disease. Results: Compared with healthy volunteers, patients with Wilson's disease had increased thickness of the interventricular septum (9.5+/-1.4 vs 8.6+/-1.1 mm, p < 0.01) and left ventricular (LV) posterior wall (9.1+/-). 1.3 vs 8.2+/-1.0 mm, p < 0.01). While the two groups did not differ in LV mass index, the relative LV wall thickness in Wilson disease patients was significantly increased compared to control subjects (0.39+/-0.06 vs 0.34+/-0.04 p < 0.001). Concentric LV remodeling was present in 9 patients (21%) and LV hypertrophy in one patient. Systolic LV function showed a non-significant trend towards lower values in Wilson's disease patients (EF 62%+/-5% vs. 64%+/-5%, p = 0.06). The frequency of diastolic filling and valve abnormalities was similar in both groups. Echocardiographic abnormalities identified did not correlate with type of Wilson's disease manifestation, presence of His1069G1n mutation, laboratory parameters, or duration and type of therapy. Twenty-four hour ECG Holter monitoring detected ECG abnormalities in 10 patients (42%), the most common findings being supraventricular tachycardias and frequent supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement in patients with Wilson's disease is mild, with LV parietal thickening characterized by an increased prevalence of concentric LV remodeling and a relatively high frequency of benign supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystolic beats.",,"Hlubocka, Z.;Marecek, Z.;Linhart, A.;Kejrova, E.;Pospisilova, L.;Martasek, P.;Aschermann, M.",2002,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016546223327,0,0,

Although only a minority of IMDs appear to have these effects, experience is still being gained. For some disorders, patients will not have reached childbearing age. Pregnancies in this group of patients will increase as the management of IMDs improves during childhood and adolescence. Clinicians should be aware of potential complications and carefully consider how best to manage these conditions. Ideally, patients should be followed into adult life by a specialist clinical team capable of implementing a planned approach to conception and pregnancy, but this is often not possible. For disorders for which the risk of complications is well established (eg, phenylketonuria), optimal treatment may lead to a good fetal and maternal outcome. It is also important to consider the possibility that an IMD may be present in fetuses of pregnancies affected by non-immune hydrops, maternal HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), or acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",,"Preece, M.

It is important for clinicians to have knowledge about these diseases and their treatments. Acute liver failure is most often caused by viral hepatitis, paracetamol overdose, or inherited metabolic liver disease. Clinical presentation includes jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis is necessary to prevent complications such as cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. Early supportive therapy, particularly intravenous N-acetylcysteine, may be effective, but liver transplantation is often the definitive treatment and therefore early referral to a specialist unit for liver transplantation is mandatory. Chronic liver failure may be due to unresolved neonatal liver disease such as hereditary biliary hypoplasia or extrahepatic biliary atresia, while autoimmune liver disease or cystic fibrosis in older children are the most common causes. Treatment includes specialized medications, nutritional support, and liver transplantation, which now has a 90% survival rate with a good quality of life.",,"Kelly, D.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, leading to toxic copper accumulation mainly in the liver and brain and other organs such as kidney and cornea. Measurements were made with <sup>125</sup>I-radioimmunoassay. No gender differences or correlations were found between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results in patients with Wilson's disease. It is suggested that the significantly elevated plasma nociceptin level is due to inhibition of Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, endopeptidase 24.15) that inactivates nociceptin by toxic copper levels, since replacement of the central Zn atom to Cu is known to result in an approximate outcome. 50% inhibition in the activity of these enzymes.

2313,Reduction of copper and metallothionein by tetrathiomolybdate but not by deferiprone in toxic dairy rats,"Copper is both essential for life and toxic. Abnormal regulation of copper at the level of intracellular transport has been associated with hereditary diseases in humans, including Wilson's disease (WND). WND results in accumulation of copper and copper and zinc-binding protein metallothionein (MT) in liver and other tissues, liver degeneration and neurological dysfunction. The toxic milk (TX) mutation in mice results in a phenotype that mimics human WND, and it has been suggested that TX is a model of the disease. We characterized TX mice as a model of altered metal ion and MT levels during development and after treatment with the metal ion chelators tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and deferiprone (L1). We report that liver, kidney and brain copper and MT are elevated in TX mice at 3 and 12 months of age. Zinc was significantly higher in TX mouse liver, but not in brain and kidney at both time points. Nodules spontaneously appeared at 8-12 months in TX mouse livers that retained high copper levels but had more normal morphology and low MT levels. Treatment of TX mice with TTM significantly reduced elevated hepatic copper and MT. Transient increases in blood and renal copper accompanied TTM treatment and demonstrated that renal excretion is an important pathway of elimination. On the other hand, treatment with L1 had no effect on liver or kidney copper and MT, but caused an increase in brain copper and MT levels. These data suggest that TTM, but not L1, may be useful in the treatment of copper overload diseases, including WND. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Czachor, J. D.;Cherian, M.

Cu accumulated in the livers of patients with Wilson's disease and its animal model, Long-Evans, rats with cinnamon-like coat color (LEC), is in the form of Cu,Zn-MT, MT is an antioxidant. In contrast to the efficient production of MT in response to excessive Cu accumulation in LEC rats, Cu-binding to MT occurs only marginally under normal conditions. However, this study revealed that Cu binds more to MT with a severe Cu deficiency. That is, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Cu-deficient diet (0.037 mg Cu/g) and deionized water containing trientine, after which the Cu concentration and distribution were determined. It has been suggested that cessation of bile excretion and limitation of Cu supply to ceruloplasmin are the first responses to feeding a Cu-deficient diet, followed by an increase in Cu-MT with maintenance of Cu concentration in the liver. These results suggest that MT induces Cu uptake in a Cu-deficient environment by cleaving Cu from degraded Cu-enzymes and delivering it to Cu chaperones.

2317,Cancer treatment with tetrathiomolybdate: Antiangiogenesis by lowering body copper - A review,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a new copper inhibitor drug developed for Wilson's disease, is a very promising antiangiogenic agent. Copper levels reduced by TM to an antiangiogenic window have demonstrated efficacy against cancer in various animal models as well as patients. The only significant toxicity so far is from overtreatment and excessive bone marrow copper depletion. The resulting anemia and/or leukopenia can be easily treated with dose reduction or drug withdrawal. The concept underlying TM efficacy as an anticancer agent is to meet cellular copper needs and prevent toxicity while the body's copper status is within the window. Copper status is relatively easily monitored by monitoring serum ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein secreted by the liver at a rate dependent on the amount of copper available to be incorporated into the protein. The authors speculate that copper level is a primitive regulator of angiogenesis and growth signaling that has been conserved throughout evolution.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Merajver, S.

MT). Rats receiving 80 mg of zinc acetate per day by gavage and control rats not receiving treatment were killed after 1 or 2 weeks. By immunohistochemical and analytical chemical techniques, we revealed that treated rats had higher MT levels in liver and kidney cells compared to untreated ones. As analytical chemical analyzes showed, tissue Zn concentrations in treated rats were significantly higher than in untreated rats, whereas Cu concentrations were decreased in the liver and kidneys. MT levels also decreased with duration of treatment. A histochemical procedure obtained using autofluorescence of Cu-metallothioneins confirms the following findings: After 2 weeks, the signal was reduced in both liver and kidney sections. This provides a better understanding of the mechanism of Cu metabolism in the two tissues considered.

We report two patients with Wilson's disease supplemented with ALF treated with the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculation System (MARS). Both patients met the criteria for poor prognosis. MARS was used as a bridge to LTx, as LTx was not immediately available in either case. In Case 1, serum bilirubin dropped from 803 to 425 mumol/L after 3 treatments, but increased to 656 mumol/L during a break and fell back to 457 mumol/L with further treatment. Serum copper decreased from 53.7 mumol/L to 35.8 mumol/L after the first treatment session and to 17.4 mumol/L at the end of treatment. In Case 2, MARS treatment for 2 weeks reduced serum bilirubin from 1200 to 450 mumol/L and copper from 35 to 13 mumol/L, with significant improvement in encephalopathy and reduction in ammonia (59 to 34 mumol/L). Both patients successfully bridged to LTx (days 9 and 28, respectively). Albumin-dialysate analysis from the MARS circuit showed that copper removal occurred mostly during the first few hours of treatment, partially adsorbed by albumin and partially by the MARSFlux membrane (Teraklin AG, Rostock, Germany).

2324,Metallothionein and antioxidant enzymes in Zinc-treated Long-Evans Cinnamon rats.,"The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant animal model for Wilson's disease. An abnormal accumulation of Cu and Fe in the liver and low concentrations of both ceruloplasmin and Cu in serum are known to occur in these rats. Cu accumulation is explained by defective expression of the Cu-bearing P-type ATPase gene, which is homologous to the Wilson's disease (ATP7B) gene. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of action of Zn and confirm the role played by this metal on Cu, Zn, Fe, metallothionein (MT) concentrations in LEC rats in short-term treatment experiments (1 and 2 weeks). ), on the activity of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh<sup>8</sup>dG) and antioxidant enzymes. It is well known that Zn induces MT and has the ability to prevent the redox-active metals Cu and Fe from binding to the active sites of Zn metalloenzymes and non-specific binding sites on proteins and causing oxidative damage. Zn administration reduces Cu and Fe transport from the mucosal to the serosal gut sides via competitive mechanisms. Our findings show that even though hepatic Zn and MT concentrations decrease with treatment duration, treatment with zinc acetate increases tissue Zn and MT content and decreases Cu and Fe concentrations in liver and kidneys. Stimulation of MT synthesis by Zn contributes to the reduction of free radicals produced by Cu and Fe.

Fifty patients of varying disease duration and severity were evaluated clinically and electrophysiologically for autonomic dysfunction using sympathetic skin response (SSR) to deep breathing and RR interval variability (RRIV). Change in heart rate (DELTAHR) was calculated from RRIV. Five patients had at least one autonomic symptom and one asymptomatic patient had significant postural hypotension. Absent SSR and abnormal DELTAHR were recorded in seven patients. Overall, 13 patients had electrophysiological dysautonomia and an additional six patients had clinical dysautonomia. All had normal peripheral conductions and all but one had normal liver functions. Dysautonomia was more common in patients with neurologic presentation (12/32) than in patients without neurologic presentation (1/18) (p = .012). Dysautonomia, often subclinical, is common in Wilson's disease and is probably of central origin. It is more common in those with a neurological presentation.

Methods: Iron indices (ferritin, transferrin saturation [TS], serum iron), liver parameters, prevalence and significance of C282Y and H63D HFE mutations were studied in 40 Caucasian patients with Wilson's disease and 295 healthy controls. Due to the specific treatment, Wilson's disease was well controlled in all but one patient. Results: Allele frequencies for the C282Y (6.2% vs 11.3%) and H63D (18.8% vs. 16.4%) mutations did not differ between patients with Wilson's disease and healthy controls. A patient with C282Y homozygous HH and Wilson's disease was identified, showing progressive liver disease despite reasonable vessel cutting and copper chelation therapy. No differences in iron indices and liver values were seen between HFE heterozygous and HFE wild-type patients with Wilson's disease. Higher serum ferritin levels were noticed in patients with Wilson's disease compared to healthy controls (149 +/- 26 cups/1 vs. 87 +/- 8 cups/1; P < 0.03). Conclusions: It seems reasonable to evaluate iron indices in patients with Wilson's disease to detect iron overload.

2333,Zinc in liver disease,"The necessity of zinc for humans was first documented by Prasad in the 1960s. In the last 35 years, zinc deficiency has been recognized in humans as a result of nutritional factors and various disease states. Many of the clinical features of liver cirrhosis have been associated with zinc deficiency, including loss of body hair, testicular atrophy, anorexia, impaired immunity, changes in taste and smell, decreased metabolism of vitamin A and thyroid hormones, alterations in protein metabolism, delayed wound healing. and decreased drug elimination capacity. One of the most interesting and novel aspects regarding the possible role of zinc deficiency in the manifestation of clinical features of liver cirrhosis is the possible relationship between zinc and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Long-term zinc supplementation improves neurological symptoms and metabolic parameters in patients with HE. In Wilson's disease, an inherited defect of hepatic copper, zinc is used for maintenance as well as to treat presymptomatic, pregnant, and pediatric patients. Zinc may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C. This study is an attempt to review the available knowledge in this area to understand the important role that zinc plays in the pathogenesis and treatment of various liver diseases. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Grngreiff, K.",2002,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jtra.10002,0,0,
2334,Wilson's disease,"Sir Alexander Kinnear Wilson gave the original description of hepatolenticular degeneration syndrome almost a century ago and correctly suggested the link between observed cirrhosis of the liver and neurological signs and symptoms. However, it was not known at that time that copper was an etiopathological agent. Although the genetic basis of this disease is now clear, our understanding of its pathogenesis is still evolving. Wilson's disease (WD), as the syndrome was later named, is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations of the adenosine triphosphatase 7B (ATP7B) gene on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a copper transporter in hepatocytes that is critical for hepatic excretion of excess. conversion of copper to bile. Although WD is a relatively rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism and is present in approximately 1 in 30,000 people, it is commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of patients younger than 45 years with fulminant liver failure or unexplained liver disease, or in patients with neurological or psychiatric symptoms. liver disease. When WD is properly identified and treated, disease progression is prevented and reversal of copper-induced injury can occur. Specific clinical and biochemical findings used for diagnosis include serum ceruloplasmin, serum and urine copper, corneal Kayser-Fleischer rings, and hepatic histology, histochemistry, and copper content. Identification of the gene enabled testing by haplotype analysis for siblings of identified patients and direct mutation analysis for de novo diagnosis in certain populations with dominant mutations. Treatment is life-long medical therapy with chelating agents or zinc to remove copper or prevent its absorption, or liver transplant that ameliorates the metabolic defect.",,"Schilsky, M.

2336,Wilson's disease: a case and review of the literature. [French],"Wilson's disease: a case and review of the literature. Wilson's disease is a relatively rare, autosomal recessive inherited copper transport disorder caused by toxic copper accumulation in the liver and brain. In patients with Wilson's disease, both the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin and the excretion of this metal into the bile are impaired. These conditions are caused by a genetic defect in the Wilson disease gene (ATP7B), which is mapped to chromosome 13. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, results of basic laboratory tests such as low serum ceruloplasmin level, increased urinary copper excretion, and liver. copper content and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings. An emerging method for diagnosis is the use of molecular techniques. Various treatments are available to increase urinary excretion and decrease intestinal absorption of copper.

2340,Molecular diagnosis of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical criteria, but these are increasingly recognized as having low sensitivity. Genetic diagnosis is impractical due to the wide coding region of the ATP7B gene and the extreme diversity of mutations. We evaluated the feasibility and utility of genetic diagnosis in WD. The coding region of the ATP7B gene was screened by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in 6 cases with uncertain diagnosis of WD. In addition, we attempted molecular diagnosis in 26 WD patients of similar ethnicity but with variable disease manifestations. In 6 individuals whose biochemical/clinical diagnosis was uncertain, DNA analyzes were useful to determine their status according to WD. Molecular diagnosis identified presymptomatic individuals in families affected by WD and assigned heterozygous carrier or wild-type status to individuals previously diagnosed as affected. In 26 WD patients, 92% of disease alleles were identified. The most common mutations are H1069Q, L936X, and 2532delA, representing 48%, 10, and 8% of disease alleles, respectively. Three new mutations were identified: Q898R, 3061(-1)g -> a and 3972insC. A genetic diagnosis for WD is possible. Further application of molecular diagnosis should enable the evaluation of the full spectrum of the WD phenotype, which is not possible with currently available diagnostic criteria.

A clinical score was obtained from the sum of the scores assigned to the extrapyramidal, pyramidal, and cerebellar symptoms. TMS was applied to all patients. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. MEP threshold and amplitude, central motor conduction time (CMCT), CSP threshold, CSP and peripheral silent period (PSP) duration were measured. Three patients also underwent transcranial bifocal electrical cortical stimulation (TES) and MEPs from the APB muscle were recorded, and CMCT, MEP threshold, and amplitude were measured. Six patients had no TMS MEPs in relaxed muscles and three patients in contracted muscles. CMCT was prolonged in six patients. APB correlates with CMCT clinical score. In three patients in whom TMS elicited or did not show abnormal MEP, TES MEPs were at normal threshold and amplitude. Seven patients had an elevated CSP threshold and one had no CSP.

2352,"Copper chelating agent, trientine, suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis in murine hepatocellular carcinoma cells","Angiogenesis is now recognized as a crucial process in tumor development, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since HCC is known as a hypervascular tumor, anti-angiogenesis is a promising approach to inhibit the development of HCC. Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is used in clinical practice as an alternative copper (Cu)-chelating agent for patients with Wilson's disease penicillamine intolerance. In our study, we examined the effect of Cu-chelating agents on tumor development and angiogenesis in a murine HCC xenograft model. Although both trientine and penicillamine in drinking water suppressed tumor growth, trientine showed a stronger inhibitory effect than penicillamine. In combination with a Cu-deficient diet, both trientine and penicillamine virtually abolished the development of HCC. Trientine treatment resulted in significant suppression of neovascularization and increased apoptosis in the tumor, while tumor cell proliferation itself was not changed. In vitro studies have also shown that trientine is not cytotoxic to tumor cells. On the other hand, it significantly suppressed endothelial cell proliferation. These results demonstrated that Cu plays a crucial role in tumor development and angiogenesis in murine HCC cells, and Cu-chelators, particularly trientine, can inhibit angiogenesis and increase apoptosis in tumor as a result of suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Trientine may be an effective new strategy for future HCC treatment as it is already used in clinical practice without any serious side effects compared to penicillamine. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Yoshii, J.;Yoshiji, H.;Kuriyama, S.;Ikenaka, Y.;Noguchi, R.;Okuda, H.;Tsujinoue, H.;Nakatani, T.;Kishida, H.;Nakae, D.;Gomez, D.

2354,"Copper in disorders with neurological symptoms: Alzheimer's, Menkes, and Wilson's diseases","Copper is an essential element for the activity of a number of physiologically important enzymes. Enzyme-related malfunctions can contribute to serious neurological symptoms and neurological diseases: copper is a component of cytochrome c oxidase, which catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water, the essential step in cellular respiration. Copper is a cofactor of Cu/Zn-superoxide-dismutase, which plays a key role in the cellular response to oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Also, copper is a component of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. Detailed investigation of the biological significance and functional properties of proteins associated with neurological symptoms will have a significant impact on the understanding of disease mechanisms and may accelerate the development and testing of new therapeutic approaches. Copper-binding proteins play important roles in maintaining and maintaining metal-ion homeostasis, deficit disorders with neurological symptoms (Menkes disease, Wilson's disease) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease). The Menkes and Wilson proteins have been characterized as copper transporters and it has been proposed that the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) act as a Cu(II) and/or Zn(II) transporter. Experimental, clinical, and epidemiological observations in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and genetically inherited copper-dependent disorders Menkes and Wilson's disease are summarized.

There are diseases caused by nuclear genes encoding non-OXPHOS mitochondrial proteins, such as frataxin (likely to play an important role in the mitochondrial-cytosolic iron cycle), paraplegin (possibly a mitochondrial ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease of AAA) in Friedreich's ataxia. - ATPases in hereditary spastic paraparesis) and possibly Wilson's disease protein (an abnormal copper carrying ATP-dependent P-type ATPase associated with Wilson's disease).

There are also disorders with as yet undetermined evidence of mitochondrial involvement.

Results: The amounts of copper deposited in liver tissues of G2 were significantly higher than those of G1 (p = 0.008). Brain copper levels were significantly higher in G3 than in G1 and G2 (p < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively), while hepatic concentrations were not statistically different. Rats in G5 had significantly lower liver and brain copper levels than G3 (p = 0.023 and < 0.001, respectively). There was a significant reduction in brain copper levels in G4 compared to G3 (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The decrease in copper levels in both liver and brain tissues with penicillamine in copper overloaded rats suggests that mechanisms other than the redistribution effect in the brain may be responsible for the neurological deterioration caused by penicillamine treatment in patients with WD. In addition, zinc may have an early effect in preventing excessive copper accumulation, possibly by inducing metallothioneine synthesis in the liver. In conclusion, it can be used with zinc chelating agents in the initial control of patients with neurological symptoms.",,"Ozcelik, D.;Eralp, Y.;Oztekin, G.;Dursun, S.;Uzunismail, H.",2001,,,0,0,

Treatment of copper storage disease includes dietary copper restriction and the use of a copper chelator or zinc acetate to prevent copper absorption. Long-term treatment with a chelator has the potential to result in copper deficiency, particularly in a heterozygous carrier with a high hepatic copper concentration. Copper deficiency associated with overtreatment should be considered in dogs receiving chelation therapy with evidence of microcytosis or liver dysfunction.",,"Seguin, M. A.;Bunch, S.

2368,Histochemical characterization of silver-derived metallothionein in rat kidney,"Histochemical characterizations of Ag-induced metallothionein (MT) in rat kidney have been reported. After Ag injection, Ag, Cu and Zn contents increased in kidney and liver. In particular, the Cu content in the kidneys increased dramatically after three Ag injections. Sephadex G-75 elution profiles of the renal cytosol of Ag-injected rats revealed that Cu deposited in the kidneys was dependent on MT as did Ag and Zn. In addition, the localization of Cu- and Ag-MT in the kidney was investigated using autofluorescence signals dependent on Cu- or Ag-thiol clusters and immunohistochemistry. Although MT induced by Ag was predominantly observed in the cortex of the kidney, some MT signaling was also detected in the outer strip of the outer medulla, as well as in the kidneys of LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease (an inherited disorder of Cu metabolism). In these LEC rats, Cu-MT also accumulated in the outer strip of the outer medulla of the kidney. From these results, one possibility could explain that the Cu-MT detected in the outer strip of the outer medulla in the kidney of the Ag-injected rat was associated with the Ag-affected Cu transporter.

2369,A young adult female Wilson's disease case presenting with mental disorder and frontal lobe findings. [Japanese],"We present a young female case of Wilson's disease who presented with mental disorder and frontal lobe findings. The patient was admitted to our neurological unit on October 4, 1999 due to schizophrenia-like symptoms, dysphagia, dysarthria and gait disturbance. He showed slowly progressive rigidity and dystonia. His parents were second cousins. Neurological examination revealed bilateral pyramidal and extrapyramidal findings, and frontal lobe findings (including imitation behavior). Tendon reflexes were slightly exaggerated in all extremities. Bilateral Babinski, Chaddock and Hoffmann findings were positive. His revised verbal IQ on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale was 49. Biochemical examination revealed low plasma copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Cranial MRI showed diffuse brain atrophy and enlargement of the lateral ventricles. T<inf>2</inf>-weighted images of MRI showed hyperintense signal in both the thalamus and basal ganglia. SPECT showed hypoperfusion of both the thalamus and basal ganglia in the left frontal lobe. Diffuse 2q wave was detected in EEG. Wilson's disease was diagnosed and D-penicillamine 900mg/day treatment was started. This hypoperfusion of SPECT and EEG findings resolved after 2 months under D-penicillamine treatment. Neurological findings showed slight improvement. A few Wilson's disease patients presenting with mental disorders have been reported.

2370,Visual pathway abnormalities Wilson's disease an electrophysiological study using electroretinography and visual evoked potentials,"The pathogenesis of pattern-reversed visual evoked potential (PRVEP) abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) has not been previously investigated. Because electroretinography (ERG) assesses the functional integrity of the retina, it was used in conjunction with PRVEP to localize abnormalities in PRVEP in Wilson's patients. Ten newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients underwent PRVEP and flash ERG immediately after diagnosis. PRVEP delays were prolonged compared to controls (P<0.001). Photopic and scotopic A waves and oscillation potentials were prolonged (P<0.02) with a decrease in the amplitudes of photopic A and B waves (P<0.001). Six of these patients underwent repeat PRVEP and flash ERG after clinical improvement with specific therapy. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment visual electrophysiological studies revealed a significant reduction in the latency of PRVEP and flash ERG A wave (P<0.05), with an increase in the amplitudes of PRVEP's P100 (P<0.05), flash ERG's A and B waves ( P <0.01). These findings confirm the reported PRVEP changes in WD and further demonstrate the reversibility of retinal dysfunction that partially contributes to PRVEP abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first ERG study in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. In addition, there is no previous report in the literature evaluating the effect of specific therapy on PRVEP and ERG in Wilson's disease.

2371,Comparative efficacy of various potential treatments for copper mobilization in copper-overloaded rats,"D-Penicillamine (DPA) is effective in the treatment of Wilson's disease, whereas zinc salts are also used for the treatment of this copper transport disorder. Recently, it has been shown that the copper chelators 1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecane tetrahydrochloride (TAUD) and tetraethylenepentamine pentahydrochloride (TETREN) may be beneficial for copper mobilization in rats. As these agents may be potential clinical alternatives to DPA in patients with Wilson's disease intolerant to this drug, we examined whether oral administration of TAUD and TETREN in copper-overloaded experimental rats was effective in mobilizing copper. The efficacy of co-administration of zinc and DPA, TAUD or TETREN was also evaluated. Rats were charged copper with 0.125% copper acetate in water for 12 weeks. After this period, DPA, TAUD and TETREN were administered by gavage of 0.67 mmol/kg/day for 5 days and zinc was given as 2.5 mg Zn/kg/day. Twelve-week copper loading resulted in a 32-fold increase in total hepatic copper. TETREN was the most effective chelator in increasing urinary excretion of copper. However, it did not significantly reduce hepatic copper levels. In contrast, co-administration of zinc and chelating agents significantly reduced the amount of copper found in feces. Although TAUD and TETREN show a similar or higher efficacy in mobilizing copper than DPA, concomitant treatment of chelating agents and zinc salts should be discarded based on current results.",,"Domingo, J.

2373,Diagnosing Wilson's disease: Over thirty years of experience,"Background - Wilson's disease is a rare but treatable condition that often presents diagnostic dilemmas. These dilemmas have mostly not been resolved by identifying and cloning the Wilson disease gene. Objectives - To report our more than three decades of experience with patients with Wilson's disease in order to demonstrate the different presentation patterns and thus broaden the diagnostic approach. Methods - Clinical and laboratory findings of 30 patients with Wilson's disease were reviewed. Results - Twenty-two patients presented with liver findings (eight with fulminant hepatic failure and 14 with chronic liver disease), three with neurological disease and one with hemolysis; four of them were asymptomatic siblings of patients with Wilson's disease. Seventy percent were diagnosed within six months of the onset of symptoms, but diagnosis was delayed for up to nine years. The age range at diagnosis was wide (7-58 years) and five patients were over 40. 18% of patients presenting with non-fulminant disease had neither Kayser-Fleischer rings nor low ceruloplasmin concentrations. Elevated liver copper concentrations were found in all patients, except one patient who was treated with penicillamine for six years. Additional diagnostic features in fulminant liver failure (n=8) include evidence of hemolysis, increased urinary copper (range 844-9375 cups/24 hours), and high levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper (range 325-1743 cups/l). . Conclusions - Diagnosis of Wilson's disease still mainly depends on evaluation of clinical and laboratory evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. No feature is reliable, but a diagnosis can usually be made provided it is suspected.

2376,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVII: Treatment during pregnancy,"Treatment for Wilson's disease continues to evolve. In 1997, zinc acetate containing penicillamine and trientine was added to the list of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The mechanism of the copper inhibitory effect of zinc is unique. It induces intestinal cell metallothionein, which binds copper and prevents its passage into the blood. As intestinal cells die and shed, the copper it contains is excreted in the feces. Thus, zinc inhibits the absorption of copper from the intestines. It is universally agreed that patients with pregnant Wilson's disease should continue anticancer therapy during pregnancy. There are numerous reports of such patients who discontinued penicillamine therapy to protect their fetuses from teratogenicity, but suffered severe deterioration or even death from renewed copper toxicity. Penicillamine and trientine have teratogenic effects in animals, and penicillamine has known teratogenic effects in humans. In this report, we discuss the outcomes of 26 pregnancies in 19 women who received zinc therapy throughout their pregnancy. The evidence is good that zinc protects the mother's health during pregnancy. Fetal outcomes were generally quite good, although one infant had a surgically correctable heart defect and the other had microcephaly.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Johnson, V. D.;Dick, R. D.;Hedera, P.;Fink, J.

2380,Oxidative phosphorylation defects in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease,"Background. Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in a P-type ATPase and is associated with copper accumulation in the liver and brain. The WD protein resides in the trans-Golgi network and can also be transferred to mitochondria. The WD protein functions as a P-type copper carrying ATPase in the Golgi, but any effects in mitochondria are currently unknown. Methods We examined mitochondrial function and aconitase activity in WD liver tissue and compared the results with a set of healthy controls and patients without WD. Results. There was evidence of severe mitochondrial dysfunction in the livers of patients with WD. Enzyme activities were reduced as follows: complex I 62%, complex II + III 52%, complex IV 33% and aconitase 71%. These defects did not appear to be secondary to penicillamine use, cholestasis, or poor hepatocellular synthetic function. Translation. The results show that there is an energy metabolism defect in WD. The pattern of enzyme defects suggests that free radical generation and oxidative damage, possibly mediated by mitochondrial copper accumulation, are important in the pathogenesis of WD. These results provide a rationale for a study of the use of antioxidants in WD.",,"Gu, M.;Cooper, J. M.;Butler, P.;Walker, A. P.;Mistry, P. K.;Dooley, J. S.;Schapira, A. H.

[Serbian],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the inability of the liver to excrete copper into the bile and incorporate copper into ceruloplasmin. The gradual accumulation of copper in various tissues causes dysfunction of organs, so that untreated disease is always fatal. Because the symptoms of Wilson's disease are variable and the disease is as well concealed as anything else, recognizing the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major challenge, leading to severe underdiagnosis of the disease. The longer recognition and diagnosis is delayed, the greater the risk of permanent damage, primarily to the liver and/or brain. The availability of effective treatment and the risk of delaying treatment make possible early diagnosis critical. Current treatments include chelators that increase urinary excretion of copper and tetrathiomolybdate, which complex with copper and block intestinal absorption of copper or render blood copper non-toxic.

2384,Zinc as initial therapy for Wilson's disease in children. [Serbian],"Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disease of copper accumulation resulting from failure of biliary excretion of excess copper. The accumulated copper causes tissue damage. The chelating drugs penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of therapy, and most patients with WD have been treated with potentially toxic cupriuretic agents. A newer approach has used zinc, which inhibits the absorption of copper and increases copper excretion in the stool, and long-term administration results in a negative copper balance. Until recently, most patients were initially treated with cupriuretic agents to remove excess copper and then maintained with oral zinc. Recently, zinc has also been used as initial therapy and in the treatment of presymptomatic patients. So far, zinc therapy has shown remarkable efficacy and lack of toxicity. In this article, we present our data on the long-term follow-up of three children with WD whose initial and sequential treatment was zinc sulfate. The results demonstrate the efficacy of zinc therapy in the treatment of the presymptomatic patient and in the initial treatment of symptomatic children with WD. Our data also indicate low toxicity. However, pediatric patients should be closely monitored because of their tendency to discontinue treatment when they become asymptomatic.",,"Cacic, M.;Percl, M.;Jadresin, O.;Kolacek, S.",2000,,,0,0,

In this study, we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene, ATP7B, in four Japanese patients with WD. By direct sequencing, we identified five mutations, two of which were novel, and 16 polymorphisms, of which 6 were novel. The 2871delC and 2513delA mutations shift the reading frame in such a way that truncated aberrant protein is expected. In contrast to these mutations found in early-onset patients of the hepatic type, the A874V, R778L, and 3892delGTC mutations were either missense mutations or a framework 1-amino acid deletion and occurred in late-onset patients of the hepato-neurological type. The 2871delC and R778L mutations have been previously reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients. It is known that especially R778L is more common in Asian countries than in other countries of the world. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner. Therefore, the accumulation of mutational species in Japanese patients with WD will facilitate rapid and efficient genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients.",,"Kusuda, Y.;Hamaguchi, K.;Mori, T.;Shin, R.;Seike, M.;Sakata, T.",2000,,,0,0,
2386,Biological regulation of copper and selective removal of copper: Wilson's disease treatment and molecular mechanism. [Japanese],"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element and Cu forms the active center of redox Cu enzymes such as Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD), ceruloplasmin and cytochrome c oxidase. Among the inherited diseases due to a defect in Cu metabolism, Menkes disease (caused by a Cu deficiency) and Wilson's disease (caused by an overaccumulation of Cu) have been shown to result from mutation of genes encoding Cu-binding. ATPase for the flux of Cu, ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Following the identification of these causative genes, specific intracellular Cu transporters (Cu chaperones) for the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and Cu, Zn-SOD were discovered, facilitating investigation of the mechanisms underlying the biological regulation of Cu. In addition to these physiological and biochemical studies, toxicological studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of acute hepatitis caused by Cu accumulation in the liver of LEC rats, an animal model for Wilson's disease. In these toxicological studies, two biological aspects of metallothionein (MT), namely antioxidant and prooxidant have been suggested depending on the Cu/Zn ratio in Cu-containing MT. This article reviews recent findings on the biological regulation of Cu and the toxicological aspect of Cu. It is known that Cu forms a stable ternary complex with molybdenum and sulfur under reducing conditions in the body. Based on this observation, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) was applied to remove Cu from the liver of Long-Evans rats with cinnamon-like coat color (LEC). The precise mechanisms underlying the complex formation between MT-binding Cu and TTM are presented, and a suitable protocol for chelation therapy is proposed along with the mechanisms underlying the formation of side effects.",,"Suzuki, K.

2390,Metabolic fate of the insoluble copper/tetrathiomolybdate complex formed in the liver of LEC rats with excess tetrathiomolybdate.,"Copper (Cu) deposited in a metallothioneine (MT)-bound form in the liver of Long-Evans rats (LEC rats) with a cinnamon-like coat color, an animal model of Wilson's disease, can be removed from MT by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM). However, it is known that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex formed with excess TTM accumulates in the liver. In this study, the metabolic fate of the insoluble Cu/TTM complex was investigated. LEC rats were injected with TTM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days and fed a standard or low Cu diet for 14 days after the last injection. About 95% of the Cu in the liver became insoluble with Mo. Cu concentration in liver supernatants of standard diet fed rats was significantly increased compared to dissected rats (control rats) 24 hours after the last injection. the concentration in rats fed a low Cu diet remained at a level comparable to that in controls. The rate of Cu accumulation in the livers of rats fed the standard diet did not differ before and after treatment, suggesting that there was no rebound effect with treatment with TTM. These results indicate that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is redissolved in the liver and the soluble complex is excreted in the bile and blood, meaning that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is not the source of Cu reaccumulation in bound form. to MT in the liver after TTM treatment. It was concluded that when Cu is complexed with TTM, the metal is either immediately soluble or slowly excreted into the bile and blood.

2396,A novel variant deletion of the copper-bearing P-type ATPase gene found in patients with Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant liver failure.,"Recently, a candidate gene (ATP7B) for Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive copper transport disorder, has been identified. We examined the ATP7B gene in two Japanese sisters with Wilson's disease who presented with fulminant liver failure but did not exhibit Kayser-Fleischer rings or abnormal neurological findings. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood of patients and their families. All exons of ATP7B and their associated splice junctions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of all exons was done using a non-radioactive sequencing method. Sequencing of exon 12 of ATP7B revealed a 9-bp deletion. The mutation deleted 922Gly, 923Tyr and 924Phe and three conserved residues in the Menkes gene ATP7A located in the fifth transmembrane region. Of the 14 family members tested, 7 were normal and 7 were heterozygous for the deletion. Mean serum copper and cerulopasmin levels were significantly lower in family members heterozygous for deletion than in normal family members, and two heterozygous family members showed abnormally low cerulopasmin levels; however, there was no difference in mean aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels between the two groups.",,"Okada, T.;Morise, T.;Takeda, Y.;Mabuchi, H.",2000,April,,0,0,

2398,Dissolution of copper-rich granules in hepatic lysosomes by D-penicillamine prevents the development of fulminant hepatitis in Long-Evans cinnamon rats.,"Background/Purpose: The Long-Evans cinnamon rat has a mutation homologous to the human Wilson's disease gene, leading to massive copper accumulation and the development of hepatitis. D-penicillamine, a copper chelating drug widely and efficiently used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, has also been shown to prevent hepatitis in Long-Evans cinnamon rats. The objectives of this study were: i) to investigate the efficacy of D-penicillamine when administered to already affected animals, and ii) to elucidate the drug's mechanism of action. Methods: Long-Evans cinnamon rats were divided into groups according to age and D-penicillamine treatment. The drug was administered orally before and after the onset of hepatitis. Livers were examined by light and electron microscopy. The effect of D-penicillamine on the intracellular distribution and binding of copper was investigated in more detail. Finally, the interaction between D-penicillamine and specific hepatic copper binding proteins was studied in vitro. Results: D-penicillamine prevented or reversed hepatitis when administered to healthy or diseased animals, respectively. The drug specifically inhibited disease-specific copper accumulation in the lysosomes of hepatocytes, tissue macrophages, and Kupffer cells. When administered to diseased animals, the drug specifically separated copper from insoluble lysosomal particles. Based on the results obtained in vitro, it is likely that the mobilization of this copper proceeds through the dissolution of these particles. In contrast, and as supported by in vitro data, D-penicillamine had only a minor effect on metallothioneine-bound copper in the cytosol. Conclusion: Our findings on the Long-Evans cinnamon rat provide some conclusions about the mechanism of action of D-penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease. The drug inhibits the formation or promotes the dissolution of copper-rich particles that occur in the lysosomes of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the livers of patients with Wilson's disease. After D-penicillamine has been chelated with copper, it can be excreted in the urine. However, the mobilization of copper by D-penicillamine appears to be limited due to the metal's binding to metallothioneine in the liver cytosol. This copper is apparently well tolerated, even at relatively high concentrations.",,"Klein, D.;Lichtmannegger, J.;Heinzmann, U.;Summer, K. H.",2000,February,,0,0,
2399,CopA: An Escherichia coli Cu(I)-substituted P-type ATPase,"The copA gene product, a putative copper-translocated P-type ATPase, has been shown to play a role in copper resistance in Escherichia coli. The CopA gene was disrupted by the addition of a kanamycin gene by homologous recombination. The mutant strain was more sensitive to copper salts but not to salts of other metals, suggesting a role in copper homeostasis. The copper-sensitive phenotype can be rescued by complementation by a plasmid carrying copA from E. coli or copB from Enterococcus hirae. Expression of copA was induced by salts of copper or silver, but not zinc or cobalt. Outward membrane vesicles from CopA-expressing cells exhibited ATP-bound copper deposition, possibly as Cu(I). The results demonstrate that CopA is a Cu(I)-displaced efflux pump similar to the copper pumps associated with Menkes and Wilson diseases, providing a useful prokaryotic model for these human diseases.",,"Rensing, C.;Fan, B.;Sharma, R.;Mitra, B.;Rosen, B.

Cu's fate was determined. TTM, LEC, and Wistar (normal Cu metabolism) rats were intravenously injected with a single dose of 2, 10, or 50 mg TTM/kg body weight, followed by Cu and molybdenum (Mo) concentrations in bile and plasma. time after injection. In Wistar rats, most of the Mo was excreted in the urine, with only a small amount excreted in the bile, while the urinary excretion of Cu was decreased. However, in LEC rats, Cu and Mo were excreted in the bile and blood, and bile was considered the main excretion pathway for the first time. Cu, which was excreted in both bile and plasma, was accompanied by an equimolar amount of Mo. The relative ratio of Cu amounts excreted in bile and plasma is 40/60 for low and high dose groups and 70/30 for high dose groups. medium dose group. Systemic rearrangements of Cu mobilized from the liver and urinary excretion of Mo complexed with Cu were also determined for kidneys, spleen, and brain. Although Mo in the three organs and Cu in the kidneys and spleen were increased or tended to be elevated, Cu in the brain was not increased at all doses of TTM.

2403,Treatment of Wilson's disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults. Clinical manifestations are dominated by hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Diagnostic procedures include determination of total serum copper, free serum copper and serum ceruloplamin concentrations, as well as urinary copper excretion. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be achieved by liver biopsy and histological determination of copper content. The goal of treatment is to reduce tissue copper concentration and detoxify copper. The drugs applied are chelating agents. D-penicillamine and trientine or zinc. Chelation agents increase copper excretion through the kidney and bile, and the synthesis of metallothionein, which binds and detoxifies intracellular copper, resulting in impaired absorption and binding of excess intracellular copper. Treatment with zinc results in induction of hepatic and intestinal metallothionein synthesis. Regular examination of copper metabolism parameters is necessary to control the therapeutic effect. Free copper serum concentrations and urinary copper excretion should reach values below 10 micrograms/dl and 80 micrograms/day, respectively. A significant improvement in clinical symptoms and normalization of copper metabolism parameters can be expected at the earliest six months after the start of treatment. Anti-copper therapy may be accompanied by a low-copper diet. Life-long treatment is necessary and provides a near-normal life expectancy. Interruption of therapy leads to copper redeposition and often to fulminant hepatic failure. This can also be observed as first presentation in 5% of cases (predominantly age 12 to 25). End-stage liver disease and fulminant liver failure are indications for liver transplantation where the genetic defect has been treated phenotypically. Copper removal is no longer necessary here. It is not clear to date whether severe neurological disorders can also be cured.",,"Smolarek, C.;Stremmel, W.",1999,Apr,,0,0,

2413,Treatment of chronic Wilson's disease in 2 patients using plasmapheresis-clinical-biochemical observations. [Croatian],"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) was a historic event [1]. D-pericillamine (d-PAM) myasthenia, kidney toxicity, etc. showed some potential side effects such as Treatment of Wilson's disease (WD) with zinc sulfate started successfully in the previous decade [4]. Danks [7] described the use of exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis, and plasmapheresis in the treatment of young patients with WD with acute liver failure. These patients had acute copper poisoning. The results of this study were useful. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Therapeutic plasmapheresis (PF) has been used in many diseases for which immunological mechanisms have been proven [8, 9]. We started using PF in the treatment of two young chronic patients with Wilson's disease. The clinical picture of the patients worsened, probably due to the decrease in the cupriuretic effect of d-PAM. One patient (1) was not taking d-PAM regularly. In this study, PF was performed using hemonetic V-50 and filter 704. During treatment with PF, 2000 ml of plasma was always replaced, i.e. removed. During the treatment with PF, the patients were admitted to the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of Children and Adolescents. CASE REPORT AND RESULTS: Patient No. 1. A 24-year-old male born in 1965 presented with gross tremor. He was diagnosed with WD at the age of 18. Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in the cornea on slit lamp examination. The disease started at age 15 with polymorphic difficulties. Over time the tremors became more severe. It was evident when the patient made any movement. Initial treatment with PF (1) lasted from 13 February to 16 March 1989. The patient had a PF of 10 without any side effects. During treatment with PF, the patient felt better. After the PF tremor has decreased significantly and the subjective and objective situation has improved. Patient (1) was hospitalized again on 24 June 1991 to continue his PF treatment. Progression of the disease was detected in anamnestic data and neurological examination. His condition got worse, especially tremor. He could not write a single letter (Picture 1-5) and could not walk without the help of others. His tremors became most severe when he made any voluntary movement. The second treatment with PF began on June 25, 1991 and ended on July 16, 1991. He received 9 PF in this series. The treatment was without side effects. Tremor decreased by about 15%. 9 Plasma copper analyzed before and after PF showed different values (Table 2). This difference in plasma copper level (2.79 mumol/l; 23.70%) was removed from the circulation. Patient No. 2. A 23-year-old male patient, born in 1966, came to the hospital with an acute exacerbation of WD. He was diagnosed with latent psychosis at the age of 16. A year later, at the age of 17, he was diagnosed with WD at the hospital. Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea on slit lamp examination. Treatment with d-PAM and other drugs (BAL, symptomatic treatments, sedatives, antidepressants, etc.) was accompanied by good and prolonged remissions and short exacerbations. A few years later, the exacerbation got longer and longer and worsened. He was hospitalized on 28 November 1989 with acute WD recurrence. His condition was very difficult, he was completely bedridden. Treatment with PF began on December 26, 1989 and lasted until January 25, 1990. Treatment with PF was without d-PAM. Only symptomatic treatments were given. After several PFs, he showed side effects with nausea, sometimes vomiting, facial sweating, a pulse rate of about 120/min while his blood pressure was normal. Therefore, he was given human albumin the next day and no side effects were observed. Removal of small amounts of plasma copper from the bloodstream correlated well with a small improvement in clinical symptomatology. Stiffness decreased and voluntary movements",,"Milovanovic, D.

The drug was injected subcutaneously to 40-day-old Long-Evans Cinnamon rats at 5 mg/kg body weight twice weekly for 65 days (20 mg total dose). In Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with tetrathiomolybdate, the hepatic Cu concentration was 60 µg/g wet weight compared to 170 cups/g in untreated rats. In seven brain regions (cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, and cortex), Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with tetrathiomolybdate had slightly lower Cu concentration (1.5 to 2.3 cups/g) (1.6 to 2, 7 cups) /g) relative to untreated rats. A significant difference was found only in the midbrain between the two groups.

2425,Zinc and manganese in schizophrenia,"The essential trace elements zinc and manganese have been implicated as factors in brain diseases since the 1920s. The combined use of zinc and manganese in schizophrenia is based on: 1) increased urinary excretion of copper when both zinc and manganese are administered orally; 2) Zinc alone causes a decrease in blood manganese; 3) Double zinc and manganese deficiencies are often found in patients with copper excess. It is known that the mauve factor (Cryptopyrrole) increases the excretion of zinc and vitamin B<inf>6</inf> (pyridoxine). Insufficient zinc and manganese levels in children have been associated with low learning ability, apathy, lethargy and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc, manganese, and vitamin B<inf>6</inf> and may have excess lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease, and Pick's disease are brain disorders that are dynamically related to zinc and manganese levels. Zinc has been used successfully to treat Wilson's disease, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and specific types of schizophrenia. Manganese is important in the production and degradation cycles of protein and nucleic acid. Manganese was found to be a better effector than magnesium for RNA chain initiation. Manganese stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in brain tissue. Manganese is important in brain function, as cyclic-AMP plays a regulatory role in the action of several brain neurotransmitters. Because zinc is well absorbed from the gut, but manganese is poorly absorbed, high long-term oral doses of zinc without manganese may harm all diagnostic categories. Oral doses of manganese occasionally raise blood pressure in patients over 40 years of age. Zinc alone can lower blood pressure in some hypertensive patients. Chronic user of hydralazine (a manganese chelator) in rats produced manganese deficiency resulting in convulsions. Low blood and serum manganese levels may play a role in epilepsy, possibly by interfering with membrane stability. Long-term use of phenothiazines causes tardive dyskinesia. Phenothiazines can chelate manganese, rendering it unusable for some putative functions as an enzyme activator.",,"Pfeiffer, C. C.;LaMola, S.",1999,First Quarter,,0,0,

Presymptomatic patients were given zinc sulfate alone and used as maintenance therapy when clinical improvement was achieved. 31 children were followed for 4-11 years. Results No clinical abnormalities were found in 3 presymptomatic patients. Of 28 patients with symptoms, 23 (82%) of symptoms and signs decreased or greatly improved, 2 patients (7%) remained unchanged, and 3 (11%) died. Blood concentrations of copper were consistently lower than normal. 24-hour urinary copper excretion was significantly lower in all patients than before combined therapy and returned to normal in 5 (16%) cases after 6 months of treatment and in 26 cases (84%) after 1-2 years of treatment. treatment. During treatment, higher blood zinc concentrations were found in 20 cases (65%), and higher urinary zinc excretion was noted in 25 cases (81%). Conclusion Combination therapy of large-dose zinc sulfate and low-dose penicillamine is an effective, safe, and inexpensive treatment for children with HLD.",,"Li, T.;Lin, R.;Du, S.;Qu, Z.",1999,,,0,0,
2429,Computer simulation of Wilson's disease and treatment with D-penicillamine,"Wilson's disease and its treatment with D-penicillamine were studied by computer simulation. It was necessary to consider a separate form of liver copper for proper simulation of Wilson's disease and a separate urinary D-penicillamine copper excretion for therapy. Both have been suggested but not shown before. These simulations support the conclusion that the liver is not ""decopperized"" by D-penicillamine, neither in Wilson's patients nor in normal subjects. These findings are in line with existing research on the molecular biology of Wilson's disease and support the conclusions that the D-penicillamine-copper complex can facilitate the redistribution of copper to provide the physiological and biochemical responses needed to overcome the liver inflammatory disease associated with Wilson's disease.",,"Blincoe, C.;Sorenson, J.

Fischer (Fischer group) and LEC (LEC- control group) rats fed 7 ppm Cu diet showed normal growth throughout the entire period (60 to 125 days post-natal). On the other hand, LEC rats fed a 30 ppm Cu diet decreased body weight and showed mild jaundice about 100 days after birth. Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM, 10 mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutaneously in half of LEC rats fed a 30 ppm Cu diet at 101 and 105 days after birth. LEC rats given TTM (LEC+TTM group) regained their body weight and jaundice quickly disappeared. However, LEC rats without TTM (LEC-TTM group) had sharply reduced body weight and showed severe jaundice 103 days after birth. At 125 days post-natal, the hepatic Cu concentration in LEC+TTM rats (460 µg/g) exceeded that of LEC control rats (330 µg/g). Our data show that TTM is effective for the treatment of acute liver injury in the LEC rat.",,"Sugawara, N.;Lai, Y. R.;Sugawara, C.",1999,February,,0,0,
2432,"Preventive effect of zinc compounds, polaprezinc and zinc acetate against the onset of hepatitis in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats.","Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats are known to be characterized by fulminant hepatitis as a result of abnormal hepatic Cu accumulation due to Cu-transporter p-type ATPase deficiency. To prevent hepatitis, 30-day-old LEC rats were given orally two Zn compounds, Zn acetate and polaprezinc. A control group of LEC rats fed a basal diet (Cu, 17 ppm; Zn, 50 ppm; Fe, 150 ppm) at 100 days post-natal showed mild jaundice and elevated serum enzyme activities related to hepatic function. There was no jaundice in the groups fed diet enriched with Zn acetate or polaprezinc (as 1000 ppm Zn). Hepatic Cu concentrations in the polaplezink group were 174 +/- 34 mug/g and 156 +/- 23 mug/g Zn acetate group, respectively.

2433,Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease),"BACKGROUND- Wilson's disease is a recessively inherited disease in which a homozygous mutation in the copper ATPase ATP7B gene (on chromosome 13) reduces the liver's ability to secrete ceruloplasmin into plasma and secrete it into bile. REVIEW SUMMARY- Systemic copper deposition leads to progressive liver dysfunction, neurologic impairment, psychiatric disturbance, or combinations of these symptoms. Wilson's disease is diagnosed by measuring copper excretion in 24-hour urine followed by copper in a liver biopsy sample. Wilson's disease is treated with copper removal therapy (penicillamine or trientine) followed by maintenance therapy with zinc. The frequent exacerbation of neurological impairment by penicillamine has prompted the use of tetrathiolmolybdate as an alternative copper-removing agent. CONCLUSION- Wilson's disease should be considered in all patients with unexplained hepatic impairment and unexplained progressive movement disorder or psychiatric disorder. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important. Tetrathiolmolybdate appears to be as effective as penicillamine and is less frequently associated with neurologic worsening than penicillamine.",,"Fink, J. K.;Hedera, P.;Brewer, G.

2436,Anesthesia management of a patient with Wilson's disease. [Japanese],"Wilson's disease, characterized by cirrhosis, extrapyramidal symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, is a rare congenital disease with abnormal copper metabolism. Despite many anesthetic problems, there are no reports in the field of dental anesthesiology. We present an anesthetic management case with Wilson's disease. The patient was a 24-year-old male with multiple teeth scheduled to be extracted. He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at age 11 and was treated with D-penicillamine. It was complicated by cirrhosis, but liver laboratory profiles were normal without mild elevations of ZTT (12.6U) and TTT (5.2U) (Table 1). Esophageal varices were treated with endoscopic varicosclerosis two years ago. Serum copper (16 cups/dl) and ceruloplasmin (less than 0.4 mg/dl) concentrations were significantly reduced and urinary copper excretion increased (130 cups/dl). He had extrapyramidal symptoms such as dysarthria, involuntary movement, and muscle stiffness, but his intellectual function was preserved. After induction of anesthesia with thiamilal, vecuronium, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane, general anesthesia was continued with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane (Figure 1). Since the effect of vecuronium is expected to be prolonged due to liver dysfunction, we monitored the degree of neuromuscular blockade with a nerve stimulator, but recovery from muscle relaxation was normal. During the surgery, first-degree AV block began to be seen on the ECG and then progressed to second-degree AV block (Wenckebach type) (Fig. 2). After administration of atropine sulfate (0.5 mg), 2nd degree AV block disappeared and the patient's hemodynamic status was stable until the end of the surgery. No serious complications were encountered during the operation. No postoperative deterioration in liver or kidney function or extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. Most Wilson's patients respond to treatment with penicillamine, allowing them to return to a normal life. General anesthesia may be required for dental treatments due to involuntary movement or muscle stiffness. We emphasize the need for adequate preoperative screening of cardiac involvement, such as electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiomyopathy, as well as preoperative assessment of liver function. D-penicillamine side effects such as myasthenia gravis and fever also had to be considered.",,"Tanaka, K.;Kamekura, N.;Teramoto, T.;Kimura, Y.;Fukushima, K.",1999,,,0,0,

We observed that LKM1-autoantibodies emerge from the liver 4 months later. Transplantation for Wilson's disease in close association with a steroid-resistant rejection episode in the absence of evidence for autoimmune hepatitis or hepatitis C. Methods: Sera from several time points before and after transplantation were tested for LKM-reactivity by immunofluorescence, ELISA. and Western blotting. Antigen specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis on different cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The absence of viral hepatitis C and hepatitis G virus infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The organ donor's serum was also tested. Results: Pre-transplantation and up to 4 months post-transplantation all sera were LKM-negative by all test systems used. Meanwhile, during a steroid-resistant rejection episode, the patient developed a high titer of LKM antibodies (70% in ELISA inhibition) and has remained positive since then (more than 4 years now). Reactivity was directed only to cytochrome isoenzyme 2D6. Hepatitis C infection never occurred, but hepatitis G was present transiently for years before transplantation. Donor serum was negative for all autoantibodies and hepatitis C and G virus infection. Discussion: Here we describe a patient who developed LKM1-autoantibodies without evidence of autoimmune or viral hepatitis. The close temporal association with an episode of transplant rejection suggests mechanisms of immunological rejection with hepatocellular injury as a pathogenic mechanism.",,"Lohse, A.

Copper is an essential metal that facilitates electron transmission in many critical biological reactions in the organism and is a component of numerous biologically important enzymes. The most important of the inherited metabolic diseases of copper is Wilson's disease, because it is still diagnosed too late at the stage of severe liver damage. Emphasizes new information in pathogenesis - P-type gene of ATP-ase ATP 7B (referred to as WD protein) on chromosome 13q14.3, lack of Cu transport from cell via cell membrane, i.e. excretion of Cu in bile, with common metallothionein instead of ceruloplasmin persistent fetal Cu metabolism, complex approach in diagnosis and new treatment approaches (zinc). The authors analyze the complexity of hereditary hemochromatosis, its frequency, genetic information - mutation of the HLA-H gene (HFE), Fe deposits in tissues and fibrosis stimulation by monocytes, highlighting the mechanism of development of bronze diabetes. As screening, they recommend examining the importance of transferrin saturation (over 50% is highly suspected hemochromatosis), ferritin concentration above 1000 µg/l, gene analysis, liver biopsy, and imaging modalities.

2442,Liver hyperplasia and cancer in the rat: changes in copper metabolism.,"We have previously shown that rats exposed to peroxisome proliferator (PP) diethylhexyphthalate (DEHP) have reduced serum ceruloplasmin (CP) oxidase activity, suggesting tissue copper accumulation. Copper is extremely toxic and causes cellular damage and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). This study addresses changes in the expression of copper-related genes and metal deposition in hyperplastic liver and tumors caused by PP. Male rats were fed for 3-60 days (hyperplasia) and diets containing 4-chloro-6-(2,3 xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio(N-beta-hydroxyethyl)acetamide or diets containing clofibrate (CLF) for 10 months. . (HCC). During hyperplasia, an abrupt and progressive decrease in serum CP activity was observed (P < 0.05), including reductions in mRNA levels for both the CP and the Wilson disease gene (WD gene, a P-type ATPase) (P < 0.05). bearing rats had lower serum CP activity (P < 0.05) and decreased CP and WD gene mRNA levels (P < 0.05) in tumors (P < 0.05) and tumors surrounding the liver (SL). Metallothionein mRNA showed no consistent changes during hyperplasia. Tumors showed 2.5-fold induction (P < 0.05) of metallothionein mRNA and 1.2-fold increase in SL. Transient increases in liver copper content occurred during hyperplasia with 2-fold (DEHP) and 3.3-fold (CLF) increases (P < 0.05) at 60 days. Copper content was 2.2-fold (P < 0.05) higher in tumors and 1.7-fold higher in SL; temporarily iron does not increase and zinc decreases. Therefore, copper accumulation and changes in copper-related gene expression may be contributing factors to liver neoplasia in PP-treated rats. Loss of CP results in reduced free radical scavenging capacity and therefore can increase oxidative damage caused by PPs.",,"Eagon, P. K.;Teepe, A. G.;Elm, M. S.;Tadic, S. D.;Epley, M. J.;Beiler, B.

We analyzed the literature reports of Wilson patients with neurological symptoms and liver transplantation and our personal data and obtained information about 40 patients. Transplantation ameliorated or improved neurological symptoms in 32 (80%) of these. This positive result raises the question whether liver transplantation can be recommended for patients with neurological Wilson's disease but stable liver function. Given the still high mortality after liver transplantation, the neurological status in Wilson patients with stable liver function cannot be a general indication for liver transplantation, in these cases it still needs to be considered experimental. However, liver transplantation can be welcome in patients with severely disabling medically intractable neurological disorders and fully inform them of the risks of the surgery.",,"Stracciari, A.;Guarino, M.;Tempestini, A.;D'Alessandro, R.;Pazzaglia, P.",1999,,,0,0,
2445,Soft metal ion-bearing ATPase families,"In the last 5 years, much progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of action and evolution of soft metal ATPases. Despite the geological ubiquity of metals, evolutionary pressure to evolve has ensured that gene families for soft metal resistances are not confined to a single species or even a single kingdom. There are many questions to be answered and we look forward to accelerated knowledge acquisition in the near future. One question is the function of ArsA homologues. Clearly, in bacteria, the arsA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the ArsAB pump. It is unknown whether eukaryotic and archaeal arsA homologues are orthologous or encode proteins with unrelated functions. Eukaryotes have mechanisms of resistance to arsenic. We showed that resistance is associated with active arsenite extrusion in both Leishmania and Chinese hamster cells (44). However, no genes or gene products that produce resistance have been identified at this time. A second question is the distribution of chaperones for soft metals in bacteria. Homologs of copper chaperones such as Atx1p and Lys7p are commonly found in eukaryotes (12), while bacteria appear to be absent. CopZ functions as a chaperone in E. hirae (10), but homologues with copper chaperone activity have not been found in other bacteria. In addition, it is unclear whether cells need chaperones for redox inactive metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). A third question is the distribution of ZntA homologues in nature. Related Cu(I)-substituted P-type ATPases are found in most organisms. In humans, these pumps are essential for copper homeostasis, and mutations in the ATP7A or ATP7B gene produce inborn errors of copper metabolism that lead to Menkes or Wilson's disease, respectively. While zinc is not as toxic as copper, partly because it is not a redox-active metal, it is still extremely toxic and mechanisms must be in place to prevent excessive accumulation. To date, an increasing number of zntA and cadA genes have been identified for zinc-translocating P-type ATPases. Genes for putative ATP-dependent zinc pumps are discovered in other kingdoms, for example in the genome of Archeaon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (GenBank accession no. 2621474) and the genome of the plant A. thaliana (GenBank accession no. 4210504). Sequencing of the human genome and many other genomes will be completed in the next 5 years. At this point, the phylogenetic distribution of zinc pumps and their relationship with human health and diseases will be better understood.",,"Rensing, C.;Ghosh, M.;Rosen, B. P.",1999,October,,0,0,

2447,Identification of a zinc-binding protein specifically found in male rat liver as carbonic anhydrase III.,"zinc (Zn) binding protein specifically found in the livers of male adult rats was detected by HPLC with inline detection by mass spectrometry (ICP MS). The Zn-binding protein was purified on Sephadex G-75 and G3000SW HPLC columns and identified as carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) based on the amino acid sequence of a peptide obtained by lysyl endopeptidase digestion. CAIII is expressed in the livers of male rats as one of the major Zn-binding proteins in an age-related manner, with Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) binding to CAIII in an amount comparable to that of copper. At 8 weeks. Castration at 4 or 8 weeks of age has been shown to reduce CAIII-bound Zn to 47.5% of the level of mock-treated control, suggesting that sex-linked expression of CAIII is partially regulated by a sex hormone, androgen.

2449,Management of chronic liver disease,"Childhood liver disorders generally have a different presentation from that in the adult population.

Oral chelation therapy and liver transplantation have profoundly impacted the outcome of patients with Wilson's disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are effective in reducing both morbidity and mortality associated with autoimmune hepatitis. Offensive carbohydrates are eliminated from the diet of patients with galactosemia and hereditary fructose intolerance. The most important and often neglected component of the management of chronic liver disease in childhood is nutritional management and rapid interventions for ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy.

2455,The role of Menkes and Wilson's disease proteins in intracellular localization and intracellular copper transport.,"Copper is a heavy metal ion necessary for the activity of various enzymes in the body. Excess copper is a very toxic ion and therefore its metabolism must be regulated effectively. This has been strikingly demonstrated by the genetic disorders of X-linked Menkes disease and autosomal recessive Wilson's disease. In 1993, both Menkes and Wilson genes were isolated and found to encode homologous cation copper-bearing P-type ATPase proteins. Menkes protein (ATP7A) is expressed in most tissues except liver. In contrast, Wilson protein (ATP7B) is abundantly expressed in the liver. The intracellular localization of these proteins was investigated. Both ATP7A and ATP7B are localized in the cell in the trans-Golgi network and the post-Golgi vesicular compartment (PGVC).

2457,Copper transport disorders,"Copper is an essential component of a number of important enzymes. Efficient systems have been developed to provide sufficient copper for essential functions while eliminating excess to prevent tissue toxicity. Copper transport is impaired in two human diseases: Wilson's disease and Menkes disease. Both have defects in copper-bearing membrane proteins. Many other proteins are involved in copper transport. Some of these proteins were identified by studying the similar copper pathway in yeast. This suggests that other copper transport diseases have yet to be discovered. Molecular diagnostics holds promise for reliable diagnosis of patients. Testing for co-markers is a reliable way to identify the presymptomatic siblings of a definite patient. While most heavy metals are too rare or too insoluble to be of biological importance, at least eleven appear to be necessary for normal function. These are vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium, molybdenum and tin<sup>1</sup>. While most of these metals are essential for normal function, they are toxic in excess. Little is known about the homeostatic control mechanisms necessary to maintain the fine balance between necessity and toxicity. Cloning of genes in the copper transport pathway allowed us to better understand the complexity of metal transport systems<sup>2</sup>.",,"Cox, D. W.",1999,,,0,0,

While symptoms of severe proximal weakness and elevated muscle enzymes may lead to a direct diagnosis in an uncomplicated patient taking a single drug, it complicates the diagnosis of toxic myopathy in patients with multisystem disease, using multiple drugs, and having more than one potential cause for weakness. In addition, many toxic myopathies are characterized by nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings and ultimately discontinuation of the drug should be attempted to clarify the diagnosis.

One male and one female beagle received trientine-2HCl orally at variable doses (50 to 2000 mg/kg) or fixed doses of 200 or 600 mg/kg/day for two weeks. Severe symptoms (abnormal gait, ataxia, vomiting, diarrhea, body tremor) and significant body weight loss were evident after an administration of 2000 or 1000 mg/kg. In the fixed dosage phase, similar effects of treatment were evident in both animals receiving 600 mg/kg/day. The approximate lethal dose was considered to be greater than 2000 mg/kg. 2) Four weeks of study. Beagles received oral trientine-2HCl at doses of 50, 125 of 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-week reversibility phase. There was no death. For some animals receiving 300 mg/kg/day, immobility, abnormal gait, ataxia and body tremor were observed during the last week of treatment. In the lungs, interstitial pneumonia was recorded for a control male and four animals receiving 300 mg/kg/day with or without healing. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed that the animals' exposure to trientine-2HCl was dose dependent and there was no significant accumulation of trientine-2HCl during the dosing period. 3) Twenty-six weeks of study. Beagles were scheduled to receive trientine-2HCl orally at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks, followed by a 13-week reversibility phase. However, given the severe symptoms that resulted in the humanitarian sacrifice of two males and one female receiving 200 mg/kg per day at week 9 of treatment, the surviving dogs of this group were treated for only 10 weeks. Signs prior to dispatch included marked low activity, body tremors, abnormal gait, limited limb use, and prone posture. Ante mortem neurological examination generally revealed depressive postural and flexor withdrawal reactions. The symptoms were quickly reversible, except for one woman who was humanely killed on day 2 of her reversibility period. Abnormal 'stiff-legged' gait and inactivity were evident from week 23 of treatment in two men and one woman receiving 100 mg/kg/day.

2465,A critical assessment of copper metabolism in children with Indian Wilson's disease with special reference to their phenotype and relatives.,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation in various organs and presents with the most common clinical manifestations such as liver, neurologic and renal dysfunction. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease were significantly lower when compared to normals, controls, and relatives of Wilson's disease patients, whereas significant hypercupriuria (145 +/- 7 cups/24 hours) was observed only in Wilson's children. A good correlation (r = 0.92) was found between non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper and 24-hour urinary copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Furthermore, copper studies between different phenotypes of Wilson's disease revealed significantly lower serum ceruloplasmin and a marked hypercupriuria in children with Wilson's disease associated with renal tubular acidosis, compared with patients with hepatologic or neurological manifestations. Serum ceruloplasmin levels in 14 patients with Wilson's disease ranged from 14 to 20 mg/dL. These patients of Wilson's disease were confirmed by measuring liver biopsy copper, which was approximately nine times higher than normal hepatic copper content. During family screening with copper studies, four asymptomatic siblings were diagnosed with Wilson's disease. These subjects were subsequently started on D-penicillamine therapy because presymptomatic treatment prevented progression of disease complications.",,"Prasad, R.;Kaur, G.;Walia, B. N.

2466,Copper and boron as examples of nutritional trace elements important in bone development and disease,"Boron and copper are examples of elements that are found in small or 'trace' but significant amounts in man. Copper is essential for bone growth and development, and copper supplementation reduces bone loss in middle-aged women. Copper deficiency is indicated by the presence of long bone abnormalities (osteopenia, wear and pitting in the region of temporary calcification, metaphyseal spurs, fractures), psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, hypopigmentation, prominent scalp veins in palpable periosteal depressions, pallor, resistant to sideroblastic anemia. Erythroid and myeloid cells with vacuoles in the bone marrow with iron accumulation in vacuoles and some mitochondria, hepatosplenomegaly, neutropenia (<1.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations below 6.28 mmol/ L and 0.13 g/L. Unintentional copper depletion by excessive zinc therapy or chelation therapy (eg, deferoxamine or EDTA) as a treatment for heavy metal poisoning, vascular disease, or intermittent claudication is of obvious importance. Intentional copper chelation with penicillamine-containing drugs for the treatment of abnormalities such as Wilson's disease, Parkinson's disease, and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can also deplete copper stores. The signs of copper deficiency associated with perinatal stress are sometimes mistaken for unexplained fractures in non-accidental infant injuries, which sometimes manifest in battered child syndrome. Boron is beneficial for mineral, vitamin D, insulin and energy substrate metabolism and immune function in animals and humans. Boron in the diet, in particular, has beneficial physiological effects for bone growth and maintenance. Further characterization of the metabolic roles of these and other trace elements involved in bone metabolism seems to be an extremely prudent endeavor because of the possible relevance of many refractory bone diseases to trace and ultra trace elements nutrition.",,"Hunt, C.

2471,Targeting tetrathiomolybdate on copper deposited in the liver of LEC rats,"The uptake of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) by the liver and the removal of liver-accumulated copper (Cu) in a metallothionein (MT)-dependent form by TTM were studied in Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model of Wilson. in order to develop better treatments for disease and Cu toxicity. Although molybdenum (Mo) was dose-dependently incorporated into the livers of both LEC and Long-Evans agouti (LEA) rats, the original strain of LEC rats used as the reference animal had a 13-fold higher uptake into the liver of LEC rats than in LEA rats. The Mo concentration in the soluble fraction was flattened and more dispersed in the insoluble fraction with a higher dose in LEC rats. Cu concentration in all livers of LEC rats was reduced by TTM in a dose-dependent manner only at lower doses. However, the Cu concentration in the soluble fraction continued to decrease with the TTM dose. The results can be explained in terms of complex formation. That is, TTM forms a complex with Cu, transiently refers to a Cu/TTM complex, which can be flushed out into the bloodstream and then selectively binds to albumin when the TTM dose is low. On the other hand, TTM forms an insoluble complex called Cu/TTM polymer which precipitates in the liver when the dose is high. The results also show that TTM uptake by a cell is immobilized in celtic through the dose-dependent formation of a complex containing Cu, Mo and sulfur (S), resulting in greater TTM uptake. TTM injected into rats or incubated with serum in vitro does not remove Cu from ceruloplasm. Therefore, it is recommended that TTM target a cell that accumulates excess Cu as Cu-MT and selectively remove Cu without interacting with Cu in Cu-enzymes. The results show that TTM is taken up by the liver depending on the amount of Cu accumulated in the form of MT, and then Cu flows into the blood circulation in the form of Cu/TTM complex with Mo.",,"Ogra, Y.;Suzuki, K.

2472,Zinc in human health: an update,"In this review, topics such as zinc and growth, zinc and serum testosterone levels, the coexistence of zinc and iron deficiencies, zinc and Alzheimer's disease, zinc as a therapeutic agent and the role of zinc in immunity are discussed. A meta-analysis of nine trials of zinc supplementation in Latin America and the Caribbean, eight from North America or Europe, five from Asia and the Middle East, and three from Africa revealed a highly significant effect of zinc supplementation on height and weight. Children under 13 years old. The growth stimulatory effect of zinc appears to be mediated by changes in circulating IGF-1. A recent study from China showed that zinc supplementation improved neuropsychological functions in children aged 6 to 9 years. A study conducted in Birmingham, Alabama showed that women who took zinc supplements gave birth to babies with heavier and larger head circumferences than babies of women who did not take zinc. Serum testosterone correlates with cellular zinc concentration in healthy adults aged 20 to 80 years. Therapeutic uses of zinc include the treatment of infantile diarrhea and chronic diarrhea, the treatment of the common cold, and the treatment of Wilson's disease in developing countries. Recent studies have shown that zinc deficiency in humans leads to an imbalance between TH1 and TH2 cell functions, which is responsible for decreased cell-mediated immunity. Zinc is a T-cell-specific growth factor, and decreased gene expression of the DNA-synthesizing enzyme thymidine kinase in zinc-deficient HUT-78 - a malignant lymphoblastoid human T cell line - adversely affected DNA synthesis in S phase and delayed the cell cycle.",,"Prasad, A.

However, the long-term effects have not been fully evaluated, and some evidence questions the long-term safety of the drug. The aim of this study was to investigate the systemic distribution and retention of Cu and Mo in sheep of different breeds and Cu status treated with TTM. Low-Cu Cambridge sheep were divided into a TTM trial group (3.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, three days a month for 5 months) and a control group and were killed at the end of the course or 7 months later. High Cu sheep consisting of a Cu-supplemented (150 mg/kg) Cambridge group and a North Ronaldsay group underwent TTM as before and compared to untreated controls. Brain, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pituitary, adrenals, testicles and ovaries were involved for metal analysis. Mo accumulated in all organs including brain and pituitary in all TTM trial groups (P < 0.02) and was maintained after discontinuation of treatment except liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. Cu increased (P < 0.02) and high Cu was retained in the cerebellum and medulla oblongata in the Cambridge groups treated with TTM. Brain Cu v. Mo concentrations showed a strong positive correlation (r 0.7) in the high Cu Ronaldsay group 7 months after TTM treatment.

She was diagnosed with Wilson's disease 27 years ago and was treated with penicillamine (1.5 g daily). Systemic abnormality of elastic fibers was confirmed by light and electron microscopy following biopsy of skin, lung, esophageal muscle, gingiva, pharyngeal tissue, and cervical connective tissue. Dysphagia resolved with cricopharyngeal myotomy. Substitution of trientene dihydrochloride instead of penicillamine relieved cutaneous and systemic manifestations. This is probably the first case to demonstrate an association between long-term use of penicillamine and biopsy-proven systemic pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum.

2485,Metallothionein and apoptosis in the toxic milk mutant mouse,"Toxic milk mutant (tx) mice accumulate excess copper (Cu) in the liver with age and develop symptoms similar to those seen in human Wilson's disease. Since metallothionein (MT) is the major Cu-binding protein in tx mouse liver and Cu-MT can increase lipid peroxidation, the potential genotoxicity of Cu-MT in tx mice when initiated by an organic hydroperoxide was evaluated in male tx mice (11 to 12 months old) and age and age. in sex-matched control wild-type (DL) mice. Toxic milk mutant mice, but not control DL mice, developed regenerative liver nodules (tx-N) with normal histological appearance. Now, non-nodular tx mouse liver (tx-R) was microscopically abnormal with large, atypical hepatocytes. Cu, zinc (Zn) and MT levels and apoptotic cell (APC) numbers in tx-N, tx-R and DL livers were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, <sup>109</sup>cadmium. -heme test and TUNEL method respectively. Compared with DL mouse livers, significantly higher levels of MT, Cu, and Zn, as well as an increased number of APCs, were found in both tx-N and tx-R. Intense nuclear and cytoplasmic immunohistochemical staining for MT was observed in both normal and atypical hepatocytes of tx mouse, whereas only cytoplasmic staining for MT was detected in DL mouse liver tissue. Accumulated Cu could be detected in tx-R and tx-N liver by rhodamine staining, but not in other tx mouse organs or mouse liver or other organs of DL. APC count and MT level were significantly higher in tx-R liver compared with both tx-N and DL liver.

Hepatic copper content of LEC rats increased in an age-dependent manner from 4-5 days of age and was maintained at a high level from 15-16 weeks of age. Renal copper content of LEC rats showed an increasing trend from 10 weeks of age and increased rapidly from 15 weeks of age. No differences in whole brain copper concentration were observed between LEC and Long-Evans agouti (LEA) rats. LEC rats treated with D-penicillamine and trientine-2HCl had reduced liver dysfunction. These agents reduced hepatic copper content by ~1/2-2/3 and renal copper content within the normal range.

2487,Oxidative stress in LEC rats assessed by plasma antioxidants and free fatty acids,"The Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rat, an animal model of Wilson's disease, develops hepatitis and liver cancer. Selected plasma markers of oxidative stress were measured in LEC rats and control Long-Evans agouti (LEA) rats, as LEC rats accumulate copper specifically in the liver and copper is a good oxidation catalyst. A significant decrease in plasma ascorbate level was observed even at the onset of hepatitis, suggesting that LEC rats are under oxidative stress because ascorbate is very sensitive to oxidation. The ratio of plasma ubiquinol-9, another oxidatively sensitive antioxidant, to ubiquinone-9 in LEC rats was also significantly reduced after the onset of hepatitis. Oxidative damage in the liver of LEC rats after hepatitis onset was also suggested by a decrease in the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to free fatty acids (FFA) and an increase in the palmitoleic acid/FFA ratio in LEC plasmas. Rats compared to LEA rats as PUFA is sensitive to oxidation and DELTA<sup>9</sup> desaturase is activated to compensate for PUFA loss. All of the above changes and hepatitis were prevented by adding a copper chelating agent, trientine dihydrochloride, to the drinking water of LEC rats. These data suggest that oxygen radicals may play an important role in the development of hepatitis and subsequent liver cancer.",,"Yamamoto, Y.;Sone, H.;Yamashita, S.;Nagata, Y.;Niikawa, H.;Hara, K.;Nagao, M.",1997,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291520-670X%281997%2910:2%3C129::AID-JTRA10%3E3.0.CO;2-T,0,0,

2490,Wilson's disease. Different starting formats. [Spanish],"Wilson's disease is characterized by a disorder of copper metabolism and the mechanism responsible for the fundamental defect that is still unknown. It is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance according to the 13th chromosome. Symptoms depend on the age of the patient. It ranges from asyntomatic forms with minimal laboratory evidence to acute liver failure and death in children aged 4 to 10 years. The course of Wilson's disease is variable but normally becomes chronic, sometimes associated with neurological, renal, hematological and ocular abnormalities. Diagnosis is based on serum and urine copper levels, serum cerulopasmin concentration, and histological study of tissues (liver, kidneys, CNS, etc.) in which the metal has accumulated. Copper chelating agents (penicillamine, trientene, zinc sulfate) can be applied as a bridge to liver transplantation, which is the definitive treatment of this metabolic disorder. We present a retrospective study focusing on presentation, biochemical abnormalities, diagnostic methods, clinical course and treatment of 7 Wilson's disease cases diagnosed in our center.",,"Sanchez, C.

2491,Ultrastructural changes in the intestines of rats fed high zinc diets,"Giving humans high-zinc diets is often used as a treatment for patients with Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation. This treatment does not seem to have any negative effects from the outside; however, preliminary studies in our laboratory showed obvious weaknesses in the intestinal walls of rats fed high zinc diets. In conclusion, this study was conducted to determine whether the administration of a high-zinc diet to rats would affect the ultrastructural morphology of the small intestine. The effects of the treatment on the copper status of the rats were also determined. Weaned male rats were fed diets containing 35 or 350 mg zinc/kg. After 7 weeks, blood and various tissues were collected to measure copper status indicators, and sections of the upper duodenum were excised and prepared for light and electron microscopy. The results showed that rats fed high zinc diets had significantly lower copper status than rats fed normal zinc diets, as demonstrated by low serum copper, serum ceruloplasmin activity, and liver copper. Liver superoxide dismutase or cytochrome c oxidase activities were not affected by high zinc. Observations of sections of the duodenum by electron microscopy showed that in rats fed a high-zinc diet, non-aggregated collagen molecules of the lamina propria more often disorganized and formed mixed masses in rats fed a normal zinc diet. This suggests that the low copper status caused by high zinc feeding may affect the activity of lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme, and thus the cross-linking of collagen molecules. However, these observations were not always associated with low copper status. Other possible explanations include a direct competition between zinc and copper for sites on the lysyl oxidase, blocking of aldehyde residues on the collagen molecule with zinc, or some unrecognized processes involving other enzymes or other aspects of collagen assembly. Whether such processes or affinities actually exist is still under investigation.",,"Reeves, P. G.;Newman Jr, S.

Additionally, lactating tx females produce copper-deficient milk. To further characterize the biochemical basis of this defect, Western blots of tissue extracts from normal and tx mice were performed using various heavy metal radioisotopes (<sup>63</sup>Ni, <sup>65</sup>Zn and <sup>65< /sup>Zn and <sup>63</sup>Zn and sup>64</sup>Cu). A 30 kDa Ni/Zn-binding polypeptide was found to be significantly reduced in the livers of tx mice. This protein was isolated from normal adult mice using a Ni-chelation chromatography-based procedure. The amino acid sequences of the two CNBr peptides were identical to portions of the mouse skeletal muscle carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) sequence. The other two peptides sequenced had sequences closely related to CAIII, but two differences at 45 amino acids. These two peptides can be derived from a new isoform of CAIII, which we have named CAIIIB to distinguish it from the published form, CAIIIA. We isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to CAIIIA and used it to show that CAIIIA mRNA was also decreased in mutant liver, but not in muscle. Copper loading of normal mice also decreased hepatic CAIIIA mRNA, suggesting that the decrease in CAIII mRNA in tx mouse liver is a secondary consequence of elevated copper levels in the liver.",,"Grimes, A.;Paynter, J.;Walker, I.

2502,Pathology of mineral metabolism. [Spanish],"Among the minerals (macro minerals) whose existence is quantitatively important for the organism, some of them - sodium, chlorine, potassium - are metabolically dependent on water, the most abundant element in the human body. Related metabolic disorders are mostly due to water imbalance and are therefore studied in the context of water metabolism disorders. Other elements, such as calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, contribute to bone metabolism under the influence of calcitrophic hormones: parathormone, calcitonin and 1.25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. Beyond the neonatal stage, the differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia is based on the level of phosphate, parathormone, and vitamin D derivatives to identify different types of rickets or parathyroid dysfunction. Similarly, the causal detection of hypercalcemia also depends on parathyroid function. Microminerals, which are called by this name due to their trace amounts in the organism, play an irreplaceable role in various enzyme functions. Some (iron, iodine) are closely linked to specific organic functions (synthesis of hemoglobin and myoglobin and thyroxine, respectively).

The renal excretion mechanism of trientine has been investigated in-vivo and in-vitro. Trientine clearance in the rat was significantly faster than creatinine clearance. However, when trientine and the same number of copper ions were administered simultaneously to the rat, the trientine clearance decreased to almost the same level as the creatinine clearance. To clarify this active excretory system for trientine, uptake of trientine and its sperm, a physiological polyamine compound, was investigated using rat renal brush bordered membrane vesicles. Although trientine and sperm are organic cations, the H<sup>+</sup>/organic cation carrier is expected to recognize these compounds, neither an outward H<sup>+</sup> gradient nor an inward Na<sup> sup>+</sup> gradient induced trientine uptake. [<sup>14</sup>C] However, uptake of sperm was trans-stimulated by both unlabeled sperm and trientine, and the trans-stimulatory effect of sperm on trientine uptake was also completely abrogated by the addition of copper ions. incubation environment. These results indicate that there is a specific transport system for sperm and trientine in the renal brush border membrane.

2511,Menkes disease: Recent developments and new directions,"Copper is the third most abundant trace element in the body, after iron and zinc, and is essential for the normal function of several important copper enzymes. However, too much of the same element is highly toxic and has harmful effects. Therefore, good regulation of intracellular copper homeostasis is vitally important, and disruption of this balance is reflected in two inherited disorders, Menkes disease and Wilson's disease. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in this area following the isolation of the defective gene in Menkes disease (MD), which will be the main focus of this review. Progressive neurodegeneration and connective tissue disorders are the main manifestations of X-linked recessive Menkes disease, and many of the clinical features can be explained by malfunctioning of one or more copper enzymes. The disease locus was mapped to Xq13.3 and the gene (MNK) defective in Menkes disease was isolated by positional cloning. The protein product is predicted to be the copper-binding P-type ATPase (ATP7A), the first intracellular copper transporter described in eukaryotes. The identification of MNK led to a number of advances in a very short time. The mouse homologue of MNK was isolated and the allelic association between MD and occipital horn syndrome was confirmed. Most importantly, the defective gene in Wilson's disease was isolated using MNK-specific sequences and the predicted protein product showed high homology to ATP7A. In this review, we will summarize these recent developments and their consequences, with special reference to Menkes disease. Wilson's disease will be briefly described and defective copper metabolism in both diseases will be summarized in the light of new insights.

2513,"(D)-Penicillamine increases hepatic oxalate production, which causes hyperoxaluria","Objective: To determine whether (D)-penicillamine is effective in reducing hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. Material and Methods: (D)-penicillamine was administered orally to rats to determine its effect on urinary oxalate excretion and was used in isolated rat hepatocytes to investigate the effect of (D)-penicillamine on oxalate production from glycolate. Studies involving hepatic aminotransferases and hepatocytes isolated from (D)-penicillamine-treated rats were used to clarify the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo results. Results: In hepatocytes (D)-penicillamine leads to a significant reduction in oxalate production from glycolate. However, in vivo, (D)-penicillamine led to a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion and a decrease in plasma aminotransferase activity. Hepatic aminotransferases are involved in the removal of oxalate precursors from oxalate production. In vitro, (D)-penicillamine has been shown to inhibit hepatic aminotransferases. Hepatocytes isolated from rats treated with (D)-penicillamine produced significantly more oxalate than controls. Conclusion: These results show that (D)-penicillamine increases hepatic oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion. (D)-penicillamine therefore does not have the therapeutic potential to reduce endogenous oxalate production and urinary oxalate excretion.

In contrast, fatal copper deposits in children with ICT were primarily attributed to increased dietary copper intake. However, 64 124 child years of exposure of children younger than 6 years to drinking water containing 125.9 mumol/L (8 mg/L) copper concentration did not cause death from any liver disease. In addition, ICT of seven infants was primarily attributed to drinking water containing < 110.2 mumol Cu/L (7 mg/L), despite evidence of a genetic defect in three of the seven infants, one of whom was exclusively breastfed.

2519,Metal-induced hepatotoxicity,"Figure 3 summarizes several proposed mechanisms of iron- or copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Due to the potent pro-oxidant effect of iron and copper salts in vitro, it has long been suspected that free radicals may play a role in iron- and copper-induced cell toxicity. In the presence of cellular reductants present, iron or copper in low molecular weight forms can play a catalytic role in initiating free radical reactions. The resulting oxyradicals have the potential to damage cellular lipids, nucleic acids, proteins and carbohydrates, resulting in far-reaching impairment in cellular function and integrity. However, cells have cytoprotective mechanisms (antioxidants, scavenging enzymes, repair processes) that counter the effects of free radical generation. Therefore, the net effect of metal-derived free radicals on cellular function will depend on the balance between radical generation and cell-protective systems. As a result, there may be a rate of free radical production that must be overcome before cellular damage can occur. Evidence has now accumulated that iron or copper overload in experimental animals can cause oxidative damage to lipids in vivo when metal concentration exceeds a threshold level. In the liver, this lipid peroxidation is associated with disruption of the membrane-bound functions of mitochondria (oxidative metabolism) and lysosomes (membrane integrity, fluidity, pH). Although these findings do not prove causation, it seems likely that lipid peroxidation is involved, as similar functional defects are produced in these organelles by metal-induced lipid peroxidation in vitro. Both iron and copper overload impair hepatic mitochondrial respiration, primarily through a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity. In iron overload, hepatocellular calcium homeostasis may be impaired by damage to mitochondrial and microsomal calcium sequestration. DNA has also been reported to be the target of metal-induced damage in the liver; this may have consequences for malignant transformation. In rats with iron or copper overload, the levels of some antioxidants in the liver are reduced, suggesting ongoing oxidative stress. Decreased cellular ATP levels, lysosomal fragility, impaired cellular calcium homeostasis and DNA damage can contribute to hepatocellular damage in iron and copper overload. There is little data to address the fundamental question of whether tree radical production is increased in patients with iron or copper overload. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have elevated plasma levels of TBA-reactants, indicative of lipid peroxidation, and increased hepatic levels of MDA-protein and HNE-protein adducts. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of patients with Wilson's disease have evidence of lipid peroxidation, and some patients with Wilson's disease have decreased hepatic and plasma levels of vitamin E. Additional research will be required to fully assess oxidant stress and its potential pathophysiological role in iron patients. or copper overload.",,"Britton, R. S.",1996,,,0,0,

2521,Inhibition of hereditary hepatitis and liver tumor development by the copper chelating agent trientine dihydrochloride in Long-Evans cinnamon rats.,"Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is an alternative medicinal copper chelating agent for penicillamine intolerant patients with Wilson's disease. We examined the effects of trientine on the spontaneous development of hepatitis and liver tumors by short-term and long-term administration to Long. Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats with hepatic copper deposition as animal models of Wilson's disease. Male rats were given trientine at 1500 ppm for 18 weeks from 6 weeks to 24 weeks and 1500 ppm for 27 weeks from 8 to 87 weeks and 750 ppm trientine for 52 weeks in the short-term experiment. in long term experiment. The development of hepatitis was observed in control LEC rats at 18 weeks of age. There were elevated levels of plasma transaminases (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [GOT], glutamic pyruvic transaminase [GPT]) and hepatocyte destruction was observed on pathological examination. Histological findings revealed that short-term administration of trientine significantly prevented the development of hepatitis. Plasma GOT and GPT levels of treated animals were only slightly higher than those of normal LEA (Long-Evans with agouti coat color) rats, the sister line of LEC rats. Copper levels in the liver are reduced by a maximum of 50%. In long-term administration of trientine, the incidence of liver cell carcinoma (HCC) in treated rats was 67% of the incidence in untreated LEC rats and the HCC count per rat in the treated group was 0.7 +/- 0.5 compared to 4.7 +/- 3.5 in untreated rats. is significantly lower. In addition, the development of cholangiofibrosis in LEC rats was completely prevented by prolonged administration of the agent. The copper level in the liver of the treated rats was reduced by 33% at 87 weeks of age. HCC development in LEC rats may be partially, but not completely absent, due to copper deposition. No effects were detected on copper, iron, or zinc levels in the liver of LEA rats, and no adverse effects were detected in LEC or LEA rats after both short- and long-term administration of trientine in drinking water.",,"Sone, H.;Maeda, M.;Wakabayashi, K.;Takeichi, N.;Mori, M.;Sugimura, T.;Nagao, M.",1996,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/jhep.1996.v23.pm0008666330,0,0,
2522,Cranial MRI in Wilson's disease,"AIM. The aim of the study was to describe the range of abnormalities seen on cranial MR images of patients with Wilson's disease and correlate findings with clinical severity, disease duration, and duration of neurological signs and symptoms before treatment. In patients with serial studies, changes in MR images were compared with clinical response. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twenty-five patients with Wilson's disease underwent MR imaging of the brain using conventional spin-echo arrays (n = 25), phase maps (n = 8), and partially refocused interleaved multi-echo arrays (n = 5). RESULTS. MRI findings were abnormal in 22 patients and normal in three patients. Basal ganglia were interpreted as abnormal in 19 of 22 (86%), 19 (86%) putamen, 12 (54%) thalamus, 10 (45%) caudate head and globus pallidus. in nine (41%). We found a preference for the involvement of the outer edge of the putamen and the ventral nuclear mass of the thalamus. Clostrum was abnormal in three patients. In 17 of these 22 patients (77%), the midbrain was abnormal and predominantly affecting the tegmentum, but also the substantia nigra, red nuclei, lower tectum, and crua. Of 22 patients, 18 (82%) pons, 11 (50%) cerebellum were abnormal and superior middle cerebellar peduncle was involved. Eighteen of 22 (82%) patients had atrophy, and 13 (59%) of 22 patients had significant cortical white matter changes. Screening of an untreated patient revealed a shortened T1 relaxation time in the thalamus, consistent with the paramagnetic effects of copper. Phase maps and partially refocused interspersed multi-echo arrays in eight and five patients, respectively, used to reveal an iron- or copper-induced susceptibility change, showed normal findings. We found a significant inverse relationship between the severity but extent of change in signal intensity and between length of untreated disease (p = .030) and total disease duration (p = .015). The study group was too small to show a correlation with clinical findings. The changes seen in the MR images matched the clinical response to treatment in only two of the seven patients who underwent follow-up studies. SOLUTION. MR imaging revealed abnormalities in the basal ganglia, cerebral white matter, midbrain, pons, and cerebellum. The paramagnetic effects of copper were detected only in untreated patients. Patients with longer disease duration had less severe changes in signal intensity. The value of MR imaging at follow-up was limited.",,"King, A. D.;Walshe, J. M.;Kendall, B. E.;Chinn, R. J.

2529,Mechanisms of selective copper removal from metallothionein by tetrathiomolybdate in LEC rats,"Copper (Cu) was selectively removed from metallothionein (MT) in the liver of LEC rats (Long-Evans rats with cinnamon-like coat color) by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) in vivo and in vitro. Female LEC rats were injected intraperitoneally with TTM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days. More than 2/3 of the Cu accumulated in the liver was removed by TTM treatment 24 hours after the last injection. Although most Cu was bound to MT in the soluble fraction prior to TTM treatment, Cu remaining in the liver was almost exclusively present in the insoluble fraction along with molybdenum (Mo). Cu,Zn,Cd-MT was separated from the liver of LEC rats injected with cadmium (Cd) and reacted with TTM at ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 to Cu and bound to MT for 10. at least 37 degrees C. Adding TTM at a mole ratio of less than 1.0 detected a Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex, adding TTM at a mole ratio greater than 1.0 selectively removed Cu from MT and produced a Cu/TTM. Complex through the release of Zn,Cd-MT from the Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex. It was observed that excessive TTM facilitated the polymerization of the Cu/TTM complex into insoluble polymers. The dose-dependent formation of different MT/TTM complexes explains the findings observed in vivo.",,"Ogra, Y.;Ohmichi, M.;Suzuki, K.

2530,Essential trace element and skin diseases. [Japanese],"Here, we have described various skin diseases caused by essential trace element accumulation, deficiency, allergy, etc. The pigmentation of hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis is recognized by the deposition of hemosiderin in the dermis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is caused by Zn deficiency and is classified as the hereditary type or the acquired type. The former is autosomal recessive and the latter is caused by low Zn uptake. Wilson's disease and Menkes' kinky hair syndrome caused by abnormal Cu metabolism cause hyperpigmentation and morphological changes in the hair, respectively. It seems that kinky hair growth is caused by the low activity of sulfhydryl oxidase, a Cu enzyme. Bowen's disease, which is carcinoma in situ, is caused by As toxicosis.

2534,Excess zinc associated with severe progressive cholestasis in Cree and Ojibwa-Cree children,"Background. High hepatic copper concentrations have been reported in various liver disorders. We report six Canadian children with severe chronic cholestatic liver disease with excess liver copper and zinc. Methods Children aged 22 months to 8 years came from Ontario, northern Canada. All were referred for possible liver transplantation due to end-stage liver disease. We examined explanted liver samples (or, in one case, liver biopsy material) by scanning transmission electronmicroscopic (STEM) X-ray elemental microanalysis and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Samples from four controls (two without liver pathology, one with biliary atresia and one with Wilson's disease) were also analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results. Explanted livers showed similar hallmarks of advanced biliary cirrhosis, with dense deposits in the enlarged lysosomes and cytoplasm on electronmicroscopy. Hepatic copper concentrations were much higher in the five patients with measurements (47.6-56.9 µg/g dry weight) than in the two normal control liver tissue samples (2.3 and 2.9 µg/g). Similarly, hepatic zinc concentrations were many times higher in patients than in controls (104-128 versus 1.9-3.2 cups/g dry weight). Translation. Excess copper may be due to chronic cholestasis, but excess zinc is unexplained. As three of the patients were consanguineous (shared grandparents), a genetic disorder of metal metabolism is possible, but we cannot exclude environmental factors.",,"Phillips, M. J.;Ackerley, C.

Patients with Wilson's disease (WD). rCMRGlc was detected in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar hemispheres. The severity of neurological symptoms, defined by semi-quantitative motor impairment scores, correlated highly (r = -0.80) with decreased striatal rCMRGlc. Clinic. The scores, the degree of striatal rCMRGlc and MRI abnormalities showed no correlation with the different indices of dopamine D2 receptor binding. Consecutive PET measurements during treatment with chelating agents in three patients revealed a moderate increase in striatal rCMRGlc (in two patients) and a moderate to significant increase in striatal D2 receptor binding (in three patients) associated with clinical improvement. Our data show that rCMRGlc represents a sensitive and objective measure to assess and monitor striatal and extrastriatal involvement in WD. The lack of correlation between dopamine D2 receptor binding and striatal rCMRGlc and structural abnormalities may be explained by the wide range of clinical manifestations and differential responses to treatment in WD patients.",,"Schlaug, G.;Hefter, H.;Engelbrecht, V.;Kuwert, T.;Arnold, S.;Stocklin, G.;Seitz, R.

[Japanese]","The disposition behavior of trientine and its metabolites, a selective copper chelating drug for Wilson's disease, was studied in normal patients with Wilson's disease and in rats. High concentrations of metabolites were seen in blood samples from patients and rats at an early stage after administration of trientine. In addition, large amounts of the trientine metabolite were excreted in the urine of patients. These results show that trientine undergoes a remarkable first pass effect. The drug concentration area under the curve of unchanged form (AUC) and trientine metabolites in patients were not dependent on the administered dose. The absorption process appears to be an important factor for trientine's regulatory behavior, we also investigated the uptake properties of trientine by rat intestinal brush-edged membrane vesicles. Trientine uptake properties were similar to the physiological polyamines, spermine and spermidine. Trientine uptake rate was dose-dependently inhibited by spermine and spermidine. It also competitively inhibited the uptake of trientine by spermine with a Ki value of 18.6 µM. This value is very close to the Km value (30.4 muM) for sperm. These data suggested that the mechanism of uptake of trientine in rat small intestinal brush-bordered membrane vesicles is almost identical to that of sperm and spermidine, and physiological polyamines appear to have the ability to inhibit the absorption of trientine from the gastrointestinal tract.",,"Tanabe, R.",1996,Mar,,0,0,

Mice and rats received triene-2HCl at concentrations of 0, 120, 600, or 3000 ppm in drinking water for up to 92 days. Twenty mice and 18 rats of each sex were assigned to each dose group fed a grain-based (NIH-31) or purified (AIN-76A) diet, both containing nutritionally adequate levels of copper. An additional control group of rats and mice received a Cu-deficient AIN-76A diet. This low copper diet resulted in Cu deficiency symptoms with anemia, liver periportal cytomegaly, pancreatic atrophy and multifocal necrosis, spleen hematopoietic cell proliferation, and increased heart weight with undetectable plasma copper levels in mice but not mice. Trien-2HCl slightly reduced plasma copper levels (at 600 and 3000 ppm) in rats fed the AIN-76A diet, but did not induce the usual signs of copper deficiency.

The changes in molybdenum (Mo) and Cu concentrations and biological forms in serum of LEC rats determined at different times after a single intraperitoneal injection were compared with those of Wistar (normal) rats. The change in Mo concentration in serum of normal rats was monophasic, whereas it was bi-phasic in LEC rats. The phase in normal rats and the first phase in LEC rats appeared to reflect the process of uptake and loss of TTM in the livers of Wistar and LEC rats. On the other hand, the second phase in LEC rats paralleled the changes in Cu and seemed to reflect complex formation between Mo and Cu (Cu/thiomolybdate complex) accumulated in the liver. The complex specifically bound to albumin as determined by high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS).

Urinary and fecal excretion were also studied. Hepatic excretion of Mo was dramatically increased in LEC rats, suggesting that interaction of TTM with Cu resulted in increased Mo uptake. Mo and Cu concentrations decreased over time in the liver of LEC rats, while those in the spleen increased. Although the concentration of Mo uptake by the kidney decreased with time after the initial increase in both rats, the concentration of Cu increased with time. Cu was not redistributed to the brain. Compared to Wistar rats, urinary excretion of Mo was decreased and fecal excretion increased in LEC rats. These results show that TTM is taken up by the liver depending on the Cu content, and Cu and Mo removed from the liver are mostly excreted via feces.

It has also been reported in children with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. A case of IgA nephropathy associated with cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease has been reported. Case report: A 10-year-old girl was hospitalized for cirrhosis. He had ascites and hematuria since 6 years old and vascular purpura at 9 years old since 6 months old. At presentation, he had atrophic liver cirrhosis of his legs, ascites splenomegaly, and petechiae. There was microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. Coombs test was positive. There were hypoalbuminemia (2 g/dl) and polyclonal hyperglobulinemia (IgA 750 mg/dl, IgG 1670 mg/dl and IgM 250 mg/dl). Serum concentrations of complement factors were normal and no immune complex was detected in the serum. He also showed biological changes due to renal failure, hematuria and proteinuria. A liver biopsy showed micronodular cirrhosis with multiple plasma cells containing IgA. Etiology study showed ceruloplasmin levels of 5 mg/dl, elevated urinary copper excretion (> 150 cups/day) and above normal liver copper (255 cups/g dry weight); The Kayser-Fleischer ring was also seen. Kidney biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence microscopy showed C3 and IgA in the mesangial and subendothelial regions. The patient was given spironolactone and furosemide, followed by triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride. Conclusion: IgA nephropathy, vascular purpura and elevated serum IgA levels may be due to liver changes. If so, our patient should be cured by liver transplantation, although he is a better candidate for combined liver and kidney transplantation.",,"Sarles, J.;Durand, J.

2553,Copper-associated liver disease in childhood,"Background/Aim: Indian childhood cirrhosis is associated with progressive liver disease with high liver copper concentrations and high mortality. Early treatment with penicillamine was found to reduce mortality and reverse liver damage. We aimed to describe the clinical features of copper-associated liver disease outside of the Indian subcontinent and to promote earlier evaluation of the syndrome in cryptogenic liver disease. Methods: Three European children aged 10 to 29 months presented with abdominal distention, fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Their condition deteriorated rapidly due to liver failure for 1-5 weeks. Two died 2 months after the onset of the disease, and one received a successful liver transplant. Evaluation of the diagnosis in two cases occurred only by examination of the liver after orthotopic liver transplantation or death. Light microscopy was used with hematoxylin and eosin, reticulin and orsein dyes. Tissue, plasma and water copper levels were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: All had micronodular cirrhosis and severe hepatocellular necrosis with Mallory bodies and abundant orsein-positive material. Liver copper concentrations ranged from 1100-1310 cups/g dry weight. Domestic water with high copper content was used in the preparation of feeds for two patients. In the third case, no source of environmental excess copper could be detected. Conclusion: We suggest that the above condition, called Indian childhood cirrhosis in the Indian subcontinent and Copper Storage Disease elsewhere, should be more accurately named 'Childhood Copper-Associated Liver Disease', emphasizing that this disorder should be considered in unexplained liver disease. and investigating possible sources of excessive copper intake.",,"Baker, A.;Gormally, S.;Saxena, R.;Baldwin, D.;Drumm, B.;Bonham, J.;Portmann, B.;Mowat, A.

After the initial diagnosis of Wilson's disease, a low copper diet and systemic D-penicillamine were administered. During the 15-year follow-up period, the anterior lens capsule and/or the yellowish/brown granular opacification within the capsule largely disappeared and instead the same type of opacification appeared in the posterior lens capsule, mostly progressive changes compared to the initial findings. These changes that have developed in the lens over the last 15 years were difficult to detect with slit lamp examination alone, but were clearly revealed by Scheimpflug slit images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of ocular changes induced by the application of a newly developed anterior eye segment examination.

The haplotype data and nature of the mutation support the existence of a founder chromosome carrying the mutation. This Icelandic mutation was not found in patients of Irish or Scottish descent who may share some of the genes of their Icelandic ancestry. Although it was predicted that protein function would be completely abolished with the deletion predicting early-onset liver disease, we found that patients presented with later-onset neurological and psychiatric symptoms.

2557,Wilson's disease. The panorama of diagnosis and treatment developed in the last forty years. [Japanese],"In 1912, Wilson and Fleischer independently reported autopsy patients with progressive neurological impairment associated with liver cirrhosis and suggested that the syndrome may be a specific disease of toxic origin. In 1952, Scheinberg demonstrated serum ceruloplasmin deficiency in Wilson's disease, and it was possible to diagnose the disease while the patient was still asymptomatic. In 1956, Walshe promoted penicillamine as the most excellent drug for the treatment of the disease. These groundbreaking discoveries encouraged Japanese doctors to diagnose early and try to prevent the disease. This course was to review the changing panorama of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease over the forty-year period, focusing on experiences in Japan. Early detection of patients based on hypoceruloplasminemia made it possible to investigate the age of onset of serum GOT or GPT elevation and the appearance of Kayser-Fleischer (CF) rings. So far, the youngest patients who exhibited a high level of GPT and CF rings were three and five years old, respectively. It has become popular that an unexpected elevation in serum transaminases in apparently healthy children aged three years and over prompted the investigation of the possibility of Wilson's disease, and an increasing number of non-familial patients were identified in late infancy. Now, mass screening for Wilson's disease continues. Over three decades of follow-up studies on prophylaxis have conclusively proven that the onset of clinical symptoms is prevented by continued penicillamine therapy. There were patients who, by the age of twenty to thirty, developed symptoms such as hemolytic crisis, motor impairment, and particularly psychotic or affective disorders after several years of discontinuation of therapy. The pressing question now is how to encourage all adult patients to continue lifelong therapy.",,"Arima, M.",1995,,,0,0,

2559,hepatitis in children. [French],"Hepatitis in children can be infectious, metabolic, toxic, or immune-mediated. The incidence of hepatitis A is steadily decreasing, thanks to the significant improvement of sanitary equipment. The anti-HAV vaccine has been made available recently and is effective in approximately 100% of cases. Hepatitis B is an important public health problem. One-quarter to one-third of chronic carriers acquired this infection during infancy or childhood and constitutes a large reservoir of the virus. Hepatitis B is associated with severe morbidity and mortality (fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma). Systematic vaccination is recommended. Pediatric chronic carriers may benefit from alpha-interferon therapy. Hepatitis B is usually limited to a few risk groups and tends to have a chronic course. Materno-fetal transmission has been described. Other known or unknown viruses can cause hepatitis, such as severe NANBNC sporadic hepatitis of childhood, which may be complicated by bone marrow aplasia. Among the metabolic causes, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson's disease are the most common, the latter requiring prompt diagnosis and specific treatment. Autoimmune hepatitis differs markedly in children compared to adults, and some can only be found in children, such as Coombs positive infantile autoimmune hepatitis.

2560,Liver disorders. Features and convenient management,"The spectrum of liver disease is extremely broad, with acute and chronic presentations of many of the underlying disorders. Many of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are responsible for autoimmune disease, viral infection, and toxic insult. The management strategy of any liver disease is a combination of treatment of emerging symptoms and complications, as well as drug therapies related to the specific underlying diagnosis. Encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, varicose bleeding and pruritus are the main complications to which drug therapy is directed, but in some cases represent only one aspect of overall treatment. With the possible exception of acetylcysteine, drug therapy per se is largely ineffective in acute liver failure, but many drugs are used in the management of the constituent components of this complex medical emergency. Treatments for specific liver conditions are expanding, particularly in areas of autoimmune and viral disease. The increasing availability and success of liver transplantation has tended to shift the emphasis of management, and exhausting treatment options before referral for transplantation is often inappropriate. A comprehensive review of all liver diseases is beyond the scope of this article, but we hope that important management principles and commonly occurring clinical decisions are discussed.",,"Aldersley, M.

[German],"Background: Early diagnosis is crucial to successfully treat mostly young patients with sudden onset acute liver failure as the first symptom of Wilson's disease. Recognition of the presence of Wilsonian fulminant hepatitis is important because timely liver transplantation improves survival. METHODS: Retrospective case analysis of the characteristic profile of standard laboratory parameters and the clinical course of acute Wilson's liver failure. RESULTS: In two female patients (aged 17 and 27 years) with non-autoimmune hemolysis serum AST and ALT levels, ALT activity was markedly decreased and only moderately elevated with relatively low serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels. One patient died from complications of multiple organ failure despite immediate administration of D-Penicillamine. CONCLUSION: The AP/bilirubin ratio is usually below 2 in fulminant Wilson liver failure. In addition, the calculation of free copper concentration in serum and renal excretion of ionic copper in combination with non-autoimmune hemolysis provide clues for the early diagnosis of Wilson's liver failure.",,"Herrmann, S.;Hofmann, W.;Theilmann, L.",1995,2022-08-15 00:00:00,,0,0,

2564,"Impaired copper metabolism in LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease: roles of metallothionein.","Impaired copper (Cu) metabolism in LEC rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease, was characterized by the expression of Cu in the liver, bloodstream, and kidneys during the accumulation process and at the onset of jaundice; Cu accumulates in the liver in a form dependent on metallothioneine (MT) with age. When Cu accumulates beyond the MT synthesis capacity, massive Cu is released from MT. Cu bound to MT is not supplied to ceruloplasmin (Cp) during the maturation process, while metal is transferred directly from MT to Cu, zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD). Cu ions not bound to MT are transferred to Cp and holo-Cp is excreted into the bloodstream near and onset of jaundice. Cu accumulated in the liver in a MT-dependent manner is selectively removed by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and the animal at the onset of jaundice recovers with chelation therapy. It has been suggested that the mechanisms of the removal reaction include the formation of MT/TTM, Cu/TTM and/or polymeric Cu/TTM complexes according to the stoichiometry of TTM to Cu. It is assumed that the Cu/TTM complex flows into the bloodstream and binds specifically to albumin. TTM is taken up by the liver according to its Cu content. The toxicity of Cu was explained by the active oxygen species produced in Cu-mediated reactions and the participation of MT.",,"Suzuki, K. T.",1995,,,0,0,

LEC rats were fed a semi-synthetic diet containing 10 ppm Cu for 40 days. Fischer rats were fed the same diet containing 10 or 500 ppm Cu for 40 days. Rats were injected subcutaneously at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals for the last 3 days. Hepatic Cu concentrations in Fischer and LEC rats not treated with TTM were 392 and 194 cups/g, respectively. However, hepatic MT concentration was approximately 10 times higher in LEC rats than in Fischer rats. In Fischer rats, biliary and serum excretion of Cu was increased by TTM, resulting in decreased hepatic Cu concentration (264 cups/g). In LEC rats, infiltration of Cu into serum, but not biliary excretion of Cu, was accelerated by TTM injection. The increased serum Cu concentration was 0.7 cups/ml in LEC rats compared to 14.4 cups/ml in Fischer rats. The hepatic Cu concentration in LEC rats treated with TTM was 170 µg/g. Serum ceruloplasmin activity (as oxidase) in LEC rats was not increased by TTM injection.

Ionic Cu (copper and copper ions) was incorporated more efficiently than metallothioneine-bound metal. Cu binds not only to the Cu binding site, but also to the Zn binding site. Although metal bound to the Zn binding site of Zn and SOD in the reaction medium had little effect on the reactivity in binding ionic Cu, they impaired the reactivity of metallothioneine bound Cu to the Cu binding site. Both ionic and metallothionein-bound Zn were transferred to the Zn-binding site, but not to the Cu-binding site, with comparable efficiency. Ionic Cu, which was not bound to metallothionein but co-existed in the medium, inhibited the binding of Zn to SOD.

2579,Copper metabolism leading to and following acute hepatitis in LEC rats,"The process of copper (Cu) accumulation in the liver and subsequent Cu metabolic derangement was studied in LEC rats, a mutant strain that accumulates Cu with age and shows spontaneous acute hepatitis and/or hepatoma. The Cu concentration in the liver of female rats was ~220 mug/g liver at 2 weeks of age, decreased to 100 cups/g liver at 4-6 weeks and then started to increase linearly with age, reaching the highest concentration of 250 cups/g. g liver at 16 weeks. Although the level of Cu expressed by concentration (cups/g liver) decreased during weaning, it increased linearly with age when expressed by content (mg/liver), indicating a constant and preferential accumulation of Cu in the liver. Cu concentration stopped increasing in the liver at 16 weeks, followed by a sudden drop to 1/2 of the highest level. When Cu reached the highest concentration, biomarkers for liver injury (serum lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activities) began to increase with the appearance of jaundice symptoms. The distributions of Cu and zinc (Zn) in the supernatant fraction of the liver showed that both metals were distributed mostly to metallothioneine (MT) and to a small extent to superoxide dismutase throughout the experiments. Serum Cu concentration began to increase in a form of ceruloplasmin with serum marker enzyme activities for liver injury. The Cu concentration in the kidneys also started to rise after the increase in serum Cu. The results show that Cu accumulates in the liver of LEC rats in the form of MT up to a maximum liver level of ~250 mug/g and then abruptly decreases with the onset of acute hepatitis. The maximum level appears to be related to the MT synthesis capacity and acute hepatitis is presumed to occur when Cu accumulates beyond the capacity. When the metal accumulates above the MT synthesis capacity in the liver, and is partially reabsorbed by the kidneys and the remainder is excreted in the urine, serum Cu begins to rise from an abnormally low level. Changes in iron and zinc levels were identified and discussed in relation to those of Cu.",,"Suzuki, K. T.;Kanno, S.;Misawa, S.;Aoki, Y.",1995,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0300-483X%2894%2902927-M,0,0,

2584,"Copper: Not too little, not too much, but true","Copper is an essential trace element with a well-established mechanism for maintaining the balance of the metal in the body controlled by at least two genes. Disruption of a gene on the X chromosome determines a defect in the copper absorption process, resulting in an existing copper deficiency at the cellular level. This causes abnormalities in collagen formation and brain maturation, leading to premature death. There is no effective treatment yet. Disruption of the other copper-controlling gene located on chromosome 13 is associated with the accumulation of excess copper in the body, leading first to cirrhosis of the liver and later to destruction of the motor control center in the brain and, often, personality changes. Copper excess can also cause kidney damage, osteoarticular changes, and joint pain. If the kidney lesion leads to urinary calcium loss and other tubular defects, there may be osteoporosis or osteomalacia, sometimes with pathological fractures. In this disease, abnormal copper stores can be mobilized with chelating agents or depleted by application of zinc salts or thiomolybdate. This often, but not always, leads to improvement or even complete reversal of symptoms. Brain lesions may also resolve, as demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear, but suggests that the longstanding doctrine of no recovery in the central nervous system may need revision.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1995,,,0,0,

We reported 16 patients (6 men) with the disease; 6 had hepatic involvement only, 4 had neurological involvement, 3 had neurological and hepatic involvement, and 3 were asymptomatic. Age of onset was 9 years for liver and 17 years for neurological involvement. The mean delay in diagnosis was 14 months. Chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fulminant liver failure were clinical forms of liver disease. Patients with neurological disorders had behavioral disorders and extrapyramidal manifestations such as dystonia and parkinsonism. Patients responded well to penicillamine, except for 3 patients who died of liver complications for whom treatment was delayed or discontinued. We conclude that this metabolic disease should be suspected in pubertal children and adults younger than 30 years of age, with liver disease of unknown origin or behavioral changes associated with the extrapyramidal syndrome.",,"Miranda, M.;Brinck, P.;Roessler, J.

[German],"To demonstrate that Wilson's disease is one of the possible causes of multiple low-density nodules in the liver, we obtained MR images in 16 patients with clinically and histopathologically confirmed Wilson's disease. MRI corresponding to the morphological changes allowed patients to be divided into two groups. Using a T<inf>2</inf>-weighted spin-echo sequence (TR/TE = 2000/45-90), the liver parenchyma showed multiple small, low-density nodules surrounded by high-density septa in 10 of 16 patients . . 5 patients also had low-density nodules on T<inf>1</inf> weighted images (TR/TE = 600/20). In this group, liver cirrhosis (n=7) and fibrosis (n=2) were detected histopathologically. The common features of this patient group were significant inflammatory cell infiltration into the fibrous septa, increased copper concentration in the liver parenchyma, and significant pathological changes in laboratory data. In the remaining 6 patients, no pathological changes in liver morphology were demonstrated by MRI, which corresponds to mild histopathological changes in the parenchyma and normal laboratory data. MRI may help identify Wilson's patients with a worse prognosis, as low-density nodules surrounded by high-density septa can be demonstrated in patients with significant inflammatory infiltration of the liver parenchyma. Laboratory data and histopathology should be checked when searching for copper metabolism disorders in patients with low-density nodules in the liver and the cause of liver cirrhosis is unknown.",,"Vogl, T.

Hepatic Cu (100 cups/g) and metallothionein (MT)-bound Cu (2,600 to 540 cups/g protein) concentrations were greatly reduced by injection. On the other hand, kidney Cu concentration increased significantly, but brain Cu concentration increased slightly. Decreased hepatic Cu concentration was accompanied by decreased Zn and Fe concentrations in liver, kidney, and brain. TTM compound stimulated excretion of Cu in bile slightly (about 3 times), but greatly (about 40 times) into the blood. In rats not treated with TTM, most biliary (100%) and serum (78%) Cu was recovered in the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) soluble fraction. On the other hand, bile and serum Cu in TTM-treated rats were overwhelmingly recovered in the insoluble fraction of TCA, possibly in the form of a Cu-TTM-albumin complex. Our results show that although there is a natural failure in the internal secretion process of Cu from the liver in LEC rats, the TTM compound is able to remove Cu from Cu-MT, resulting in a reduction in hepatic Cu.",,"Sugawara, N.;Li, D.;Sugawara, C.",1994,,,0,0,

2591,Pregnancy and movement disorders,"The coexistence of pregnancy and movement disorders is a rare event in general neurological practice.

The most pressing questions asked by patients are the safety of drugs, an issue for which there is insufficient data, and the ability to care for a child for at least the next ten years, an issue that varies according to the disease and social situation. The author's formulation of efficacy and toxicity suggests that some drugs commonly used in movement disorders should be discontinued before pregnancy, if possible. These drugs include neuroleptics, amantadine, diazepam, primidone, selegiline, and reserpine. Pregnancy may reveal a pre-existing potential for chorea (ie, chorea gravidarum) and often has a mild aggravating effect on PH symptoms; however, it has little effect on other movement disorders. Severe generalized dystonia will likely prevent vaginal delivery, but the lack of available data indicates that the impact of movement disorders on pregnancy, childbirth and neonatal health is minimal.",,"Golbe, L.

While 45% of patients had prolonged central motor conduction times (CCTs) to FDIs, only 12% of patients presented with prolonged CCTs to TA muscles. No consistent and significant correlation was found between copper metabolism and the pyramidal pathway function tested with magnetic brain stimulation. An improvement in CCTs and response amplitudes with copper elimination therapy was observed only in the early stages of treatment. There was no correlation with duration of treatment or neurological symptoms. Magnetic brain stimulation thus turned out to be sensitive to detect subclinical pyramidal pathway impairment in WD, but appears to test a very specific aspect of motor impairment in WD to reflect the patients' overall neurological status. Therefore, it should be combined with other tests to be used in treatment control.",,"Hefter, H.;Roick, H.;Van Giessen, H. J.;Arendt, G.;Weiss, P.;Stremmel, W.;Benecke, R.",1994,,,0,0,

2599,Liver disease and psychiatric illness: Relationships and treatment,"An association between liver diseases and psychiatric symptoms has long been predicted. While liver detoxification renders exogenous substances harmless to the body, there are also cases where the liver converts a harmless substance into a more toxic one. With such an important role, the liver protects all organs of the body. When the liver malfunctions, toxic metabolites can be produced that damage the brain. Since the brain receives a large amount of blood, a large amount of metabolites reaches this organ. Therefore, the metabolic function of the liver establishes a delicate interrelationship between the two organs. In addition, some psychiatric drugs also affect liver functions. Another confusing clinical issue is the difficulty in treating psychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disease. For example, benzodiazepines that do not affect liver function in physically healthy psychiatric patients may cause hepatic coma in patients with liver disease. Benzodiazepine antagonists provide dramatic and temporary improvement in hepatic coma patients. Clinically, many psychoactive drugs cause hepatic complications. The same drugs that cause hepatic side effects are required for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms in patients with hepatic impairment. A comprehensive knowledge of the side effects of these drugs is necessary to properly handle these conditions.",,"Ananth, J.;Swartz, R.;Burgoyne, K.;Gadasally, R.",1994,,,0,0,

2601,"Wilson's disease. Physiopathology, therapeutic approach and clinical contribution. [Italian]","Wilson's disease is an inherited recessive autosomal disease that affects about five in every million people. The primary defect is localized in the liver, and the disease is manifested by the accumulation of copper in the tissues. Ceruloplasmin reduction, which until a few years ago was mistakenly thought to be the pathogenic cause of Wilson's disease, is an epiphenomenon of the underlying metabolic disorder characterized by defective copper biliary excretion. There are four stages in the natural course of the disease: 1) the asymptomatic stage of hepatic copper deposition; 2) excretion and redistribution of copper leading to hepatocellular necrosis and hemolysis; 3) extrahepatic copper accumulation leading to the onset of cirrhosis and neurological damage; 4) homeostasis phase following treatment but with possible irreversible neurological damage. Treatment of Wilson's diseases takes the form of pharmacological, dietary and surgical treatment. Through the formation of copper and protein metal complexes, D-penicillamine weakens copper deposits, resulting in reduction or disappearance of hepatic and neurological symptoms; a small percentage of treated patients develop a nephrotic syndrome that requires mandatory suspension of the drug. A viable alternative in this situation is triethylenetetramine dichloride (TETA), which causes increased cupremia during cupresis. The earlier the response to pharmacological treatment is started and the more regularly it is administered, the better. Dietary copper intake should be reduced by avoiding foods with high copper content. Liver transplantation provides the 'solution' of the underlying metabolic problem in patients who develop fulminant hepatitis with hypercuprema and hemolysis and, of course, in cases of uncompensated cirrhosis unresponsive to chelation therapy. Finally, the authors describe the case of a young man suffering from stage I Wilson's disease who developed a severe nephrotic syndrome following treatment with D-penicillamine; The new TETA therapy is better tolerated and the patient continues to maintain good functional compensation today.",,"Gallo, V.;Riva, P.;Sidoli, L.;Bisbocci, D.",1994,,,0,0,

Design: Case report. The identified patient is briefly compared to a previously studied group of 13 similar presymptomatic patients who received zinc therapy without any clinical worsening and had follow-ups of 3 to 9 years. Setting: Referral hospital. Patients: The patient was referred to us. Intervention: The patient was initially treated with penicillamine. Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome of interest is permanent neurological disability depending on the type of initial therapy. Results: The result of initial penicillamine therapy in the described patient was permanent neurological disability. This is believed to be due to the mobilization and redistribution of hepatic copper causing high copper levels in key areas of the brain. Conclusion: We conclude that penicillamine used as initial therapy increases the risk of permanent neurological damage, even in patients with neurologically asymptomatic Wilson's disease.",,"Brewer, G.

2609,Direct transfer of copper from metallothionein to superoxide dismutase: a possible mechanism for differential supply of Cu to SOD and ceruloplasmin in LEC rats.,"Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)-binding superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) is always synthesized in the liver of LEC rats in the form of a holo-protein, a mutant strain genetically impaired in Cu metabolism that binds to a metallothionein (MT). On the other hand, ceruloplasmin (Cp) is synthesized in the liver and excreted into the blood plasma mostly as an apo-protein before the onset of acute hepatitis and then as a holo-form at the onset of jaundice. Thus, Cu is supplied between Cp and SOD at different times and at different times, that is, before and at the onset of acute hepatitis. The availability of Cu to apo-SOD has been studied to explain the mechanisms for the differential supply of Cu among the three different forms of Cu; i) copper ion bound to glutathione, ii) free copper ion, and iii) copper ion bound to MT. Cu was transferred from the three Cu complexes to SOD, but Cu bound to MT was a less efficient Cu source for apo-SOD. The results show that in LEC rats SOD is always present in a holo-form, since even Cu bound to MT can be supplied to SOD, whereas Cp is present in an apo-form as Cu is sequestered to MT and is not available in free ionic forms.

Cu and metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels in the liver of LEC rats were reduced to the same levels as those of LEA rats by selective removal of Cu with tetrathiomolybdate in vivo. Cu was taken up by LEC rat cells to the same extent as LEA rat cells by exposure to low ambient Cu and to a greater extent high ambient Cu, whereas MT mRNA level in LEC rat cells was greatly increased in a dose-dependent manner. Higher rate than in LEA rats. MT mRNA levels in both cells were comparable to cadmium, zinc and dexamethasone exposure.

Effects of tetrathiotungstate on systemic copper metabolism in normal and copper-treated rats.,"Intraperitoneal administration of tetrathiothungstate (6-17.4 mg W/Kg BW) to rats induced profound changes in copper metabolism in both normal rats and previously copper-treated rats. Albumin-associated plasma copper was increased, liver copper, especially cytosol copper was depleted, and biliary excretion increased. There was also movement of copper to higher molecular weight proteins in both the liver cytosol and bile. In contrast to penicillamine, tetrathiotungstate did not increase liver cytosolic apometallothionein levels and reduced the copper-induced increase. Copper bound to metallothionein was removed. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was inhibited and there was evidence for increased movement of copper to intracellular organelles, possibly lysosomes.

At tracer levels (12.5 µg W), the most important plasma-binding protein was dissociated at the ceruloplasmin location, although this association did not prevent thiotungstate uptake by the liver. At higher dose levels (1.5 mg W), there was significant hydrolysis immediately after injection with rapid excretion of the label in the urine. [<sup>185</sup>W] tetrathiothungstate remaining in plasma was associated with albumin and the amount retained was increased by pretreatment of rats with copper. Increased binding to albumin did not inhibit hepatic uptake, and short-term pretreatment with copper increased the movement of the isotope to subcellular organelles, possibly lysosomes. The excretion in bile was increased and the tag was associated with high molecular weight proteins. In the liver cytosol <sup>185</sup>W was bound by specific proteins that have not yet been characterized. At higher dose levels there was some movement to higher molecular weight proteins and this was greatly enhanced by pretreatment with copper.

As MT mRNA levels were not increased in tx mouse livers, increased MT-gene transcription alone could not explain the high constitutive MT protein levels. However, hepatic MT was significantly more stable in adult tx mice: the MT half-life (t(1/2)) was 79% or 77% greater before and after Cd induction than in wild-type mice, respectively. Cd or Zn treatment increased MT mRNA, but not MT protein, accumulation in tx mouse livers: Cd displaced MT-bound Zn and Cu in pre-existing MT. Thus, tx mice appear to accumulate hepatic MT as a result of reduced protein degradation. These animals may provide a useful model for studying the physiological role of MT and human diseases with abnormal copper metabolism (such as Wilson's disease).",,"Koropatnick, J.;Cherian, M.

2624,"Zinc-derived metallothionein and copper metabolism in the intestinal mucosa, liver and kidneys of rats.","Long-term administration of high doses of parenteral zinc (Zn) and/or high-Zn diets to animals or humans affects copper (Cu) metabolism. Previous work suggests that Zn-induced metallothionein (MT) in intestinal epithelial cells binds Cu and inhibits its absorption. This study was designed to determine the effects of high dietary or parenteral Zn treatment on Cu metabolism in rats and its relationship to MT in the intestinal epithelium, liver, and kidney. Six-week-old male rats were fed a control diet containing 42 mg Zn and 6 mg Cu/kg for one week. They were then divided into three groups. One group continued to receive the control diet, while another received a similar diet containing 560 mg Zn/kg. A third group fed a control diet received a subcutaneous dose of 90 mg Zn/kg body weight every 2-3 days throughout the experiment. Rats from each group were killed on days 7 and 14. Low Cu status in Zn-treated rats was demonstrated by lower-than-normal serum Cu concentration, serum ceruloplasmin activity, lower liver and kidney Cu concentrations, and lower cytochrome C oxidase activity. However, none of these changes were related to an increase in Cu as a result of Zn-induced MT in the intestinal epithelial cell. Instead, the Cu concentration decreased as MT concentrations increased. This study suggests that the effects of elevated Zn treatment on Cu status are not the result of the long-held theory that Zn-induced intestinal MT sequesters Cu and inhibits its passage into the circulation. Instead, it may be due to the direct effect of high luminal Zn concentrations on Cu transport into the epithelial cell.",,"Reeves, P. G.;Rossow, K. L.;Bobilya, D.

Depending on the etiology of chronic liver disease, it has been found that the function of the electron transport chain and/or ATP synthesis is disrupted, leading to decreased oxidative metabolism of various substrates and impaired recovery of hepatic energy status after a metabolic injury. Changes in mitochondrial structure include reduced crystalline megamitochondria, dilatation of mitochondrial cristae, and crystalloid inclusions in the mitochondrial matrix. The most important strategies for maintaining an adequate mitochondrial function per liver are mitochondrial proliferation and increases in the activity of critical enzymes or cofactor content per mitochondria.

In retrospect, the clinical picture was atypical, especially with significant neurological involvement, mainly parkinsonism almost uncontrollable and exacerbated by neuroleptics. Chelation therapy with D-penicillamine resulted in partial improvement in neurological involvement due to persistence of extrapyramidal and neurovegetative symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms improved with fewer neuroleptics compared to the previous 12 years. However, neuroleptics had to be continued, as there was a delay in the diagnosis of the disease and reduced the effectiveness of single chelation therapy.

2678,"Concentration of metallothionein in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and colorectal cancer liver metastases","In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, liver copper concentrations are elevated during the development of the disorder. The accumulated copper is thought to be detoxified by metallothionein, a protein that binds copper and zinc. In liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, copper and zinc concentrations are usually reduced compared to normal liver tissue, but little is known about the accompanying metallothionein levels. In this study, metallothionein concentrations were determined in archival liver samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, and in both normal and malignant liver samples from patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma metastases. Twenty-seven control liver samples contained 3.98 +/- 1.55 mg metallothionein/g protein. Of the 21 liver samples of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis with a mean metallothionein concentration of 6.06 +/- 5.03 mg/g protein, 6 were above the peak control level. Liver metallothionein concentrations were significantly increased for 8 patients with Wilson's disease (10.98 +/- 6.93 mg/g protein, P < 0.005 versus controls, and p < 0.05 versus primary biliary cirrhosis). Metallothionein concentrations (1.17 +/-0.90 mg/g protein) in 11 liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinomas were significantly (p < 0.005) lower than surrounding normal liver tissue (4.25 +/-1.75 mg/g protein). We conclude that increased liver metallothionein concentrations in primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease can detoxify accumulated copper. Also, liver metastases of colorectal cancer contain less metallothionein than the surrounding normal liver tissue.",,"Mulder, T. P. J.;Janssens, A. R.;Verspaget, H. W.;Van Hattum, J.;Lamers, C. B. H.

Seventeen had Wilson's disease, 22 had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 6 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, 12 had chronic liver disease of various etiologies, 4 had cryptogenic acute liver failure, 6 had acute hepatitis and 8 had normal liver. There were several disorders with histological features. appearance. Patients with Wilson's disease had significantly lower serum ceruloplasmin and total copper levels compared to all other groups, but three children with Wilson's disease had normal ceruloplasmin levels and seven had normal total copper levels. There was no significant difference between patients with Wilson's disease and the other groups in terms of free serum copper levels and liver copper content. Baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion was significantly higher in patients with Wilson's disease compared with other patients, but levels were just above the upper limit of normal in six children with Wilson's disease, overlapping with values obtained in three children with hepatic failure, two with acute hepatitis, two with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and three with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge proved to be the most accurate single diagnostic test; Fifteen of the 17 patients with Wilson's disease had levels above 25 mumol/24 hours, but only 1 child with liver failure had 58 other disorders. The penicillamine test is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, especially in children without Kaiser-Fleischer ring.",,"Da Costa, C. M.;Baldwin, D.;Portmann, B.;Lolin, Y.;Mowat, A.

From two patients with Wilson's disease, two patients with chronic liver disease, and two patients with normal hepatic copper levels. Unlike previous studies, the present results do not show any major differences in the intracellular distribution of copper between livers, with most of the copper being found in the soluble supernatant, where it is associated with metallothionein. Ceruloplasmin mRNA levels were decreased in two patients with Wilson's disease and also in one patient with fulminant hepatic failure. Whether the reduction of ceruloplasmin mRNA is specific to Wilson's disease has not yet been confirmed.

As we found a corresponding gross copper accumulation in the liver of rats, we examined whether the development of hepatitis in our rat system could be prevented by administration of D-penicillamine. D-Penicillamine is a copper chelating agent and is one of the effective drugs in human Wilson's disease in which abnormal copper metabolism is also observed. The results show that D-penicillamine treatment inhibited elevation of serum transaminases, suppressed abnormal histological changes in the liver, and completely prevented the onset of hepatitis in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats. We also found that liver copper concentration and serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were decreased, whereas urinary copper level increased in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with D-penicillamine. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of hereditary hepatitis in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats is due to abnormal copper accumulation in the liver.",,"Togashi, Y.;Li, Y.;Kang, J.

The prevalence rate was 0.6 per 100,000 people. Clinical onset was hepatic (50%) or neurological (50%), but at the time of diagnosis (6.4 years later) 67% of patients showed a variety of clinical manifestations: hepatic, neurological, renal, and haematological. Among the main diagnostic indices, we find false negative results for Kayser-Fleischer ring (25%), serum ceruloplasmin (8%), and total serum copper (34%). Ten patients were treated with penicillamine. This drug was effective and well tolerated, but one patient (10%) developed membranous nephritis and had to be switched to BAL and triene sequentially. At 61 months of follow-up, 5 patients (42%) died of severe hepatic failure. Patients with poor prognosis had a significantly greater degree of diagnostic delay and hepatic failure than patients with a good prognosis. Our results point to the following conclusions: a) The prevalence rate of Wilson's disease in Spain is close to the lower reported rate; b) Early diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rare; c) diagnosis should be made only when a few key indicators are positive; d) Demonstrated early liver transplantation in patients with acute or chronic severe liver failure.",,"Castellano, G.;Blasco, A.;Ballesta, F.;Colina, F.;Moreno, D.;Franch, O.;Urruzuno, P.;Solis, J.

2692,Failure of simple biochemical indices to reliably distinguish fulminant Wilson's disease from other causes of fulminant liver failure,"Serum, urine, and tissue biochemical findings were analyzed in 21 cases of fulminant Wilson's disease according to a recently defined biochemical index value based on serum alkaline phosphatase and total serum bilirubin levels, and these cases were compared with 193 other cases of fulminant liver. fault. Serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and AST levels found in fulminant Wilson's disease were significantly different from those found in other cases of fulminant hepatic failure, but it was not possible to distinguish them from other causes of fulminant hepatic failure on the basis of these biochemical parameters. The alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin and aspartate AST/bilirubin ratios derived from the above parameters were also significantly lower in fulminant Wilson's disease than in other fulminant hepatic failure categories, but it was not possible to differentiate between diagnostic categories on this basis. Choosing ratios that accurately describe all cases of fulminant Wilson's disease would have incorrectly diagnosed fulminant Wilson's disease by alkaline as 59/190 (31%) and 84/190 (44%) cases of non-Wilson's fulminant liver failure. phosphatase/bilirubin and AST/bilirubin ratios, respectively. A low alkaline phosphatase-bilirubin ratio (<0.57) in any category of fulminant hepatic failure suggested a significantly worse prognosis than cases with higher ratios (chi<sup>2</sup>, Yates' corrected = 5.37, p =) . 0.02). In the Wilson disease group, serum and hepatic copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal at 4/21, 2/15 and 2/19, respectively, while urinary copper level was elevated at 18/18 and was the most valuable diagnostic test. Some patients have seen greatly increased hepatic copper stores with normal serum copper concentrations; in others, the tissue copper concentration from different parts of the same liver varied up to 7 times. D-penicillamine treatment had no observable beneficial effects in five patients.",,"Sallie, R.;Katsiyiannakis, L.;Baldwin, D.;Davies, S.;O'Grady, J.;Mowat, A.;Mieli-Vergani, G.;Williams, R.",1992,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0270-9139%2892%2990016-3,0,0,
2693,Comparison of the insertion behavior and copper removal effect of triethylenetetramine with normal Wistar rat in an animal model for Wilson's disease (Long-Evans Cinnamon rat).,"The regulatory behaviors and copper removal effect of triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine), a selective chelating agent for copper and an ""orphan drug"" for Wilson's disease, were evaluated in an animal model, Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats and under normal conditions. rats (Wistar). In LEC rats, urinary excretion of trientine was considerably lower than that of Wistar rats. Absorption rates from the jejunal ring in the liver S9 fraction (9000 xg supernatant) and from in vitro metabolism were approximately the same for both strains. The reduction in urinary trientine excretion in LEC rats is thought to be mainly due to decreased functional activity of the kidney, as urinary excretion of creatinine and phenolsulfonphthalein was significantly lower in LEC rats than in Wistar rats. In 6-week-old LEC rats, both an acceleration of urinary copper excretion and a decrease in hepatic copper levels were observed with trientine treatment. However, in 13-week-old LEC rats, no hepatic copper-removal effect was observed, despite increased urinary copper excretion. These results suggest that trientine has a pharmacological effect in the disease, especially in the early stages of hepatitis.",,"Iseki, K.;Kobayashi, M.;Ohba, A.;Miyazaki, K.;Li, Y.;Togashi, Y.;Takeichi, N.",1992,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bdd.2510130406,0,0,

2729,Effect on D-penicillamine metallothionein mRNA levels and copper distribution in mouse hepatocytes,"Penicillamine increases metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner without changing the copper uptake rate or the amount of copper in the cell. However, the effect is dependent on the presence of intracellular copper, as depletion of copper by chelators blocks the effect and does not alter the ability of dexamethasone to stimulate mRNA production. Penicillamine did not alter the <sup>64</sup>Cu distribution in hepatocytes as measured by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), although the model may be affected by the amount of MT present. The data show that penicillamine removes copper from some intermediate ligands, thus making it available to induce metallothionein. It is possible that this is part of the therapeutic effect of the chelator in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"McArdle, H. J.;Kyriakou, P.;Grimes, A.;Mercer, J. F. B.;Danks, D.

Before and after zinc therapy with Wilson's disease. Gastroduodenal intubation was performed in six healthy subjects and five patients with Wilson's disease. After intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (40 ng/kg/hr), pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion increased from a basal rate of 283.1 +/- 75.8 nmol/L/min to a peak of 716.6 +/- 175.3 nmol/L/min. in normal matters. Normal subjects on a zinc-deficient diet had both basal (66.8 +/- 15.8 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (559.5 +/- 31 nmol/L/min) pancreaticobiliary zinc secretion compared to a zinc-sufficient diet. In contrast to the marked reduction of pancreaticobiliary secretion of copper, patients with Wilson's disease who were not treated with zinc had normal baseline (226.6 +/- 126 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (728.7 +/-195.5 nmol/L/min) zinc secretion. . These studies show that there is significant secretion of zinc in pancreaticobiliary fluid in healthy subjects and no impairment of zinc secretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Our data also show that pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc is dependent on the zinc status of subjects, suggesting that endogenous zinc secretion may play an important role in zinc homeostasis.",,"Lee, H.

2733,Hepatolenticular degeneration. [Serbian],"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is an inherited disease in which the metabolic disorder of copper leads to accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, cornea and kidneys, resulting in pathological changes in these organs. The inherited mechanism of the disease is autosomal recessive and its prevalence is between 30-100 per 1,000,000 people. The etiology of this disease has not yet been clarified. There are two hypotheses. The first is the disorder of ceruloplasmin metabolism caused by insufficient or functionally abnormal ceruloplasmin synthesis of normal ceruloplasmin synthesis. Second: block of copper biliary excretion, which is the result of functional defect of liver lysosomes. The pathogenetic mechanism of the disease is that copper accumulates in the liver for a long time, then it is released into the circulation when the liver storage is full, and it causes sufficient pathological changes by accumulating in the brain, cornea, kidney and bones. The toxic activity of copper is the result of its activity on enzymes, especially those with the -SH group. There are two main clinical forms of the disease: liver disease or neurological disease. While prepubertal liver injury is more common, the neurological form of the disease is common in adolescents and young adults. Liver disease is nonspecific and is characterized by symptoms of cirrhosis and chronic aggressive hepatitis. The only specificity is hemolytic anemia, which, together with the previous symptoms, is important for the diagnosis of the disease. The most common consequence of pathological changes in the basal ganglia are neurological symptoms. The most common symptom in our patients was tremor (63%); dysarthria, choreoathetosis, and fussiness (38%); ataxia and mental disorders (31%); dysphagia and dystonia (12%), diplopia, hypersalivation, nystagmus and Babinski sign (6%). Among the pathological changes in other tissues and organs, the most important is the presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea as a result of copper deposition. It is of great importance for definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis of the disease is based on anamnesis, clinical examination, specific and non-specific laboratory tests. The preferred treatment is penicillamine. If we use it early, the result in most patients will be a good remission. Late diagnosis or delay in treatment causes death as a result of bleeding from esophageal varices or basal ganglia disease. Immunological damages caused by penicillamine require discontinuation of treatment and its substitution with tri-ethyl-tetra-amine (TETA). We also use zinc salts and tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of this disease. The pathogenesis, clinical picture and treatment of the disease are based on our own results.",,"Zudenigo, D.;Relja, M.",1990,,,0,0,

While receiving 1 g IV penicillamine four times daily, neurological symptoms worsened and akinesia, mutism, tachy- and bradyarrhythmias developed, as well as transient respiratory failure. On the sixth day of treatment, the serum copper concentration dropped significantly to 28 mug/dl, while on the ninth day it increased to 60 mug/dl. The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was the first 4500-5000 cups. There was any improvement after the drastic reduction of the penicillamine dosage to 600 mg three times a day, and after 11 weeks the patient was able to walk again and was discharged. The likely cause of the patient's initial worsening was marked, mostly hepatic copper depletion, resulting from the high dose of penicillamine.

Half a year before clinical diagnosis, the patient had poor school performance, emotional lability, worsening handwriting, progressively slower gross and fine motor functions, and a steady solid smile. No obvious signs of liver disease were found. Continuous improvement was seen with D-penicillamine treatment (1-1.5 g/day). Pre-treatment MRI showed significant pathological transformation in the basal ganglia. However, changes in many other parts of the brain were also seen, suggesting widespread involvement. Computerized MRI images became more and more normal during treatment.

We think that early diagnosis of this disease is very important to shorten the time from acute symptoms to diagnosis and to apply appropriate treatment. In our cases, this period lasted between 0 and 4 years. In addition to d-penicillamine (up to 900 mg per day), we think that the use of acidum ascorbicum (up to 4.5 g per day) is also very important. This acid shows less consumption of d-penicillamine and has low complications.

2751,Trace metal interactions in vivo: Inorganic cobalt increases urinary copper excretion in rats without producing an associated zincuresis.,"The effects of cobalt chloride on copper and zinc metabolism in male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. These effects were compared with penicillamine, a chelating agent used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, a genetic abnormality of copper metabolism in humans. Cobalt elicited an increase (~4-fold) in urinary copper excretion for 72 hours following a single dose of cobalt. In contrast to the significant increase in urinary zinc excretion produced by penicillamine, cobalt greatly reduced urinary zinc output (~75%). Tissue copper and zinc concentrations were measured after treatment with cobalt at doses ranging from 12 to 60 mg/kg body weight. Significantly decreased (~25%) renal copper concentration was observed 1 and 3 days after cobalt administration. In addition, cobalt produced a concomitant dose-dependent increase (up to 1.6-fold) in hepatic zinc concentration. Cytosolic zinc was eluted from a Sephadex G-75 column in the molecular weight region associated with metallothionein. Time-dependent induction of metallothionein concentration (10-fold) in the liver by cobalt was confirmed by cadmium/hemoglobin affinity analysis. The ability of inorganic cobalt to elevate zinc concentration in the liver and increase urinary copper excretion without the zincuresis that normally accompanies penicillamine administration represents a newly identified biological property of this essential trace metal.",,"Rosenberg, D.

2758,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. VII. Protection of the liver from copper toxicity by zinc-derived metallothionein in a rat model,"Patients with Wilson's disease usually have a greater increase in hepatic copper when zinc is given as initial therapy, although there is no associated clinical deterioration. To better understand this situation, an animal model was developed in which copper-loaded rats were treated with subcutaneously administered zinc. In the presence of equal amounts of copper overload in the liver, control rats show liver damage while zinc-treated rats do not. Zinc-treated rats had much higher hepatic metallothionein levels. Gel filtration studies reveal that most of the hepatic copper in zinc-treated rats is in this metallothionein fraction, whereas copper in control animals is mainly associated with high or low molecular weight fractions. Subcutaneous zinc therapy also induces metallothionein in the gut but not the brain. We interpret these findings to show that zinc treatment protects against copper toxicity in the liver by inducing hepatic metallothionein, which retains copper in a non-toxic form.",,"Lee, D.

2768,Wilson's disease: symptomatic treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Some comments,"The neuropsychiatric disturbances in Wilson's disease may require symptomatic relief, often beyond long-term anticancer therapy. The coexistence of brain and liver damage necessitates careful selection of drugs, their doses, and the definition of these symptoms due to copper accumulation in the brain and hepatic encephalopathy. Benzodiazepines with short half-lives, 'non-classical' neuroleptics, anticholinergics and phenobarbital can be valuable therapeutic tools in the symptomatic treatment of Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is a rare condition characterized by degenerative changes in the brain, softening of the basal ganglia and liver cirrhosis. The biliary excretion of copper is impaired, and the metal accumulates in the liver, brain and other tissues. Patients usually present in the second or third decade of life with hepatic, neurological and psychiatric involvement. The administration of agents that remove copper from the body, inhibit penicillamine or its absorption, zinc, or have both effects, such as trientine, at least ameliorate or reverse the most common signs of Wilson's disease months or years later, and prevent its occurrence in asymptomatic affected siblings. The anticancer treatment of Wilson's disease has been extensively reviewed (Walshe, 1986; Brewer et al., 1987; Hogenraad et al., 1987; Marsden, 1987; Walshe, 1988). However, in addition to specific anticopper therapy, symptomatic therapy can be used in severe cases, particularly in patients whose clinical condition worsens at the start of penicillamine therapy (Brewer et al., 1987), and in its presence it may be difficult to select appropriate therapy.

The effect of PSH in PSS may also be due to the formation of thiazolidine, a recognized biochemical reaction of PSH. However, the pharmacodynamics of PSH in suppressing inflammatory activity in RA and possibly PSS are poorly understood. Future work is required in systems that adequately model PSH-responsive inflammatory disease and are exposed to PSh and its metabolites at therapeutically relevant concentrations. A better understanding of the pharmacodynamics of PSH should lead to safer, more effective use of the drug and point a direction for the development of new antirheumatic drugs.",,"Joyce, D.

For 34 D-penicillamine recipients, StrAb was found at 15% by EIA and 6% by immunofluorescence. StrAb was detected by EIA in two of the four bone marrow recipients and by immunofluorescence in one. Prospective testing of 434 fresh serums (49 of which were positive by both methods) yielded discordant results in only 4. tumor. Elderly patients with spontaneous MG had a high prevalence of StrAb in both assays, but StrAb could be more easily measured with the EIA.

Alcohol intake, bleeding, stress, and subsequent catabolism cause acute loss-inducing encephalopathy, the symptoms of which are very similar to those observed in deep Zn depletion.

We propose that zinc ions present in nerve terminals are extruded into the extracellular space during neuronal activity. During intense neuronal activation, excessive zinc levels may be released and contribute to the observed paroxysm and toxic damage. Zinc ions are found in high concentrations in the mossy fibers of the hippocampal formation, and it is the postsynaptic neurons of these fibers that are most susceptible to the toxic effects of the potent convulsant kainic acid or to chronic exposure to organometallic compounds.

Second, glutaraldehyde-frozen sections were used to examine copper deposits in the livers of patients. There was a significant correlation between copper and sulfur contents in the lysosomes of all patients studied, but no correlation in the rest of the cytoplasm. Zinc was not detected in lysosomes. Regardless of the copper content in the lysosomes, the ratio of DELTAcopper to phosphorus (w/w) DELTAsulfur to phosphorus was 0.60.

To demonstrate the effects of high doses of Zn on Cu absorption, a series of experiments were conducted using an experimental animal model. In the first experiment, five groups of mice were fed five different levels of Zn: 6 ppm (basal diet), 30 ppm (control), 750 ppm, 1,000 ppm, and 2,400 ppm over a 35-day period. The <sup>64</sup>Cu-loading test was performed to measure the whole body uptake (WBR) of <sup>64</sup>Cu at days 10, 14, 21, and 35. The results showed that the inhibition of <sup>64</sup>Cu absorption by Zn was dose and time dependent. However, maximal inhibition occurred in mice fed 1,000 ppm Zn, and no additional effects were observed in mice fed 2,400 ppm Zn. In the second experiment, the distribution of the retained <sup>64</sup>Cu dose between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the gutless carcass was measured in controls and the group fed 750 ppm Zn. WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in mice fed 750 ppm Zn, while the distribution of the retained dose was not affected. In the third experiment, one group of mice received 30 ppm Zn (control) for a period of 70 days and a second group received 1,000 ppm Zn for the first 35 days (repletion), then the mice were switched. basal diet (6 ppm) for the next 35 days (exhaustion). WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu was performed at intervals throughout the experimental period. Endogenous fecal Zn (MFZn) was determined at the end of replenishment (0 t) and at intervals during extinction. Results from this experiment showed that the effect of Zn on <sup>64</sup>Cu absorption persisted up to 21-35 days following cessation of Zn supplementation. In addition, WBR of <sup>64</sup>Cu correlated significantly (r = -0.92, p < 0.005) with MFZn. (a) high doses of Zn may not cause a complete inhibition of Cu absorption, and (b) endogenous Zn secreted into the GIT (as MFZn) plays an important role in inhibiting Cu absorption and thus endogenous Zn for maximum inhibition of high Cu absorption. condition is essential.",,"Cossack, Z.

2832,Clinico-biochemical diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease. [Slovak],"The presented review article deals with current information regarding the pathophysiology, clinico-biochemical (CB) diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease (Wd). CB screening is performed by determination of ceruloplasmin and total copper in serum and copper in urine under basic conditions and after penicillamine administration. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty (and post-mortem), second-stage screening is done by the quantitative determination of copper in bioptic liver samples or by the <sup>64</sup>Cu load test. This deadly congenital disease has been effectively treated for more than 30 years in case of intolerance to penicillamine and triethylenetetramine hydrochloride. The latest treatment with zinc has a different mechanism of action - it removes excess copper from the organism through feces, while previous treatments were in the urine. To monitor Wd therapy, the authors recommend adjusting the dose based on urinary copper excretion or the <sup>64</sup>Cu load test. Treatment is checked annually by determining urinary copper excretion on 2-3 consecutive days and testing tubular functions - unless the patient's clinical condition requires a shorter duration. Hemogram, ALT and urinalysis should be performed with clinical control at least 4 times a year. In the case of zinc therapy, serum zinc should be monitored. The authors recommend the indicated groups for CB screening of WD, which is not as rare as it used to be (1:35000 or 1:50000) today: 1) Patients aged 5 to 60 years with suspected hepatologic or neurological symptomatology. 2) First-degree relatives of the patient with Wd. 3) Children with chronic liver symptomatology or acute symptomatology with an annual protracted or fulminant course. Even a slit lamp should be used to search for a Kayser-Fleischer ring in children. Wd screening and therapy monitoring is done as follows: 1) by a clinician alone observing precisely the specimen collection requirements, 2) by a clinician in collaboration with a medical professional in clinical biochemistry, 3) by a CB metabolic outpatient department in collaboration with a clinician .",,"Slugenova, E.",1987,,,0,0,

2835,Liver cirrhosis: Is pharmacotherapy of the underlying disease possible? [German],"There are many causes of cirrhosis of the liver and the answer to the question ""Is drug therapy of cirrhosis helpful?"" depends on the underlying cause, not the histology. For inherited disorders where specific treatment is highly successful, such as Wilson's disease or hemochromatosis, the answer is definitely yes. In primary biliary cirrhosis, drug therapy with corticosteroids is justified only in cases with features of chronic active autoimmune hepatitis (CAD). The results with penicillamine are disappointing. Azathioprine may be valuable in some situations. Colchicine and cyclosporine are being tried and results are not yet available. HB(s)AG negative autoimmune CAD-cirrhosis should be treated for months or even years with corticosteroids or a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine. Steroids are no longer recommended for HB(s)AG-positive patients with CAD-cirrhosis, because the results of controlled studies suggest that they may be harmful: virus replication and propensity for cancer formation may be increased. The results of treatment with antiviral drugs alone or in combination with interferon are still scarce and more will need to be evaluated before any recommendations can be made. Drug therapy is rarely successful in alcoholic liver disease. Glucocorticosteroids have been tried and may be indicated in rare and exceptional cases with encephalopathy.

Lethargy and anorexia (70%), jaundice (50%), and abdominal pain (48%) were the most common symptoms, and less commonly mental impairment (22%) and recurrent epistaxis (22%). The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from five days to three years (mean 10.5 months), and only five of the patients were diagnosed before referral. Analysis of physical findings at admission showed that hepatomegaly (81%) and splenomegaly (70%) were common, with jaundice and ascites the only signs that were significantly more common in 13 fatal cases. In three of these, and in another patient who survived the clinical course, it was extremely severe and indistinguishable from fulminant hepatic failure. Based on the severity of the abnormality in serum aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and prothrombin time at admission, a prognostic index was obtained that allows the precise separation of fatal and non-fatal cases and then accurately predicts outcome when used in nine index cases. Two other cases found to have indices in the lethal category did well after liver transplantation and cases with such severe liver injury should be evaluated as soon as they are diagnosed.",,"Nazer, H.;Ede, R.

2857,Wilson's disease: Evaluation of D-penicillamine therapy.,"Serum copper and zinc concentrations and 24-hour urinary copper and zinc excretion were serially determined from the start of D-penicillamine therapy in four children with Wilson's disease. The data show a progressive decrease in both serum copper and zinc concentrations in all of them. Urinary copper excretion gradually decreased to approximately 50% of baseline values, but zinc excretion increased. Urine zinc:copper ratios therefore increased with duration of treatment. Copper elimination was considered adequate when challenge with the test dose of D-penicillamine did not result in an increase in copper excretion. Urinary zinc excretion increased further with the test dose. Zinc depletion was suspected clinically in a patient receiving D-penicillamine maintenance therapy. Lowering the dose relieved symptoms, urinary zinc loss decreased from 64 to 34 mumol/24 hours, and copper excretion remained largely unchanged. The obtained data show that D-penicillamine alters both copper and zinc metabolism. The extent of this is not only dose dependent, but also related to the efficiency of copper elimination. Both copper and zinc concentrations should be monitored to assess the benefits of therapy and the risks of inducing overt or subclinical zinc deficiency.",,"Van Caillie-Bertrand, M.;Degenhart, J.

The course, evaluated by clinical, biochemical and histological parameters, was satisfactory in both. Urine copper concentration returned below 1.26 mumol/24 hours; and serum copper concentration was further reduced during zinc sulfate treatment. In a child, the increase in 24-hour urinary copper excretion observed after a dose of D-penicillamine (+/- 20 mg/kg) remained constant throughout the observation period, while liver copper content ranged from 1460 cups/g dry weight to 890 cups/g dry weight. However, in the other patient, liver copper content and 24-hour urinary copper excretion increased after D-penicillamine loading in the third year of treatment. We conclude that zinc sulfate is a low-toxic and well-tolerated alternative to D-penicillamine. However, dosage depends on individual factors that are not yet fully understood, and we recommend limiting its use in patients who do not tolerate D-penicillamine well. We recommend monitoring treatment with annual D-penicillamine loading and performing a liver biopsy if liver function deteriorates.",,"Van Caillie-Bertrand, M.;Degenhart, H. J.;Visser, H. K.

2865,Interactions of trace elements: clinical significance,"We studied the interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. The usual situation in sickle cell anemia is mild to moderate zinc deficiency due to kidney loss of zinc. Zinc deficiency appears to produce a slight excess of copper and an increased level of ceruloplasmin, possibly by increasing copper absorption. With zinc treatment, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc will often lead to copper deficiency when administered (without food) to achieve efficacy. We took advantage of the copper-depleting effect of zinc to design a new treatment for Wilson's disease. Zinc inhibits the absorption of copper from food by inducing intestinal metallothionein and inhibits the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, thus creating a negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are confident that zinc blocks the accumulation of copper in the liver of patients with Wilson's disease, zinc therapy will be available as an approach to treating this deadly disease. The animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity, undoubtedly via the intestinal metallothionein mechanism, when both elements are administered orally. In preliminary experiments in rats, we were unable to demonstrate that toxicity from non-oral lead ingestion is affected by oral zinc supplements.",,"Brewer, G. J.;Hill, G.;Dick, R. D.",1985,,,0,0,

The roles of trace metals in carcinogenesis/mutagenesis and aging are typical of this category. Second-level genetic trace metal disorders affect the metabolic pathway of the trace metal itself. Biochemical dysregulation caused by genetic defects causes abnormal metabolism of the element and hence disease symptoms. Diseases caused by abnormal metabolism of copper, zinc, iron and molybdenum are discussed. Trace metal disorders can also be the result of other genetic diseases. This aspect of genetic trace metal disorders is the least researched.

He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 6 when he developed a hemolytic crisis. At the age of 14, gait disturbance, dysgraphia and dysarthria appeared. These were only improved with an increase in D-penicillamine dosage. She was fine until her acute worsening soon after she had an acute respiratory infection. At presentation, she could not walk, speak or swallow, showed severe involuntary movements and right hemiplegia. However, liver functions were normal. Although involuntary movement and hemiplegia gradually improved, dystonia and anarthria were persistent. Surface EMG showed characteristic dystonic pattern. She was able to stand, walk and write a few weeks after starting treatment with trihexyphenidyl 10 mg daily. When the drug was discontinued to determine its effects, she clearly got worse and could hardly walk or write. Psychiatric symptoms such as irritability and emotional instability were noted as side effects, but these were not severe enough to stop the drug. Seven months after treatment initiation, dystonia tended to fluctuate, increasing in the morning and decreasing in the evening, and there were no corresponding diurnal changes in CSF homovanilic acid or dopamine levels. Fahn (1979) reported that the treatment of various types of dystonia with high-dose trihexyphenidyl was particularly effective in childhood.

Adding penicillamine to a peritoneal dialysis solution allowed chelatin and removal of more than 14 mg of copper per day, but with no apparent benefit. Exchange transfusion and high-dose dexamethasone therapy (24 mg/day) were equally ineffective in reversing liver failure. Other reported cases have also been fatal. The best treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is prevention through diagnosis at a pre-symptomatic stage and life-long therapy carefully supervised with penicillamine.",,"Rector Jr, W.

2889,Diagnostic value and significance of radiocopper challenge test abnormalities in Wilson's disease. [French],"Wilson's disease in this patient was suspected in relation to the histological features of chronic active hepatitis and increased hepatic-copper concentration. However, the patient exhibited prolonged cholestasis, neither a Kayser-Fleischer ring nor neurological symptoms, and had a serum-ceruloplasmin concentration in the normal range. The time course of plasma-<sup>64</sup>Cu levels in this patient was compared to those found in four other subjects: a normal subject, two patients with typical Wilson's disease, and one patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. Similar time periods were observed for both the patient with suspected Wilson's disease and the two typical cases, thus establishing a definitive diagnosis. This pattern differed from that of the normal subject in the absence of a secondary increase in plasma-<sup>64</sup>Cu concentration. In the patient with primary biliary cirrhosis, the time course was intermediate between that of the normal subject and patients with Wilson's disease. These results suggest that: 1) a radiocopper challenge test is useful in diagnosing difficult cases of Wilson's disease, especially when the ceruloplasmin level is normal; 2) The absence of a secondary increase in plasma <sup>64</sup>Cu levels in Wilson's disease is largely independent of the decrease in serum-ceruloplasmin; rather, it appears to be related to isotope dilution and abnormalities of intrahepatic copper distribution in an expanded hepatic copper pool.",,"Mavier, P.;Meignan, M.;Wirquin, E.",1982,,,0,0,

2903,Hudson Memorial Lecture: Wilson's disease: Genetics and biochemistry - their relevance to therapy,"Wilson's disease is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects children, adolescents, and young adults. The first signs and symptoms before puberty are almost always associated with liver injury with or without hemolysis. After adolescence, the neurological symptoms become increasingly prominent and always involve the motor centers, sometimes the personality, never the sensory nervous system. The most characteristic physical sign is Kayser Fleischer corneal pigment ring, which is caused by the deposition of copper in Descemet's membrane. Although the primary genetic defect is unknown, the disease appears to result from the inability of hepatocytes to excrete copper through bile. As a result, this metal accumulates first in the liver, then in the brain, cornea and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys when this organ is saturated. When copper is present in excess in tissues, it poisons various enzyme systems, causing cellular damage and death. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for the pleomorphic nature of the disease, let alone the often large asymmetry of lesions in the brain. Treatment requires establishing a negative copper balance until abnormal body stores of the metal are removed. After that, the patient must be kept in balance for life. There are two main drugs that can be used for this purpose, penicillamine and triethylene tetramine (Trientine). Both will result in biochemical and clinical reversal of the disease. Pencillamine can cause a wide variety of toxic reactions, mostly immunologically; therefore, regular monitoring of blood count and kidney function is essential. Less is currently known about trientine's potential to cause unwanted side effects. Wilson's disease is characterized by recessive inheritance. It can be diagnosed at the presymptomatic stage by finding abnormalities of copper metabolism. All families should be screened and prophylactic treatment initiated when appropriate, thereby halting the clinical evolution of the disease.",,"Walshe, J. M.",1983,,,0,0,
2904,Metallothionein - aspects of copper and zinc metabolism,"Metallothionein is a cysteine-rich, low molecular weight protein that binds zinc, copper, and cadmium. Glucocorticoids can be induced in the liver, kidney, and intestine by changes in dietary zinc supply, acute administration of various metals, food restriction, infection, stress, and endotoxin therapy. Regulation of synthesis involves altered gene expression. The protein degrades fairly quickly when zinc is the primary metal type bound, but the rate of degradation is reduced when cadmium or copper is also bound. The net result of metallothionein production appears to be bound metal deposition and/or intracellular metal redistribution. Copper accumulation in various tissues of individuals with Menkes and Wilson's disease may be associated with altered metallothionein cycling. Its physiological function is unclear, but the response of metallothionein to hormonal stimuli suggests an important role in cellular metabolism.",,"Cousins, R. J.",1983,,,0,0,

The earliest clinical manifestation of liver disease was hepatosplenomegaly with varying liver function indices. The disease was detected in 4 couples in the siblings of the families. In all cases, the diagnosis was made based on ceruloplasmin, serum copper, basal urinary copper and urine copper values after D-penicillamine. In addition, it has been shown that the copper concentration in the liver is greatly increased in 8 cases. D-penicillamine treatment resulted in hepatic improvement in 8 cases, 6 of which were affected only by the hepatic form, and the treatment was well tolerated. In 1 case, this treatment caused nephrotic syndrome, replaced by Trien-2HCL. Wilson's disease in its pure hepatic form should be considered in the differential diagnosis of liver diseases in pediatric age, especially in the absence of viral hepatitis markers.

Unlike ocular myasthenia, no clinical, humoral, or genetic factor has been identified that would allow the identification of individuals developing generalized. Withdrawal of penicillamine facilitated by the use of anticholinesterase agents was associated with slow resolution of symptoms over 4-60 weeks in 12 patients. Persistent partial unilateral ptosis remained in 2 patients after 15 and 25 months, while another patient had diplopia 42 months after resolution of other myasthenic symptoms. Compared with a healthy 'control' population, patients with PIM had a significant increase in HLD Dr1 (p corr<0.005) and absence of HLA Dr3. This abnormal distribution of HLA Dr antigens suggests a genetic predisposition to the development of PIM, unlike that observed in spontaneous-onset myasthenia gravis.",,"Delamere, J.

Hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria have been linked to Fanconi syndrome, a known component of Wilson's disease. Circulating immunoreactive parathyroid hormone was usually undetectable or sometimes minimally detectable in the presence of low blood levels of ionized calcium. Normal ionized calcium levels were not maintained over a 24-hour monitoring period. The patient had tetany at a time of rapid decline in ionized calcium levels, and an appropriate elevation in circulating immunoreactive parathyroid levels was never demonstrated. Hypocalcemia induced during citrate infusion did not stimulate either parathyroid secretion or magnesium infusion. We concluded that parathyroid insufficiency may be associated with Wilson's disease.

2917,A new look at cirrhosis,"There have been modest advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of some types of cirrhosis, but the current system classification is not entirely satisfactory. For example, how do we classify the type of cirrhosis found in an individual who drank 80g of alcohol per day, was hepatitis BsAg-positive, and was stated to be an MZ heterozygous for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency? Many cases of cirrhosis may have multifactorial origins; alcohol and hepatitis B virus can act synergistically in this respect. Some types of cirrhosis are now potentially preventable, for example, due to the hepatitis B virus, while others are partially reversible. For inherited disorders with specific treatment, such as Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis, screening other family members is vital. In established cirrhosis associated with disorders such as non-A, non-B hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis and Indian childhood cirrhosis, the antifibrogenic drugs penicillamine and colchicine show promise, but it is doubtful whether either drug should be used outside of medicine yet. the limits of a controlled study.

Reactive drug metabolites, metal poisoning, and anoxia are also directly related to the hepatocyte injury pattern. The immunological model is characterized by fragmentary necrosis of periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes and damage to cell membranes by mononuclear cell infiltration. Examples include chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions such as halothane. In cholestatic order, there is a disorder in the bile secretion mechanism with the retention of bile in hepatocytes. Cholestatic liver injury can be intrahepatic, as in sex hormone cholestasis, or extrahepatic, as in choledocholithiasis or carcinoma of the bile ducts.

[Russian],"Basic parameters of catecholamine metabolism were investigated in 48 patients with hepatocerebral dystrophy. Significant changes were noted, mainly characterized by a significant decrease in the excretion of dopamine and noradrenaline and an increase in the excretion of their direct precursors, namely DOPA. Based on the data obtained, it was assumed that the synthesis of these neurotransmitter catecholamines is suppressed. A statistically significant increase in dopamine excretion (compared to baseline) was noted during treatment with d-penicillamine, which can mobilize copper and stimulate its excretion from the body, and not only dopamine but also noradrenaline excretion was increased in the severely rigid-arrhythmohyperkinetic patients in the form of the disease. It is assumed that catecholamine metabolism disorders in hepatocerebral dystrophy have a complex mechanism and are associated with both severe hepatic pathology and copper metabolism disorders. In this regard, additional methods of treating this disease are presented. These methods affect catecholamine metabolism and are primarily effective on extrapyramidal motor as well as psychic disorders.

2940,Hepatic copper in primary biliary cirrhosis: Biliary excretion and response to penicillamine therapy.,"Excessive hepatic copper accumulation occurs in long-term cholestatic liver disorders, especially in primary biliary cirrhosis. As in Wilson's disease, penicillamine has recently been used for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. The biliary excretion of copper is decreased in Wilson. This study shows that biliary excretion of copper is not reduced in primary biliary cirrhosis compared with controls; instead, it may increase in some patients. However, compared with the high hepatic copper concentration, biliary copper excretion was low. In contrast to copper, bile secretion of bile acids was decreased in eight of 17 patients. Treatment with oral penicillamine (600 mg/day) for one year resulted in a significant decrease in hepatic copper concentration, but had no consistent effect on the biliary excretion of copper or the amount of histologically stainable orcein-positive copper-binding protein. The results suggest that excessive hepatic copper deposition in primary biliary cirrhosis may not primarily result from a decreased biliary excretion or that a new equilibrium has been reached in advanced primary biliary cirrhosis. D-penicillamine appears to significantly improve the biliary excretion of bile acids.",,"Salaspuro, M. P.;Pikkarainen, P.;Sipponen, P.",1981,,,0,0,

A brief review of the relevant literature revealed that dermatological lesions of pemphigus secondary to penicillamine were relieved by discontinuation of penicillamine and initiation of prednisone therapy. Since penicillamine could be stopped for a short time in order to maintain acceptable serum copper levels and due to the scarcity of available alternative copper chelating agents, primarily oral lesions of our patient did not improve with this proposed change in treatment. Finally, the patient was given an experimental copper chelating agent, tetraethylene tetramine (TETA) and betamethasone (Celestone). This resulted in a satisfactory reduction in serum copper levels and resolution of oral lesions.",,"Eisenberg, E.;Ballow, M.;Wolfe, S.

D-Penicillamine administration did not cause significant reductions in these enzyme activities. It is likely that Wilson's disease and changes in copper metabolism induced by D-Penicillamine administration do not affect MAO or DAO activity.

Hepatic copper concentrations were associated with urinary copper excretion in cholestasis and treated Wilson's disease, but not in hepatitis or cirrhosis. In treated Wilson's disease, measurement of urinary copper excretion should be valuable in estimating the degree of copper excretion during treatment.

In such cases, proteinuria usually occurs within four to 18 months, although the onset can sometimes be later. The incidence of proteinuria (30%) is higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and cystinuria than in patients with Wilson's disease (4%), and its occurrence is associated with the mean daily dose of penicillamine and the rate at which this maintenance dose is reached. . Rheumatoid arthritis patients with low serum IgG and IgA concentrations may be more sensitive, and those with DRW2 and DWR3 antigens are more responsive to penicillamine or gold, perhaps reflecting the pharmacological properties common to the two drugs. Penicillamine is a valuable drug in rheumatoid arthritis and can be lifesaving in Wilson's disease and cystinuria.

2951,Superstructure of penicillamine-induced skin lesions,"Three D-penicillamine-induced skin lesions, two hemorrhagic and one elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS)-like, were examined by electron microscopy. Elastic fibers are decreased in hemorrhagic lesions. Elastic fibers are markedly increased in the papillary and reticular dermis in EPS lesions. These appeared as thorny bushes spotted with elastic fibers, as described by Lund. Ultrastructurally, the berry bush fibers consisted of near-normal core and abnormal coat that was moderately electron-dense and lacked the alternating pattern of the dense and light layer of normal dermal elastic fibers. The 'thorns' are formed as regular heavings of this covering material at regular intervals and at right angles to the long axis of these fibers. In some fibers, the covering material did not surround the entire circumference of the core, suggesting that it was added on top of the normal elastic fiber after the disease process had begun. The elastic fibers in the perforation canal along the epidermis were either intact thorny bush fiber or its degeneration. Collagen fibers in both hemorrhagic and EPS lesions stained poorly with routine electron microscopic dyes. The most striking abnormality was the extreme variation in thickness of individual fibers ranging from 0.01 µm to 0.05 µm. Banding patterns and periodicity were normal. Subendothelial detachment of vascular endothelial cells in small vessels and actual degeneration of subendothelial elastic fibers (inner elastic membrane) in larger vessels appear to be the main defect in hemorrhagic lesions. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa appears to be a phenomenon caused by various abnormal elastic fibers. Obviously, the ones in our case are completely different from the idiopathic ones. Any abnormal elastic fiber causing foreign body recognition by the host is commonly assumed to be eliminated through this phenomenon.",,"Hashimoto, K.;McEvoy, B.;Belcher, R.",1981,,,0,0,

Penicillamine was found to significantly reduce the cytotoxic effect of serum obtained from patients affected by hepato-lenticular degeneration. The effect was less pronounced when using serum from patients suffering from hepatic coma and serum containing exogenous copper salts. There was no reduction in the cytotoxic effect of ammonia. The above observations have led to the assumption that the protective effect of penicillamine is only demonstrated when copper is the sole or concomitant pathogenic factor. The partial attenuating effect of penicillamine in cultures with exogenous copper-containing serum and in cultures with serum from patients affected by hepatic coma is attributed to excess copper salts in relation to penicillamine in the first case and a common condition in the second case. the influence of copper and ammonia, equally pathogenic factors.",,"Mossakowski, M.

The positive correlation of serum zinc level with the amount of alpha<inf>1</inf> globulin and also the increase of the latter in Pick's disease suggest a physiopathology that may be closer to hemochromatosis than hepatolenticular degeneration. Confirmation of this hypothesis will require replication of our own results by other research teams, more specific studies of the modalities of zinc transport by plasma proteins, and global assessments of this metal metabolism in Pick's disease.",,"Constantinidis, J.;Richard, J.;Tissor, R.",1977,,,0,0,

3090,Goodpasture syndrome and D penicillamine,"Recently, it has been suggested that Goodpasture syndrome may be caused by D penicillamine therapy. One patient (51-year-old male) who developed the clinical picture of this syndrome during treatment with this drug has been reported. Peritoneal dialysis was required and a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed several fully sclerosing glomeruli and 6 glomeruli with focal proliferative changes with prominent epithelial crescent formation. Immunofluorescence showed no residue of IgG or complement components. The thin (one micron) section did not show the presence of immune complex residues and therefore electron microscopy was not performed. Clinical features very similar to those of this patient have been described in Wilson's disease, which was recently treated with D penicillamine. In these cases, features were attributed to Goodpasture's syndrome and D penicillamine was implicated as the causative agent. However, linear deposition of immunoglobulin on the glomerular basement membrane was not demonstrated in any of these cases. This is a feature characteristic of Goodpasture's syndrome and its absence should preclude the use of this diagnostic term. Therefore, it may be more accurate to define the disease as 'lung purpura and nephritis'. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that it contains D penicillamine in the described clinical syndrome, and this case report is felt to give credence to the relationship reported by previous authors.",,"Gibson, T.;Burry, H.

Following the elimination of bilateral hyperkinesia, low doses of D penicillamine were administered. The effect of this treatment was maintained for 3 years postoperatively. Conservative treatment has proven to be useless. It is suggested that electrical stimulation with an unchanged genotype tends to abolish the 'persistent pathological condition' and positively change the phenotype of patients. It is recommended to examine the relatives of the patients for early identification of cases in the presymptomatic form and carriers of hepatolenticular degeneration genes, which are important in medicogenetic consultations.",,"Bondarchuk, A.

Another patient often had minor mal attacks that could be completely suppressed by D penicillamine. The authors describe two cases of hepatolenticular degeneration with specific changes on the EEG but without epilepsy. This EEG change completely disappeared during treatment with D penicillamine. Epileptic crises at the onset of the disease, incompletely developed biochemical changes may be a diagnostic problem.

SGOT activity was lower in patients with Huntington's chorea than in controls (P = 0.02), LGPT activity was decreased in Friedreich's ataxia (P<0.001); ALS was increased in patients suffering from SGOT (P = 0.005), SGPT (P<0.001) and LGOT (P<0.001) activities. Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease with L dopa resulted in an increase in SGOT, LGOT, and SGPT activity approximately every 2 months, and these enzyme activities returned to normal after continued treatment. Guanidine treatment led to an increase in aminotransferase activities in patients with ALS. Penicillamine caused a decrease in SGOT and SGPT activities in Wilson's disease. These results indicate the need to consider therapeutic measures when interpreting data on aminotransferase activities.",,"Weiss, J.;Grundig, E.;Gerstenbrand, F.",1975,,,0,0,

The patient's 12-year-old sister was found to have the hepatic form of Wilson's disease with typical biochemical findings. During the first hospitalization, a severe spontaneous copper-induced hemolysis was noted. Another sister probably has a presymptomatic form of the disease.

3100,Stomatitis caused by D penicillamine. [French],"The authors recall the chemical structure, pharmacological properties, and main indications of D penicillamine: Wilson's disease and rheumatoid polyarthritis. D penicillamine therapy can cause digestive, neurological, hematological, and renal accidents, as well as cutaneous mucosal accidents, which are very interesting to study. Except for early-onset accidents of the pruritic type of erythema, which appear to be allergic in nature, these accidents occur late after ingestion of high doses and their mechanisms are different: lupus erythematosus syndrome, erosive and lichenoid stomatitis, hemorrhagic detachment of the skin. pressure points with the formation of epidermal microcysts apparently associated with the lathyrogenic effect of the product, bullous eruptions clinically, histopathologically and immunologically defined by pemphigus. The authors describe the case of a 49-year-old woman who was treated for 17 months with D penicillamine for rheumatoid polyarthritis. An pruritic erythema of the face and extremities that appeared in the fifth week was progressively less responsive to antihistamines. After 14 months, a painful, erosive, and keratotic stomatitis developed that followed treatment and resolved quickly when D penicillamine was discontinued. It clinically resembled an erosive lichen planus, but histopathologically it looked very different and the epithelium had acantholysis. Therefore, it may be an atypical pemphigus, and penicillamine appears to be the first known drug capable of inducing this disease.",,"Kuffer, R.;Noble, J. P.",1973,,,0,0,

Such a change appears to belong to the primary picture of Wilson's disease, as it is known to occur in the asymptomatic form. However, a drug effect could not be completely excluded, as both patients were treated with D penicillamine. Hemorrhagic diathesis develops if the liver is damaged secondary to copper deposition and the hemostatic condition worsens. Thus, the phenomenon of petechial (and hence thrombocytic) hemorrhage paradoxically manifests itself, with the reduction of hepatic-bound plasma coagulation factors.",,"Sutor, A. H.;Ketelsen, U.

3103,"Penicillamine, its metabolism and therapeutic applications: a review","Penicillamine has proven to be an excellent therapeutic agent for the treatment of Wilson's disease and cystinuria. However, its use in other disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis is still controversial. This controversy has arisen in large part because of the higher incidence of drug-related adverse events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For the most part, the etiology of these side effects is unknown and therefore careful monitoring of patients taking penicillamine for adverse reactions is imperative. Measurements of penicillamine and its metabolic products can be a useful adjunct to the laboratory parameters currently used to evaluate the patient's response to this drug. The mechanism by which penicillamine exerts its beneficial effects in different disease states is not understood. What is clear, however, is that the penicillamine thiol group plays a critical role in determining the effects of the drug. It follows, therefore, that the in situ effect of penicillamine will depend on factors such as the drug's physical condition, its distribution in the body, and its metabolism and excretion rate. Hopefully, once more is known about these parameters, it will be more appropriate to speculate about the mechanisms by which penicillamine exerts both its beneficial and harmful effects. Much more research will be needed if this goal is to be achieved in the near future.",,"Crawhall, J. C.;Lecavalier, D.;Ryan, P.",1979,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bdd.2510010205,0,0,

The drug is applied daily per os. Additional psychiatric treatment is not applied. Physical findings are checked 5 to 7 months after treatment. Evaluation is made according to clinical psychopathometric and psychological test criteria. In 4 out of 5 patients, the transition syndrome manifested after 5 to 7 months. In the treatment part of HAWIE, a significant increase in values (between 14 and 27 IQ points) compared to the initial examinations corresponds to the above results. In only one patient, the clinical picture improves with a 7-month delay.

3107,Treatment of inflammatory and metal storage diseases of the liver,"No specific drug therapy is indicated for chronic persistent hepatitis, if the prognosis in this case is equally favourable. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents have been used in chronic active hepatitis for 20 years, and in most controlled studies, corticosteroids have been shown to prolong life. It is usual to start prednisone with 20 or 40 mg daily and reduce the dose as symptoms and biochemical abnormalities improve. Azathioprine alone is no more effective than placebo. However, it has a steroid sparing effect and allows lower doses of corticosteroids. Gradual discontinuation of therapy is recommended only after patients have remained in biochemical and histological remission for at least 6 months. Further trials are needed for the use of immunostimulation with transfer factor, interferon, and levamisole. Treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis with azathioprine prior to symptomatic cirrhosis has not proven beneficial. However, there was improvement in the cases of itching. A preliminary report from the Mayo Clinic suggests that copper chelation therapy with D-penicillamine can be effective with a significant improvement in serum gamma globulin, bilirubin and IgM levels. Supportive treatment and correction of malabsorption, fluid retention, portal hypertension and hepatic decompensation are very important. Itching can be relieved with cholestyramine or androgens. Fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin A 100,000 IU, vitamin D 100,000 IU, and vitamin K, are administered after a 10 mg monthly schedule. No pharmacological agent has been conclusively proven to be useful in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. The use of corticosteroids has been both advocated and condemned on the basis of a number of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials. There is substantial evidence that iron is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hemochromatosis. Two controlled studies have shown that venection therapy is effective as it relates to survival, liver function, skin pigmentation and diabetes mellitus. Twice weekly phlebotomy is recommended, 500 ml each and serum iron concentration should be kept below 150 µg/100 ml and serum ferritin level should be kept in the low normal range. Chelation therapy with deforoxamine is impractical, but can be used when venesectone therapy is not possible. The cornerstone of treatment for Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is the removal of copper. The most effective copper chelating agent is D-penicillamine. Numerous studies have shown that patients with this once-fatal disease can expect functional recovery of both liver and neurological abnormalities. The starting dose is 500 mg 3 times a day, increasing to 3 to 4 g daily until adequate cupriuresis is achieved. One third of patients develop side effects such as rash, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, arthralgia and lymphadenopathy. Complications of this treatment can be managed with temporary withdrawal followed by resumption of steroid coverage. (Mattar - Sao Paulo)",,"Powell, L. W.;Tolman, K. G.",1979,,,0,0,

The antagonistic effect of zinc sulfate on copper resorption, which improves clinical status, was described by Schouwink in 1961 before this patient. The patient had been using oral zinc sulfate for approximately 1.5 years at that time. No changes in Kayser-Fleischer rings and ceruloplasmin levels were noted.

Lenses incubated with 20, 50, or 100 µM copper became cloudy, the turbidity increased with increasing copper concentration and was more intense at the equator than in the central region. With increasing copper concentration, glucose utilization was inhibited, lens sodium and water contents increased, and lens potassium decreased. At 10 µM, the copper concentration at which opacification first became observable, glucose utilization was inhibited by 20%, and the lens sodium content was tripled compared to control lenses. Copper (100 µM) inhibited active transport of <sup>86</sup>Rb and increased its passive transport significantly more than cultured lenses inhibited glucose utilization.

3122,Wilson's disease presenting as chronic active hepatitis,"17 patients (8 males and 9 females) with Wilson's disease (mean age 12 years) presented with clinical, biochemical and morphological features similar to chronic active hepatitis. Neurological dysfunction was evident in only 3 patients (mean age, 18 years); Kayser-Fleischer rings were absent in 8 patients with severe hepatic impairment and serum ceruloplasmin was normal in 3 patients. Smooth muscle, mitochondrial antibodies and HbsAg were negative in all patients. Fifteen patients had cirrhosis at the first liver biopsy. Despite treatment with D-penicillamine (1.0 to 3.0 g daily), 4 patients died of fulminant hepatic failure due to hemolysis within 3 weeks of diagnosis. Five more patients died within 2 years due to hepatic failure (3 patients), varicose bleeding (1 patient), and lupus-like syndrome (1 patient). A sustained improvement was observed in 8 patients who were in good condition (mean survival time, 7 years) with near-normal liver function tests and inactive liver histology. Patients with Wilson's disease presenting as chronic active hepatitis often exhibit atypical features: Kayser-Fleischer rings and neurological dysfunction may be absent, and both serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper may be normal, especially if severe hepatocellular necrosis is present. As a result, diagnosis of Wilson's disease may be delayed, and once cirrhosis occurs, this form of Wilson's disease may have a poor prognosis despite D-penicillamine therapy. Therefore, it is important to exclude the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in all patients with chronic active hepatitis and chronic parenchymal liver disease of unknown etiology, in order to achieve optimum treatment response to D-penicillamine.",,"Scott, J.;Gollan, J.

3148,Treatment of hepato-cerebral degeneration (Wilson's disease). [German],"Among the diseases with extrapyramidal disorder syndrome, hepatocerebral degeneration (synonyms are Morbus Wilson and Strumpell-Westphalic Pseudosclerosis) occupies a special place, where the cause of the problems lies in a recessively inherited metabolic disorder. It can be effectively affected by the resulting drug therapy and diet. The disorder is extremely rare: it is estimated that only a total of 100 patients across the entire GFR need such specific treatment. A key feature of the antibody regimen lies in the transition to a low copper diet. If possible, copper intake should not exceed I mg daily. In the last 15 years, D-Penicillamine (Metalcaptase) has been the agent of choice for the medicated treatment of hepatocerebral degeneration. The substance activates the copper stored in the organs and prevents its further storage, so that the copper is converted into soluble chelate complexes, which can then be excreted through the kidneys. The substance should be administered slowly; as a rule, 0.9 to 1.8 g per day is required. In experiments, an antagonism was established between D-Penicillamine and vitamin B-6 (Pyridoxine). As a result, hidden vitamin B-6 deficiencies were observed under D-Penicillamine treatment. In conclusion, supplementation of 40 mg of vitamin B-6 daily is recommended, especially in patients who show signs of latent or overt hypovitaminosis before starting treatment (21 references).",,"Fouquet, H.;Broser, F.",1977,,,0,0,

The most common radiological abnormality was an overall increase in radiolucency interpreted as skeletal demineralization (21 cases), followed by early osteoarthrosis (8 cases). Changes in the spine were common and included osteochondritis, decreased intervertebral joint spaces, osteoarthrosis, and a tendency to square the vertebral bodies. Other bone changes included raised irregularity of the femoral trochanters, osteochondritis dissecans of the knees, osteophytic spurs at the bone ends, and tongue-like osteophyte bundles at the articular margins. Symptoms associated with these radiological abnormalities included back pain and stiffness with limited range of motion, pain and stiffness in the knees, hips, and ankles, and sensitivity to pressure on the edges of the affected joints.

3154,Renal lesion in Wilson's disease. Electron microscopic findings in hepatic glomerulosclerosis and electron microanalysis of copper in renal lesion (in Japanese). [Japanese],"Kidney and liver biopsies of 2 patients with abnormal urine findings were studied with light, fluorescent and electron microscopy in addition to electron microanalysis. A 10-year-old boy had cirrhosis of the liver with marked vacuolar degeneration. Percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed twice, before and after D-penicillamine administration. The kidney showed glomerulosclerosis. Light microscopy showed a marked increase in mesangial matrix with slight cell proliferation and focal thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Electron microscopy confirmed these findings and showed a so-called ""moth-eaten appearance"" as well as electron-dense deposits in the subendothelial areas and mesangial matrix. Thickening and mesangial interposition were evident in GBM. IgG and IgM were present in the glomeruli; IgG and fibrinogen were seen in the mesangial areas. After that penicillin treatment, granular staining of IgG, IgM, IgA and fibrinogen was seen in the mesangium and throughout the GBM. Electron microanalysis showed a high copper concentration in lysosome-like dense bodies in proximal tubule cells. No copper was obtained from the glomeruli. The second case was a 6-year-old boy. IgA increased in the blood; C<inf>3</inf> and C<inf>4</inf> were normal. By light microscopy, the findings in the glomeruli were not much different from that in case 1: an increase in the mesangial matrix and thickening of the GBM were evident ultrastructurally. But there were no electron-dense deposits and no 'moth-eaten look'. By immunofluorescence, only IgG stained weakly in the mesangial area and along the glomerular capillary walls. Copper could not be shown. The results lead to some hypotheses. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia and low serum levels of complement components may result from liver failure (case 1). Morphological glomerular changes were not directly due to serum copper deposition in tissue according to copper microanalysis; although no antigens have been identified, immunological mechanisms may play a role. Lysosomes have a specific function in copper metabolism of the proximal tubular epithelium. Although hyperimmunoglobulinemia and low serum C<inf>3</inf> and C<inf>4</inf> levels were found only in case 1, it can be considered that they may play a role in the pathogenesis of nephrosclerosis.",,"Fukunishi, Y.;Fujisawa, S.;Shimizu, S.",1976,,,0,0,

In subjects receiving D penicillamine for the treatment of cystinuria and rheumatoid arthritis, 4 and 8 percent of the dose were methylated, respectively. The total percentage of dose of D penicillamine discarded (as cysteine penicillamine plus penicillamine disulfide plus S methyl D penicillamine) was 40 percent and 34 percent in cystinuria and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Findings in the two cases of Wilson's disease were similar to those in rheumatoid arthritis. In studies of four cystinuria patients, an average of 12 percent of administered penicillamine was recovered in the feces, primarily as penicillamine disulfide. However, only 42 to 53 percent of the dose was identified in the urine and faeces, so that about 50 percent of the drug administered was not disclosed.

3166,D penicillamine-induced glomerulonephritis. [German],"total of 12 patients with proteinuria after D-penicillamine treatment during the year were examined by clinical, serological and kidney biopsy (light microscopy, immunohistology, transmission and scanning electronic microscopy). Light microscopic, immunohistological and electron microscopic evaluations were performed independently in 3 different institutes. In one table, the renal symptoms of the patients at the time of kidney biopsy were summarized, and in a second table, the degree of proteinuria was compared with the histological diagnoses. A 'mesangioproliferative' glomerulonephritis was found in all cases, somewhat resembling a LE nephritis. The interstitium contained infiltrates of lymphocyte and plasma cells, usually hyaline vacuoles, and foam cells as expression of lipoid nephrosis. There was no indication of the presence of an amyloidosis. Immunohistology corresponded to a picture of immune complex nephritis. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an uneven thickening of the basement membrane of the glomerulus. Neither extensive thickening of this membrane, as in typical membranous glomerulonephritis, nor protrusions resembling spikes were found. The mesangial matrix was expanded with increased cell proliferation. Scanning electron microscopy showed partial shrinkage and disruption of podocyte processes with bud-like or shell-shaped growths, especially in cases with strong proteinuria. Podocytic changes are probably nonspecific. The clinical course of the disease was favorable. On the basis of renal biopsies (sometimes mesangial cell proliferation and increase in PAS-positive matrix substances) D-penicillamine glomerulopathy is considered the specific form of 'mesangioproliferative' glomerulonephritis because as a rule all glomeruli have undergone inflammatory changes and electron microscopy shows a relatively strong showed proliferation. This contradicts the classification of this LE-like nephropathy among typical forms of membranous or perimembranous glomerulonephritis, as well as regressive thickening of the basement membrane with subepithelial deposits. Etiologically, this D-penicillamine glomerulonephritis is unlikely to be a drug-induced immune complex nephritis similar to golden nephropathy. In favor of this assumption: immunohistological picture with IgG and complement deposits, periglomerular and periarteriolar round cell infiltrations, and obvious lack of dose dependence. Antibodies to D-penicillamine can be demonstrated, but their pathogenetic significance is unclear. The higher prevalence of kidney injury by D-penicillamine in diseases with normal copper metabolism compared to Wilson's disease may possibly be explained by the less immunogenic effect of D-penicillamine after chelation with copper.",,"Brass, H.;Genth, E.;Hartl, P.

However, the negative side effects of this drug are associated not only with its allergenicity, but also with its effect on connective tissue, and possibly with the chelation of heavy metals. Since the side effects of penicillamine are common and the drug is used in the treatment of many diseases, the following case is presented. A 41-year-old patient with hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) treated with penicillamine for 15 years developed small white papules at the vascular access sites and surgical sutures in the antecubital fossa. Histologically, these papules showed connective tissue degeneration in the dermis. The changes were most likely due to penicillamine's effect on new connective tissue formation at sites of injury. The patient also developed wrinkles on the skin of her face and neck during penicillamine therapy, and these changes were at least partially attributed to the effects of this drug on connective tissue.",,"Greer, K.

3173,Diagnostic application of specific anti-procollagen serums. I. Analysis of skin biopsies,"Antisera were prepared against mature calf skin collagen (type I) and a polypeptide characteristic for calf skin procollagen (type I) in rabbits. The second peptide binds to the amino terminal end of the alpha chains and is cleaved by a specific enzyme, procollagen peptidase, during normal maturation. For this study, procollagen was isolated from the skin of calves with congenital procollagen peptidase deficiency, a disease called dermatosparaxis. Antisera for mature collagen and procollagen were made specific by appropriate immunoadsorption procedures. These serums show a strong cross-reactivity with human skin collagen and procollagen. Anti-collagen sera produce indirect immunofluorescent staining of the entire dermis, whereas anti-procollagen sera only react with the uppermost dermal layer (stratum papillare) of unfixed frozen sections of normal human skin biopsies. Frozen unfixed skin biopsy sections from 50 patients with various diseases were analyzed in indirect immunofluorescence tests with antiprocollagen serums. In 19 cases, material from unaffected skin areas was also available for study. Skin from patients with connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, scleroderma) responds like normal skin. Extensive subepithelial procollagen fluorescent zones are seen in the skin taken from patients with psoriasis vulgaris and lichen planus. Keloids show very weak or no procollagen immunofluorescence in a few cases. A normal procollagen immunofluorescence pattern reappeared in 3 cases studied with long-term local corticoid therapy. Biopsies from one case of Wilson's disease and one case of epidermolysis bullosa under long-term treatment with D penicillamine were also devoid of reactivity with anti-procollagen serums.

While all previously untreated patients with Wilson's disease have died, they can now return to almost normal health; they can live a normal life and a normal life span provided that early diagnosis and treatment are started before irreparable damage to vital organs occurs. The purpose of this article is to remind the clinician when to suspect Wilson's disease in children, how to diagnose or exclude, and how to treat the patient after diagnosis.",,"Sass Kortsak, A.",1975,,,0,0,
3193,Late adult onset Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration). report of a case,"Wilson's disease usually begins in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. The clinical picture of hepatic dysfunction without central nervous system dysfunction is more typical for the disease in a child or adolescent than in an adult. We present a male case of 55 years of age at disease onset, with hepatic complications of Wilson's disease, and without clinical evidence of central nervous system disease. All patients with chronic hepatitis (chronic active liver disease) or cirrhosis of unknown etiology should be screened for the possibility of Wilson's disease. This screening should include slit lamp biomicroscopy for Kayser Fleischer rings, determination of serum ceruloplasmin concentrations, and measurement of copper excretion in 24-hour urine. If the diagnosis is in doubt, either a radio-copper kinetic study using <sup>64</sup>Cu or <sup>67</sup>Cu, or if the patient's condition permits, a liver biopsy with hepatic copper concentration should be performed. The rubean stain of liver tissue for copper is not reliable in diagnosing or excluding Wilson's disease.",,"Fitzgerald, M. A.;Gross, J. B.;Goldstein, N. P.;Wahner, H. W.;McCall, J. T.",1975,,,0,0,
3194,Molecular biology of copper. A circular dichroism study on thionine and penicillamine copper complexes.,"Chicken liver Cd was isolated from 1 500 g chickens pretreated with Zn thionein (metallothionein), Cd. Native Cd, Zn thionein contained 9 g of metal atoms per 12,000 g of protein. When Cu(CH<inf>3</inf>CN)<inf>4</inf>ClO<inf>4</inf> is added, all Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup >2+ </sup> has been successfully modified. 15 g of Cu<sup>+</sup> atoms from the acetonitrile perchlorate complex were bound to the protein. Due to the absence of aromatic amino acid residues, thionein has unique ultraviolet and circular dichroism properties. At 250 nm (A<inf>250</inf> x A<inf>280</inf><sup>-1</sup> = 23.9) the shoulder of the ultraviolet spectrum is shifted to 275 nm (A<inf >250</inf> x A<inf>280</inf><sup>-1</sup> = 1.6). No significant absorption was detected in the visible region. The conformational changes of the protein fragment were much more visible in the circular dichroism spectra. Titration with Cu(CH<inf>3</inf>CN)<inf>2</inf><sup>+</sup> resulted in three new Cotton effects: 257.5 nm (<sup>+</sup> sup> sup>), 350 nm (+) and 301 nm (-). The negative Cotton effect of the original metallothionein at 239 nm was completely offset. The binding strength of copper with thioneine is extraordinarily high: it survives proton treatment up to pH 1.9. Replacement of Cd<sup>2+</sup> by Cu<sup>+</sup> using Cd thionein formed at pH 2.2 resulted in the same circular dichroism properties as observed for Cu thionein. D Penicillamine proved to be a suitable model for metal-free thionine as the redox reactions and polymerization of the sterically hindered thiol residue are known to be slow. The correlation of circular dichroism properties of the copper complex using thionein or D penicillamine was surprisingly high. Cu(I) D penicillamine circular dichroism measurements revealed Cotton effects at 255 nm (+), 280 nm (+), and 355 nm (-). When the red violet mixture Cu(I) Cu(II) D penicillamine complex was examined, cotton bands were seen in the visible region at 425 nm (-) and 495 nm (+). In many blue copper enzymes, copper is assumed to be in the vicinity of cysteine and aromatic amino acid residues, which are known to play an important role in electron transfer. This is not the case with Cu tione, which would explain the many different properties of this copper protein. It is very tempting to conclude that the sterically hindered SH group of D penicillamine reacts specifically with excess copper, similar to Cuthionein. This phenomenon may explain the significant success of D penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Rupp, H.;Voelter, W.;Weser, U.",1975,,,0,0,

3199,Wilson's disease. Clinical and laboratory findings in 40 patients,"The clinical and laboratory findings of 40 (16 male, 24 female) Chinese patients with Wilson's disease (WD) are described. The mean age of onset of symptoms in 31 symptomatic patients was 12.2 years for women and 22.1 years for men. Eight of the 10 people presenting with symptoms after the age of 15 were male. Eighteen of them died of their disease at an average age of 19.1 years. Kayser Fleischer rings were present in 37 patients. Half had splenomegaly and hyperpigmentation of the shins. Bleeding and easy bruising occurred in 17 of them. Less common symptoms and signs; edema, arthralgia, jaundice, palpable liver and ascites. Neurological symptoms were common. More than half of the patients had at least one of the following: poor coordination, psychological disorder, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, face masks, gait disturbance, rigidity, dementia, dystonia, hypertonia, and drooling. Pancytopenia was a common finding associated with splenomegaly. Hyperchloremia, hypokalemia, and low serum carbon dioxide content associated with a constant alkaline pH of the urine suggested renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Nearly all patients had decreased serum uric acid and increased uric acid clearance. Hyper aminoaciduria occurred in the majority of patients treated with penicillamine for less than 1 year. High serum creatinine and BUN and low creatinine clearance were found. Fasting blood sugars were normal and glycosuria was not detected. Serum calcium decreased and calcium clearance increased. Serum inorganic phosphates were 60% low and phosphorus clearance increased by 36%. Four patients had bone deformity. Prothrombin time was the most common abnormal liver function test. 75% had BSP retention, 36% had elevated SGOT; SGPT 14%. Serum proteins, albumin and transferrin were reduced by approximately 1/4 and complement was decreased in 3 out of 16. IgG and IgM were occasionally elevated. Total serum bilirubin increased in 1/3, direct fraction of bilirubin increased in 1/4. Urinary abnormalities are often included; pH > 6.5, specific gravity of 1.015 or less, microscopic hematuria and minimal proteinuria. Classical abnormalities of copper metabolism; hypoceruloplasminemia, hypocuprinemia, hypercuprinuria, and increased hepatic copper concentration were almost always present.

3200,Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration). [German],"There is a low level of ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease, as a result of which copper is transported loosely bound to albumin and released to different tissues, and some of it is excreted in the urine. The cause is likely a genetic defect that allows increased copper absorption due to ceruloplasmin deficiency. At the forefront of internal damage in this disease complex are liver cirrhosis and kidney damage. Multi-organ involvement gives numerous clinical symptoms such as hepatocerebral form, abdominal or hepatic type, and pseudosclerosis or neurological type. Apart from these, there are changes in coagulation, bones and joints. His main laboratory interest is copper metabolism.

In one patient not treated with penicillamine, the estimated copper excretion in total body sweat during sauna bathing was 18 cups. In 6 patients taking oral penicillamine (1 g per day), the estimated copper excretion in total body sweat during sauna bathing averaged 106 cups (range = 43 to 179). This study shows that sweating may be an important pathway of copper excretion in patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine. The thermal induction of sweating through a sauna bath may serve as a therapeutic adjunct to the conventional treatment of Wilson's disease, possibly through a low copper diet and penicillamine.",,"Sunderman Jr, F.

3205,Lupus induced by D penicillamine during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Two cases and immunological studies during treatment. [French],"Based on 2 observations of lupus erythematosus induced by administration of D penicillamine during treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, the authors provide a systematic study of the biological characteristics of lupus during such treatment. The first observation involved a 45-year-old woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. At 11 months, there was an episode of muscle pain in which LE cells and antinuclear antibodies emerged. Clinical symptoms disappeared when treatment was discontinued. The second case was a 53-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis who had facial eruptions and antinuclear antibodies at 11 months. The rash disappeared when treatment was stopped, but resumption of therapy subsequently resulted in the rash and reappearance of antinuclear antibodies. In the systematic study involving 25 patients (including the 2 patients described above), the authors found that with the use of indirect immunofluorescence in liver sections, antinuclear antibodies were absent in 15 patients at baseline. During treatment, 10 of these adverse cases became positive, usually only to a small extent. Of the 10 cases that were positive at baseline, 3 became negative during treatment, and 3 increased significantly. With the aid of the latex agglutination test, it was demonstrated that all 25 patients did not have anti-DPN antibodies. Observations are comparable to those described in the literature on the treatment of Wilson's disease or cystinuria. The absence of immunological abnormalities prior to treatment in the two cases described indicates that lupus was induced by rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The extent or frequency of formation of antinuclear antibodies during D penicillamine treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in about half of the cases is comparable to the results obtained with the use of procainamide or hydralazine. Lupus induced by D penicillamine appears to be extremely rare, even in cases of rheumatoid arthritis in which antinuclear antibodies are positive. The presence of such antibodies does not appear to be sufficient to contraindicate the use of D penicillamine against rheumatoid arthritis.",,"Crouzet, J.;Camus, J. P.;Leca, A.

A Kayser Fleischer ring is always present as early as the first neurological signs, making diagnosis easier. However, although penicillamine therapy has significantly improved neurological prognosis, its effect on major liver lesions is less clear and tolerance is not always perfect. Therefore, the importance of diagnosis in the presymptomatic stage, which can only be made by evaluating the serum ceruloplasmin levels in siblings of the patients, is to measure the copper levels in the tissues by liver biopsy in those with low ceruloplasmin levels.",,"Pepin, B.;Haguenau, M.",1974,,,0,0,
3208,D Treatment of chronic aggressive hepatitis with penicillamine (Slovene). [Slovene],"penicillamine, already proven effective in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma, is now entering the field of chronic aggressive hepatitis (CAD). A non-specific mesenchymal reaction with an accentuated collagen synthesis represents the essential event in CAD both in collagenoses and via indirect blockade of cysteine, D penicillamine inhibits collagen synthesis and consequent fibroplasia. Contraindications to such therapy known so far are renal failure and disorders of the hematopoietic system. D penicillamine was given to 10 patients with CAD who did not respond to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs because the histological picture of the liver did not improve. All but 2 patients (all younger than 45 years, mean age 29.4) had significant subjective improvement and normalization of laboratory findings. Seven patients can be biooptically controlled. In 3 patients, the histological picture improved enough to demonstrate practical clearing of the morbid process. Aggression symptoms disappeared in 2 patients, one remained unchanged, and one showed even stronger aggression in the histological picture. Undesirable side effects in the form of skin and mucous membrane changes were observed in 3 patients. A trial with D penicillamine seems justified, especially in AuAg-positive subjects with CAD for whom corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy may be dangerous or have failed.

Nine patients did not acidify their urine to pH 5.2 after ammonium chloride loading. Tm for bicarbonate was low after bicarbonate loading in only two patients, but the bicarbonate excretion threshold was markedly reduced in half of the patients (ie, excretion greater than muEq/min at a plasma level of less than 22 mEq/l). Mean bicarbonate excretion was high at normal plasma bicarbonate levels but less than 3% of the filtered load in all but two patients. These data suggest that two patients had type II or proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and an additional seven patients had gradient defects or distal RTA.

3231,Pathogenesis and evolution of Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease can be defined as an autosomal recessive disease characterized by excessive copper deposition, particularly in the liver, kidneys, brain, and cornea, eventually leading to liver disease, proximal renal tubular reabsorption abnormalities, basal ganglia disease, and the characteristic Kayser Fleischer cornea. rings. The metabolic abnormality is most likely an abnormal processing of copper by the liver, resulting in decreased bile copper excretion and copper accumulation in the body. The biochemical nature of liver impairment in copper metabolism is unknown, but removal of copper from the body by chelation therapy is followed by a dramatic reversal of all manifestations of the disease. This response to chelation therapy can be taken as evidence that the clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease are due to the harmful effects of excessive copper accumulation in the tissues. A concept of disease is presented that explains the variability of clinical manifestations as successive stages in the natural evolution of the disease. According to this concept, copper accumulates in the liver until a certain critical level is reached. Copper is then released into the blood and progressive copper deposition occurs in the brain. Neurological disease occurs after copper in the brain reaches a critical level, and if copper accumulation is not reversed with chelation therapy, progressive neurological disease ends the disease.",,"Cartwright, G.

3237,Trace elements and skin pigmentation,"Of the 50 or more trace elements known to exist in the body, zinc offers the most interesting possibilities for its relationship with melanin. Hyperpigmented skin lesions have been reported in patients with trace element metabolism abnormalities such as Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis. Although elevated serum copper levels have been found in a number of hyperpigmentary conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and melanosis, that accompany pregnancy or oral contraceptive intake, many other conditions with hypercuprema are not associated with pigmentary changes. A recent vitiligo study found no evidence of copper deficiency either in the skin or serum, while serum zinc levels were significantly reduced. However, any speculation regarding the role of trace elements in vitiligo would have to account for the structural defect underlying the absence of melanin. Heavy metals can cause skin discoloration in various ways. Melanosis has long been associated with the overuse of drugs containing heavy metals such as arsenic, bismuth, gold or silver. In these cases, there is an increase in melanin in the basal cell layer and dermal melanophages. Hyperpigmentation from the use of mercury in cosmetic creams is probably more common than you think. Particles of metal can contribute to skin color and can often be shown directly in cross-sections. The use of EDTA in skin complications following gold therapy is advocated by the Bureau (1967) given the renewed interest of rheumatologists in prescribing this heavy metal. The authors' findings suggest that gold can be retained by the skin for a significant period of time after administration and therefore such an approach may be justified in patients with reduced gold secreting ability.",,"Molokhia, M.

Sodium maleate, administered subcutaneously at doses of 50 to 400 mg/kg, reduces (significantly or a trend) copper content in the liver and kidneys. While smaller doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg do not significantly alter the toxicity of copper sulfate, the effect at higher doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg is a marked intensification of this toxicity. Sodium maleate, administered by itself at an ineffective dose of 25 mg/kg, does not alter the copper scavenging effect of penicillamine and tends to potentiate its antidotal effect.

3247,Metals: From poverty to pollution,"Lead and mercury, like many other metals, present certain health hazards: lead mainly due to ingestion of paint and plaster in slums; mercury, due to industrial discharges in inland waterways and in the form of fungicides. Environmental redistribution of such metals resulting from the activities of a growing population poses a potential ecological threat, but in most cases the data currently available is timescale of the form or appearances of biological changes that may eventually occur. Obtaining such data is an extremely complex task that requires the collaboration of science, industry and government, but it is clearly an urgent necessity. The author presents a review of the polluting effects of lead and mercury and outlines the steps that will be needed to develop better analytical methods. Among the recommendations presented in this paper are the following: First, long-term trends in the redistribution of environmental metals and their accumulation rates should be simultaneously investigated and studied and projected when identifying local pollution problems. Second, the investigation of the effects of metals on biological systems should be expanded and more sensitive toxicity signals sought to be developed. In particular, investigations of the biological consequences of long-term, low-dose metal exposure should be supported and matrices developed that reflect and allow assessment of metal ion imbalance and related biological antagonisms. Third, to support such efforts, researchers should strive for better analytical approaches that are sensitive, fast, and accurate.",,"Ulmer, D. D.",1973,,,0,0,

Comparison of tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in a double-blind study of the treatment of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease.,"Randomized, double-blind, controlled, 2-arm study of DESIGNA in 48 patients with the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease. Patients received trientine hydrochloride 500 mg twice daily or 20 mg tetrathiomolybdate 3 times daily with meals and 20 mg 3 times daily between meals for 8 weeks. All patients were given 50 mg of zinc twice a day. The patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with weekly evaluation of neurological and speech functions; Discharged taking 50 mg of zinc 3 times daily and returning for annual follow-up. SETTING UP A university hospital referral setting. PATIENTS Primarily patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease presenting with neurological symptoms and who have not been treated with an anticopper drug for more than 4 weeks. INTERVENTION Treatment with trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESNeurological function was assessed by semi-quantitative neurological and speech examinations. Drug side effects were assessed by blood cell counts and biochemical measurements. RESULTS: 6 of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm suffered neurological deterioration (P<.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had side effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had greater transaminase elevations. Anemia had an adverse effect in one patient taking trientine. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, with 3 showing neurological deterioration at baseline. Neurological and speech recovery was quite good during the 3-year follow-up period.

3253,Time course of changes in plasma levels of trace elements after thrombolysis during the acute phase of myocardial infarction in humans,"It has been suggested that the damage caused by reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium may be due in part to the cytotoxic effects of free oxygen radicals. Since various trace elements are involved in many of the reactions leading to free radical generation, we measured plasma copper, zinc, selenium and iron levels: 1.6 after onset of myocardial infarction (G1) in 18 patients (mean age 60 years) exposed to thrombolytic therapy; 2. In 16 patients (mean age 50, G2) with coronary artery disease but no history of previous myocardial infarction (MI); and 3. 50 healthy volunteers were divided into two subgroups according to age (mean age 33, G3 and 55 years old, G4). Plasma myosin levels were used to quantitatively estimate the size of the infarcted mass. Plasma trace element levels were measured in blood samples after centrifugation and storage at -80 degrees C. The main results are as follows: In G1 patients exposed to thrombolysis, a significant myosin release in plasma was measured and a peak myosin release was measured. D6 (95 microU/L versus 1678 at H0). In these G1 patients post-MI: 1. A significant increase in plasma copper levels was observed from day 4 post-infarction to day 10 (x1.15 relative to baseline data in H0); 2. A decrease in plasma zinc levels was observed, with a maximum of 12 hours after initiation of thrombolytic therapy; 3. A decrease in selenium concentration was observed in G1 and G2 patients compared to control groups (80% of G3 and G4 values); and 4. A significant decrease in plasma iron levels was observed at G1 (67.8% of G3 and G4 control values) and was significant from H0 to day 7 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this study underlined the evolution of plasma trace element levels over time and the potential prognostic implications of such variations in the follow-up of patients undergoing thrombolysis after an MI.",,"Pucheu, S;Coudray, C;Vanzetto, G;Favier, A;Machecourt, J;Leiris, J",1995,,10.1007/BF02790115,0,0,
3254,The role of vitamin E supplementation on serum copper and zinc levels in patients with G6PD deficiency and hemolytic anemia.,"Its vitamin scavenges free radicals and can prevent the destruction of RBC in Glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient hemolytic anemia, where copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) changes can act as additional contributing factors for hemolysis. In this study, changes in serum Cu and Zn and the role of vitamin E supplementation in these changes were observed in patients with hemolytic anemia with G6PD deficiency. This study was conducted at Dhaka Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Department of Physiology between July 2005 and June 2006. For this, 102 people between the ages of 5-40 of both genders were included in the study. Of these, 68 were G6PD-deficient patients, 34 in the supplemented group and 34 in the non-supplemented group. The supplemented group received vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU/day for adults and 400 IU/day for children < or 12 years of age (4 times daily) for 60 consecutive days. To observe baseline data (healthy control) as well as for comparison, 34 apparently healthy subjects with normal G6PD levels were matched for age and sex. All patients with G6PD deficiency were selected from Hematology, BSMMU, Dhaka's External Patient Department (OPD) and all healthy subjects from personal contact. Blood G6PD levels were determined by spectrophotometric method, serum Cu, Zn levels were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. Serum total protein, albumin, globulin and A:G ratio were performed by standard laboratory techniques to monitor the presence of binding proteins. All parameters were measured on day 1 of their 1st visit and also on day 60 in the missing groups. Data analysis was done with the appropriate statistical method. On day 1, serum Cu was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the G6PD deficient groups compared to the healthy control, but serum Zn, total protein, albumin, and A/G ratio were significantly lower (p<0.001). After vitamin E supplementation, the values of these parameters were comparable to the values of the healthy control in the supplemented group compared to the values of the pre-fortified and non-supplemented groups at both day 1 and day 60.

3255,Effect of intragastric pH on oral zinc acetate and zinc oxide absorption in young healthy volunteers.,"METHODS: After 9 hours of fasting, 10 healthy subjects (5 males and 5 females) received a single oral dose of 50 mg of elemental zinc as acetate or oxide salt under conditions of high or low intragastric pH. A Heidelberg capsule pH detector-transmitter was used to continuously monitor intragastric pH in all phases. During the high pH phases, a single oral dose of famotidine 40 mg oral suspension was administered before zinc to raise the intragastric pH above 5. Intragastric pH < or = 3 was maintained during the low pH phases. RESULTS: The mean plasma zinc area underneath. curves 524, 378, 364, and 66 micrograms xh for zinc acetate at low pH (AL), zinc acetate at high pH (AH), zinc oxide at low pH (OL), and zinc oxide at high pH (OH) was. /dL, respectively. The highest plasma concentrations of zinc occurred with the acetate salt at low intragastric pH, while the lowest plasma concentrations occurred with the oxide salt at high intragastric pH. The importance of pH in dissolving these salts has been confirmed by in vitro tests. Twenty-four hour urinary zinc excretion was highest for AL phase and lowest for OH phase. CONCLUSION: This study shows that intragastric pH and salt solubility-dissolution are important in oral absorption of zinc. Specifically, the oxide salt is not a zinc salt suitable for use in patients with high intragastric pH. BACKGROUND: Zinc is an essential nutrient and is essential for maintaining many physiological processes. Mineral supplements that provide physiological doses of zinc can be used when dietary zinc is insufficient. Zinc is also used in pharmacological doses to treat zinc deficiency and diseases such as Wilson's disease and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Although there are several zinc salts available, they are unequal in solubility, which is thought to be a key factor in zinc absorption. In addition, the solubility of salts is affected by pH, which can vary between pH 1 and 7 under various physiological conditions in the stomach. The objectives of this 2-way 4-stage crossover study were to evaluate the effect of high (> or = 5) and low (< or = 3) intragastric pH on zinc absorption from acetate and oxide salt in young healthy volunteers. .",,"Henderson, Lm;Brewer, Gj;Dressman, Jb;Swidan, Sz;DuRoss, Dj;Adair, Ch;Barnett, Jl;Berardi, Rr",1995,,10.1177/0148607195019005393,0,0,
3256,Trientine versus tetrathiomolybdate in the initial treatment of neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Initial management of the neurological presentation of Wilson's disease is problematic. Penicillamine, used for years in most patients, causes neurological deterioration in up to half of such patients, and half of those who do get worse never get better. Ideal for maintenance therapy, zinc is too slow for these acutely ill patients. We developed tetrathiomolybdate (TM) for these types of patients and it did well in open-label studies. Trientine, another commercially available copper inhibitor approved for patients with penicillamine intolerance, has not been tested in such patients. Here we report a double-blind trial of trientine versus TM in a neurologically presenting Wilson disease patient. Design and Methods: The study was a double-blind design in which patients received either TM plus zinc or trientine plus zinc for 8 weeks* Patients were accepted if they presented with neurological symptoms from Wilson's disease and were not treated for a longer period of time. 4 weeks with penicillamine or trientine. Patients were followed in hospital for 8 weeks of treatment with weekly semiquantitative neurological and speech examinations to assess possible neurological deterioration. They also had weekly blood and urine tests done. They continued on zinc maintenance therapy upon discharge from the hospital and returned at annual intervals for 3 years for further evaluation. Results: Twenty-three patients entered the trientine arm and 6 reached the criteria for neurological deterioration, while 25 patients were recruited to the TM arm and only 1 worsened (p < 0.05). Side effects were seen in one patient using trientine, and in 7 patients receiving TM. All adverse events were mild. Four patients in the Trientine arm died during follow-up, 3 showed neurological deterioration at baseline, 2 patients in the TM arm died. Neurological and speech recovery was good for 3 years in patients who did not deteriorate or die.

3257,Zinc therapy for Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease,"Zinc is effective in all phases of Wilson's disease treatment and is the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy. It acts by blocking the absorption of copper at the intestinal level and is devoid of the side effects of the other two anticancer drugs. Zinc is approved in the USA, Europe and Japan for the maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease. We will discuss the appropriate dosing, monitoring, and follow-up of Wilson's disease patients treated with zinc. Because we discovered that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are zinc deficient and that zinc is crucial for neuronal functioning, we conducted a double-blind clinical trial of a new, gastro-inhibiting, 150 mg once-daily zinc tablet developed by Adeona Pharmaceuticals for 6 months. in AD patients. Zinc-treated patients over 70 years of age had statistically significantly better scores than the placebo group in the two cognition scoring systems (ADAS-Cog, p= 0.037 and CDR-SOB, p= 0.03), suggesting that zinc therapy was effective in elderly patients with AD. shows that.",,"Brewer, Gj",2011,,,0,0,1733.0

Methods Patients >18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of WD and untreated or treated with chelation or zinc therapy for <2 years initially received 15 or 30 mg of WTX101 QD, and after 6 weeks, dosage was guided by laboratory and clinical criteria. Regular assessments included safety, liver disease status, neurological status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), and copper metabolism parameters. Results 28 patients were included in the study. At trial entry, most patients were untreated or treated with WD therapy for <28 days, only 5/28 treated for >90 days. Baseline mean non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) was elevated (3.5 mM), 25/28 had neurological signs at baseline and mean UWDRS III. it was episode 22. The modified Nazer score ranged from 1 to 5. Adverse events (AEs) included reversible liver elevation. tests (n=5, 3 related to dose escalation per protocol) and neutropenia (n=2). After the initial dose was reduced from 60 mg to 15-30 mg QD per day and dose escalation was limited to 60 mg QD, WTX101 was well tolerated with several AEs. Hepatic status (ALT, INR, and bilirubin) and modified Nazer score improved or remained stable in all patients. NCC (adjusted for molybdenum) decreased over time during treatment. Other Cu measurements (exchangeable Cu, total serum Cu, 24-hour urinary Cu excretion) show a similar copper removal pattern. UWDRS part III scores were greatly improved in patients with neurological signs or stable in those without. Daily activity status (UWDRS part II) showed a similar improvement. Summary WTX101 appears to be safe and well tolerated as initial therapy in patients with WD. Improvements were observed in liver and neurological disease, Cu metabolism and daily activity status over time with WTX101 treatment. More data is being collected. Conclusion Further clinical evaluation of WTX101 is warranted to determine its safety and efficacy for initial treatment of WD.

3259,The promise of copper-lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of previously incurable advanced cancer and in the treatment of inflammatory diseases,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) complexes copper with protein in a strong ternary complex. This complex, which contains nutritional protein, is excreted in the faeces, causing a negative copper balance. In the blood, this complex, TM, free copper, and albumin render free copper unusable and non-toxic. Developed for Wilson's disease, TM is very effective for the neurological condition for which no other drug is optimal. Reducing copper to moderate levels by TM inhibits many cytokines, with levels high enough to prevent clinical deficiency, those that promote fibrotic, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases and cancer. TM is effective in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis by inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TM is effective in mouse models of inflammatory disease involving the liver and heart and in four mouse models of immune-modulated disease. In man, TM achieved both primary endpoints in a one-year randomized controlled trial in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune attack on the bile ducts. TM shows great promise in disease areas such as fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmunity. Wherever steroids are useful, TM will be better and safer. Most excitingly, recent developments suggest that TM can treat advanced, previously incurable, metastatic cancer. Tumor growth requires angiogenesis (Folkman). Many angiogenic promoters, particularly those active at the micrometastatic cancer level, are copper dependent. IMPORTANT TIP: TM COMPLETELY INHIBITS CANCER GROWTH IN HER/2neu MOUSE GENETIC BREAST CANCER MODEL. The micro-clusters of cancer cells that were still there after one year of TM treatment failed to grow due to a lack of angiogenesis, while all controls had large cancers. Human trials ignored this clue and tried TM only against advanced cancers. These can recruit many promoters, most of which are not copper dependent, and only modest effects in these trials have generated little interest. Now, two US groups are treating metastatic cancer with TM, returning to the mouse tip. One group requires conventional suppression of no evidence of disease (NED), even though the disease is considered incurable due to micrometastases. After three years of TM, the cancer is treated with 10 different advanced metastatic cancers that were hitherto untreatable. The second group treats many patients with different metastatic cancers using TM and conventional therapy from the outset plus specific therapies that target cancer metabolic vulnerabilities. We commenced a randomized controlled trial of TM in micrometastatic osteosarcoma in dogs. It seems that TM can cure many previously hopeless cancer cases.",,"Brewer, Gj",2013,,,0,0,1531.0
3260,Zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"Introduction and Aims: AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend zinc monotherapy as treatment for asymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease (WD). However, there are few reports of zinc monotherapy for young children with asymptomatic WD. Here, we aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for young children under 10 years of age with asymptomatic WD in Japanese pediatric centers and establish criteria for appropriate maintenance therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to examine 21 children (median age 6 years, range 1-9) who met the diagnostic criteria for WD at 10 participating pediatric centers in Japan and were treated with zinc acetate alone prior to symptom onset. No additional WD sequelae such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormalities were noted. We monitored serum AST and ALT, non-ceruloplasmin serum copper, and 24-hour urine copper 1-7 years after the start of zinc monotherapy. We performed abdominal ultrasonography and evaluated clinical signs of WD, drug compliance, and adverse effects of zinc. The prescribed dose of zinc acetate for the patient less than 5 years old was 25 mg twice daily; For children 6 years of age and older, the dose was 25 mg 3 times a day. We increased the zinc dose if patients had AST/ALT > 50-70 U/L, and decreased if zinc had side effects such as iron deficiency anemia or pancytopenia. Results: AST/ALT and 24-hour urine copper were 148+/-118/234+/-151 U/L and 124+/-54 mug/day (5.8+/-2.9 cups/kg/day) at the time of diagnosis. . days), respectively. All patients continued to take zinc without any evidence of zinc toxicity. None of our 21 patients became clinically symptomatic. AST/ALT dropped significantly to 54+/-30/77+/-49 U/L (P<0.001) 1 month after initiation of therapy and mostly remained below 50 U/L for 1-7 years (AST /ALT : 33+/-7/38+/-17 and 29+/-5/34+/-6 U/L at 1 and 7 years after initiation of therapy, respectively. Twenty-four-hour urine copper dropped significantly to 49+/-21 cups/day (2.2+/-1.1 cups/kg/day; P<0.001) 6 months after the start of treatment and was mostly kept below 75 cups/day, and the study 1 to 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder (2.2+/-0.6 and 1.5+/-0.2 cups/kg/day 1 and 7 years after initiation of treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term zinc monotherapy has proven to be highly effective and safe for young children with asymptomatic WD.

The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare renal functional and structural integrity in 50 infants with IDA and 50 healthy controls, and to evaluate the relationship between IDA and oxidative stress and response to iron therapy. Methods: This is a prospective study in which peripheral blood samples were collected from all study subjects and the following laboratory investigations were performed: serum iron profile, urinary microalbumin, urinary leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), fractional sodium excretion (FeNa), serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), serum malondialdehyde (MDA), serum and urine trace elements (iron, copper, zinc, calcium and magnesium). All patients received oral iron therapy and were followed for 3 months. Results: Initial urinary marker levels were higher in patients with IDA than in controls (p < 0.05). Patients had lower pretreatment TAC and lower serum zinc and magnesium levels, as well as higher MDA and serum copper levels than controls (p < 0.05). MDA level was positively correlated with microalbumin and LAP level (p < 0.05). Urine LAP concentration correlated positively with urinary trace element concentrations (p < 0.05). While hemoglobin and ferritin levels increased, a significant decrease was observed in microalbumin, LAP, FeNa and urinary trace elements after iron treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Among study subjects, IDA had an adverse effect on kidney functional and structural integrity that could be reversed by iron therapy. Oxidative stress has played an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in IDA.

3263,Comparison of long-term therapeutic effects between succimer and penicillamine on hepatolenticular degeneration,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term effect of succimer (Suc) with penicillamine (Pen) in the treatment of hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with HLD were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n =60) Suc 750mg, po.bid. Group B (n =60) received Pen 250mg, po. qid. The duration of maintenance therapy varies between 6 months and 3 years, with an average of 1.5 years. Symptoms and therapeutic effects were evaluated with the modified Goldstein scale. RESULTS: The overall efficacy of group A at two different treatment periods was 80% and 85%, respectively, higher than group B (58% and 59%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Suc also had significant curative effects for patients who failed Pen use. Group A had fewer side effects than group B (P < 0.05). Suc and Pen can effectively and consistently increase urinary copper excretion. CONCLUSION: Suc is more effective and safer than Pen. Clinically, it may replace Pen as the first-choice drug for long-term maintenance treatment of HLD.",,"Ren, M. S.;Zhang, Z.;Wu, J. X.;Li, F.;Xue, B. C.;Yang, R. M.",1998,Dec,,1,1,
3264,Liver features of Wilson's disease,"Defective AT7B function in Wilson's disease (WD) leads to biliary copper excretion and pathological copper accumulation where it causes cellular damage, particularly in the liver and brain. Liver disease most often precedes neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Most patients with neurological or psychiatric symptoms have some degree of liver disease at the time of disease presentation. The hepatic manifestations of WD can be extremely variable. Patients with clinically asymptomatic WD are usually found by family screening or identified in routine laboratory tests. Others may have a clinical picture of chronic active hepatitis or end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis. A minority with acute liver failure, often against the background of advanced fibrosis. Complications from liver disease may be associated with portal hypertension, and concomitant liver disease may precipitate the course of liver disease. Liver cancer can occur in patients with WD, most commonly when cirrhosis and inflammation are present. The prognosis of patients with WD is excellent, especially for those who do not have cirrhosis at diagnosis, but require timely initiation of appropriate therapy specific to WD and the patient's liver disease independent of WD.",,"Boga, S.;Ala, A.;Schilsky, M.

3265,Comparison of results from empirical studies of complementary research techniques and recommendations in review methodology handbooks: a methodological review.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose and contribution of complementary research methods in systematic reviews is increasingly recognized. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential to identify studies or study data that might be missed by bibliographic database searches alone. What is less certain is how additional search methods actually work, how they are implemented, and the resulting advantages, disadvantages, and resource implications of each search method. The purpose of this study is to compare current practices of using complementary search methods with methodological guidance. METHODS: Four methodological manuals to inform systematic review practice in the UK were read and reviewed to establish up-to-date methodological guidance. Studies evaluating the use of complementary research methods were identified by scanning five bibliographic databases. Studies were included if they (1) reported the practical application of a complementary search method (descriptive), or (2) examined the usefulness of a complementary search method (analytical), or (3) included identified/discovered factors that affect the usefulness of a complementary search method. method when applied in practice. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included in this review, in addition to four methodological manuals. Studies were published between 1989 and 2016, and the publication dates of the handbooks ranged from 1994 to 2014. Five complementary research methods were reviewed: contacting study authors, citation tracking, manual search, trial records search, and web search. CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable consistency between recommended best practice (handbooks) and current practice (methodological studies) as it relates to the application of additional search methods. Methodological studies provide useful information about the effectiveness of additional research methods, often attempting to evaluate aspects of the method to improve effectiveness or efficiency. In this way, studies advance the understanding of complementary search methods.

3267,Clarifying the distinction between case series and cohort studies in systematic reviews of comparative studies: potential impact on body of evidence and workload,"It is difficult to distinguish cohort studies from case series. We propose conceptualizing cohort studies in systematic reviews of comparative studies. The main purpose of this conceptualization is to clarify the distinction between cohort studies and case series. We discuss the potential impact of the proposed conceptualization on the body of evidence and workload. All studies with exposure-based sampling aggregate multiple exposures (with at least two different exposures or exposure levels) and provide calculation of the relative risks that should be considered as a cohort. studies in systematic reviews, including nonrandomized studies. The term ""enable/can"" means that a predefined analytical comparison is not a prerequisite (ie absolute risks per group and/or a risk ratio is provided). Instead, all studies for which there is sufficient data for reanalysis to compare different exposures (for example, sufficient data in publication) are classified as cohort studies. data needed to calculate impact measures for a comparison. Consequently, more studies may be included in a systematic review. Therefore, on the one hand, the approach outlined can increase confidence in the impact estimates and strengths of the results. On the other hand, the workload will increase (for example, reanalysis as well as the risk of additional data extraction and bias assessment).",,"Mathes, T.;Pieper, D.",2017,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10.1186/s12874-017-0391-8,0,0,

3269,Wilson's disease: a review for the general pediatrician,"Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that causes impaired copper excretion in the liver and copper accumulation in various tissues due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene. The classic triad of cirrhosis is associated with neurological signs and ocular manifestation of Kayser-Fleischer rings; however, the clinical presentation can vary widely, from incidental findings of abnormal liver enzymes to acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Pediatric patients may present with subtle findings such as asymptomatic hepatomegaly, transaminitis, behavioral changes, movement disorders, or school failure. The general pediatrician may be the first to notice these symptoms and should consider Wilson's disease in their differential diagnosis. Wilson's disease can be treated with lifelong chelation or zinc therapy in patients presenting early in the disease; therefore, pediatricians should have a low threshold for referral to a pediatric hepatologist for further evaluation when suspected.

3270,Tetrathiomolybdate induces dimerization of the metal-binding domain of ATPase and inhibits platinization of the protein.,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is used clinically for the treatment of Wilson's disease by targeting the cellular copper flux protein ATP7B (WLN). Interestingly, both TM and WLN are associated with the efficacy of cisplatin, a widely used anticancer drug. Here, we show that TM induces dimerization of the metal-binding domain of ATP7B (WLN4) through a unique sulfur-bridged Mo2S6O2 cluster. TM expels copper ions from Cu-WLN4 and forms a copper-free dimer. Binding of Mo to the cysteine residues of WLN4 inhibits platinization of the protein. The reaction with multi-domain proteins indicates that TM is able to form Mo-bridged intramolecular cross-links by binding both domains in the same molecule. These results provide a structural and chemical insight into the mechanism of action of TM against ATPase and reveal the molecular mechanism by which TM reduces cisplatin resistance mediated by copper efflux proteins.",,"Fang, T.;Chen, W.;Sheng, Y.;Yuan, S.;Tang, Q.;Li, G.;Huang, G.;Su, J.;Zhang, X.;Zang, J.;Liu, Y.",2019,2022-01-14 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08102-z,0,0,

The aim of our study was to determine the performance of REC for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in a patient population with chronic liver disease. Method(s): Interchangeable serum copper levels and relative exchangeable copper were measured in a group of patients with Wilson's disease who had clinical worsening at diagnosis or due to non-compliance (group 1, n=9), and a group of stable WD patients. (group 2, n=40) and two patient groups (adult and pediatric) were followed up for non-Wilson liver diseases (group 3, n=103 and group 4, n=49, respectively). Result(s): Exchangeable serum copper (N: 0.6-1.1 mumol/L) was significantly higher in group 1 (mean 2.2+/-0.7 mumol/L) compared to the other three groups: group 2=0.9+/-0.4 mumol/L, group 3=1.2+/-0.4 mumol/L, group 4=1.1+/-0.3 mumol/L (P<0.05). Relative exchangeable copper was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 with Wilson's disease (mean 52.6% vs 43.8%) compared with patients with other liver diseases (mean 7.1% vs 5.9%) (P<0.05).

3272,Evaluation of the accuracy of exchangeable copper and relative exchangeable copper (REC) in a mouse model of Wilson's disease.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused mainly by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for toxic copper overload in the liver and central nervous system. Phenotypic heterogeneity may challenge diagnostic confirmation. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) has recently been proposed as a new marker of WD and its ratio to total serum copper (Cus), Relative Exchangeable Copper (REC = CuEXC/Cus) as a diagnostic marker. This study aimed to investigate whether this could be confirmed in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice, an engineered WD animal model. Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> (n = 137) and wild type (WT; n = 101) mice were studied under the same conditions at 6-8, 20, 39 or 50 weeks of age. Twenty-four Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice received D-penicillamine treatment at 39 to 50 weeks of age. Serum and liver [histology and intrahepatic copper (IHCu)] data were evaluated. All serum and liver data were normal in the WT group. A chronic injury developed in Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> livers from isolated moderate inflammation (6-8 weeks: 16/33 = 48%) to inflammatory fibrosis with cirrhosis (50 weeks: 25/25 = 100% and 16). /25 = 64% respectively). Cus and CuEXC increased by week 39, while IHCu and REC were stable with increasing age and much higher than in WT mice (mean +/- SD: 669 +/- 269 vs. 13 +/- 3 cups/g dry liver and 39 +/- 12 vs 11 +/- 3% respectively). A cutoff of 20% for REC provided a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100%, regardless of gender, age, or use of D-penicillamine. Eleven weeks of 100 mg/kg D-penicillamine reduced liver fibrosis (p = 0.001), IHCu (p = 0.026), and CuEXC (p = 0.175). In conclusion, this study validates REC as a WD diagnostic marker in a mouse model of chronic liver disease induced by copper overload. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of CuEXC, particularly for monitoring the development of WD during treatment. Copyright © 2018",,"Heissat, S.;Harel, A.;Um, K.;Brunet, A.

Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a copper chelator for the treatment of Wilson's disease and reduces the severity of autoimmune arthritis in mice. Purpose(s): In this report, we evaluated the effects of TM in a mouse model for psoriasis. Method(s): A murine model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis was used. We performed immunohistochemistry staining and ELISA to determine cytokine levels in inflamed skin, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes. In addition, we used keratinocytes and splenocytes to test the inhibitory effects of TM on cytokine production and activation of transcription factors. Result(s): Our results showed that TM significantly reduced cumulative scores, epidermis thickness, and ki-67 expression in inflamed skin. Additionally, TM reduced skin cytokine levels and systemic inflammation. Moreover, TM suppressed activation in keratinocytes and splenocytes with reduction in Erk1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Conclusion(s): These findings are strong evidence that TM can inhibit psoriasis in the model. Copyright Â© 2018 Japanese Investigative Dermatology Association",,"Hsu, P. Y.;Yen, H. H.;Yang, T.

3274,A case report: Coexistence of Wilson's disease and oculocutaneous albinism in a Chinese patient.,"Rationale: Both Wilson's disease (WD) and Oculocutaneous Albinism (OCA) are rare autosomal recessive diseases caused by mutations on chromosomes 13 and 11, respectively. Here we report a patient with co-existing WD and OCA who presented with episodes of tremor at baseline. PATIENT CONCERNS: WD is a copper metabolism disorder. The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and brain, causing hepatic symptoms. OCA is a melanin biosynthesis disorder characterized by a general reduction in pigmentation of the eyes (oculo-), skin (-cutaneous), and hair. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of WD was confirmed by neurological symptoms, metabolism tests, and MRI scans. Interestingly, the patient also had very fair skin, blond hair and eyebrows, dark brown eyelashes and irises. OCA was highly suspected based on these clinical findings, as the association of dermatological manifestations was rarely reported in WD. Genetic analysis was then performed and the results revealed p. (Arg778Leu) mutation 1 allele and p. (Asn1270Ser) Mutation in the other allele of the ATP7B gene confirming the diagnosis of WD; p. (D456fs) mutation in 1 allele and p. The (R299H) mutation confirms the diagnosis of OCA in the other allele of the TYR gene. His family history was positive for WD, and a 14-year-old brother was also diagnosed with WD. His family is negative for OCA and WD. INTERVENTIONS: Sodium dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) was given during hospitalization. After discharge, D-penicillamine and zinc sulfate treatment was started for long-term control. CONCLUSION(s): Postural and intentional tremor disappeared and other symptoms and signs significantly improved after treatment. LESSONS: In this study, we report the first case of a child presenting WD and OCA simultaneously, raising the possibility of a possible link between these 2 rare diseases.",,"Rao, R.;Shu, S.;Han, Y.

3275,Feature Article: Trientine selectively delivers copper to the heart and suppresses overpressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats,"Dietary copper supplementation reverses excess pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy by copper replenishment in the heart. A copper-selective chelator, trientine (triethylenetetramine [TETA]), reverses diabetes-associated left ventricular hypertrophy by supplementation of copper in the heart. This study was undertaken to address the critical issue of how TETA delivers copper to the heart. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Eight weeks after CIC surgery, cardiac hypertrophy developed and the copper content in the heart decreased. TETA was then administered by gavage at two different dosages (21.9 or 87.6 mg/kg day) for six weeks. The results showed that the lower dose of TETA restored the copper content in the heart with a decrease in copper concentration in the blood and kidney and an increase in the urine. At the higher dose, TETA did not replace copper content in the heart, but significantly increased copper concentrations in the urine and decreased that in the blood and kidney. Neither a lower nor a higher dose of TETA changed copper concentrations in other organs. Low-dose TETA, corresponding to myocardial copper supplementation, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy, as assessed by decreased left ventricular wall thickness and reduced heart size, and decreased cardiac fibrosis as reflected by decreased collagen I content. Higher doses of TETA not only suppressed cardiac hypertrophy, but also induced cardiac hypertrophy in sham-operated rats. TETA-mediated myocardial copper restoration is independent of copper transporter-1 or -2, but is related to an energy-dependent transport. This study demonstrates that low-dose TETA functions as a copper chaperone and selectively delivers copper via active transport to the copper-deprived heart; At higher doses, TETA retains its chelator function and removes copper in the urine. Effect statement: Our study reveals that TETA, traditionally regarded as a copper chelator, selectively delivers lower doses of copper to the heart via a mechanism independent of copper transporter-1 or -2. Copper supplementation with a lower dose of TETA suppresses overpressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Since ischemic heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are accompanied by loss of myocardial copper, an approach to using lower doses of TETA to supplement the heart with copper would aid in the management of the disease state of patients with such cardiac events.

Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic literature search was performed on Pubmed to identify articles describing EPS. Result(s): A peculiar histological pattern was detected in patients associated with EPS PCM in affected or unaffected skin samples. Using specific elastic fiber dyes (Verhoeff-van Gieson, Weigert, and Orcein), the fibers appeared with an irregular surface with a spine-like protrusion, possibly due to weaker fiber crosslinks, making these fibers unable to re-expand after shrinkage over their long lifetimes. axis.

Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Our aim was to describe the clinical features, diagnostic findings, treatments and outcomes of patients with ALF due to WD. Tools and methods. Retrospective medical record reviews of all patients with ALF due to WD over eight years in Uruguay. Results. Six (15%) of the 39 ALF cases were caused by WD. All patients were female and the mean age was 18 years. Four patients presented with hyperacute liver failure and two patients with acute failure. Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. The mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), AST and ALT were 27.5 mg/dL, 45.5 IU/l, 156 IU/L and 51 IU/L, respectively. Four patients had low ceruloplasmin levels, four had high urinary copper, and two patients had Kayser-Fleischer rings.

3280,Tetrathiomolybdate inhibits the reaction of cisplatin with the human copper chaperone Atox1.,"Cisplatin is a widely used clinically used anticancer drug, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ([(NH<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>MoS<inf>4</inf>], TM) is a copper. A chelator used clinically in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Recently, TM has been found to enhance the therapeutic effect of cisplatin; however, the source of this effect is not clear. Here, we found that TM can inhibit the reaction of cisplatin with Cu-Atox1 and prevent protein unfolding and aggregation induced by cisplatin. Although Ag(i) binds to Atox1 in a similar way to Cu(i)-Atox1, TM does not inhibit the reaction of Ag-Atox1 with cisplatin. This result indicates that Mo-centered trimeric protein cluster formation plays a role in the inhibitory effect in the TM-Cu-Atox1 system. This study provides new insights into the mechanism by which TM enhances the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin and helps tumor cells circumvent cisplatin resistance.

DESIGN AND PLACEMENT: A cross-sectional study based on patient records from the university hospital in İnönü University, Malatya, Turkey. METHODS(S): Medical records of 64 children with WD were evaluated focusing on clinical, laboratory and liver biopsy findings in different clinical presentations. RESULT(s): The mean age at diagnosis was 8.6 +/- 3.26 (3.5-17) and the mean follow-up time was 2.49 (range 0-9). There were 18 (28.1%), 12 (18.8%), 9 (14.1%), and 6 (9.4%) chronic liver diseases, fulminant liver failure, neurological WD, and acute hepatitis, respectively. Nineteen (29.7%) were asymptomatic. The most common and laboratory findings were jaundice (45.3%) and hypertransam-inasemia (85.9%), respectively. The lowest serum zinc level was found in the fulminant hepatic failure group (P = 0.035). Hepatosteatosis was detected in 35% of 20 patients who underwent liver biopsy. 57.1% of those with hepatosteatosis were asymptomatic. While 35% had copper staining, 25% had iron accumulation in liver biopsies. Nine cases underwent liver transplantation, and seven of them presented fulminant liver failure (77.8%). CONCLUSION(s): The presentation, symptoms and signs of our cases were similar to those in the previously reported series, except for the high rate of fulminant WD cases.

Although several copper-removing drugs are currently available, their Cu(I)-binder affinities have not been quantitatively characterized. Here, we determined the Cu(I)-binding affinities of five major copper-removing drugs - D-penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate and tetrathiomolybdate. Remove Cu(I) ions from two Cu(I) binding proteins, the copper chaperone for cytochrome c oxidase, Cox17 and metallothionein. We report that the Cu(I)-binding affinity of these drugs varies by four orders of magnitude and correlates positively with the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule and negatively with the number of atoms separating the two SH groups. Based on the analysis of the structure-activity relationship and the determined Cu(I)-binding affinity, we hypothesize that the endogenous biologically active substance, alpha-lipoic acid, may be suitable for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Our hypothesis is supported by cell culture experiments in which alpha-lipoic acid protects hepatic cells from copper toxicity. These results provide a basis for elaborating next-generation drugs that may provide better therapeutic outcomes.",,"Smirnova, J.;Kabin, E.;Jarving, I.;Bragina, O.;Tougu, V.;Plitz, T.;Palumaa, P.",2018,2022-01-23 00:00:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-19873-2,0,0,
3284,"Bridging Eastern and Western Europe - a comparison of orphan drug policies in Poland, Russia and the Netherlands","The purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth review of rare disease policies and ODs reimbursement in 3 European countries, two EU members (Poland, Netherlands) and one non-EU country (Russia). A review of publicly available information on rare disorder policies and HTA processes was conducted. Experts were consulted in case of unclear or scarce information. Russia has a five times higher frequency threshold for rare disease definition than Poland and the Netherlands (both use the EU definition). The Netherlands has greatly increased disease registries by establishing 300 specialist centers with the National Plan, Poland has only 6 registries, while Russia has one central registry. All 3 countries have an HTA process, but the one in Russia is relatively undeveloped. Access to MCs is the widest in the Netherlands, with 80 of the 83 EMA-approved MCs reimbursed in 2015; Poland made 49 repayments, Russia 4 at the federal level and 43 in the Moscow region. New rare disease policies are under development in all countries. Availability of health system solutions and reimbursement of ODs vary widely between the 3 countries. While both countries are EU members with common regulations and access to EMA-approved drugs, there are marked differences in policies, access to treatments and screening programs between Poland and the Netherlands.

3285,Seizure predictors in Wilson's disease: A clinico-radiological and biomarker study,"Background: Studies on predictors of seizures in Wilson's disease with a neurological manifestation (WDNM) are inconclusive, and none have evaluated the role of copper (Cu)-induced oxidative stress, proinflammatory, and excitotoxicity in seizure occurrence. Purpose(s): To report the frequency, refractoriness and outcome of seizures in WDNM. We also evaluate the role of Cu-induced oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and cytokines in predicting seizures. Method(s): The diagnosis of WDNM was based on clinical, MRI, CF ring, and 24-hour urine Cu. Detailed clinical examination including WD severity, seizure occurrence, seizure semiology, antiepileptic drug (AED) and breakthrough seizures were recorded. Cranial MRI and electroencephalography findings were noted. Serum free-Cu, markers of oxidative stress (glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde), glutamate, and cytokines (interleukin 6, 8, and 10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, spectrophotometer, fluorometer, and flow cytometry, respectively, and are associated with seizures. . Patients were treated with zinc with or without penicillamine, and those with epilepsy were given second-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Outcome(s): 16 (14.5%) of 110 patients with WDNM had seizures; It was focal in 11 (68.7%) and generalized in 5 (31.3%). Patients with seizures had higher serum free Cu (35.87 +/- 1.34 vs 31.72 +/- 0.68; P = 0.02), severe dystonia (P = 0.04), and more frequent cortical (6.4% vs 100%; P < 0.02) 0.01). and subcortical (20.2% vs 81.3%; P < 0.01) lesions on MRI compared to non-seizures. Oxidative stress markers (glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde), cytokines and glutamate were higher in WDNM compared to controls. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, cortical involvement (OR = 105.49; 95% CI = 8.74-1272.39; P < 0.01) and number of MRI lesions (OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.11-3.57; P = 0.02) were independent predictors. seizure Seizures were controlled with a single and dual AED in seven patients, and two patients required three AEDs. All patients had seizure remission during a median follow-up of 66(24-180) months. Result(s): Approximately one-sixth of WDNM patients experience seizures, particularly those with cortical and diffuse MRI lesions. Seizures are easily controlled by AEDs.

3287,Advances in the treatment of Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder that affects children and young adults, resulting in excessive copper deposition in the liver and brain. Without treatment, the disease is always fatal. Although treatments for WD have been available since the 1950s, the disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to missed diagnosis and delayed or inadequate treatment. In this article, we search the literature on WD to review recent advances in the treatment of WD. Method(s): We conducted a literature search using the PubMed database for articles on WD and its medical treatment. We reviewed the articles and cross-references to related articles to summarize current practices for the treatment of WD. Conclusion(s): The survey shows that if WD is treated appropriately, most patients can stabilize the liver, even return severe neurological disability and lead normal lives. Discussion(s): Medical treatment for WD includes the use of copper chelators (penicillamine, trientine, dimercaprol, dimercaptopropane sulfonate, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and drugs that reduce gastrointestinal copper absorption. Our knowledge of treatment approaches has benefited from extensive systematic clinical studies conducted over the past decade. For each drug used to treat WD, we investigated its development, indication for use, dosage, efficacy, and side effects.

3290,Wilson's disease - a case report,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is caused by a genetic abnormality that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, leading to disruption of cellular copper transport. The clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease are predominantly hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric, and many patients experience a combination of symptoms. Regardless of the clinical signs present initially, patients often develop other clinical signs as the disease progresses. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms are more common in patients with neurological involvement than in patients with liver involvement. However, the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms associated with Wilson's disease are often misdiagnosed. In this article, a 23-year-old male patient who presented with progressive psychiatric symptoms (depression, insomnia) despite psychiatric treatment is presented. Two years later, he was diagnosed with Wilson's disease, which was confirmed by genetic testing. Copyright © 2018, Editura Medicala.

3291,Clinical profile and treatment response study of Wilson's disease in a tertiary care center,"IntroductionWilson's disease is caused by a defect in the ATP7B gene that leads to impaired excretion of copper through the bile and accumulation of copper in various organs, usually in the liver and brain, resulting in neurological dysfunction in chronic liver disease. Methods The study was conducted in the Govt Department of Medical Gastroenterology. Stanley Medical College, Chennai, October 2017-July 2018. Sixteen patients diagnosed with Wilson's disease were included in the study. The patients were analyzed according to their clinical features at the time of admission and were followed up for clinical response to treatment. Results Age distribution is 11-61 years, most of them are in the 15-30 age group. Majority of the patients (68.7%) presented with liver findings. Twenty-five percent of the patients had neuropsychiatric symptoms. Two patients (13%) had both neurological and hepatic symptoms, both presented with tremor. Three patients were asymptomatic and diagnosed in family screening. Nine patients (56%) were born from consanguineous marriage. Kayser-Fleischer (CF) ring was found in 56% of patients. All patients with neurological features, 2 out of 3 asymptomatic patients, and 3 patients with liver features only had a CF ring. Ten patients were treated with penicillamine, 2 patients with zinc, and 4 patients with zinc and penicillamine. Nine patients showed improvement in LFT and reduction in 24-hour urinary copper with chelation therapy. Two patients with DCLD underwent liver transplantation and were successful in follow-up after liver transplantation. Fifty-six percent had stable disease and 25% worsened, now working on liver transplants. Conclusion Family screening is important for early diagnosis. Liver manifestations were found to be more common. Penicillamine and zinc therapy can effectively treat Wilson's disease with hepatic symptoms. Liver transplantation continues to be a life saver for those with fulminant and end-stage disease.",,"Joseph, J.",2018,October,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12664-018-0911-4,0,0,
3292,Liver manifestations of Wilson's disease: 12 years of experience in a Swiss tertiary referral center,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism that leads to copper deposition in the brain, cornea, and other organs as well as the liver. Here, we describe adult cases of hepatic Wilson's disease diagnosed between September 2004 and August 2016 at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland. METHODS: Clinical signs, results of diagnostic tests, management, and outcomes of adult patients with hepatic Wilson's disease were evaluated based on standard medical records. In addition, liver histology was examined and lesion patterns were recorded. CONCLUSION(s): Ten new adult cases of Wilson's liver disease were diagnosed at our center between September 2004 and August 2016. The male/female ratio was 1:1 and the median age at diagnosis was 26 (range 18–56). Four patients presented with acute liver failure, four with persistently elevated liver function tests, and two with decompensated cirrhosis; None of them had neurological signs. Only one patient had a Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring. Median ceruloplasmin level at diagnosis is 0.13 (range <0.03–0.30) g/l, median 24-hour urinary copper excretion is 2.8 (range 0.3–77.3) µmol, and median hepatic copper concentration is 789 (range 284–ndash; 1677) &ug/g . At least one mutation in the ATP7B gene was detected in eight patients. The allelic frequency of the common H1069Q mutation was 19%. The Leipzig score was &ge;5 in all patients. Successful liver transplantation was performed in three patients who presented with acute liver failure and two patients with decompensated cirrhosis. One patient with acute hepatic failure recovered under chelation therapy, as predicted by a Dhawan score <11. D-penicillamine was used as first-line chelator therapy, then three out of six patients were switched to trientine due to side effects. CONCLUSION(s): The clinical presentation of hepatic Wilson's disease is highly variable. Three out of 10 patients were diagnosed at age >35 years. A high index of suspicion is key in clinically compatible situations.",,"Vieira Barbosa, J.;Fraga, M.;Saldarriaga, J.;Hiroz, P.;Giostra, E.;Sempoux, C.;Ferenci, P.;Moradpour, D.",2018,2022-12-17 00:00:00,,1,1,
3293,Hepatic copper deposition in a young cat with familial variations in the ATP7B gene,"one-month-old intact crossbred female cat presented with jaundice, intermittent anorexia and lethargy, increased liver enzyme activities and hyperammonemia. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomographic examinations revealed a round and irregular border of the liver, and histopathological examination revealed excessive copper hepatocyte accumulation in the liver. Both blood and urine copper concentrations were higher than in healthy cats. The patient responded well to penicillamine therapy. Clinicopathological abnormalities and clinical signs resolved within 2 months, and the patient survived >9 months after starting treatment. Genetic analysis determined that the patient and her offspring had a single nucleotide variation (SNV, p. T1297R) that impairs the function of the ATP7B gene product; The gene that is mutated in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Hepatic copper deposition was believed to be related to the SNV of the ATP7B gene, and the patient had a genetic disorder of copper metabolism equivalent to WD in humans. Copyright Â© 2018 Authors.

3295,Epigenetic changes of the thioredoxin system in the Tx-j mouse model and patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the copper transporter ATP7B, resulting in accumulation of copper in the liver and brain. Excess copper inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, leading to variable WD phenotypes from diffuse changes in DNA methylation and gene expression. We have previously shown that in the Jackson toxic milk (tx-j) mouse model of WD, maternal choline supplementation corrected higher thioredoxin 1 (TNX1) transcript levels in the fetal liver. Here, we investigated the effect of maternal choline supplementation with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in tx-j fetal liver. Tx-j Atp7b genotype-dependent differences in DNA methylation were corrected with choline for genes including but not limited to oxidative stress pathways. To examine the phenotypic effects of postnatal choline supplementation, tx-j mice were randomized to one of six treatment groups: maternal and/or continuous choline supplementation and with or without copper chelation by penicillamine (PCA) treatment. Hepatic transcript levels of TXN1 and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) were significantly higher in mice that received maternal and continuous choline, with or without PCA treatment, compared with untreated mice. A WGBS comparison of human WD liver and tx-j mouse liver showed significant overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with ATP7B deficiency. Furthermore, eight genes in the thioredoxin (TXN) pathway were differentially methylated in human WD liver samples. In summary, Atp7b deficiency and choline supplementation have a genome-wide effect in tx-j mice, including genes related to the TXN system. These findings may explain the variability of the WD phenotype and suggest new complementary treatment options for WD. Copyright Â© Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

3296,Providing trace elements in parenteral nutrition in children: One size does not fit all,"Routine administration of trace elements is accepted as a standard of care in children needing parenteral nutrition. However, there is no global consensus on the provision and dosing of trace elements in pediatric parenteral nutrition. This review provides an overview of the available evidence on trace element supply and posology in parenteral nutrition in neonates and children. The provision of trace elements in children should be tailored to the child's weight and clinical situation, with an emphasis on those at risk of toxicity or deficiency. Based on the available evidence, there is a need to review the formulation of commercial solutions containing multiple trace elements and ensure that individual trace element additives are available for specific indications. Manganese and molybdenum supplementation is discussed while the literature supports the removal of chromium supply. Preterm neonates may have higher parenteral requirements for iodine, selenium, and copper than previously recommended. There is increasing support for routine iron provision in long-term parenteral nutrition. More studies are needed on trace element contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions for a number of trace elements. Copyright Â© 2018 belongs to the authors.

3297,Recovery of severe acute liver failure without transplantation in patients with Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder that leads to cirrhosis of the liver. WD patients with NWIS > 11 should receive LT; however, we encountered 2 WD patients with NWIS >11 who recovered from ALF without LT. This report aimed to analyze cases of WH patients with high NWIS who recovered from severe ALF and to discuss the clinical manifestations of patients and the effects of treatments including zinc (Zn) therapy, chelator therapy, PE, CHDF, and LT. . We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of five patients (male, 2; female, 3) diagnosed with WD with severe ALF. Cases 1, 2, and 3 achieved complete recovery from ALF without LT. In case 4, initial recovery from ALF without LT was noted; however, ALF worsened due to bleeding from esophageal varices. Thus, the patient eventually needed LT. In case 5, improvement from LT and ALF was noted. Except for Case 2, all cases showed ALF with maximum PELD/MELD scores >=26 and NWISs >= 11 and had indications for LT. In severe cases of ALF with Grade I or II encephalopathy, we recommend evaluating the effects of Zn and chelator therapies in preparation for LT, as the condition may not improve without LT and pediatricians or physicians may prompt transplant surgeons to perform LT if present. is necessary.

3298,Wilson's disease: 2017 update,"Wilson's disease (WD) is characterized by the accumulation of harmful copper in the liver and brain. It is one of the rare genetic disorders that benefit from effective and lifelong treatments that significantly alter the prognosis of the disease. Its clinical prevalence is estimated between 1.2 and 2/100,000 in Europe, but the genetic prevalence is higher at around 1/7000. Incomplete penetration of the gene or the presence of modifier genes may explain the difference between the estimated genetic prevalence and the number of patients diagnosed with WD. The clinical spectrum of WD is broader as expected, with mild clinical presentations in 6% of patients and late onset of the disease after 40 years of age. WD is usually suspected when ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels are low and 24-hour urinary copper excretion is elevated. Recently, significant diagnostic progress has been made with the application of direct ""free copper"" or exchangeable copper (CuEXC) testing. Relative exchangeable copper (REC), corresponding to the ratio between CuEXC and total serum copper, allows diagnosis of WD with high sensitivity and specificity when REC > 18.5%. In addition, CuEXC values at the time of diagnosis are an indicator of extrahepatic involvement and its severity. A value of >2.08 mumol/L suggests corneal and brain involvement (Se = 86%, Sp = 94%), and the higher the values, the more severe the disease will be clinically and radiologically. The use of FibroScan<sup></sup> is becoming increasingly common to evaluate liver stiffness measurements in WD patients. 6.6 kPa is considered a threshold value between mild to moderate fibrosis, while a value greater than 8.4 is indicative of severe fibrosis. More studies are now required to confirm the usefulness of Fibroscan in managing chronic therapy for WD patients. Treatment of this disease is based on maintaining the initial active and prolonged chelating phase (with D-Penicillamine or Trientine) followed by Trientine or zinc salt. Two major problems that may be encountered are neurologic deterioration in the initial phase and non-adherence to treatment during maintenance therapy. Liver transplantation is the recommended treatment option in WD with acute liver failure or end-stage liver cirrhosis; Its indication should be considered when the neurological status deteriorates rapidly despite effective chelation. Regular clinical, biological, and hepatic ultrasound follow-up is essential to assess efficacy, tolerance, and adherence to therapy, as well as to detect the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. There is hope in the near future with the development of a new chelator and copper absorption inhibitor, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), and gene therapy.

3299,Copper chelators are also relatively strong zinc chelators.,"Zinc (Zn) is an important metal involved in many physiological processes. It is required for the catalytic activity of about 100 enzymes and plays a role in protein and DNA synthesis, cell division, wound healing and immunity. Zinc deficiency, growth retardation, loss of appetite, suppressed immune function, diabetes etc. is characterized by One of the causes of zinc deficiency may be the long-lasting use of mostly non-selective metal chelators. Such examples are copper chelators used in the rare inherited disorder that results in an excess of copper in the body - Wilson's disease. The aim of this study was to examine the possible abilities of D-penicillamine, trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATM) to bind zinc through a competitive spectrophotometric method between the tested compound and dithizone as an indicator. Various physiologically relevant pH levels ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 were tested. compound and dithizone as an indicator. Various physiologically relevant pH levels ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 were tested. All compounds showed non-selective for copper and zinc binding capacity. Experiments showed that the most potent Zn chelator was trientine. It can bind approximately 65% of Zn when mixed with zinc ions in a 1:1 molar ratio at pH 7.5. D-penicillamine and ATM showed lower chelating capacity. Surprisingly, all of the tested compounds showed higher capacity to form a complex with the Zn ion compared to the ability of D-penicillamine to chelate Cu ions. ATM, as well as clinically used copper chelators, are relatively potent zinc chelators, and therefore their long-term use may result in toxicity possibly associated with zinc deficiency.",,"Tvrdy, V.;Karlickova, J.;Hanuscinova, L.;Mladenka, P.",2018,May,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/intox-2018-0006,0,0,
3300,"Wilson's disease in children: patient perspective on diagnosis, treatment, compliance and follow-up","Wilson's Disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive copper transport disease that can occur in childhood with a wide spectrum of manifestations (liver, neurological and/or psychiatric). Treatment requires lifelong adherence to diet and medical therapy. The aim of the study was to evaluate patient-reported symptoms during diagnosis and treatment. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to 877 WD patients in the WD Association patient network. Of the 124 participants, 34 were younger than 21: 10 were younger than 10 and 65% were female. Most patients were from North America (79%) and had private insurance (65%). WD was diagnosed before 1 year of age in two cases, between 1-5 years of age in 9 cases, between 6-10 years in 12 cases and between 11-19 years in 11 cases. The symptoms at presentation were primarily hepatic (56%), neurological (21%) and psychiatric (9%). Concurrent liver involvement was present in 6/7 patients with neurological disease, and it was reported as severe liver disease in 2 cases. All patients with a psychiatric presentation had liver disease. Patients report currently being treated with trientine (44%), zinc salts (29%), D-penicillamine (1 patient), and zinc and chelator combination therapy (24%). Only about one-third, 32% continued the same treatment for WD that they initially started. In 41%, the drugs were changed once, and in another 27%, the treatment was changed more than once. Regarding treatment adherence, 59% reported that they never missed the dose, 20% reported that they missed more than twice a week, once a week and 21% mostly the afternoon dose (82%). The most common cause of non-adherence was forgetfulness (74%), although 41% reported drug side effects as the cause of missing doses. Medicines were obtained from the local pharmacy (44%), by mail (29%), and from a specialty pharmacy (21%), and other (6%). Interestingly, 53% reported that the pharmacy did not supply the medication on time, and 38% reported difficulties in obtaining insurance approval for their medication. The median monthly out-of-pocket expenditure was $25-50. It was reported that 56% adhered to a strict low-copper diet, 36% adhered in some way, and 8% did not restrict the diet at all. Medical follow-ups were performed by gastroenterologists (26%), hepatologists (21%), primary care physicians (15%), and specialist physicians (48%). Blood tests to monitor treatment were performed every 3 months in 44%, every 6 months in 44%, and annually in 12%. The majority (68%) were seen by their MDs at least every 6 months. Quality of life was reported in 62% of affected WD patients. Conclusion(s): WD diagnosed in childhood may present mostly with hepatic symptoms, but a minority also had neurological or psychiatric symptoms at the time of diagnosis. In most patients, medical treatments have changed, unlike initial treatment, and the reasons for this need to be explored. Medication compliance was a challenge for approximately 40% of patients due to patient and non-patient issues. Therefore, improving medication adherence should address patient forgetfulness, treatment side effects, and medication access.",,"Miloh, T.;Schilsky, S.;Graper, M.;Gonzalez-Peralta, R.;Schilsky, M.",2018,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000002164,0,0,
3301,Chelation principles in Menkes and Wilson diseases: Choosing the right compounds in the right combinations at the right time.,"Dysregulation of copper homeostasis in humans is found mainly in Menkes and Wilson's diseases, which show symptoms of copper deficiency or overload, respectively, two genetic diseases of copper transport. However, both diseases are copper storage disorders despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by copper deficiency due to poor loading of copper-requiring enzymes despite adequate body copper. Copper accumulates in non-hepatic tissues, but is deficient in the blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson's disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity secondary to copper deposition in various organs, primarily the brain and liver, and a saturated blood copper pool. Although copper depletion is most challenging in Menkes disease, it is difficult to correct copper dyshomeostasis in both diseases. Both diseases are caused by defective copper export from different cells, and we are trying to give new perspectives and guidelines to improve the treatment of these two complementary diseases. Treatment of Menkes' disease with copper-histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate, or lipoic acid is discussed. The combination of a hydrophilic chelator such as trientine or dimercaptosuccinate with a brain shuttle in Wilson's disease is discussed, for example, thiomolybdate or lipoate. New chelating principles for the removal or delivery of copper are outlined. Copyright © 2018",,"Horn, N.;Moller, L. B.;Nurchi, V.

3302,Quantitative trace element mapping in liver tissue from patients with Wilson's disease as determined by micro X-ray fluorescence,"Objectives: The aim of this study is to measure the amount of copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) together with sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) in hepatocytes and connective tissue in liver sections taken from patients with Wilson's disease (WD). micro Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (mu-SRXRF). Second, to generate two-dimensional mu-SRXRF element maps for comparison with histologically prepared slices, and third, to evaluate whether the baseline distributions are related. Method(s): Archive liver tissues from twelve patients with end-stage cirrhosis or fulminant WD were investigated. Mutations in ATP7B have been previously classified. Seven archived normal liver tissues were searched for control. mu-SRXRF measurements were performed on the DORIS III storage ring at HASYLAB/DESY (Hamburg, Germany). The two-dimensional element distribution was compared with histologically prepared slices of approximately 20-30 mm, except for those examined by mu-SRXRF. Result(s): Elementary copper (Cu) could be demonstrated in all liver sections analyzed simultaneously with Fe, Zn, P and S. Mean Cu increased 20-fold in hepatocytes and three-fold in fibrotic areas in WD compared to controls. Cu is strikingly inhomogeneously distributed in the regeneration nodules. Cu concentrations measured by mu-SRXRF correlate with those measured by atom absorption spectroscopy. There were strong relationships between Zn and Cu or Fe and S in their regional distributions. In addition, Cu/S differences were found between hepatocytes and fibrotic areas. Fe increase can only be documented in hepatocytes compared to fibrotic areas. With a beam size of 15 x 15 mm, the two-dimensional distributions of these elements can be compared morphologically by histological section with an optical microscope magnification of approximately 25x. Conclusion(s): mu-SRXRF studies are a valuable tool for measuring element concentrations in biological tissues, and also provide 2D information about element distribution and element association in biological tissues, thus accelerating basic information in a summary with biological and clinical data.

3303,Altered zinc balance in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse reveals mechanism of copper toxicity in Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that affects copper transport in the body. The ATP7B mutation damages copper transporter function, resulting in excessive copper accumulation and subsequent toxicity in both the liver and brain. However, the mechanisms of copper toxicity are not well defined. The Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model is well characterized and presents a hepatic phenotype consistent with WD. In this study, we found that untreated Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mice accumulated approximately 2 times more hepatic zinc compared to wild type. We used targeted transcriptomics and proteomics to analyze the molecular events associated with zinc and copper accumulation in the Atp7b<sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver. Altered gene expression of Zip5 and ZnT1 zinc transporters showed a transcriptional homeostatic response, while increased copper/zinc ratios associated with high levels of metallothionein 1 and 2 indicated altered Zn availability in cells. These data suggest that copper toxicity in Wilson's disease includes effects on zinc-dependent proteins. Transcriptional network analysis of RNA-seq data reveals an interconnected network of transcriptional activators with overrepresentation of zinc-dependent and zinc-sensitive transcription factors. In the context of previous research, these observations support the hypothesis that mechanisms of copper toxicity involve disruption of intracellular zinc distribution in liver cells. The translational significance of this study lies in oral zinc supplementation in the treatment of WD, which is thought to mediate protective effects through the induction of metallothionein synthesis in the gut. This study demonstrates the broader effects of altered zinc-copper balance in WD, including global transcriptional responses and altered zinc balance in the liver.

3304,Serum zinc value in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of liver disease in children with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare congenital defect of copper metabolism with various manifestations. Until now, no studies have been conducted on the copper antagonist zinc (Zn) in the diagnosis and severity of WD. Our aim was to evaluate serum Zn in WD and its relationship with disease severity score (revised WD index). Although ATP7B mutation analysis is highly accurate for diagnosing WD, it may not be readily available in a resource-limiting environment. We proposed a disease diagnostic score (Recommended WD diagnostic score) that includes serum Zn. Method(s): Medical records of WD and non-WD children seen at King's College Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed for selected parameters using the Recommended WD diagnostic score. In children with WD, available serum Zn data and calculated severity score were statistically analyzed before diagnosis. The diagnostic values of the proposed WD diagnostic score were evaluated. Result(s): Serum Zn level was significantly higher in 8 WD-acute liver failure (ALF) (5.8 [4.1-8.3] mumol/L) compared with 18 non-WD-ALF (13.5 [6.1-22.2] mumol/L). low ) and 9 ALF of unknown cause (9.8 [7.0-12.1] mumol/L) (P < 0.001). Serum Zn correlated significantly with the revised WD index (r = -0.554, P = 0.004). The recommended WD diagnostic score, which included serum Zn level as 1 of the parameters, had a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Serum Zn is a new parameter for diagnosis and correlates with the severity of WD. The recommended WD diagnostic score is useful while awaiting ATP7B mutation analysis.

3305,Characteristics and prevalence of Wilson's disease: an observational population-based study in France in 2013.,"Background and objectives: Only a few epidemiological studies have been conducted to date on the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD), and results vary widely according to reports. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, outpatient care and treatment of patients with WD in France. Method(s): Among 58 million general health program beneficiaries (86% of the French population), persons administered for WH in 2013 were identified using a diagnosis of hospitalization in 2011-2013 or certain long-term disease status with 100% reimbursement. certain health services in 2013. Data were obtained from Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). Prevalence was calculated according to age and gender. Result(s): In 2013, 906 common cases were identified, resulting in a crude prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 for men and 1.44 per 100,000 for women. This prevalence is comparable to that reported in other population-based studies in European countries and a study using a similar method. Approximately 40% of patients were treated with D-penicillamine and 14.3% were treated with zinc acetate. Trientine delivered on the basis of compassion was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients had a liver transplant and 4% had a liver transplant in previous years. 15 percent of patients took antidepressants at a higher rate than the general population. Conclusion(s): This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population based on administrative data and represents an important step forward in understanding the impact of WD and examining quality of care.

3306,Low serum alkaline phosphatase activity in a teenage girl,"Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare genetic disease that affects bone mineralization. There are currently six forms of HPP of varying age of onset and severity: perinatal (fatal), perinatal benign, infantile, childhood, adult, and odontohypophosphatasia. Perinatal HPP is the most severe and results in death in utero, while adult HPP is milder and presents with pain and osteomalacia. HPP is caused by mutations of the ALPL gene, which encodes tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase. One of the key features of HPP is low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. For accurate diagnosis and treatment, HPP needs to be recognized and differentiated from other causes of ALP activity. Here, we present the clinical case of a 17-year-old girl who presented with fatigue at her annual medical examination. Results from an external laboratory showed low daytime cortisol concentration. At his father's request, he was referred to endocrinology due to chronic fatigue and possible adrenal insufficiency. Hypothyroidism and chronic fatigue syndrome were remarkable in his family history. His medical history included the presence of anti-TPO antibodies below the diagnostic threshold and a normal TSH. She was taking folate, vitamin B12, and multivitamins. At the time of her initial examination, her laboratory results were notable for low ALP activity (24 units/L; reference range 55-140 units/L). Low ALP activity may be due to Wilson's disease, hypophosphatasia, pernicious anemia, and severe hypothyroidism. Magnesium and zinc deficiencies were once sources of erroneously low ALP measurements, but current assay formulations contain magnesium and zinc to circumvent this problem. Method(s): : Fresh samples were taken and ALP activity repeated to distinguish the cause of low serum ALP activity. In addition, ALP-isoenzyme analysis, sequencing of the ATP7B gene, ceruloplasmin, vitamin B6 (P5P) and urinary phosphoethanolamine quantification were also performed. Result(s): Repeat analysis of the patient's serum ALP activity was 23 units/L. ALP-isoenzyme analysis could not be performed due to insufficient ALP activity. Initial results showed high vitamin B12 concentration and normal thyroid function, which eliminated differentially pernicious anemia and hypothyroidism. The patient's ceruloplasmin concentration was determined to be 16.5 mg/dL (reference range 16-45 mg/dL), prompting further evaluation for Wilson's disease by sequencing the ATP7B gene, which did not show any deleterious mutations. Vitamin B6 and PEA concentrations were 95 cups/L; 5-50 cups/L) and (80 mmol/mg Cr; <88 mmol/mg Cr), respectively, are consistent with hypophosphatasia. Conclusion(s): HPP was initially considered unlikely due to the absence of bone abnormalities and impaired growth; however, the combination of low ALP activity and high vitamin B6 and PEA is consistent with a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia. Its clinical features indicate a mild childhood or adult form of HPP. This case was complicated by the ceruloplasmin concentration at the lower end of the reference range. The patient's later admission that he had received cortisol from his father to treat his fatigue also complicated the diagnosis. The family was advised to stop giving exogenous cortisol and the patient successfully relapsed without any signs of acute adrenal crisis. The family refused genetic testing of the ALPL gene.",,"Shajani-Yi, Z.;Casella, S. J.;Cervinski, M. A.",2017,,,0,0,
3307,Update on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Wilson's Disease,"Purpose of Review: Exciting developments in Wilson's disease (WD) have come from both basic biological and clinical research. This review critically examines some of these findings and considers their impact on current thinking about WD. It is not a comprehensive review of WD as a clinical disorder. Recent Findings: The structure of the ATP7B gene product that is abnormal in WD is being studied in detail, along with a broader explanation of how the ATP7B protein (Wilson ATPase) works in cells, including enterocytes. but also depends on lipid synthesis. Recent population studies raise the possibility of incomplete penetration of WD. Innovative scanning techniques can increase precision. New strategies are being developed to diagnose and treat WD. Several disorders have been identified that could be characterized as WD-mimicking. Summary: Diagnosing and treating WD can be difficult. Information from its pathobiology provides new options for managing WD. Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Roberts, E.

3309,Movement Disorders and Neurometabolic Diseases,"Many inherited metabolic diseases or inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) cause movement disorders in children. This review focuses on chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, and parkinsonism. The broad neurometabolic categories commonly responsible for pediatric movement disorders include mitochondrial cytopathies, organic acidemias, mineral metabolism and transport disorders, neurotransmitter diseases, purine metabolism abnormalities, lipid storage conditions, and creatine metabolism dysfunction. Each movement disorder can be caused by many IEMs, and many of them can cause more than one movement abnormality. Dietary changes, medications, and increasingly specific therapy can improve outcomes in children with movement disorders caused by IEM. Recognition and characterization of secondary movement disorders in children facilitates their management and diagnosis and possible treatment of an underlying IEM.

3310,Dietary copper restriction in Wilson's disease review article,"Dietary copper restriction has long been recognized as an important aspect of the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD). However, the evidence supporting this approach is limited. Due to the rarity of the disease and the variable presentation, there are no published randomized controlled studies examining this recommendation. This review summarizes the available information on the absorption and regulation of copper in humans and its relevance to patients with WD. Studies have shown that as dietary copper level increases, the rate absorbed decreases. This observation means that the 'high copper' foods that WD patients are generally advised to avoid would need to be consumed in large quantities to significantly affect the amount absorbed. Dietary copper restriction is unlikely to significantly reduce the amount absorbed and is not only difficult to manage, but also unnecessarily restricts food groups, detracting from providing the substrates necessary to improve nutritional status in a nutritionally poor group. Medical management for WD is effective in compliant patients and allows stabilization of liver disease. Based on the available evidence, dietary copper restrictions in patients with stable WD due to medical therapy are unnecessary, with two food exceptions (shellfish and liver).

3311,The hidden face of Wilson's disease,"In summary, the classic form of Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive condition with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric and systemic findings. However, the diagnosis should not be excluded because of a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The latest generation sequencing (NGS) studies have shown a gap between phenotype and genetic prevalences, further suggesting that WH may still be underdiagnosed. In most WD patients, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can result in resolution of symptoms and/or improved quality of life. Therefore, it is of great importance to find WD in patients aged > 40 years or with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, unexplained bone pain, amenorrhoea, recurrent spontaneous abortion or kidney stone disease. All of these symptoms may be present on their own or with mild to inadequate neurological and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. While brain lesions of the lenticular, midbrain, and dentate nuclei are classic, white matter changes and cortical lesions can also be observed: they are usually asymmetrical with anterior lobe bias and are associated with a poor prognosis when widespread. These lesions are mainly due to copper deposition, but may also be associated with focal deposition of other metals such as iron and manganese. A new biomarker called 'relative exchangeable copper' (REC) facilitates diagnosis and familial screening. Patient follow-up is important to ensure treatment compliance, efficacy and tolerability, and to detect rare complications such as copper deficiency and hepatocarcinoma caused by chronic copper chelation in patients with cirrhosis. The treatments currently used are copper chelators and zinc salts. Therapeutic perspectives include liver transplantation, new copper chelators such as tetrathiomolybdate, hepatocyte/tissue transfer, and gene therapy.

3312,Results of WTX101 treatment in a phase 2 and extension study in Wilson's disease: Comparison of subjects with and without cirrhosis.,"Background: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper-protein binding agent that reduces plasma ceruloplasmin unbound copper (NCC) in Wilson's Disease (WD) by forming ternary complexes with albumin and increasing biliary copper excretion. In a 24-week prospective single-arm phase 2 study in WD, oral once-daily WTX101 rapidly reduced NCC, improved neurological status, and stabilized liver function. Our aim was to compare baseline characteristics and the efficacy and safety of the 48-week extension in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic study participants. Methods: Of the 28 WD subjects (18-64 years, 15 women) enrolled in the phase 2 study, 13 (46%) were categorized as cirrhotic based on medical history (biopsy or imaging) or AST-to-platelet ratio estimates. Of the 22 subjects who continued on WTX101 at extension, 12 were cirrhotic and 10 were non-cirrhotic. Key parameters monitored over 48 weeks included NCC<inf>corrected</inf> (corrected for copper in tripartite complexes), liver status using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), disability, and neurological status. Results: The mean NCC at study entry was 3.9 µM for non-cirrhotic subjects and 3.2 µM for cirrhotic subjects. At week 48, the mean NCC<inf>corrected</inf> increased to 0.6 and 0.5 µM, respectively. The mean INR was higher and albumin lower at baseline in patients with and without cirrhosis, but increased to the normal range in both groups at week 48. The mean MELD score for cirrhotic subjects increased from 8.4 to 7.5 at week 48, and the mean modified Nazer score was increased from 1.9 to 0.6. In non-cirrhotic subjects, scores remained stable from study entry to week 48 for MELD (7.0 to 7.1) and modified Nazer (1.0 to 0.8). UWDRS disability and neurologic scores increased to week 48 independent of cirrhosis. Eight serious adverse events possibly or possibly associated between WTX101 and week 48 were similarly distributed between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic subjects. Reversible ALT elevations requiring dose adjustment were observed in 5 and 6 without cirrhosis and resulted in discontinuation of therapy before week 24 in 3 subjects without cirrhosis. No ALT elevations requiring dose adjustment were observed at extension. Conclusion: In summary, after 48 weeks, WTX101 treatment improved copper control with improved or unchanged liver function and a favorable tolerability profile, with or without liver cirrhosis. Therefore, we conclude that the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment with WTX101 is not affected by the presence or absence of compensated cirrhosis in patients with WD.",,"Schilsky, M.

3313,Contribution of the French registry system to the understanding of Wilson's disease,"Purpose: To identify patients in the French Wilson's disease (WD) registry. Background: WD is a rare genetic disorder caused by loss of function of the ATP7B protein, resulting in toxic copper deposition in the liver and brain. Due to its rarity, it is difficult to collect data from patients. In France, the WD National Reference Center has a network dedicated to the disease and allows maximum data collection from these patients. Methods: WD patients residing in France were included in the registry. Data were analyzed at diagnosis and at final follow-up. The mean age and clinical forms at diagnosis and initial treatments prescribed were reported. Mean disease duration, development of clinical symptoms, and modification of treatments at last follow-up were examined. Results: 619 patients (49.1% men) were included in the records, and their diagnoses were made between 1959 and 2017. The mean age at diagnosis was 18.5 +/-11 years (min 1; max 64). 45.8% had a hepatic phenotype, 33.5% had a neurological presentation, and 20.7% were diagnosed on familial screening. The main initial clinical symptoms in the liver group were jaundice (49%), ascites (12.7%), and edema (6.9%). The main initial symptoms in neurological patients were tremor (52.6%), dysarthria (52%), difficulty writing (31%), dystonia (27%), gait disturbance (27%), drooling (23%), and difficulty swallowing. 14%). The mean time between diagnosis and last follow-up in surviving patients (95.2%) was 15 +/-13 years (min 1, max 58). 12.8% of neurological patients had no further symptoms. Persistent symptoms were dysarthria (45.2%), dystonia (40.9%), difficulty writing (23.4%), tremor (21.8%), gait disturbance (19.7%), and drooling (13.3%). Between the diagnosis and the last follow-up, 42% of the patients had their treatment changed. D-Penicillamine prescriptions fell from 79% to 37%, while zinc salts rose from 9% to 32%, and those with Trientine increased from 6% to 20%. Bitherapy remained stable (2% versus 3%), with 8.5% undergoing liver transplantation. Adverse effects leading to treatment change were present in 33.7% under D-Penicillamine and 14.3% under zinc salts, respectively. Conclusions: This cohort is the largest in Europe, accounting for two-thirds of WD patients identified in France, as a recent epidemiological study reported 906 common cases in this country1. These data are essential to better understanding the disease and improving patient care.",,"Poujois, A.;Girardot, N.;Brunet, A. S.;Lachaux, A.;Woimant, F.",2018,October,,0,0,
3314,Chinese patients and treatments with Wilson's disease: exemplified by intravenous infusion of Unithiol (DMPS).,"Objective: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of effects and adverse events for a series of 136 Chinese patients with Wilson's disease who were treated with an intravenous infusion of Unithiol (DMPS) at Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College Affiliated University Hospital. Background: Therapeutic drugs approved to treat patients with Wilson's disease (WD) in Europe and America mainly include penicillamine and trientine. However, trientine is not available in China as the price is too high, especially for patients. It is recommended that WD patients with penicillamine allergy or intolerance take the safer and less expensive oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in mainland China. Major WD specialists in China give an intravenous infusion of Unithiol (DMPS) over several weeks. The authors observed insufficient data on the effects of DMPS infusion on blood routine (WBC,N,Hb, Plt) and liver function (ALT,AST,GGT,Alb). We aimed to find the effects with data from a single center at Shanghai University Hospital. Methods: All of these 136 patients had blood routine (WBC,N,Hb, Plt) with liver function (ALT,AST, GGT,Alb) before and after DMPS and before and after DMPS infusion. We analyzed with SPSS 20.0. Results: 1. Blood routine (WBC,N,Hb,Plt) showed no significant change before and after DMPS treatment (P>0.05); 2. There was no significant change in liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb) before and after DMPS treatment (P>0.05); 3. Urine copper content increased 5.5 times. Conclusions: DMPS infusion therapy is effective on blood routine (WBC, N, Hb, Plt) and liver function (ALT, AST, GGT, Alb) of WD patients. Overall, DMPS is a type of safe and beneficial treatment for this series of WD patients. However, rare serious side effects have been reported.",,"Wang, X. P.",2018,October,,0,0,
3315,GPi Targeting: DBS treating dystonia in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) targeting the inner segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in the treatment of dystonia due to Wilson's disease (WD). Secondary goals are to evaluate the impact of GPi DBS on cognitive aspects of the disease and to evaluate the safety of GPi DBS in the specific context of WD. Background: WD is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by mutations affecting the ATP7B copper transporter and leading to copper accumulation in the brain and liver. Common neurological manifestations of WD include dystonia, tremor, ataxia, chorea, and parkinsonism. Of these, dystonia is one of the most difficult to manage. Although GPi DBS is a treatment option to target dystonic symptoms, there are limited data on the use of this therapy to treat dystonia in WD. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of bilateral GPi DBS in the treatment of WD with dystonia, we present a patient with WD who was implanted with bilateral GPi DBS and evaluated with the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). The patient's dystonia did not improve with zinc acetate treatment administered two years before DBS surgery. Methods: Baseline UWDRS scores were evaluated preoperatively and at 1 and 2 months postoperatively. Postoperative UWDRS scores were compared with baseline scores and analyzed on neurological, hepatic and psychiatric subscales. Additionally, DBS has undergone an extensive neuropsychological evaluation as part of the approval process and will be reassessed 6 months post-surgery to address our secondary outcome measure. Results: Compared with baseline UWDRS scores, total UWDRS scores increased by 34.48% at postoperative 1 month evaluation and by 45.98% at postoperative 2 month evaluation. The neurological subscore increased by 30.99% and 43.66%, respectively. In addition, the patient's liver subscale improved by 37.5% and 50%, respectively. The patient's psychiatric subscale improved by 62.5% in the 1st month postoperatively and remained stable in the 2-month follow-up evaluation. Results: Although significant improvement in neurological subscales, improvement in hepatic and psychiatric subscales probably represents variability in patient self-report rather than response to DBS. In particular, her responses to the liver subscale may reflect an overall sense of well-being rather than specific hepatic recovery. Using bilateral GPi DBS to treat WD with significant dystonia may be effective in improving neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Further clinical trials should be conducted to further confirm the clinical efficacy of bilateral GPi DBS in WD patients with dystonia.",,"Sperry, L.;Duan, X.;Girgis, F.;Denny, K.;Farias, S.;Kahn, D.;Medici, V.;Zhang, L.;Shahlaie, K.",2018,October,,0,0,
3316,Tics in Wilson's disease and review of the literature,"Objective: We present a case of tic in a patient with Wilson's Disease (WD). Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that causes liver failure and neurological deficits. The most common neurological manifestations are midline cerebellar disorders (dysarthria, gait disturbances), movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor), and a number of psychiatric disorders. Tics and stereotypical movements are extremely rare in WD. This article presents a 23-year-old male patient with WD who exhibits stereotypical movements. We reviewed all previous cases of WD presenting with tics (five cases) and stereotypical movements in the literature. Methods: Case report and literature review. Results: A 23-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic with speech disorder, chewing difficulty, gait disturbance and involuntary movements (shown in the figure). His mother is his father's first cousin. He has two sisters who are healthy and have normal blood ceruloplasmin levels. He had stereotypical movements such as left hand raising and forehead touching and elbow flexion, right hand waving, left foot raising, and circular movements that could be voluntarily suppressed for a while (video). There were also occasional dystonic movements in the right upper extremity. Bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen. Blood tests were notable for low ceruloplasmin levels (<0.02 g/LN: 0.22-0.58 g/L). The 24-hour urinary copper excretion was 102mug/day and 55.9 cups/day (N:3-35 cups/day), and the urinary copper was 818 cups/day after the fourth day of trientine 300mg twice daily use. Cranial MRI showed hyperintensity of the outer capsule on T2/FLAIR (fig. 1) and hypointensity of the lentiform, caudate nucleus and bilateral significant nigra on SWI (fig. 2). A diagnosis of Wilson's Disease was made and 300 mg trientine treatment was started three times a day. [fig. 1] [fig. 2] Conclusions: Tics are very rare in WD. In the literature summarized in the table, there are five other cases with stereotypical movements and tics. Table 1: Characteristics of the patients in the literature. [table 1].

3317,Explosive seizures and new-onset cortical-subcortical lesions in a patient with Wilson's disease,"Objective: We present a patient with stable neurological Wilson's disease (WD) who developed recurrent seizures and new-onset cortical-subcortical lesions and discuss possible causes of the changes. Background: Cortical-subcortical lesions and seizures have been reported in 5-10% and 4-8% of patients with WD, respectively, and are often observed simultaneously. However, they have not been reported to occur in a stable patient receiving treatment. Methods: An eight-year-old boy developed progressive dysarthria, gait instability, and behavioral changes over the course of 18 months. Examination also showed Kayser-Fleischer rings, Wilson's faces, and diffuse dystonia. He could walk independently and get high grades in school. He was diagnosed with WD. T2W and FLAIR brain MRIs showed symmetrical basal ganglia and thalamic lesions; there was no cortical lesion [fig.1]. With copper chelation (penicillamine increased gradually from 125 mg/day to 1 g/day) there was significant neurological improvement over the next 10 months. Although he developed recurrent seizures at this point; initially every few weeks, but after two months more than once a day despite antiepileptics. He became dull, sleepy, and unstable. Brain MRI repeated one year after the initial scan showed new-onset patchy lesions in the frontal and parietal cortical-subcortical areas [fig.2]. Clinical and electrical frontal lobe seizures were seen on video EEG. Intravenous benzodiazepines and levetiracetam and pulse methylprednisolone (to reduce brain inflammation) were administered and seizures were controlled immediately. Longer-term antiepileptic therapy was also intensified. Penicillamine was maintained at 1g/d. Cognition and balance improved over the next few weeks. Results: It has been shown that very frequent or prolonged seizures (in diseases other than WD) cause acute postictal cortical lesions. Such changes are believed to result from seizure-induced neuronal hyperexcitation, increased cellular metabolic demand, and sodium/potassium ATP pump failure. In WD, copper deposits in cortical gray matter increase cellular metabolic stress. We hypothesize that recurrent seizures markedly increase this stress, accelerate cellular damage and death, and lead to new-onset cortical-subcortical lesions and even more seizures. Conclusion: Late-onset seizures and concurrent cortical lesions may develop in stable WD patients who are treated. We hypothesize that seizures may contribute to the development of lesions. If true, this suggests that rapid control of seizures may limit such cortical-subcortical lesions.",,"Aggarwal, A.;Munshi, M.;Gadgil, P.;Sanghvi, D.;Bhatt, M.",2018,October,,0,0,

To review important diagnoses and tests in riveting rare condition. To highlight the different drugs that can be used in patients with neurological Wilson's Disease. Background: Wilson's Disease is a rare genetic disease that results in pathological copper deposition in the liver, brain, cornea, kidney and heart muscle. Wilson's Disease has a prevalence rate of 30 cases per million, which is characterized as a rare disease according to the criteria of the European Public Health Commission. Methods: Two cases of Neurological Wilson's Disease were reviewed. The first of these is ataxia and parkisonian symptoms, and the other is in the dysonic form. Results: Two cases of Neurological Wilson's Disease presented with Kayser-Fleischer rings containing low serum copper, low ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper on the background of progressive movement disorder and normal liver enzymes. Cranial Imaging revealed symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensities on T2/FLAIR. The 8th International Wilson's Disease Scoring System Meeting and the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale also helped in the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients. In both cases, a low copper diet was the mainstay of treatment. Zinc supplementation was also initiated, noting remarkable improvements in speech, tremor, and stiffness of the extremities. The first case received D-Penicillamine therapy with slow escalation of the drug to avoid haematological consequences and monitor paradoxical neurological deterioration, as in the second case, the patient continued to take Zinc supplements because of his relatively severe initial neurological condition. Treatment should still be individualized, as no two patients with Wilson's Disease are the same. Botulinum toxin injection may be recommended for patients with debilitating movement disorder who are resistant to chelation and medical therapy. Screening of the patient's siblings and monitoring of serum ceruloplasmins is a major part of management. Conclusions: These cases are often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed due to their rarity and diverse presentation. A comprehensive study is required to confirm the diagnosis. To date, there is no test other than genetic methods that can be considered diagnostic alone. As for management, the earlier the intervention is initiated, the better the prognosis for recovery. There are several treatment options and should be tailored to each Neurological Wilson Disease patient. Since Neurological Wilson's Disease is considered a Copper Toxicity, urgent diagnostic evaluation and early treatment are essential.",,"Porlas, R.;De Castillo, L.;Dioquino, C.",2018,October,,0,0,
3319,"Neurological improvement with WTX101 treatment in a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in Wilson's Disease","Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize neurological manifestations in patients with Wilson's Disease (WD) and to describe specific neurological changes after 24 weeks of treatment with WTX101. Background: There are largely unmet needs regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of WD treatments. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a once-daily dosed, oral investigational first-in-class copper-protein binding agent that rapidly improves disability and neurological status in a 24-week prospective Phase 2 trial in WD. Methods: Adult patients with WD (treatment-naive or with <=2 years of chelation or zinc therapy) received a response-guided individual dose of WTX101 (15-120 mg once daily) for 24 weeks. Changes in neurological status were characterized using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: Of the 28 enrolled patients, 25 had neurological symptoms. Baseline mean UWDRS Part II (disability) and III (neurological status) scores were 6.6 (SD 10.0; range 0-35) and 22.8 (SD 21.0; range 0-83), respectively. By week 24, both the mean [SD] UWDRS Part II score (4.1 [8.2]; p<0.001) and the Division III score (16.6 [17.7]; p<0.0001) had improved. Taken over time II. Part and III. There was a highly significant predictive relationship between the part total scores (p<0.0001). The most common UWDRS Part III abnormalities at baseline were postural arm tremor (71%), dysarthria (68%), gait (61%), and limb dexterity and coordination scale items, such as altered hand movements (71%), finger tapping (57%) was. , handwriting (54%) and leg agility (54%). The most severely affected items were handwriting and dysarthria (mean [SD] scores of 2.0 [0.8] and 1.8 [0.9], respectively). The greatest mean improvements (% change) over 24 weeks were observed for handwriting (51.4%), leg agility (40.8%), postural arm tremor (39.5%) and altered hand movements (35.0%). Grouping of total tremor or limb dexterity and coordination items showed similar improvements (34.2% and 29.2%, respectively). WTX101 was generally well tolerated and no early drug-induced neurological deterioration was observed. Conclusions: Neurological manifestations were common in this cohort of patients with WD. Improved neurological status after WTX101 treatment correlates with reduced patient-reported disability. Combined with simplified dosing and an appropriate safety profile, the WTX101 has the potential to meet the unmet needs in WD.",,"Bega, D.;Bronstein, J.;Nicholl, D.;Askari, F.;Ala, A.;Ferenci, P.;Bjartmar, C.;Weiss, K.

3320,Copper deposition in oligodendroglial cells in an autopsy case of hepatolenticular degeneration,"We report a case of hepatolenticular degeneration termed Wilson's disease (WD) in a 31-year-old Japanese man with extensive copper deposition in the liver, kidney, and brain. The liver showed severe cirrhotic changes with macronodular pseudolobule formation, but there was little difference in the immunohistochemical expression patterns of the copper transporter ATP7B between the control and current case. There were both WD-related lesions in the brain, such as a scattering of Opalski cells, and changes caused by hepatic encephalopathy, which included the appearance of Alzheimer's type II glia. Remarkably, we identified copper deposits in systemic organs, including hepatocytes, renal tubules, and large areas of the brain. Surprisingly, upon further investigation, copper deposition in the brain was identified rarely in neuronal cells, but in Olig2-positive glial cells with double immunohistochemical staining. Together, this rare autopsy case highlights a novel cellular candidate affected by abnormal copper metabolism and the need for systemic examination of copper accumulation in WD.

3321,Exome sequencing of an adolescent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease describes a clinically viable case of Wilson's disease,"Diagnostic whole-exome sequencing has proven highly successful in a number of rare diseases, particularly in early-onset genetic conditions. However, in more common conditions, diagnostic exome sequencing remains an exception. Here, we describe a patient who was initially diagnosed with a diffuse, complex liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who was determined to have Wilson's disease (WD) on investigational exome sequencing. The patient presented as a 14.5-year-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin, and histological examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. A large longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD was recruited and found to undergo WDbyexomedylation 4 years later. This new diagnosis, which was clinically confirmed by 24-hour urine copper measurement, led to a change in treatment from lifestyle counseling to directed therapy with D-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, with exome sequencing and careful interpretation, the probability of making a correct diagnosis and therefore choosing the appropriate treatment is increased. This example demonstrates the usefulness of diagnostic exo-sequencing in more common conditions that are not currently considered targets for genome-wide evaluation, and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common conditions actually have rarer genetically determined syndromes that often escape clinical detection. . .

3322,Pregnancy in Wilson's disease: treatment and outcome,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism that causes toxic hepatic and neural copper accumulation. Clinical symptoms range widely from asymptomatic disease to acute liver failure or chronic liver disease with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Continuation of specific medical therapy for WD during pregnancy is recommended, but reports of pregnancy outcomes in patients with WD are infrequent. In a retrospective, multicenter study, 282 pregnancies in 136 WD patients were reviewed. Disease onset age, gestational age, and WD-specific treatments were recorded. Maternal complications during pregnancy, spontaneous abortion rates and birth defects were examined in terms of medical treatment during pregnancy. Worsening of liver function tests was evident in 16 (6%) of 282 pregnancies and occurred in undiagnosed patients as well as in those receiving medical treatment. Liver test abnormalities resolved in all cases after birth. Exacerbation of neurological symptoms during pregnancy was rare (1%), but tended to persist after delivery. The overall spontaneous abortion rate in the study cohort was 73 (26%) of 282. Patients diagnosed with WD and receiving medical treatment experienced significantly fewer spontaneous abortions than patients with undiagnosed WD (odds ratio, 2,853 [95% confidence interval, 1.634-4.982]). Birth defects occurred in 7 (3%) of 209 live births. Conclusion: Pregnancy is safe in WD patients receiving anticopper therapy. The rate of spontaneous abortion in treated patients was lower than in untreated patients. Although the teratogenic potential of copper chelators is a concern, the rate of birth defects in our cohort was low. WD treatment should be continued during pregnancy and patients should be closely monitored for hepatic and neurological symptoms. (Hepatology 2018;67:1261-1269).

3323,High spatial resolution LA-ICP-MS shows massive liver copper depletion in Wilson's disease rats upon Methanobactin treatment,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism that predominantly results in systemic copper accumulation in the liver. The therapeutic approach in WD patients is currently establishing a negative copper balance and maintaining copper homeostasis with the use of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine (D-PA). However, in cases of delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment compliance, or treatment failure, mortality is almost certain without liver transplantation. Also, WD patients have elevated liver copper levels, even after years of D-PA therapy. We have recently proposed the use of the bacterial peptide Methanobactin (MB), which has an outstanding binding affinity for copper, as a potentially efficient and patient-friendly remedy against copper damage in WD. Here, we significantly confirm these findings by showing significant removal of copper from liver samples of WD rats in short, only one-week MB treatments. Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with spatial resolution up to 4 mm, we show that only small copper hotspots remain in MB-treated animal livers. We also showed a lower liver copper concentration in the liver of WD rats seven weeks after the discontinued MB treatment compared to the untreated control animals. Therefore, MB highly efficiently depletes liver copper overload with a sustained therapeutic effect. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",,"Muller, J.

3324,Steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease,"Objective: To determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in children (>= 12 years of age) and adult patients receiving trientine dihydrochloride therapy prior to the study. Methods: Twenty patients were exposed to trientine (trientine dihydrochloride capsules supplied by Univar) after standard oral dosing as part of ongoing therapy. Plasma trientine concentration was determined before and 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 hours post-dose. Trientine concentrations in plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS using a validated bioanalytical method with stable labeled trientine as internal standard. Results: Trientine was absorbed fairly rapidly, with a median T<inf>max</inf> of generally 1.49 hours (range, 0.48-4.08 hours). There was some variability in exposure, with a 10-fold range in C<inf>max</inf> and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly lower when dose-normalized for PK parameters (6.7-fold range in C<inf>max</inf>/D and 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). The identifiable terminal half-life in 14 of 20 patients was largely consistent between patients (range 2.33 to 6.99 hours). There was no significant difference in pharmacokinetics between adult patients (n = 16) and children (n = 4). The C<inf>max</inf> range was 506 to 3100 ng/mL in adults and 309 to 1940 ng/mL in children - equivalent ranges for AUC0-t were 1240 to 17,100 ng/mL hour and 1500 to 8060 ng/mL h. When the PK parameters were normalized for the administered dose, C<inf>max</inf>/D and AUC0-t/D for children were kept within the ranges for adult patients. Results: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of trientine in patients with Wilson's disease were broadly similar to those reported in healthy subjects.

3325,A case report of a successful pregnancy with zinc sulfate in a woman with Wilson's disease.,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder. Untreated disease often causes infertility and often causes miscarriages in cases where pregnancy does occur. However, drugs such as Zinc salts and Penicillamine have resulted in successful pregnancy outcomes. We present a case of successful pregnancy in a woman with Wilson's disease using zinc sulfate. Case: A 19-year-old female patient with Wilson's disease applied to us in her first pregnancy. At the time of diagnosis, Serum Ceruloplasmin was 27 lmol/L and 24-hour urine Cu was 2.28 lmol. AST and ALT were 47 U/L and 54 U/L. Penicillamine was initially started and then converted to Zinc acetate 50 mg tds 06 months prior to its presentation. OGTT, liver profile and 2D ECHO (17+1) at the time of reservation were normal. Multiple hypoechoic nodules were detected in the abdomen of the USS, consistent with the changes in Wilson's disease, without portal hypertension in the liver. Morphological scan was normal. Zinc sulfate and folic acid treatment was continued. Liver profile and fetal growth were normal throughout pregnancy. She had cesarean section at 37 weeks due to breech presentation. The baby (girl) was 3650 g and healthy. Discussion: Zinc is increasingly used in the treatment of Wilson's disease due to its low side effects. Inhibits the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract; inhibits the serosal passage of copper into the blood. It is widely used during pregnancy due to its very low teratogenicity.

ELISA was performed to analyze the expression of vascular injury factors. Pathological changes in cerebral vessels were observed with HE staining. Immunohistochemistry experiments were performed to analyze the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and GRP78. Western blot was measured to analyze the expression of caspase-3, caspase-12, PERK, eIF2alpha and CHOP. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL test. Expression of vascular injury factors and ICAM-1, VCAM-1 were significantly increased with WD and significantly decreased in the GanDouLing-Penicillamine group. Caspase-3, caspase-12, PERK, eIF2alpha and CHOP expression were clearly expressed in the Wilson group, GanDouLing-Penicillamine suppressed apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our findings suggested that GanDouLing-Penicillamine ameliorates cerebrovascular injury through the PERK/eIF2alpha/CHOP ER stress pathway in the mouse model of WD.

3328,"Wilson's Disease: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Indian National Society for Liver Research, the Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, and the Movement Disorders Society of India","Clinical practice guidelines for Wilson's disease (WD) were published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of Liver in 2008 and 2012, respectively. Their focus was on the hepatic aspects of the disease. Recently, an opinion paper on pediatric WD was published by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. The need was felt to harmonize guidelines for the hepatic, pediatric, and neurological aspects of disease and make them suitable for resource-constrained settings. Therefore, experts from Indian national associations representing 3 disciplines hepatology (National Liver Research Society of India), pediatric hepatology (Indian Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Society) and neurology (Movement Disorders Society of India) came together. Develop new guidelines. A literature review on retrospective and prospective studies of WD was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed). Members voted on each recommendation using the nominal voting technique. The Rating, Evaluation, Development and Evaluation system was used to determine the quality of the evidence. Questions were asked about the diagnostic tests, the scoring system, and its modification to a version suitable for resource-constrained settings. While ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper remain important, serum copper and penicillamine loading testing have little role in the diagnostic algorithm. A new scoring system - Modified Leipzig score has been proposed by adding additional scores for family history and serum ceruloplasmin less than 5 mg/dl. Liver dry copper estimation and penicillamine challenge test were excluded from the scoring system. Differences in pharmacological approach to neurological and liver disease and global monitoring scales are included. Increased bilirubin and worsening encephalopathy are suggested as indicators that predict the need for liver transplantation but need confirmation. Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for comprehensive WD management that will be valuable to all specialties.

Currently, treatment of Wilson's disease focuses on achieving a negative copper balance with chelators (eg, d-penicillamine, trientine, and tetrathiomolybdate) or zinc, which reduces copper absorption, or a combination thereof. 1 However, these lifelong treatment regimens often cause side effects and do not restore normal copper metabolism.

Based on the data from this study, we aimed to provide better treatment options for patients with Wilson's disease. Methods: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which maintains clinical records of approximately 99% of Taiwanese residents. The database used is a random sample of two million out of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD region in 2005. Integrated medical records of these two million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Persons with Wilson's disease, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and specific prescription drugs (including D-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in the outpatient or inpatient registry. Results: During the study period, 66 Wilson's disease cases were detected. The male female ratio was 1.75. The mean prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the mean annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was mostly made at the ages of 20-24 and 10-14, followed by the ages of 25-29. Fifty-four (81.8%) of all subjects started treatment with D-penicillamine compared to zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Liver transplantation was performed in 27 (40.9%) of these 66 cases due to liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) due to liver failure. Conclusion: D-penicillamine is still the most popular prescription for Wilson's disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a positive potential outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study. Copyright © 2017",,"Tai, C. S.;Wu, J. F.;Chen, H. L.;Hsu, H.

3334,Modulation of chemosensitivity of tumors to platinum-based antitumor drugs by transcriptional regulation of copper homeostasis.,"Platinum (Pt)-based antitumor agents have been effective in the treatment of many human malignancies. Drug import, intracellular mixing, and export by the high-affinity copper (Cu) transporter (hCtr1), Cu chaperone (Ato x1) and Cu exporters (ATP7A and ATP7B) cumulatively contribute to the chemosensitivity of Pt, respectively. drugs, including cisplatin and carboplatin, but not oxaliplatin. This entire system can also process Pt drugs through interactions between Pt and thiol-containing amino acid residues in these proteins; interactions are strongly influenced by cellular redox regulators such as glutathione. hCtr1 expression is induced by acute Cu deprivation and induction is regulated by transcription factor-specific protein 1 (Sp1), which is also regulated by Cu concentration variations per se. Copper alters zinc (Zn) coordination in the zinc finger (ZF) domains of Sp1 and inactivates DNA binding, while Cu deprivation increases Sp1-DNA interactions and increases Sp1 expression, which upregulates hCtr1. Due to the shared transport system, the chemosensitivity of Pt drugs can be modulated by targeting Cu transporters. A Cu-lowering agent (trientine) in combination with a Pt drug (carboplatin) has been used in clinical studies to overcome Pt resistance. Future research should aim to further develop effective Pt drug retention strategies to improve treatment efficacy. Copyright Â© 2018 belongs to the authors.

3335,Are there genetic variants that explain the phenomenon of donor cell survival following blood transfusion?,"Background/Case Studies: Despite the availability of leuko-depleted blood components, donor leukocyte engraftment (transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM)) has been shown to remain a long-term consequence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in some patient groups. The mechanism of survival of donor leukocytes following blood transfusion is unclear and genetic factors are speculated as a possible cause. This study was conducted to determine if there is any association between an individual's genetic profile and the occurrence of TAM in blood transfusion recipients. Study Design/Methods: Australian trauma patients (n = 86) transfused with RBC units between 2000 and 2012 with an injury severity score greater than 15 were recruited. TAM was detected in 12 of these patients. To date, whole exome sequencing has been performed on four patients with TAM and four patients without TAM. Alignment of exome data with the human genome reference sequence assembly GRCh37 was performed and analysis of different genetic variations was performed. Variations specific to at least 50% of patients in each group were further investigated, focusing primarily on genes associated with immune regulation. Results/Finding: Preliminary analysis was performed. Most of the changes found in 2 of the four patients with TAM were present in highly heterogeneous genes, including zinc finger protein genes and human leukocyte antigen genes (HLA-B and HLD-DRB1). Some of the most interesting changes were found in genes of unknown function, such as Chr4 70257329 variant ID248066. In addition, changes were detected in the following genes, the BTN3A1 gene (Chr6 26405815 variant ID 340887), which has a role in the regulation and proliferation of T cells, and the CCL8 gene, which is a chemokine (chr 17 32647356 variant ID 847320). contributes to tumor-associated leukocyte removal. Conclusion: Next-generation (whole exome) sequencing technologies allow the investigation of genetic variations among different population groups, and this may provide clues for potential indications of the mechanisms by which TAM may occur in certain patients. This preliminary analysis provides potential genetic changes that may include genes involved in T cell regulation and proliferation. Further analysis with expanded patient numbers is expected to allow further exploration of these genomic data.

3336,Wilson's disease occurring during pregnancy: a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the transport of copper and causes hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Changes in pregnancy can mimic certain clinical features of chronic liver disease, such as spider nevi, and limitations in using various studies for diagnosis pose a challenge for physicians.

3338,Wilson's disease in 2018,"Wilson's disease (WD) is characterized by the accumulation of harmful copper in the liver and brain. It is one of the rare genetic disorders that benefit from effective treatments that significantly alter the prognosis. The establishment of a national reference center in 2005, which was recertified this year, and the inclusion of patients in a national registry have allowed us to advance in the knowledge and management of this rare disease. The clinical prevalence is estimated at 1.5/100 000 in France, but the genetic prevalence is higher at around 1/7,000. An incomplete penetration of the gene or the presence of modifier genes may explain the difference. The clinical spectrum of WD is broader as expected, with 6% of patients having symptomatic presentations and late onset over 40 years of age. WD is suspected when ceruloplasminemia is low and 24-hour urinary copper excretion is elevated. Recently, significant diagnostic progress has been achieved with the administration of direct dosage of toxic free copper called exchangeable copper. The exchangeable copper/total copper (REC) ratio > 18.5% provides the diagnosis of WD with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, copper > 2.08 mumol/L, which can change at the time of diagnosis, is an indicator of the severity of extrahepatic (brain and retina) involvement. WD therapy is based on an initial active and long chelating phase (with Trolovol<sup></sup> or Trientine<sup></sup>) followed by a maintenance phase with Trientine<sup></sup> or Zinc salt. . The two most important problems that can be encountered are neurological deterioration at the initial stage and non-adherence to treatment at the maintenance stage. Liver transplantation is the recommended treatment option in WD with acute liver failure or end-stage liver cirrhosis; Its indication should be considered when rapid neurological deterioration occurs despite effective chelation. Regular clinical, biological, and hepatic ultrasound monitoring is essential to assess treatment efficacy, tolerance, and compliance, as well as to detect the appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. The near future is promising with the arrival of a new chelator, tetrathiomolybdate, and the development of gene therapy.

3340,Associations between zinc deficiency and metabolic abnormalities in patients with chronic liver disease,"Zinc (Zn) is an important trace element with positive antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects. The liver mainly plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic Zn homeostasis. Therefore, the emergence of chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis or fatty liver causes disruption of Zn metabolism and subsequent Zn deficiency. Zn deficiency causes many metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Conversely, metabolic abnormalities such as hypoalbuminemia often result in Zn deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis. Recent studies have uncovered the mechanisms putatively where Zn deficiency evokes various metabolic abnormalities in chronic liver disease. Zn supplementation has shown beneficial effects on such metabolic abnormalities in experimental models and in real patients with chronic liver disease. This review summarizes the pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities caused by Zn deficiency and the positive effects of Zn administration in patients with chronic liver disease. We also highlight interactions between Zn and other trace elements, vitamins, amino acids or hormones in such patients. Copyright Â© 2018 belongs to the authors.

3342,Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a potentially treatable, inherited disorder of copper metabolism characterized by pathological copper deposition. WD is caused by mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, leading to disruption of copper homeostasis and copper overload in the liver, brain, and other organs. The clinical course of WD may vary according to the type and severity of symptoms, but progressive liver disease is a common feature. Patients may also present with neurological disorders and psychiatric symptoms. WD is diagnosed using diagnostic algorithms that include clinical symptoms and signs, copper metabolism measurements, and DNA analysis of ATP7B. Current treatments include chelation therapy and zinc salts, which reverse copper overload through different mechanisms. In addition, liver transplantation is indicated in selected cases. New agents such as tetrathiomolybdate salts are currently being investigated in clinical trials and genetic treatments are being tested in animal models. Prognosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment; however, an important issue is to diagnose patients before they start serious symptoms. Therefore, advances in WD screening may bring earlier diagnosis and improvements for patients with WD.

3343,Successful Treatment of Hypersplenism with Partial Splenic Embolization in Wilson's Disease,"Objective: Hypersplenism can be seen in patients with Wilson's disease (WD). Surgical splenectomy is the traditional treatment for this condition; however, emotional and neurological deterioration may follow splenectomy. In recent years, partial splenic embolization (PSE) has been increasingly applied as a non-surgical alternative treatment for hypersplenism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PSE compared to splenectomy in the treatment of hypersplenism in WD patients. Methods: Fifty WD patients with hypersplenism were randomly divided into two groups (group A and group B) of 25 patients each. Patients in groups A and B were treated with PSE and splenectomy, respectively. Data were collected on the clinical efficacy of each procedure, adverse reactions, hematological and blood chemistry test results, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan findings (group A only). Results: Significant improvements were observed in platelet and leukocyte counts after PSE and splenectomy in all patients. PSE was associated with improved liver function without serious complications and no significant changes in emotional and neurological symptoms were observed. In contrast, seven WD patients experienced neurological deterioration after splenectomy. Conclusions: Hypersplenism in WD patients was successfully treated with PSE, which appears to be a safe and effective alternative therapy for WD-induced hypersplenism. Copyright Â© 2017 Author(s).

3345,"Clinical features, laboratory findings and prognosis in fulminant Wilson's disease","Introduction: We evaluated the 16-year experience of pediatric patients with fulminant Wilson's disease (WD). Materials and Methods: We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of 12 (12.2%) patients with fulminant WD out of 98 pediatric patients with fulminant liver failure. At admission PELD-MELD, Child-Pugh scores and new Wilson indices were calculated. Prognoses were also recorded. Results: There were 12 fulminant WD patients, 9 of whom were women (75%). The mean age of arrival was 9.3+/-1.59 years (range: 7.3-12.5 years). At the time of admission, 4 patients had no signs of encephalopathy, 2 patients had stage 1, 3 patients had stage 2, and 3 patients had stage 3 encephalopathy. 6 patients had ascites. Mean hemoglobin, white blood cell count and platelet levels were 7.43+/-2.67 g/dL, 20.330+/-12.430/mm3 and 131,820+/-93.650/mm3 respectively. Liver function tests during reference; total bilirubin: 39.26+/-15.66 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 27+/-11.76 mg/dL, AST: 513.66+/-943.6 U/L, ALT: 164.6+/-331.8 U/L, GGT: 78.4+ /-71.8 U/L, ALP: 234+/-250.6 U/L, albumin 2.8+/-0.73 g/dL, prothrombin time 36.44+/-16.29 sec, INR 4+ /-2.25. Mean creatinine value was 0.83+/-0.24 mg/dL, mean glomerular filtration rate was 77.66+/-64.84 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 5 patients had tubulopathy in the follow-up. 9 patients had low ceruloplasmin levels. Ceruloplasmin levels ranged from 5.9-26 mg/dL (mean 13.8+/-7.4 mg/dL). 24-hour urine copper was measured in 4 patients and the mean was 430+/-600 mugr/dL. The other 4 patients underwent a loading test and the mean urine copper was 3155+/-2490 mugr/dL. Mean PELD values, Child Pugh scores, and new Wilson indices were 32.1+/-11.5 (range: 16-48), 11.44+/-1.66 (range: 10-15), and 15.44+/-1.94 (range: 12-18) . , respectively. There was only 1 patient over 11 years of age with a MELD value of 40. Plasmapheresis in all patients, D-penicillamine in 3 patients, D-penicillamine, zinc and steroid in 2; Trientine, zinc and steroids for 2 patients. 4 patients died, 6 patients underwent liver transplantation, and 2 patients survived spontaneously. Histopathological examinations of explant livers or post-mortem liver necropsy specimens were evaluated in 9 patients. 7 patients had cirrhosis, 1 patient had chronic active hepatitis, and 1 patient had diffuse microvesicular steatosis. The mean tissue copper level was 440+/-347 mugr/g dry liver tissue. 5 patients who underwent liver transplantation had a living donor and 1 patient had a cadaveric donor. They were followed for 9+/-3.3 years (range: 4.5-12 years) after transplantation. Conclusion: Fulminant WD is extremely fatal if liver transplantation cannot be performed. Initiation of plasmapheresis and chelation therapy in low-risk patients may be life-saving.

3346,Wilson's Disease: A case report. [Portuguese],"Objective: This report describes a rare genetic disorder called Wilson's Disease, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and whose symptoms are easily confused with other diseases. The underlying cause of the clinical manifestations is the accumulation of copper in various parts of the human body, especially in places such as the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea, due to mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper transport protein, Cu+2 ATPase. It is found in the Golgi complex of hepatocytes. Liver changes may present as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and, more rarely, fulminant hepatitis. Neurological changes are variable, predominantly extrapyramidal symptoms, tremor, dystonia, dysarthria, mood changes and if untreated psychiatric symptoms, progressive decrease in intellectual capacity. One of the most unusual features of this syndrome is the great variability of phenotypic manifestations in patients with the same mutation. In the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, various biochemical parameters are analyzed: serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, urinary copper excretion and hepatic copper concentration. In addition, eye examination is performed with the observation of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Because symptoms and laboratory abnormalities can often be associated with other diseases, genetic studies may be performed to complete and facilitate the diagnosis. Treatment is based on the use of copper chelating drugs. D-penicillamine is the drug of choice in up to 50% of patients, despite the risk of neurological deterioration and various side effects associated with its use. Trientine and tetrathiomolybdate are alternative drugs, the latter chosen for people with neurological symptoms. Zinc is indicated for asymptomatic or maintenance therapy. Early treatment prevents serious complications. Case report: A 14-year-old patient from Poco Fundo-MG sought medical attention due to frequent episodes of facial paralysis, particularly in the mandibular region, causing dysphagia and dysphonia, as well as irritability and gait abnormalities. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed ""signs of edema in the bilateral striatum, caudate nuclei, and caudate nuclei and symmetrical signal changes with atrophy of the pale spheres"" from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Considering the family history of Wilson's syndrome, differential diagnosis was made with serum ceruloplasmin and serum and urine copper concentration showing changes typical of Wilson's syndrome, and ocular biomicroscopy confirming the presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring. The patient's absence of pre-existing liver disease indicates that the disease does not always manifest as expected and reflects the difficulty of early diagnosis, which may prevent the appearance of the first symptoms. All patients with Wilson's syndrome require multidisciplinary care as it is a disease that can significantly affect various organs and systems.

3347,Difficulties in diagnosing Wilson's disease in a country with limited resources,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, resulting in decreased biliary excretion of copper, caused by accumulation of Copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. It can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease from other diseases, such as hepatic dysfunctions, musculoskeletal manifestations, and neuropsychiatric features. Purpose: To describe the challenges of Wilson's disease, which was first diagnosed at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Case: A 13-year-old boy born from consanguineous marriage presented with anemia one year ago. Thalassemia and subsequently leukemia were suspected, but further diagnostic procedures yielded negative results. He had a history of melena due to 3rd degree esophageal varices and varicose ligation was performed. Six months later, he was referred to the Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases Clinic with the suspicion of hereditary metabolic diseases and dysarthria due to involuntary movements of the arms and legs. Physical examination revealed skin pigmentation, Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes, and hepatosplenomegaly and severe malnutrition. Laboratory findings revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia and mildly elevated liver transaminases, normal serum electrolytes, plasma glucose, and kidney function. High signal hyperintensities were seen in bilateral basal ganglia on brain MRI T2-weighted images. One of our differential diagnoses was Wilson's disease, so we took blood and urine samples from abroad. Results showed low serum ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper. We diagnosed Wilson's disease based on the above research and it was then treated with D-penicillamine, zinc and diazepam. Conclusion: It is necessary to be suspicious for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, especially in a child with liver disease and neurological findings. Due to the lack of awareness and limited diagnostic methods in our country, it is still difficult to diagnose Wilson's disease.",,"Pratita, W.;Rachmawati, N.;Sjarif, D.

3348,Late-onset fulminant Wilson's disease with a clinical diagnosis without cirrhosis: A case report.,"64-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital with the complaints of bulbar conjunctival jaundice and general weakness. He developed hepatic encephalopathy after admission and was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis, according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) position report. Later, additional laboratory findings revealed that serum ceruloplasmin levels were decreased, urinary copper levels were greatly increased, and routine tests specific to Wilson's disease (WD) were positive, although the Kayser-Fleischer ring was unclear. Based on the AASLD practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of WD, the patient was eventually diagnosed with fulminant WD. Then penicillamine and zinc acetate administration was started; however, the patient unfortunately died of acute pneumonia on the 28th day of his hospitalization. At autopsy, the liver did not show a bridging pattern of fibrosis suggestive of chronic liver injury.

Existing WD models all show good resemblance to human hepatic WD and have helped to better understand human disease. As mammals, mouse, rat and dog models also benefit from high homology to the human genome. However, between these mammalian models and human diseases, Significant differences exist, especially in the absence of a convincing neurological phenotype.This review will first provide an overview of our current knowledge of the orthologous genes encoding ATP7B and the closely related ATP7A protein in C. elegans, Drosophila and zebrafish (Danio rerio), and then ATP7B Deficiency of rodent and larger mammalian models of key features I will summarize. .

3350,High genetic carrier frequency of Wilson's disease in France: inconsistencies with clinical prevalence,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease caused by ATP7B gene mutations that cause excessively high copper levels, particularly in the liver and brain. The WD phenotype differs in clinical presentation and intensity. Diagnosing this metabolic disorder is important because a lifelong treatment based on the use of copper chelating agents or zinc salts is more effective if started early. The worldwide prevalence of WD is variable, with an average of 1/30,000. In France, a recent study based on French health insurance data estimates the clinical prevalence of the disease to be around 3/200,000. Methods: To estimate the genetic prevalence of WD in France, we analyzed the ATP7B gene by Next Generation Sequencing from a large cohort of French indiscriminate subjects. Results: We observed a high heterozygous carrier frequency of ATP7B in France. Among the 697 subjects studied, 18 variants classified as heterozygous or possibly pathogenic were found in 22 subjects (22 alleles/1394 alleles), giving a prevalence of 0.032 or 1/31 subjects. Conclusions: This important and unexplained difference between the frequency of heterozygous carriers and the clinical prevalence of WD may be explained by clinical variability, incomplete penetration, and the presence of modifier genes. It suggests that molecular analysis of ATP7B should always be interpreted with caution, particularly with respect to exome sequencing, alongside copper assays (ceruloplasmin, relative variable copper, 24-hour urinary copper excretion).

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 90 patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease was performed (according to Ferrenci criteria). Hepatic outcome was classified as resolution (R=normal LFT & asymptomatic), partial resolution (P=near-normal LFT & asymptomatic), worsening or deterioration (W/D), and requiring transplant (OLT). Results: Hepatic (H) 75.5%, neurological (N) 16.6%, and combined hepatic and neurologic (H+N) 7.7% disease, mean 9.5 years and 10.9 years of age in H in N & H & N. Mean symptom duration was 5.2 months in H&H+N and 8.76 months in N. 14.4% had a history of consanguinity. 38.8% had a family history. Hepatic manifestations were: Acute hepatitis-16%; acute liver failure-6.6; in acute chronic liver failure - 26.6%; compensated chronic liver disease (C CLD) - 5.3%; decompensated cirrhosis (D CLD) - 45%. 38.8% had varicose veins & 75% had H and 90.9% had CF rings in H+N &N.

3354,A case of Wilson's disease presenting with acute pancreatitis,"Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with hepatic or neurological presentation. Wilson's disease presenting as pancreatitis has been described in only two case reports previously and has been linked to copper deposition in the pancreas or the formation of gallstones. Here, we present a case of Wilson's disease in a young adult presenting with acute pancreatitis and associated with gallstones. Case Summary: A 17-year-old female patient presented with complaints of upper abdominal pain, jaundice for 2 days and non-bilious vomiting for 1 day. He had never experienced anything like this before. The patient had no significant addiction and no contributing family or perinatal history. He had normal scholastic abilities. Clinical examination revealed jaundice, pallor and mild epigastric tenderness. Studies showed Irregular Liver function test in the form of hemolytic anemia, mild hyperbilirubenimia and transaminitis. Pancreatic enzymes were markedly elevated (amylase 816U/L/lipase 906U/L). Imaging showed features of Acute Interstitial Edema Pancreatitis, Calculous Cholecystitis, Splenomegaly, and Slightly Acidic Rough Liver Parenchyma. He was conservatively treated for biliary pancreatitis and showed good recovery. The study was performed concurrently for Chronic Liver Disease eliciting a low serum Ceruloplasmin level (0.05 g/l), high 24-hour urine copper (1123.8 mcg/day), and a Positive CF Ring. After Wilson's disease was diagnosed, d-Penicillamine and Zinc Treatment was started. In the follow-up, biochemical parameters improved and 24-hour urinary copper gradually decreased to 168 mcg/day.

3355,Stroke in a young patient with Wilson's disease: the specter of 'rebalanced hemostasis',"Background: Coagulopathy is an essential component of hepatic cell failure and reflects the central role of liver function in hemostasis. Case Summary: We present a case of Wilson's disease, a seven-year-old boy who presented with jaundice and abdominal distension for two weeks and had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia in the last five days. She was taking Penicillamine 500 mg three times a day. On examination, he was found to have chronic liver disease, decompensated, grade I hepatic encephalopathy, and minimal ascites. In laboratory examinations, thrombocytopenia (64,000/mm3), Blood glucose 52mg/dl, Serum albumin; 2.5mg/dl, Bilirubin; 17mg/dl, Serum Alanine transaminase; 52IU/L, Aspartate transaminase; 153IU/L, Alkaline phosphatase; 211IU/L and international normalized rate 3.1. The patient with a donor mother is listed as priority for liver transplant with a PELD of 32 and a Na MELD of 30. However, within 7 days of enlistment, the patient developed a sudden onset brainless stance. CT scan of the head showed acute frontal lobe venous infarction with midline shift. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died the next day, possibly from a cerebral hernia, despite all critical care measures. Conclusions: The above case illustrates the dynamic ""rebalanced hemostatic"" state in a patient with liver cirrhosis with significant coagulopathy. The risk of cerebrovascular events, especially infarction in cirrhosis, has not been clearly determined. The balance of hemostasis achieved by simultaneous reduction of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors may explain arterial and venous thrombotic events, challenging the old dogma/paradox of increased bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.",,"Javid, K.;Cg, S.;Khan, J.;Ts, R.

3356,Update on Wilson's disease: focus on WTX-101,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Treatment is lifelong to restore copper homeostasis. Current treatments are limited by multiple daily dosing and side effects, as well as a rare but serious risk of neurologic deterioration at the start of chelation therapy. Excess free copper is thought to be responsible for copper toxicity and early neurological deterioration. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (WTX-101) is one of the emerging therapies that currently appears to fill an unmet need by offering a single daily dose option and the absence of significant undesirable effects. In addition, the risk of causing early neurological deterioration appears to be low. WTX-101 forms a tight complex with copper, reducing free copper levels.

3358,WTX101-A novel copper-protein binding agent for Wilson's Disease shows long-term neurological improvement in an ongoing extension of a Phase-2 trial (WTX101-201),"Background and objectives: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class copper-protein binding agent that forms ternary complexes with albumin, reducing plasma ceruloplasmin unbound copper (NCC) and increasing bile copper excretion. Here, we present 72 weeks of preliminary data from the ongoing extension of a Phase-2 study in patients with Wilson's Disease (WD). Methods: All 22 patients who completed the 24-week open-label, single-arm study chose to continue WTX101 once daily at extension. Assessments up to 72 weeks included disability and neurological status, copper control, liver status, and safety using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At study entry, 86% of patients had neurologic symptoms associated with varying degrees of WD. From baseline to week 72, the mean (SD) UWDRS disability score was 6.6 to (10.0) 1.2 (2.1) and neurological score from 22.8 (21.0) to 9.9 increased to a (10.7). The UWDRS neurologic score increased by >=4 points in 12 patients, stabilized in 5 patients (+/-3 points), and worsened by >=4 points in 2 patients. The corrected mean (SD) NCC level for copper in the ternary complexes was 3.6 (2.1) µM at baseline and dropped to 0.5 (0.7) mM at week 72. Liver function tests and End Stage Model of Liver Disease (MELD) score improved or remained unchanged at 72 weeks. Two absences were considered unrelated to WTX101 treatment. Conclusion: Once-daily WTX101 treatment improved neurologic status and disability and controlled free copper in patients with WD for 72 weeks. The WTX101 was generally well tolerated and, with its simplified dosing, the WTX101 has the potential to meet the unmet needs in WD.",,"Czlonkowska, A.;Schilsky, M.;Askari, F.;Ferenci, P.;Bronstein, J.;Bega, D.;Ala, A.;Nicholl, D.;Weiss, K.

3359,Metallothionein is elevated in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice,"Different mutations in the copper transporter gene Atp7b are identified as the primary cause of Wilson's disease. These changes cause high copper concentrations, especially in the liver and brain, and ultimately lead to dysfunction of these organs. The Atp7<sup>(-/-)</sup> mouse is an established animal model for Wilson's disease and is characterized by abnormal copper accumulation, low serum oxidase activity, and increased urinary copper excretion. Metallothionein (MT) proteins are low molecular weight metal-binding proteins and are essential for zinc homeostasis, but are also involved in the regulation of other metals, for example copper. However, the molecular mechanisms of MT related to Atp7b still remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the expression of MT in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice and wild-type mice. Hepatic and duodenal expression of MT was measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and post-translational expression was analyzed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. MT expression in the liver and duodenum was significantly higher in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice than in controls. Hepatic and duodenal copper, iron and zinc contents were also examined. Compared to control hepatic copper and iron content, Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice had significantly lower hepatic zinc content, while copper and iron content was significantly higher. Duodenal copper and zinc content of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice was significantly lower than in controls. Duodenal iron content was also lower in Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice, but did not reach statistical significance. The results of our study show that metallothionein is elevated in the liver and duodenum of Atp7b<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice. Copyright © 2018, Author(s).",,"Zhang, C.

3360,Wilson's disease and related copper disorders,"Copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes in critical metabolic pathways. Mutations in copper metabolism genes or abnormalities in copper metabolism cause diseases caused by copper excess or deficiency. Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. More than 500 different WD mutations have been identified along the ATP7B gene, most of which are missense mutations. Mutations in both ATP7B alleles result in abnormal copper metabolism followed by toxic copper accumulation. Clinical manifestations of neurological WD include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, and choreoathetosis. Misdiagnosis and delay in treatment are clinically important as untreated WD progresses to liver failure or severe neurological disability and death. Treatment can prevent and cure WD. Mutations in the second, closely related copper-bearing ATPase, ATP7A, cause a number of copper-deficiency disorders, including Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy. Two important non-genetic causes of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy are due to copper deficiency or excessive zinc intake after gastric bypass, both of which can cause a myeloneuropathy similar to vitamin B12 deficiency. Copper deficiency can be prevented after gastric bypass, and detection and elimination of excess zinc source, often in dental cream, may result in improvement.

Here, we report 3 new unrelated cases of CCDC115-CDG, emphasizing the diagnostic difficulties associated with the strong phenotypic similarities with mitochondriopathies, Niemann-Pick disease C, and Wilson's Disease. Indeed, two individuals presented with early and severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis clinically associated with neurological symptoms, while the other ""only"" showed isolated and late severe hepatic involvement. Biological outcomes were similar to patients previously described, including hypercholesterolemia, elevated alkaline phosphatases, and defects in copper metabolism.

3363,Serebral metal birikimi ve nörodejeneratif bozukluklar-nedensel ilişki?,"Metal ions are essential for life as cofactors of various metalloproteins, but excess is toxic. Biogenic metals can be divided into bulk (e.g. calcium, magnesium), trace (e.g. iron, zinc) and ultra-trace (e.g. manganese, copper, cobalt, molybdenum) elements based on their abundance in the human body. A few other metals, such as mercury or lead, can enter the brain and cause neurotoxicity. Mutations in proteins involved in metal homeostasis cause systemic metal accumulation disorders in which tissue metal concentrations increase 5 times or more. These genetic disorders can be considered as model diseases for metal neurotoxicity. Mutations in the ATP7B copper transporter cause Wilson's disease, mutations in SLC30A10 and SLC39A14 cause manganese transporter deficiencies, and mutations in genes encoding ceruloplasmin and ferritin cause neurodegeneration with iron deposition in the brain. Environmental metal exposure can cause marked neuropathology with a severe clinical phenotype, as documented for mercury in Minamata Bay, Japan between 1930-1960 and for manganese during the epidemic of intravenous metcathione abuse in Eastern Europe 1990-2010. Disorders of cerebral metal homeostasis such as iron, copper and manganese have also been found in common sporadic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Irregular transition metals in the brain may contribute to neurodegeneration by mediating oxidative stress, altering enzymatic functions, inducing protein aggregation, and triggering neuronal death. Prominent questions for research in the metallobiology of neurodegeneration are 1) whether low levels of environmental metal exposure will cause neurotoxicity, and 2) whether correction of impaired metal homeostasis, for example, through chelation, will have a neuroprotective effect.",,"Dusek, P.",2018,July,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.12449,0,0,
3364,Wilson's disease: The supremacy of mindful awareness!,"Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a rare autosomal disease with a defined genetic abnormality identified in the 13q arm of the chromosome and a consequent defect in the hepatic copper-transporting ATPase gene (ATP7B) [1]. Core abnormality is a dysfunction of copper metabolism with abnormal biliary excretion of copper and consequent accumulation of this toxic chemical in classically defined structures (eg, cornea, liver, brain, others) [1], [2]. Various confusing presentations can be seen making an accurate diagnosis difficult; classically, there are corneal liver disease, neuropsychiatric presentations, and the Kayser-Fleischer triad of rings [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Kayser-Fleischer rings are copper deposits in the cornea where a golden discoloration of Descemet's membrane in the limbic areas is revealed on an ophthalmological examination. Liver presentation may appear similar to that of chronic active hepatitis, including cirrhosis [2]. Neuropsychiatric presentations may include symptoms suggestive of Parkinsonism with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, or basal ganglia involvement. There may also be incoordination, arm 'wing slam', dystonia and/or dystonic posture. Most have dysarthria and dysphagia may also occur. Clinical confusion is noted in encephalopathy seen in this situation, whether due to liver failure or to copper toxicity itself [5]. Diagnosis includes liver biopsy (reveals increased copper deposits) and genetic testing, along with testing of blood (including low serum ceruloplasmin) and urine (including increased urinary copper levels) [2], [6]. It is a fatal disease with no cure, which involves early detection, a low copper diet (avoiding copper utensils for cooking) and copper chelation with D-penicillamine or trientine, as well as zinc supplements [1], [2] , [3], [4] , [5], [6].

3365,Long-term evaluation of urinary copper excretion and non-ceruloplasmin-associated copper in Wilson patients under medical treatment.,"Objective: Urinary copper excretion rates and ceruloplasmin unrelated copper concentrations are increased in patients with Wilson's disease. However, there is little literature describing long-term monitoring of these parameters. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study that included data collected through chart review from 321 patients with Wilson's disease between 2003 and 2015. Patients were under treatment with D-penicillamine, trientine or zinc. 24-hour urinary copper excretion rates, non-ceruloplasmin-related copper, and total serum copper concentrations were determined at the start of treatment, as well as at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and >= 60 months from the start of treatment. . For patients receiving chelating agents, all parameters were measured while continuing treatment as well as after a 48-hour dose interruption. A mathematical formula was created to predict 24-hour urinary copper excretion rates under different treatments. Results: In all treatment groups, urinary copper excretion rates decreased over time, but inter-individual variation of results was high. Copper concentrations not associated with ceruloplasmin tended to decrease over time, but with variation of results higher than observed for urinary copper excretion rates. Conclusion: Due to their variability, urinary copper excretion rates and serum copper concentrations are less than ideal parameters to monitor the benefit of a copper-reducing therapy. Urinary copper excretion rates appear to be more appropriate for this purpose than non-ceruloplasmin-related copper concentrations. Copyright © 2018 SSIEM",,"Pfeiffenberger, J.;Lohse, C.

There was no jaundice, hepatomegaly, or neurological abnormality at presentation. An older brother died of jaundice at the age of 10. Urinalysis showed multiple dysmorphic erythrocytes without proteinuria and had leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and hypo-albuminemia (23 g/L). The C<inf>3</inf> component of complementemia was low and anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were strongly positive by immunofluorescence. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered, but severe hypoalbuminemia could not be explained. During the pre-renal biopsy study, an irregular coagulation profile in which transaminases were elevated prompted evaluation for chronic liver disease, resulting in a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

Postmortem liver biopsy showed cirrhosis and postmortem kidney biopsy showed class II features. lupus nephritis. Autoimmune antibodies and autoimmune disorders have been reported in Wilson's disease, and there have been anecdotal reports of an association between SLE and Wilson's disease.

WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational copper (Cu)-protein binding agent developed for the treatment of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B Cu-transporter resulting in toxic Cu. accumulation. 2. The mass balance of a single intravenous dose of WTX101, measured as molybdenum (Mo), was evaluated over 168 hours in control (Long Evans Agouti [LEA]) and Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, a WD model. 3. Mo is partially excreted (up to 45%) in LEC rats; Renal clearance was 29%, and fecal clearance still continuing at 168 hours was 16%. In contrast, Mo was almost completely excreted (~87%) in LEA rats; 79%, only 7% cleared renally with fecal excretion. 4. In LEC rats, the ratio of faecal and renal Mo excretion increased (4:6) compared to controls (1:9). 5. In agreement with the tissue Cu distribution, significantly more Mo was found in LEC liver and kidney compared to LEA tissues. 6. These findings are consistent with the WTX101 mechanism of action: In the WD model, excess Cu is removed from hepatic metallothionein and retained in the stable tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin ternary complex, preventing tetrathiomolybdate degradation, resulting in less urinary elimination and more stool. more breakthrough than in controls.

Copper overload can be evaluated as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper or non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in the blood. Current treatments are limited in efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple daily dosing. Areas covered: This article reviews the literature on WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), a premium oral copper-protein binding agent in development for the treatment of WD. Expert opinion: In a proof-of-concept phase II trial, WTX101 once daily for 24 weeks rapidly reduced NCC levels, accompanied by paradoxical worsening from baseline with drug-induced paradoxical worsening, reduced disability, improvement in neurological status without stable liver function. an appropriate security profile. WTX101 directly removes excess copper from intracellular hepatic copper stores and also forms an inert triplet complex with circulating copper and albumin and promotes biliary copper excretion. These mechanisms may explain the rapid biochemical and clinical improvements observed. A phase III trial of WTX101 is ongoing and results are eagerly awaited to confirm whether WTX101 can improve the treatment of this devastating disease.

3370,Zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease: a multicenter study in Japan.,"Background and Aim: Few studies of zinc monotherapy for presymptomatic Wilson's disease have focused on young children. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zinc monotherapy for such children and established criteria for maintenance therapy. Methods: We retrospectively and prospectively examined children under 10 years of age with presymptomatic Wilson's disease who received zinc monotherapy from the time of diagnosis at 12 participating pediatric centers in Japan. Results: Twenty-four patients met the entry criteria. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly reduced starting 1 month after the start of treatment and generally remained below 50 U/L after 1 to 8 years of treatment. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper decreased significantly at 6 months and remained generally below 75 cups/day and between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day for the remainder of the study. All patients continued to take zinc and none became symptomatic. In patients younger than 6 years of age receiving 50 mg/day of zinc as an initial dose, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly reduced at 1 month after the start of treatment, and gamma-glutamyltransferase and 24-hour urinary copper at 6 months. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of zinc monotherapy for young children with presymptomatic Wilson's disease. Such monotherapy has proven to be quite effective and safe. It is a reasonable target to maintain normal transaminase values (or values below 50 U/L, which is difficult to normalize) and 24-hour urinary copper excretion between 1 and 3 cups/kg/day and below 75 cups/day.

3371,Copper dyshomeostasis in Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as indicated by serum and urine copper indicators,"Abnormal use of copper is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare disorder characterized by increased plasma copper levels not bound to ceruloplasmin (nCp-Cu, also known as 'free' copper). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analyses show that copper decreases in the brain but increases in the serum due to an increase in the nCp-Cu component. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of copper biological status in the two diseases has never been made. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu, and Cu:Cp at 385 CE and 336 healthy controls previously studied and compared with 9 newly diagnosed WD patients. We next evaluated 24-hour copper urinary excretion in 24 WD patients on D-penicillamine (D-pen) therapy and 35 healthy controls, and compared the results with AD patients who participated in a previously published D-pen phase II clinical trial. After adjusting for sex and age, serum nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp resulted higher in AD and WD than in healthy controls (both p < 0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p < 0.016). 24-hour urinary copper excretion (12.05 cups/day) was higher in AD patients than in healthy controls (4.82 cups/day; p < 0.001). 24-hour urinary excretion was higher than 200 cups/day in 77.8% of AD patients under D-pen therapy, suggesting failure of copper control. This study provides a new insight into the pathophysiology of copper homeostasis in AD by demonstrating the failure of copper control and the Cu:Cp ratio as a suitable marker.

3372,Recent advances in understanding liver fibrosis: Bridging the concepts of basic science and individualized therapy [version 1; referees: 2 confirmed],"Hepatic fibrosis is characterized by the formation and accumulation of excessive fibrous connective tissue leading to progressive architectural tissue remodeling. Regardless of the underlying noxious trigger, tissue damage induces an inflammatory response involving the local vascular and immune system and a systemic mobilization of endocrine and neurological mediators, ultimately leading to activation of matrix-producing cell populations. Genetic disorders, chronic viral infection, alcohol abuse, autoimmune attacks, metabolic disorders, cholestasis, changes in bile acid composition or concentration, venous obstruction and parasitic infections are well-known factors that predispose a person to hepatic fibrosis. In addition, excess fat and other lipotoxic mediators that provoke endoplasmic reticulum stress, altered mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and modifications in the microbiota are associated with the initiation and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and subsequent hepatic fibrosis. Multidisciplinary expert panels have developed practice guidelines that include recommendations of preferred therapeutic approaches for a specific cause of liver disease, stage of fibrosis, or emerging comorbidities associated with ongoing loss of liver function.

Compared at 3-time points - at presentation, at the transition from penicillamine to zinc, and at the end of follow-up. Results: 31 patients (median age 11 [5-24] years) with symptomatic hepatic WD were studied; ten of them had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was changed to zinc sulfate either because of financial constraints (28 patients) or because of the adverse effects of penicillamine (3 patients). At admission (at baseline), six patients belonged to Child's A class, five patients to Child's B, and 17 patients to Child's C. The duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, and the duration of subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-). 728) weeks. There was a significant improvement from baseline in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Child's, MELD, Nazer, and NWI score) in switching from penicillamine to zinc. This improvement was maintained until the end of the study period with 90% survival at 10 (2-20) years. Of the 17 Child's C cirrhotic patients, 15 showed significant improvement in disease severity scores from baseline to end of follow-up. Conclusions: In resource-limited conditions, penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with symptomatic hepatic WD of all degrees of initial disease severity. Some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to WD can be managed with medical treatment by avoiding liver transplantation.

3374,Current and promising treatments for autosomal recessive ataxias,"Background and Aim: Ataxia is clinically characterized by unsteady gait and instability. Cerebellar disorders can be caused by many causes, such as metabolic diseases, stroke, or genetic mutations. Genetic causes are classified according to the mode of inheritance and include autosomal dominant, X-linked and autosomal recessive ataxias. Many years have passed since Friedreich's ataxia, the most common autosomal recessive ataxia, was described, and mutations in many other genes have now been described. Genetic mutations often result in the disappearance of the Purkinje neuron and the accumulation of toxic metabolites that ultimately cause cerebellar dysfunction. Unfortunately, recessive ataxias remain a poorly recognized group of diseases, and most of them are still incurable. Conclusion: The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive clinical profile and review available treatments. We review the physiopathology, neurological features and diagnostic approach of common recessive ataxias. Emphasis is also placed on potential drugs currently or soon to be in clinical trials. For example, promising gene therapies raise the possibility of treating Friedreich's ataxia, Ataxia-telangiectasia, Wilson's disease and Niemann-Pick disease differently in the next few years.

3375,Diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease. [German],"Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive copper overload disorder characterized by a highly variable phenotype in terms of clinical and biochemical presentation. The diagnostic pathway is often difficult, but is well characterized by compounds of the diagnostic 'Leipzig score'. Advances in genotyping have questioned the role of diagnostic liver biopsy. Wilson's disease requires lifelong medical anti-copper therapy, liver transplant in most cases limited to fulminant liver failure. Medical treatment with standard-of-care drugs shows partially ineffective responses in symptomatic neurological patients, where the novel copper modulator biscoline-tetrathiomolybdate is a promising new treatment option.

3376,Anesthetic management of cesarean delivery in a pregnant woman with Wilson's disease,"Rationale: Wilson's disease (WD) or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disease with a prevalence of 1:50,000 to 1:100,000 live births. Patient concerns: She was admitted to our hospital because she was expecting a 26-year-old primipara delivery with WD. Its main symptoms were slightly higher total bile acid (TBA) and bilateral depressive edema of the lower extremities. Diagnosis: It was a 38 weeks, 4 days, 15-year history of WD, who was controlled with penicillamine in the past and changed to zinc preparations three months before pregnancy. Results: General anesthesia was successfully applied to a woman with WD who delivered by cesarean section. Lesson: General anesthesia can be applied in an asymptomatic primigravida with WD. Appropriate anesthetic selection can effectively minimize complication and sequelae rates.

3377,case of refractory elastosis perforans serpiginosa successfully treated with ALAPDT,"Background: A 56-year-old woman with a history of cystinuria who had been on penicillamine therapy for forty years developed multiple erythematous polycyclic and ring-shaped plaques with atrophic centers and serpiginous, raised borders in the anterior neck and axilla. A punch biopsy revealed transepidermal elimination of abnormally thick elastic fibers with vertical buds. Movat stain outlined coarse entangled elastic fibers in a ""blackberry bush"" configuration throughout the dermis. A diagnosis of penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpignosa (EPS) was made. EPS is a rare condition that often occurs in the presence of underlying conditions such as Down syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos, as well as following penicillamine therapy. Penicillamine, a heavy metal chelator, is used to treat a variety of diseases such as cystinuria, Wilson's disease, and systemic sclerosis. Long-term administration has been associated with cutaneous adverse events in 20-50% of patients. Dermatoses caused by penicillamine include EPS, cutis laxa, or pseudo-pseudoxanthoma elasticum. EPS is difficult to treat and consists of cases of intralesional corticosteroids, retinoids, destruction and isolated photodynamic therapy (PDT). The patient failed multiple injections of intralesional corticosteroids and topical retinoids. He developed significant neck constrictions and wrinkles that caused physical discomfort and social anxiety. Study: The patient was treated with weekly aminolevulinic acid PDT (ALA-PDT) for 4 treatments. 1.5 ml of 20% ALA was applied to the neck and covered with plastic wrap for two hours. The patient was then irradiated with a narrow band LED at a distance of 630nm 15 cm from the neck. The initial treatment exposure dose was 99 J/cm2 and the remaining three treatment doses were 130 J/cm2. Pain was assessed during and after the procedure on a numerical scale. Clinical images were taken before and after each treatment session. Results: Clinical images revealed a significant improvement in disease activity and patient satisfaction. Conclusion: ALA-PDT is a viable option in treatment-resistant EPS.",,"Condon, S.;Lucas, J.",2017,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lsm.22650,0,0,
3378,"Clinical features, laboratory findings and prognosis in fulminant Wilson's disease","Introduction: We evaluated the 16-year experience of pediatric patients with fulminant Wilson's disease (WD). Materials and Methods: We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of 12 (12.2%) patients with fulminant WD out of 98 pediatric patients with fulminant liver failure. Results: There were a total of 12 fulminant WD patients. The mean age at arrival was 9.3}1.59 years (range: 7.3-12.5 years). At the time of admission, 4 patients had no signs of encephalopathy, 2 patients had stage 1, 3 patients had stage 2, and 3 patients had stage 3 encephalopathy. Mean hemoglobin, white blood cell count and platelet levels were 7.43}2.67 g/dL, 20.330}12.430/mm3 and 131.820}93.650/mm3 respectively. Liver function tests during reference; total bilirubin: 39.26}15.66 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 27}11.76 mg/dL, AST: 513.66}943.6 U/L, ALP: 234}250.6 U/L, INR 4}2.25. 9 patients had low ceruloplasmin levels. Mean PELD values, Child Pugh scores and new Wilson indices were 32.1}11.5 (range: 16-48), 11.44}1.66 (range: 10-15) and 15.44}1.94 (range: 12-18), respectively. While plasmapheresis was used in all patients, D-penicillamine in 3 patients, D-penicillamine, zinc and steroid in 2 patients; Trientine, zinc and steroids for 2 patients. 4 patients died, 6 patients underwent liver transplantation, and 2 patients survived spontaneously. Histopathological examinations of explant livers or post-mortem liver necropsy specimens were evaluated in 9 patients. 7 patients had cirrhosis, 1 patient had chronic active hepatitis, and 1 patient had diffuse microvesicular steatosis. The mean tissue copper level was 440}347 mugr/g dry liver tissue. Conclusion: Fulminant WD is extremely fatal if liver transplantation cannot be performed. Initiation of plasmapheresis and chelation therapy in low-risk patients may be life-saving. Most of the patients have cirrhosis findings in the histopathological examination of the liver at the time of admission.",,"Baris, Z.;Ozcay, F.;Balci Sezer, O.;Haberal, M.",2018,May,,0,0,
3379,"Three patients with glycosylation deficiencies caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane protein TMEM199, chronically elevated transaminases, and low serum ceruloplasmin and copper","Background: Ten years ago, we reported on four children with glycosylation deficiencies and a liver disease that mimics Wilson's disease but has no known genetic cause. Two (patients #1 and #2) were later diagnosed with phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency. Objectives: Here we present the long-term follow-up of two other children (#3 and #4) and data on a third, unrelated child (#5), all diagnosed with TMEM199 deficiency. Patients: Patients 3 and 4 are Italian healthy young adults who were investigated for hypertransaminasemia when they were 2 years old. In addition, total and LDL cholesterol, creatinine kinase and alkaline phosphatase values were also increased. Ceruloplasmin and serum copper were low despite normal urinary baseline and after penicillamine excretion. Liver biopsy confirmed mild fibrosis/steatosis ultrasonographically with slightly increased copper content; Wilson's disease and aceruloplasminemia were ruled out with appropriate tests. Transferrin glycosylation was consistent with a CDG-II. Patient #5 (Italian, now 2 years old) presented a similar picture at age 1; Liver biopsy was not performed. Results: Exome sequencing identified in all compound heterozygous mutations in TMEM199 (frameshift with premature stop and missense change, respectively). Western blot analysis showed the absence of TMEM199 protein in patient fibroblasts. Conclusions: Our patients present a recently identified Wilson's disease that mimics a rare disease with chronically elevated transaminases, low serum ceruloplasmin and copper, caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane protein TMEM199. Mechanisms potentially involve at least partial loss of one or both of the copper transport proteins ATP7A and ATP7B.",,"Poeta, M.;Zielinska, K.;Maccarana, M.;Mandato, C.;Ng, B.

3381,Causes of metallic taste in the mouth,"Learning Objective #1: Evaluate a patient who reports having a metallic taste in the mouth. He has been complaining of a metallic taste in his mouth for 3 weeks at the doctor's office. He works as a flight attendant, but has recently refused to travel internationally. He refused new drugs. His medications included naproxen, oral contraceptives, and Botox injections for Tourette's. The patient denied the possibility of pregnancy. The patient has already been seen for evaluation by a dentist, emergency care physician, and ENT. He had completed azithromycin treatment, as the symptoms were thought to be due to a sinus infection. Symptoms improved after the first two tablets, but later returned. In the ED, the metallic taste was thought to be related to allergies where the patient was taking loratadine without relief. The ENT advised the patient to suck on lemon drops, but these did not help either. The patient reported that he consumed pine nuts, which he thought could be a contributing factor. The clinical pharmacist was consulted to investigate possible drug-related causes of the metallic taste. Previous literature included a case report of a patient who experienced a metallic taste following initial injections of botulinum toxin A, but symptoms subsided after subsequent injections. This was thought to be due to its effects on zinc metabolism. After routine laboratories and heavy metals (eg lead, copper and mercury) were checked, it was found that our patient's copper level was 197 ug/dL compared to the normal level of 72-166 ug/dL. The repetition level was similar. BMP, CBC and TSH were normal. Wilson's disease was ruled out. It was found that copper elevation may contribute to the oral contraceptive that the patient did not want to quit. The doctor also consulted poison control and occupational medicine to rule out occupational exposure. Advised against the treatment of elevated copper level. IMPACT: This case of metallic taste caused by drugs has been added to the literature and highlights the value of the pharmacist when conducting a drug review to evaluate possible causes. CONCLUSION: Most taste disorders are commonly the result of loss of smell, which can contribute to allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, or an upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore, examination of the nose, mouth and cranial nerves is important. Metallic taste can also be attributed to external exposure, pregnancy (excluded where appropriate), or drugs that affect the metabolism of metals such as zinc or copper, whose levels should also be evaluated. In our case, botulinum injections and oral contraceptives were evaluated as the possibility of causing the patient's symptoms. A third possibility was pine nut syndrome, as symptoms were associated with patient-reported pine nut consumption.",,"Lu, C.;Lee, J.;Marrast, L. M.",2018,,,0,0,
3382,Unusual presentation of Wilson's disease in a pediatric patient: a case report,"Objective: To review a pediatric patient with an unusual primary neuropsychiatric presentation of Wilson's disease. Background: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that affects both children and adults and is typically manifested by neuropsychiatric and/or hepatic symptoms due to copper deposition. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical findings, including the presence of Keyser-Flescher (KF) rings and biochemical testing, and is confirmed by testing of the ATP7B gene. Neurological findings include choreoathetosis, dystonia, dysmetria, ataxia, and dysarthria. Psychiatric symptoms include mood disorders, compulsions, or behavioral changes including disinhibition. CF rings are present in an estimated 90% of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Pediatric patients typically present with hepatic symptoms and rarely with neuropsychiatric symptoms alone. The treatment is chelation of copper (Weiss, GeneReviews, 2016). Design/Method: NA Results: We present the case of a 10-year-old girl with subacute onset dysarthria and fall ataxia. The examination was remarkable in terms of flat affect, disinhibition, and non-nystagmus-free extraocular movements with wavy smooth follow-ups, localized findings to the cerebellum, motor instability, dysmetria, ataxia, broad-based shuffling gait, positive Romberg, and inability to perform stressful gaits. The patient did not have choreoathetosis or dystonia, although he had dysarthria with strangely slow, stagnant speech. Lab work revealed elevated transaminases. Neuroimaging was unremarkable and ophthalmologic examination did not show CF rings. Ceruloplasmin and serum and urine copper screening were related to Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed on ATP7B sequencing for the presence of two pathological variants, c.3955C>T. Liver biopsy showed high copper content. Treatment with oral zinc was initiated and his neurological symptoms improved rapidly, he was on his feet within a few weeks and was almost completely back to baseline within a few months.

3384,Indian childhood cirrhosis - Dropped but not gone: report of a rare case with a practical clinicopathological diagnostic approach,"Indian childhood cirrhosis is an entity believed to be on the verge of extinction. We present a case of a 13-month-old girl presenting with acute jaundice, fever and ever-increasing bilirubin. Investigations revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, anemia, a blood with few schistocyte, positive direct Coombs test, and irregular prothrombin time. Viral, autoimmune and metabolic tests were unremarkable. Ultrasonography revealed chronic liver disease, portal hypertension and ascites. Due to numerous confounding factors and a low index of suspicion, diagnosis of Indian childhood cirrhosis remained elusive and was only clinched on liver biopsy shortly after the child's death, albeit more than three weeks later. The timing and technique of liver biopsy can have a profound impact on the final clinical outcome. Close coordination between clinical and pathological teams is essential for deciphering acute presentations of uncertain etiology. Clinical evaluations highlight various morphological indicators and present a diagnostic algorithm that facilitates the assessment of this disease.

3385,Identification and characterization of a novel 43-bp deletion mutation of the ATP7B gene in a Chinese patient with Wilson's disease: a case report.,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by copper accumulation. ATP7B gene mutations lead to ATP7B protein dysfunction, resulting in Wilson's disease. Case report: We describe a male case with Wilson's disease who was diagnosed 10 years after routine biochemical testing and showed low serum ceruloplasmin levels and Kayser-Fleischer rings in both corneas. Analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the proband, including the reported c.3517G>A mutation and a novel c.532_574del mutation. The c.532_574del mutation covered a 43-bp region in exon 2 and resulted in a frameshift mutation (p.Leu178PhefsX10). By base sequence analysis, two microhomologies (TCTCA) were observed at both deletion breakpoints in the ATP7B gene. Meanwhile, the presence of some sequence motifs associated with DNA breakage near the deletion site favored DNA strand breakage. Results: By comparison, a replication-based mechanism called fork-stopping and template switching/microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (FoSTeS/MMBIR) was used to explain the occurrence of this new deletion mutation.

3386,Clinical presentation and outcome of Wilson's disease patients in a single-center liver reference center cohort,"Introduction and Aims: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism that causes liver cirrhosis and neurological disorders. Clinical data on larger cohorts are limited due to the low disease frequency. The aim was to determine the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with WD in a patient cohort from a French liver reference centre. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with WD at a liver reference center (Paul-Brousse Hospital, Villejuif, France). The patients were evaluated clinically, biologically, morphologically and genetically. Liver involvement was evaluated by liver biopsy and/or liver stiffness measurement. Results: We included 107 patients, 54 (50.5%) female and 53 (49.5%) male, with liver symptoms of WD from 1974 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 15 years [extra: 1-44 years]. Fifty-seven (53.3%) had neurological symptoms (mixed symptoms, neurological and hepatic) at presentation. The mean age at diagnosis was 20.1 (+/- 10.54) years, with the difference in age (p = 0.0081) between patients with hepatic symptoms (17 +/- 8.6 years) and those with mixed symptoms (23 +/- 11.4 years). . Liver pathological analysis was performed in 65 patients (70%), and liver stiffness was measured in 72 patients (67%). Seventy-three (68%) patients had cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis of the disease. 43 (77%) patients with mixed symptoms and 30 (61%) patients with isolated liver symptoms had cirrhosis. Thirty-four (32%) patients were transplanted at a mean age of 27 (+/- 12.2) years. Eighteen (52%) patients who required liver transplantation had decompensated cirrhosis, 8 (23%) fulminant liver failure, 8 (23.5%) severe neurological disease and 5 (14%) liver cancer. Chelation therapy was predominantly D Penicillamine in 104 (97%) patients. 37 (35%) patients required a change in treatment due to side effects of Trientine or Zinc salts. Four patients died in this cohort; two after primary liver cancer (1 HCC and 1 cholangiocarcinoma), one after hemorrhagic stroke, and one after liver transplant for severe neurological symptoms. Conclusion: At the time of presentation of WD, two-thirds of the patients admitted to the hepatology reference center had cirrhosis and one-third required liver transplantation. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 77% of the patients with neurological symptoms of the disease.

3387,Improvement of phenotypic features and liver stiffness measurement during follow-up in patients with Wilson's disease,"Introduction and Aims: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that causes hepatic and neurological disorders. The aim of our study is to evaluate the phenotypic and therapeutic features of WD patients treated in a tertiary hospital between 2012 and 2016. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted involving 88 patients diagnosed with WD within the defined period. Results: Age at diagnosis was under 7 years in 12.9% of the cases, 7-18 years in 44.7%, 18-35 years in 37.6%, and >35 years in 7%. At the time of diagnosis, 67% had liver disease, 27.3% had liver and neurological disease, and 5.7% had specific neurological disease. Patients with hepatic WD had 30.3% compensated and 14.2% decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), 50% chronic hepatitis and 5.3% acute liver failure. Of the patients with hepatic and neurological disorders, 66.6% had compensated, 11% decompensated LC and 22.2% had chronic hepatitis. Specific liver disease was encountered in 77.7% of children compared to only 50% of adults (p = 0.02). At the last control, treatment was D-penicillamine 32.1%, trientine 8.3%, zinc 5.9%, Dpenicillamine and zinc 41.7%, trientine and zinc 3.6%, and liver transplantation was performed in 8.4% of the cases. In patients with liver disease, only 20.3% of patients had worsening, while 65.8% of patients had clinical improvement. Clinical improvement was found in 59.1% of patients with liver and neurological diseases, and worsening in 22.7%. Patients with isolated neurological disorders had a favorable clinical course in 75% of cases and worsened in the remainder. Liver stiffness measured at diagnosis in all patients with compensated liver disease was significantly reduced after 12 months of chelating therapy (14.6 +/- 10.9 vs 8.4 +/- 5.1 kPa, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In a tertiary center in Romania, WD with hepatic phenotype is most common, especially in children, and specific neurologic disease is rare. A favorable disease course can be confirmed by a significant reduction in liver stiffness in >60% of cases across all phenotypes. During the study period, liver transplantation was performed in <9% of cases due to timely diagnosis and effective chelating therapy.",,"Iacob, R.;Iacob, S.;Oana, A.;Cristina, A.

3388,Long-term results of treatment with Trientine in Wilson's disease: final results of a multicenter study in patients withdrawing from d-Penicillamine therapy.,"Background and Objectives: Trientine dihydrochloride (Trientine; UNIVAR BV) is a common treatment for Wilson's Disease. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability outcomes of Trientine chelator-based therapy after discontinuation of d-Penicillamine. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02426905. Methods: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study evaluations were performed at 6,12, 24, 36, and 48-month time points and at the latest available follow-up after Trientine initiation. A total of 81 patients were included in the study, and 77 (95.1%) patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint was the investigator graded outcome of hepatic and neurological symptoms, with additional efficacy analysis included the copper parameter, LFTs. Safety reporting included SAE and termination rate. Results: Of the 77 patients included in the ITT population, 16 (20.8%) were under 18 years of age. Reasons for discontinuation of D-Penicilamine were adverse events (58 [75.3%] patients) or lack of clinical improvement (12 [15.6%] patients). On average, patients were treated with trientine for 73.3 (+/-74.76) months. The mean total daily dose during treatment was 1005.7 (+/-425.32) mg. Trientine treatment improved hepatic symptoms in 49.4% of patients, 35.1% asymptomatic, 10.4% unchanged and 5.2% worsened, neurological symptoms remained unchanged in 36.4% of patients, 46.8% asymptomatic, 14.3% improved, and 2.6% worsened . Overall, the median NCC concentration decreased from baseline to last follow-up (n = 35 [-0.613 +/- 1.7318]). A total of 17 (22.1%) patients experienced a severe TEAE. Many of these TEAEs have been resolved, resolved with sequelae, or developed. Only two serious TEAEs related to trientine were considered and both resolved. Trientine treatment was permanently discontinued in 1 (1.3%) patient (anemia) due to TEAE. Two (2.6%) patients discontinued trientine therapy due to inadequate liver response. Conclusion: Anti-copper therapy with trientine was effective following discontinuation of d-Penicillamine therapy. Trientine was well tolerated and rates of symptomatic deterioration were lower than reported in previous series. These findings support the important role of Trientine in the management of Wilson's Disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Manolaki, N.;Zuin, M. G.;Kruse, C.;Dhawan, A.",2018,April,,0,0,
3389,Long-term efficacy and safety of WTX101 in Wilson's disease: data from an ongoing extension of the Phase 2 trial (WTX101-201),"Background and Aims: WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a copper-protein binding agent that forms ternary complexes with albumin, reducing plasma ceruloplasmin unbound copper (NCC) and increasing biliary copper excretion. In a Phase 2 study in Wilson's disease (WD), oral once-daily WTX101 corrected NCC (corrected for copper in ternary complexes), improved disability and neurological status, and stabilized liver function for 24 weeks. We present 72 weeks of preliminary efficacy and safety data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial extension, the first prospective report on long-term disease control with WTX101 in WD. Methods: All 22 patients who completed the 24-week open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study chose to continue once-daily response-guided therapy with WTX101 at extension. Key parameters reviewed up to week 72 included hepatic status, NCC corrected, neurological status, safety, and tolerability. Results: Mean ALT, international normalized ratio, albumin, and Model score for End Stage Liver Disease improved or remained constant between weeks 24 and 72. Reversible ALT elevations requiring dose adjustment were observed in 39% of patients (> = 30 mg/day) with no prolongation between week 24. High mean (SD) NCC corrected at baseline (3.6 [2.1] µM) was reduced and controlled at week 24 (0.9 [1.0] µM) and controlled at week 72 (0.5 [0.7] µM) with accompanying disability and sustained improvements in the neurological condition in most patients. Low platelet (56%) and neutrophil (32%) counts were common at baseline and similar reports were made during follow-up; Low hemoglobin was rare. Most cytopenias are not accompanied by low NCC levels and are unlikely to reflect copper deficiency. Two subjects had mild anemia and evidence of neutropenia with low NCC, potentially consistent with copper deficiency, at weeks 36 and 72, respectively; both responded rapidly to dose reduction. Overall, the number of reported adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) is 1-24. 25-72 weeks (175 AE and 11 SAE). decreased by more than 50% to weeks (71 AE and 4 SAE). Between weeks 24 and 72, 89% of AEs were mild or moderate, and 89% were unrelated or possibly unrelated to treatment. Conclusion: Once-daily treatment of WD patients with WTX101 for up to 72 weeks achieved long-term disease control, as demonstrated by sustained improvements in NCC, disability and neurological status, and stable hepatic function, with an appropriate tolerability profile.",,"Weiss, K.

3390,Case report: Pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly in a 31-year-old man,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease that causes copper accumulation in all organs and primarily affects the liver and brain. The clinical presentation of patients can be uncertain and initial misdiagnosis is not unusual. This case report describes a 31-year-old male patient who was transferred to our hemato-oncology department with the suspicion of pancytopenia and malignant liver disease. In the additional anamnesis, a history of progressive muscle weakness, ataxia and gait disturbance in the last 4 years was revealed. These findings were previously interpreted as dissociative movement disorder, and adjustment disorder and psychiatric drug treatment was initiated. Sequential diagnostic studies showed no evidence of an underlying hematological disease despite a proven pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. The history of elevated liver enzymes and progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms has increased our awareness for further diagnosis beyond hematological malignancies. Eventually, an ophthalmological slit lamp investigation revealed a Kayser-Fleischer ring, which led to the dubious diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which was later confirmed by liver biopsy. Chelation therapy with D-penicillamine was initiated and most of his symptoms resolved in the following months.",,"Hockl, P.;Dax, K.;Hayat-Khayyati, A.;Greul, R.",2018,March,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12254-018-0401-5,0,0,
3391,Psychological symptoms as the only presentation of Wilson's disease in an 11-year-old boy,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to copper metabolism disorder. The clinical presentation spectrum of Wilson's disease is wide and the first signs of the disease depend on the organ involved. It may develop insidiously or suddenly with neurological disorders, intentional tremor, dysarthria, rigid dystonia, Parkinsonism, deterioration in school performance or behavioral changes. This article presents an 11-year-old boy who mainly complained of falls and upper extremity spasm. In 2016, he was admitted to the Neurology Department of Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, northeast of Iran. His symptoms started 6 months ago as mood instability (prolonged spontaneous crying). He also suffered from occasional tremors and micrographs. Her initial examinations were normal, and she was diagnosed with depression and psychiatric problems and was treated with fluoxetine and risperidone. Wilson's disease should be considered in the diagnosis of all children with psychiatric and musculoskeletal symptoms. Copyright Â© 2018, Iran Child Neurology Society.

3392,Pediatric Wilson's disease: a study of clinical profile and treatment outcomes from a tertiary care center in northern India.,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. Multifaceted liver presentations include acute hepatitis, acute liver failure, acute upon chronic liver failure, portal hypertension, asymptomatic hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and gallstones. Extrahepatic manifestations are also well known. There is very little data on this disease and its consequences. Here we present one of the largest cohorts of pediatric Wilson's disease patients treated at our center. Methods: The clinical profile and outcomes of 107 pediatric cases of Wilson's disease from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis was made by standard cutoff +/- liver histology of CF rings, low serum ceruloplasmin and high 24-hour urine copper. Cases with at least 12 months of follow-up after chelation were analyzed. The result is (1) Complete recovery: Asymptomatic with normal synthetic function (2) Partial recovery: AST/ALT elevation and resolving synthetic dysfunction (3) Deterioration: Worsening synthetic function or neurologic status & (4) Death. Conclusion: Admission symptoms of 107 patients aged 3-18 years treated in our center were jaundice in 60 (56.07%), ascites in 49 (45.7%), cola-colored urine in 5 (4.6%), encephalopathy was. Eleven (10.2%) had GI bleeding, 18 (16.8%) and 13 (12.1%) had extra-GI bleeding (cutaneous, hematuria, epistaxis). 23 (21.4%) patients were neurological, 5 (4.6%) patients. There was consanguinity in 15 (14%) patients, and a family history of Wilson (liver/neurological/with liver) in 44 (41.1%) patients. On clinical examination, 88 (82.2%) hepatomegaly, 69 (64.4%) splenomegaly, 40 (37.3%) ascites, 39 (36.4%) signs of cirrhosis (including clubbing, spider angioma, skin changes) and sunflower cataract was detected. in 4 (3.7% patients). Gallstones were seen in 2 (1.8%), nephrolithiasis in 3 (2.8%), MPGN and pancreatic involvement in 1 (0.9%). Familial Wilson's disease was present in 13 (12%) patients. Four (3.7%) of the patients' parents (3 male and 1 female) were diagnosed later. Admission types were hepatic in 87 (81.3%) and hepatolenticular in 20 (18.7%). The PELD score at admission ranged from 0-45.8 (mean 11.36). Child Pugh Score was A in 53 (49.5%) patients, B in 13 (12.1%) patients, and C in 41 (38.3%) patients. CF ring was present in 63 (72.4%) hepatic Wilson patients and 18 (90%) hepatolenticular Wilson patients. Serum Ceruloplamin was low/20 mg/dl in 81 (93%) of the liver and 19 (95%) of the hepatolenticular Wilson. Of these, 67.2% had a value\or = 10 mg/dl. 66 (73.3%) [has 100 lg/24 hours and 11 (12.2%)] [has 40 lg/24 hours. Liver biopsy was performed in 53 (49.5%) cases that contributed to the diagnosis. Hepatic presentation types were cirrhosis in 45 (46.3%), chronic liver disease in 7 (7.2%), ACLF in 13 (13.4% & 53.8% due to Wilson exacerbation), ALF in 2 (2.06%), acute hepatitis in the other. .

3393,Kidney involvement in children with Wilson's disease,"Objective: Although renal involvement is rare in Wilson's disease (WD), it is of great importance because of the morbidity it brings. Recent data, initially thought to be rare, indicate that kidney disease is more common in children with Wilson's disease. However, little work has been done to detail this finding. The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of associated kidney disorders in children with WD. Method: This is a prospective observational study involving patients aged 1-18 years, previously diagnosed with WD, visiting the Liver clinic or presenting to the Pune KEM Hospital Pediatrics service. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease were excluded from the study. Demographic information, laboratory data and sonographic findings were recorded. Standard definitions were used to define proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypercalciuria. The data were analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test and the z-score was calculated to know the significance of the difference between the group with and without renal abnormalities. Conclusion: 4 out of 70 patients included in our study were excluded because they had kidney disease before. Finally, of the 66 patients evaluated, 24 were female and 42 were male. Renal involvement generally occurred early in the course of the disease and occurred more frequently in children with WD at an earlier age. 60% of WD patients with renal manifestations had a positive Kayser-Fleischer (CF) ring. 11 (16.6%) patients had RTA, 8 (12%) hematuria, 6 (9%) proteinuria (non-nephrotic), 5 (7.5%) stones, and 4 (7%) patients 6) isolated hypercalciuria was observed. There was no significant difference in hepatic, neurologic or combined hepatic and neurologic presentation of WD between WD patients with and without renal involvement. All children were taking Penicillamine, except for two children who received zinc maintenance therapy for penicillamine allergy. Despite an extensive literature review, we found only two pediatric studies worldwide highlighting the renal aspect of WD. The most common associated renal abnormalities reported in these studies were hematuria, proteinuria, and renal tubular acidosis with or without hypercalciuria. Conclusion: Ours is the only study in India that sheds light on the unexplored renal aspect of WD in children. Further studies are needed to formulate guidelines for screening children with WD for kidney abnormalities. [Table Featured].",,"Shah, V.

3394,Transient elastography (fibroscan) evaluation in patients with hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease,"Background: Non-invasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis by ultrasound-based transient elastography (TE) (or fibroscan) has been validated in a number of chronic liver diseases. However, studies involving patients with Wilson's disease (WD) are rare. There are no further studies comparing TE with liver stiffness in hepatic and neurological Wilson. Our aim was to evaluate liver stiffness with fibroscan in patients with hepatic and neurological Wilson's disease. Methods: Twenty-five patients with well-characterized WD underwent TE with FibroscanR, Echosens 402, Paris, France, software-B21. TE was performed in the right intercostal space in the resting breathing position. The diagnosis of WD was made according to the Leipzig criteria. All patients were on follow-up and were stable on treatment with D-penicillamine +/- zinc. Fibroscan values were differentiated between hepatic and neurological Wilson according to treatment and disease duration. Continuous variables between groups were compared with an unpaired t test. P value \0.05 was considered significant. Conclusion: Twenty-five patients (13 hepatic, 10 neurologic and 2 both) underwent TE 3-4 hours after breakfast. Seventeen were men. The mean age of the patients was 20 years and the mean disease duration was 7.2 years. Demographic and laboratory characteristics between hepatic and neurological WD are shown in Table. There was no statistical significance between the two in all variables except Fibroscan scores. FibroScan values were 12.94+/-5.03 (Dec 7-22) kPa in patients with neurological WD, and 26.7.6+/-16.06 in patients with hepatic WD. (Range of 12.2-75) kKa (p-value = 0.003). Scores above 8.4 kPa are considered serious in WD. Conclusion: Patients with WD have advanced hepatic fibrosis in TE. Patients with hepatic WD had significantly higher scores suggesting cirrhosis, while patients with neurological WD had scores suggesting severe fibrosis.",,"Joseph, T.

3395,Pediatric Hepatic Wilson's Disease: Effect and outcome of chelation therapy in a large cohort.,"Background: Since the specific literature on pediatric hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is scarce, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcomes of children with hepatic WD. Method: WD children meeting > 2 out of 3 criteria (serum cerulo-plasmin < 20 mg/dL, positive Kayser-Fleischer ring, 24-hour urine copper > 40)jg) +/- Liver in our department from January 2007 to June histology was managed 2016 analyzed. Patients with adequate follow-up for more than 9 months were evaluated for response to chelation therapy. They were analyzed as the following categories: a) complete recovery (asymptomatic + normalization of transaminases, serum albumin and coagulation); b) partial recovery (asymptomatic + near-normal normalization of transaminases + serum albumin or coagulation) c) progression (impairment of synthetic functions, decompensation or death); d) drug toxicity. To determine the prognostic factors for outcome, the follow-up cohort was divided into 2 groups a) Good outcome (>9 months follow-up with complete or partial recovery) and b) Poor outcome, worsening of liver synthetic function, liver transplant, discontinuation or death within 9 months of starting treatment . Outcome: 111 WD children 108 (36-180) months old and an overall PELD score of 16 (-11 to 60). Liver histology was compatible with WD in 68% (n = 27/40). Figure 1 shows the presentation and the result. Chelation was initiated in 84% (n = 94). 14% (n=16) patients died in hospital due to advanced disease. It was analyzed for 65 outcomes with 43 (9-144) months of follow-up. 92% (n=60) were on D-penicillamine monotherapy and 6% (n=4) were using D-penicillamine and zinc with additional severe neurological symptoms. Positive results were seen in 58% (n = 35) of those who received D-penicillamine monotherapy. 13% (n=8) had drug toxicity and 12% (n=7) required zinc supplementation due to disease progression. Trientine 6% (n = 4) was started. Overall, a positive result was observed in 70% (n = 46). Table 1 shows the comparison of patients with good and bad outcome. In logistic regression analysis, PELD score and Evil Eye score were the best predictors of outcome among all variables (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this extensive pediatric experience of hepatic WD, we demonstrated extended clinical forms with various manifestations. The majority were manageable with D-penicillamine monotherapy. Chelation needs to be added or changed in certain cases of drug toxicity and neurologic presentation. [Table Featured].",,"Sarma, M. S.;Das, M. C.;Yachha, S.

3396,High efficacy of D-penicillamine in Wilson's disease: Contribution of incompatibility to D-penicillamine treatment 'failure',"Background: Wilson's disease (WD), a genetic disorder of copper metabolism dependent on mutant ATP7B enzyme, is characterized by decreased excretion, irregular accumulation, and abnormal copper deposits causing toxic damage in various organs. D-penicillamine (D-PCA) is an effective oral chelating agent for WD. Method: None. Conclusion: A WD patient with clinical signs was reversed with D-PCA. However, the patient thought that he was healthy enough to lead to discontinuation of penicillamine administration. Relapses of many signs of Wilson's disease were reported, but regular examination was also discontinued. In addition, after drinking alcohol, liver function began to deteriorate with symptoms such as progressive jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, lower extremity edema, and diarrhea. There were no signs of any reduction in Wilson's disease after taking several couples of Chinese herbs. Approximately 4 months after the administration of D-PCA treatment, improvement in jaundice and dysphoria, decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase levels and elevation of ceruloplasmin, as well as stabilization on the radiograph of the neurologic and liver examination were observed. Conclusion: Our case offers important recommendations for improving the compliance of WD patients and is a lifelong challenge for the management of WD.",,"Han, D.;Li, G.;Yan, T.;Sun, J.;Fan, W.",2018,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12072-018-9852-3,0,0,
3397,Phenotypic features and therapeutic multidisciplinary approach in Romanian patients diagnosed with Wilson's Disease,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that causes hepatic and neurological impairment. The aim of our study is to evaluate the phenotypic and therapeutic features of WD patients treated in a tertiary hospital between 2012 and 2016. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted involving 88 patients diagnosed with WD within the defined period. Results: Age at diagnosis was under 7 years in 12.9% of the cases, 7-18 years in 44.7%, 18-35 years in 37.6%, and >35 years in 7%. At the time of diagnosis, liver disease was found in 67%, liver and neurologic disease in 27.3%, and specific neurological disease in 5.7%. Patients with hepatic WD had 30.3% compensated and 14.2% decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), 50% chronic hepatitis and 5.3% acute liver failure. Of the patients with hepatic and neurological disorders, 66.6% had compensated, 11% decompensated LC and 22.2% had chronic hepatitis. Specific liver disease was encountered in 77.7% of children compared to only 50% of adults (p=0.02). At the last control, the treatment was D-penicillamine 32.1%, trientine 8.3%, zinc 5.9%, D-penicillamine and zinc 41.7%, trientine and zinc 3.6%, and liver transplantation was performed in 8.4% of the cases. In patients with liver disease, only 20.3% of patients had worsening, while 65.8% of patients had clinical improvement. Clinical improvement was found in 59.1% of patients with liver and neurological diseases, and worsening in 22.7%. Patients with isolated neurological disorders had a favorable clinical course in 75% of cases and worsened in the remainder. Conclusion: In a tertiary center in Romania, WD with hepatic phenotype is most common, especially in children, and specific neurologic disease is rare. A favorable disease course can be confirmed in >60% of cases across all phenotypes. During the study period, liver transplantation was performed in <9% of cases due to timely diagnosis and effective chelating therapy.",,"Iacob, R.;Oana, A.;Iacob, S.;Anghel, D.;Constantinescu, A.;Lupescu, I.;Popescu, I.;Gheorghe, L.",2017,,,0,0,
3398,Long-term consequences of neurological Wilson's disease,"Introduction: The aim of the study was to characterize the clinical spectrum of patients receiving long-term treatment with Wilson's disease (WD) and to identify risk factors that affect long-term outcomes. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 30 WD patients treated for at least 2.5 and up to 31 years underwent a detailed clinical investigation, scoring clinical findings giving 7 motor and 3 non-motor sub-scores of clinical findings, as well as laboratory testing. A factor analysis of these subscores and laboratory parameters was performed to identify the items with the highest impact on outcome, an ANOVA and subgroup analysis tested the effect of age, age at diagnosis onset, and duration of treatment on outcome. Correlation analysis was performed between clinical subscores and laboratory findings. Results: Three factors characterizing the clinical outcome (F1-F3) (F1: tremor and pathological reflexes; F2: dystonia and dysarthria; F3: cerebellar abnormalities and gait) and laboratory findings (LF1: serum ceruloplasmin level; LF2): liver enzymes; LF3: INR). Mildly affected patients have increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion, while more severely affected patients have elevated liver enzymes. While six of the 7 motor sub-scores did not change with treatment duration, tremor (p <.04), total score (p <.02), and especially non-motor items (p <.001) increased significantly with treatment duration. treatment. The outcome of patients with neuropsychiatric abnormalities was significantly worse compared to the rest of the patients (p < .01).

3400,Wilson's disease (hepato-lenticular degeneration),"Background: Wilson's disease is a neuropsychiatric-autosomal recessive disease characterized by excessive copper deposition predominantly in the liver and different parts of the brain, namely the basal ganglia, midbrain, and pons. The genetic defect is attributed to a membrane-associated copper-binding protein gene-ATP7B (on chromosome 13) containing copper in ceruloplasmin. Impaired elimination of copper leads to its accumulation and resulting clinical features. The patient may present with tremor, dystonia, rigidity, dysarthria, brisk reflexes, psychological and behavioral disorders. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms can occur at any point in the course of the disease. We present a case of Wilson's disease in a 26-year-old woman who presented with psychiatric symptoms. Case summary: A 26-year-old woman with a history of tremors, walking and speech difficulties since the age of 10, presented with complaints of feeling naked despite being dressed for 4 months, touching when alone, and sleep disturbance. Tactile hallucinations, ideas of reference, anxiety, and dysphoric mood were found on mental state examination. Neurological examination revealed tremor, rigidity in the upper extremities, dysarthria, incoordination, and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Ophthalmological examination revealed prominent Kayser-Fleischer rings in both eyes. The patient's ceruloplasmin level was <0. 08 g/L, serum copper level was 29.3 mcg/dl, and liver function test revealed alkaline phosphatase levels of 144 U/L. MRI reported focal areas of T2/FLAIR hyper-intensities including the brain, bilateral thalamus, midbrain, and pons, and mild cerebral atrophy, which was significant for age.

3401,Case report of a psychiatric disorder - Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder involving copper metabolism and is associated with abnormal liver functions. It is a genetic disease with hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. The most common psychiatric symptoms in patients with Wilson's disease include sudden and fluctuating mood swings, outbursts of anger, personality changes, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. When the patient initially presents with psychiatric symptoms, it may obscure the primary diagnosis, and therefore the diagnosis of Wilson's disease should be kept in mind. Here, we present a 22-year-old male patient who initially presented with behavioral abnormalities and was later diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Introduction: Wilson published a description of 12 patients presenting with extrapyramidal motor disease and an autopsy showing lenticular nuclei softening and cirrhosis. In the initial description of 12 cases of the disease, Dr Wilson described the presence of schizophrenia-like psychosis in two of his cases. Psychiatric symptoms ranging from major depression, mania, antisocial behavior to psychosis were observed in patients with Wilson's disease. It was later found to be a genetic disorder involving copper metabolism, transmitted via an autosomal recessive mode and characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other tissues. The genetic defect is localized to the short arm of the 13th chromosome, which affects the ATPase(ATP7B)1 gene in the liver, and liver findings (40%), neurological symptoms (40%), and psychiatric symptoms occur in the fifth2. Neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders are widely reported in Wilson's disease, whose lifetime prevalence is estimated to be in the range of 20-100%. We present a case report of a patient who presented with psychotic features and was found to have Wilson's disease in the examinations. Case Report: A 22-year-old male born from an unrelated marriage from a rural area was brought to the Visakhapatnam State Mental Health and Diseases Hospital psychiatry outpatient clinic with complaints of behavioral disorders for a week and exacerbation for 3 days. Behavioral abnormalities are decreased sleep, decreased appetite, increased irritability, excessive talking, excessive socialization, self-praise, high religiosity, increased patriotism, abusive and aggressive behaviors. He has reportedly been treated with inj for aggression. The day before haloperidol came to us. Birth and development were normal with no significant past history. In his family history, his older brother was found dead in the meadows at the age of 10 and is thought to have died from a snakebite. His sister died at the age of 13 from jaundice and ascites. Before his illness, he was a cheerful boy who had an average performance at school and was a regular at school. In general physical examination, normal vital parameters were determined with an Indian map tattoo with a ring around the cornea and a cross on his left forearm. Higher mental functions revealed impaired attention span. He has a good orientation to time, place and person, and it has been found that his near/long/distant memory is together with his intact abstract abilities. In her neurological examination, there was no abnormality in the cranial nerves, sensory system, and there were no cerebellar signs of tremor in the motor system in the extended hand. At the admissions mental state examination, an average built male wearing an off-white uniform with a tie and greeting the examiner as a teacher and greet the examiner appeared. He was conscious, uncooperative, did not maintain eye contact with increased psychomotor activity, decreased reaction time, spoke extremely loudly. There are grandiose delusions and second-person auditory hallucinations. He was found to be angry throughout the interview. Routine blood tests such as CBC, LFT, S. Creatine, urine routine were performed and they were found to be normal. He was temporarily diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder-mania, and initially oral olanzapine and injectable antipsychotics were started. Later, the patient developed tremor and slurred speech, trihexyphenidyl was added to this, and lithium carbonate was added to improve affective symptoms. Considering the significant family history and acute-onset behavioral abnormalities, the case was further studied with the differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease. On the developmental screening test, he had an IQ of 84 and had dull normal intellectual functioning. Slit lamp inspection has bilateral KF rings. Chronic liver parenchymal disease was observed in the ultrasound abdomen. MRI brain revealed subcortical white matter hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, calcified high right parietal lobe granuloma, and bilateral lentiform nucleus T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity suggestive of Wilson's disease. Urine analysis revealed elevated copper levels and serum ceruloplasmin levels at 108 ug/24 h. 46g/l. Olanzapine was maintained with 15 mg, 6 mg trihexyphenidyl, 900 mg lithium carbonate and 400 mg zinc sulfate. He improved symptomatically with treatment, and he was discharged with the same treatment. Discussion: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the inability of the liver to transport and store normally absorbed dietary copper, causing abnormal copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, eyes, liver and other tissues. This is an unusual presentation of Wilson's disease, where the patient had a history of abnormal behavior for 7 days and significant family history and the differential diagnosis of Wilson's disease was considered and a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made in further evaluation. The patient was controlled with 15 mg olanzapine and 900 mg lithium carbonate. Some authorities believe that neurological and behavioral symptoms can be alleviated with the use of Pencillamain (mosai et al. 1985). some reports indicated that the use of antipsychotics is not recommended. There are reports of the effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of Wilson's disease (krim et al. 2001). There is a need to further investigate the efficacy of various antipsychotics and chelating agents in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Jetty, R.

3402,"Copper chelation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Open-label pilot study evaluating the effects of trientine on LV mass, myocardial fibrosis, performance, and metabolism","Background: HCM is the most inherited cardiomyopathy, but no pharmacological intervention has yet been proven to alter the natural history or outcome of the disease, and new momentum is urgently needed in this area. Furthermore, CMR seems ideally placed to characterize many of the underlying pathophysiological processes that dominate the disease. Copper (Cu) is an essential cofactor for various metabolic functions and regulation of systemic Cu metabolism is critical to human health, while free Cu ions are highly redox active and therefore potentially toxic. We have previously reported abnormal copper homeostasis in patients with HCM. In summary, we found significantly higher serum (free) copper and coeruloplasmin levels in HCM patients compared to controls. Considering that disturbances in Cu homeostasis can lead to hypertrophic forms of heart disease (for example, in Wilson's disease) and we have previously shown that Cu chelation in the absence of Cu can reverse both LVH and organ fibrosis in animals via a Cu-dependent mechanism, and human studies suggest that trientine with Cu-selective We hypothesized that chelation would slow disease progression in HCM. Methods: This open-label pilot study investigated the clinical efficacy and tolerability of trientine dihydrochloride in a group of 20 patients with HCM over a 6-month period. Predefined endpoints included changes in LVK, markers of LV fibrosis, markers of LV performance, and myocardial energy. 10 more matched HCM patients were studied as controls. Patients underwent a complex evaluation program during 6 visits that included separate CMR and CMR 31P-spectroscopy at the start and end of treatment. Results: Trientine did not produce any significant changes in BP, HR, or BMI. LV Mass was significantly decreased in the treatment arm compared to the control group (-4.2gv 1.8g, p=0.03). A trend towards absolute reduction in mass was observed in the treatment group (p=0.06). These changes included a reduction in native T1 (1060+/-47ms and 1049+/-42ms, p=0.06) and a reduction in ECV (30.0+/-4.5 v 29.5%+/-4.0%, p=0.06). ) was associated with. ). Also, using both Echo speckle tracking based and CMR feature tracking based technologies (-16.6+/-4.3 vs -18.9+/-4.4, p=0.01 and -18.3+/-3.4 vs -19.4) There were significant developments in tension. +/-3.4, respectively p=0.03). Likewise, significant improvements were recorded in atrial strain parameters with mirror changes between both imaging technologies. There was a trend towards an increase in the PCr/ATP ratio with trientine treatment (1.27+/-0.44 vs. 1.4+/-0.39), but this did not reach statistical significance. No significant increase in exercise time, VO2max or AT was observed. Conclusion: Cu-selective chelation with trientine in a controlled setting is safe and appears to have beneficial effects on various disease imaging biomarkers. Indeed, it appears to at least slow the progression of the disease. A larger Phase 2b double-blind randomized trial is now warranted.",,"Reid, A.;Miller, C.;Cooper, G.;Schmitt, M.",2017,August,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx502.P4503,0,0,
3403,"WTX101 in patients newly diagnosed with Wilson's disease: Final results of a global, prospective phase 2 trial","Background and Objectives: Current treatments for Wilson's disease, a copper metabolism disorder caused by the absence or dysfunction of the ATP7B protein, are limited in efficacy, safety, and multiple daily dosing. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a first-in-class copper modulating oral agent that acts by increasing biliary copper excretion and reducing ceruloplasmin unbound serum copper (NCC) by forming complexes with albumin. Methods: In an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, 28 newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease (18-64 years of age, 46% male, 89% with some degree of neurologic symptom and approximately 50% with cirrhosis at baseline) mostly administered once daily. He received WTX101 monotherapy using a response-directed dosing regimen with individualized doses of 15-120 mg/day. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to 24 weeks in copper-adjusted NCC levels in triple tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes in treated patients (NCCc). The End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) model and modified Nazer Score were used to monitor the stability and safety of liver disease. Neurological status was assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At 24 weeks, 71% of WTX101-treated patients either achieved or maintained normalized NCCc levels or experienced a >=25% reduction from baseline NCCc (p < 0.001). The mean NCCc decreased significantly from 3.6 µM at baseline to 0.9 µM at week 24 (p < 0.0001). The mean MELD score and modified Nazer score remained stable over the course of treatment, indicating stabilization of liver function. Reversible asymptomatic liver test elevations observed in 39% of patients (at a dose of 30 mg/day or higher) were generally mild to moderate and resolved with dose adjustments. Compared with baseline, patients showed significant improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (6.6 vs 4.1, p < 0.001) and neurological symptom score (22.8 vs 16.6, p < 0.0001) at week 24. There was no drug-induced neurological deterioration at baseline. Conclusions: Final data from the first global, prospective clinical trial in Wilson's disease demonstrate that WTX101 rapidly lowers and controls NCCc, resulting in improved disability and neurological status with stable liver function and a favorable safety profile. These findings, together with the simple dosing regimen, suggest that WTX101 has the potential to meet many unmet needs in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

3404,"Predicting ""poor outcome"" in decompensated Wilson's disease: Does the new Wilson index help?","Background and Objectives: Recently, there have been conflicting reports about the effectiveness of the New Wilson index (NWI) in predicting the outcome of Wilson's disease (WD), which is the only prognostic model available in WD. Thus, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NWI. Methods: A retrospective evaluation of eighty WD cases admitted to this center from 2011 to 2016 was performed, of which 71 were acute chronic liver failure (ACLF) or decompensated CLD. They were managed with supportive care in combination with D Pencillamine and Zinc. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to see the association of risk factors with poor outcomes (liver transplant or death) at any time during hospitalization. Results: Of the 71 cases of WD, 43 survived with medical treatment: 7 of 22 ACLF and 36 of 49 decompensated CLD. Fifteen of 22 ACLF and 13 of 49 decompensated CLD had poor results. In univariate analysis, bilirubin (Mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p = 0.00), AST (Mean difference 1600.8, 95% CI 64.8-256, p = 0.001), INR (Mean difference 1.63, 95% CI 0.93 -2.33, p = 0.00), NWI (Mean difference 5.37, 95% CI 3.67-7.08, p = 0.00), Pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) score ( Mean difference 11.47, 95% CI 6.7-16.2, p = 0.00 ), ACLF (single ratio or OR 5.93, 95% CI 1.97-17.8, p = 0.001) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade 3 or Presentation was found to be significant as 4 (OR 48.5, 95% CI 5.8-402.7, p = 0.00). associated with poor outcome. In logistic regression analysis, HE grade 3/4 (adjusted OR 33.47, 95% CI 3.6-310.4, p = 0.002) and PELD score (adjusted OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.9-35.1, p = ) was found to be significantly correlated with poor outcome. 0.004). When subjected to further binary logistic analysis, the group without HE or HE grade 1 or 2 was associated with a significantly worse outcome with a PELD score (adjusted OR 11.4, 95% CI 2.2-59.2, p = 0.004). ROC analysis revealed the best cutoff of the PELD score of 17.5% to determine poor outcome in patients with or without HE (AUROC = 0.843) or without HE (AUROC = 0.812), with 84.5% sensitivity and 69% specificity. Results: Grade HE 3/4 and high PELD (>17.5) are independently associated with poor outcomes in decompensated WD. NWI showed no significant independent association with poor outcome.

WD patients with neurological symptoms were divided into two groups as the treatment group (n=53) and the control group (n=50). The treatment group received copper inhibitor therapy with a combination of Gandouling and low-dose D-penicillamine (10 mg/kg), while the control group received conventional dose D-penicillamine (20 mg/kg) monotherapy. The clinical efficacy, side effects and results of various hematological and biochemical studies were recorded and statistically analyzed. Overall, 98.11% of WD patients treated with combined therapy experienced a reduction in their neurological status (in line with or remained constant with a significantly improved Global Rating Scale score). White blood cell and platelet counts stabilized, and liver function improved or remained stable. Combined therapy also clearly improved 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Only 15.09% of WD patients receiving combined therapy experienced adverse reactions, including one case of neurological worsening (1.89%) and one case of hepatic worsening (1.89%); this was less frequent than in the conventional dosed control group.

3408,A case of acquired hepatocerebral degeneration manifesting as hemichorea after liver transplantation,"Acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (AHCD) is a rare but morbid neurological manifestation of decompensated cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunt causes manganese deposition in the basal ganglia, which is defined as bilateral hyperintense signals on T1-weighted MRI. The resulting neuronal loss leads to involuntary movements, cognitive dysfunction, Parkinsonism, or cerebellar ataxia in the absence of hepatic encephalopathy. We present a case of AHCD with several unique features: 1) initial presentation after liver transplant (OLT), 2) no clinical or radiographic evidence of portosystemic shunt, and 3) unilateral basal ganglia hyperintensity. A 57-year-old man with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (stage III) underwent OLT for hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis 3 years before admission. Her post-transplant course was complicated by continued alcohol abuse, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and acute cellular rejection without fibrosis 4 months ago. Prescriptions included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, nifedipine, and insulin with questionable adherence. He had no personal or family history of movement disorders. His main complaint was one month of progressive, uncontrollable right arm and leg movements in an unrhythmic, writhing pattern. It was fireless. On physical examination, normal strength, finger-nose test, reflexes and sensation, and right-sided hemichorea were remarkable. He did not show altered mental status, asterix, nystagmus, hepatosplenomegaly, or ascites. Laboratories were notable for total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, Alk Phos 43 U/L, AST/ALT 117/65 U/L, blood alcohol level 103 mg/dL. INR 1.0 and platelets 141 x103/mu L. Electrolytes, glucose and creatinine were normal. HgbA1c 6.0%. Unable to detect tacrolimus level. Serum iron, zinc, lead and manganese levels were normal. MRI brain is notable for T1 hyperintensities in the left globus pallidus without evidence of hemorrhage or acute ischemia (Fig. 1). He was treated with haloperidol 1 mg twice daily, which suppressed the hemichorea slightly and allowed discharge with close neurology follow-up. ACHD symptoms usually improve with resolution of the portosystemic shunt after OLT. However, we present a case of new-onset ACHD in a post-transplant patient without evidence of portosystemic shunt. This suggests that ACHD remains a poorly understood disorder that should be considered in patients with typical manifestations and a history of cirrhosis, even after liver transplantation.

3409,Incidental diagnosis of Wilson's disease: A case report.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by the complete absence or dysfunction of a copper transport enzyme, ATPase (ATP7B), a transmembrane protein encoded on chromosome 13. The incidence of this condition occurs in 1 in 30 000 people. . The presentation of WD is variable and includes the hepatic and neuropsychiatric systems with symptoms usually attributed to chronic liver disease, compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, fulminant liver failure, dystonia, choreiform movements, tremor, gait disturbances, personality changes, and cognitive impairments. copper accumulation. We present a case where routine imaging for a persistent problem considered chronic pelvic pain led to the diagnosis of WD. A 28-year-old female patient presented with a long-standing history of depression and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and recurrent abdominopelvic pain. He had been hospitalized multiple times for evaluation of recurrent abdominopelvic pain. The first episode of abdominopelvic pain was evaluated with a CT Abdomen showing a pelvic abscess and was surgically treated with full resolution and has since undergone extensive evaluation, including serial imaging, during subsequent hospitalizations negative for any acute process. At the time of this application, a recurrent CT Abdomen showed new-onset liver cirrhosis not found in previous imaging studies. The patient's alcohol use was denied, and after negative infectious, autoimmune, and hematological examination, further laboratory evaluation revealed low serum ceruloplasmin levels (5.4 mg/dl) and increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion (302 ug/d). Slit light examination of the eyes was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings. MRI Brain showed T2 high signal intensity in the pons. Zinc gluconate was started empirically. Genetic testing showed a heterozygous mutation in the ATP7B gene and a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. The patient continues on zinc therapy and is being followed up for liver transplant evaluation. The diagnosis of WD is easily missed, and if diagnosed early, it can potentially prevent or reverse many of its serious symptoms. The fact that our patient was completely asymptomatic despite the hepatic and neurological system involvement on imaging makes this case unique. Our case also reiterates the importance of keeping WD always in the differential in the evaluation of patients with cirrhosis.

3410,Deployed sailor with an acute presentation of Wilson's disease,"previously healthy 23-year-old US Marine was evacuated from Bahrain after presenting to a local hospital with complaints of exertion, abdominal swelling, jaundice, cognitive decline and months of fatigue. The patient had no past medical or surgical history and was an infrequent drinker. His family history was notable for a schizophrenic uncle who died in his early 40s from cirrhosis, presumed to be from alcohol. Examination showed hypomemia, bradyphrenia, bradykinesia, Kayser-Fleischer rings, jaundice, new ascites but no asterix. Laboratories were notable for pancytopenia with 37K platelets, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 111, and coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Alkaline phosphatase was 133, Aspartate aminotransferase 81, Alanine aminotransferase 57, and total bilirubin was 1.9. The presentation INR was 2.8 and the calculated MELD sodium was 26. Contrast MRI showed multiple basal ganglia signal abnormalities. On arrival in Germany, ceruloplasmin was low at 8 mg/dL. A 24-hour urinary copper intake was followed by treatment with oral zinc based on a possible diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Subsequent transjugular liver biopsy was performed with 12 elevated HVPGs confirming portal hypertension. Small esophageal varices were recorded on EGD. Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease with a worldwide incidence approaching 1 in 30,000, resulting from copper deposition and injury to the affected tissues. Defects in the ATP7B gene, which encodes for transmembrane transport of copper in hepatocytes, play a role in the disease. Key clinical features include liver disease, neuropsychiatric changes, Kayser-Fleischer rings and Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. However, given the significant variability in disease presentation, both the European Association for Liver Disease Research (EASL) and the American Association for Liver Disease Surgery (AASLD) have proposed criteria to aid diagnosis. The diagnosis was made approximately 8 days ago using the EASL criteria, but ultimately the patient met the requirements of both communities.

3411,Copper deficiency in Wilson and Alzheimer's disease,"Copper deficiency is the cause of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare disease characterized by increased copper levels that are not dependent on ceruloplasmin (Cu without Cp) and copper-ceruloplasmin ratio (Cu:Cp). Meta-analyses also show copper abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, direct comparison of the biological status of copper in the two diseases has never been performed. Investigation of serum copper status (copper, ceruloplasmin, non-Cp Cu and Cu:Cp, adjusted for sex and age) in patients with AD, WD (nine WD patients at baseline and 24 WD) and 24-hour copper urine evaluation D-penicillamine [D- pen] treatment)] and healthy controls (35 healthy controls). In a sample of 385 AD cases and 336 healthy controls examined in previous studies, non-Cp Cu and Cu:Cp were higher in AD than in healthy controls (both P < .001), but lower than in WD patients at baseline. Cu without Cp was similar in AD and WD, while the mean value of Cu:Cp separated AD from WD (P < .016), the Cohen d value of Cu:Cp 0.8 in AD (indicating a large biological effect) healthy vs. Controls even higher to 2.2 on WD. 24-hour urinary copper concentrations in 35 healthy controls were compared to baseline in a cohort of AD patients analyzed in a previous study of the effect of D-pen on disease progression. At baseline, AD patients had a higher 24-hour urinary copper concentration (P < .001; AD 12.05 cups/day [median, interquartile range 7.85-22.50]) than healthy controls (4.82 cups/day (median, interquartile range: 3.31-). 7.43]) 24-hour urinary copper values higher than the 200 mug/day threshold were found in 87% of WD and 78% of AD.

3412,When drug is not the culprit: Abnormal liver function in a patient with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Background: Hepatotoxicity is a well-known side effect of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Transient elevation of transaminases is common in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and patients taking methotrexate and some anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha drugs. There is little evidence to guide optimal monitoring, interpretation of results, further investigation, or intervention. Objective: We present an 8-year-old girl with polyarticular JIA who had persistently elevated liver enzymes during the first eighteen months of treatment, which led to further investigation and the consequent diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Methods: We prepared a retrospective case study. Results: The diagnosis of JIA was made at 6 years. He received steroid injections in multiple joints and was started on methotrexate. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was marginally elevated at diagnosis (59 U/l, normal range <50), but returned to normal before starting treatment. ALT levels rose and remained high shortly after starting methotrexate. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was sometimes marginally elevated, but other liver functions remained normal. In the following months, high ALT often coincided with upper respiratory tract infections. Methotrexate was not given several times because ALT levels were greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal. The dose was reduced and extended every other week, ALT improved but not normalized. Due to ongoing active JIA, infliximab was started at 8 months. Liver function remained abnormal (peak ALT 433 U/l) and was associated with the development of a new worsening abdominal pain and nausea at 12 months. It was decided to stop methotrexate and infliximab. Basic investigations into ongoing hepatitis and other causes of abdominal pain were normal. JIA disease control became increasingly difficult and the patient was started on adalimumab. Eighteen months after diagnosis, it was discussed with gastroenterology colleagues. Further investigation revealed low ceruloplasmin and an alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) transporter phenotype. Repeated ultrasound scan showed mild liver inflammation and fatty infiltration. Serum copper level and urinary penicillamine loading were highly suggestive of Wilson's disease. Liver biopsy showed high copper content and adiposity. Genetic testing continues to be outstanding. Zinc acetate was started with normalization of liver function within weeks. Abatacept was selected for the ongoing management of JIA and reduced the risk of associated liver disease that may preclude monitoring for Wilson's disease. Conclusions: Wilson's disease is rare and transaminase abnormalities are highly variable. Early diagnosis and treatment before organ damage occurs will optimize the outcome. However, as in this case, children are usually asymptomatic with abnormal transaminases noted incidentally. The blood results of pediatric patients on methotrexate are difficult to interpret and there is little evidence to guide intervention. In our case, there was no improvement in liver function with changes in drug therapy, and this triggered further investigations for the underlying pathology. The case illustrates the importance of considering other causes of elevated liver transaminases during methotrexate follow-up and highlights the value of early discussion with gastroenterology.",,"Bertram, L.;Kelly, I.;Raimondo, V.;Brennan, M.;Henderson, P.;Davidson, J.",2017,October,,0,0,

3414,"Early history of manganese and recognition of its neurotoxicity, 1837-1936","Biomedical recognition reflects technologies ranging from the history of manganese-induced neurotoxicity to the ontology of parkinsonism. The first 1837 report of neurological injury from manganese was made by John Couper, a doctor at the university in Scotland. He made it clear that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach factory near Glasgow. The relatively new technology of chlorine production using manganese was responsible for the new exposure involved. At that time this factory was the world's largest producer of hypochlorite bleach powder. As the 19th century progressed, the technological change in steel production requiring higher manganese content greatly increased the demand for the metal. However, more than six decades passed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity appeared. Two unrelated outbreaks (both in Continental Europe) were reported within weeks in 1901, one by von Jaksch and the other by Embden. All cases were heavily exposed to dust containing manganese. On the eve of the First World War, a total of 9 patients with manganese-induced neurological disease were reported in five separate Continental European publications. Meanwhile, new technology has given way to another source of exposure. Magnetic separation techniques also allowed the extraction of zinc from mixed ore containing iron and manganese, leading to the exploitation of a unique high manganese content ore resource found in New Jersey. Shortly after the introduction of this technology, in 1912 Casamajor reported the first US cases of manganism detailing the classical findings. Several years later, additional cases were reported from the same cohort, and continued exposure due to World War I demand for manganese for use in armaments. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity remained in flux only with great emphasis on common features with Wilson's disease, a recently described syndrome. A groundbreaking 1924 primate study by Mella demonstrated manganese-induced basal ganglia damage; Human autopsy study data in the years that followed further supported the view that manganese toxicity represented a Parkinson's syndrome. As the 1937 centenary of Couper's first report approaches, newer technologies (electric arc welding and battery making) have been linked to manganese-related diseases, even as mineral extraction is expanding as a global source of exposure.

3415,"Wilson's Disease in Children: Opinion Report of the Hepatology Committee of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition","Background: Childhood clinical presentations of Wilson's disease (WD) range from asymptomatic liver disease to cirrhosis or acute liver failure, whereas neurological and psychiatric symptoms are rare. The basic diagnostic approach includes serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The definitive diagnosis of WD can be made using a symptom-based diagnostic scoring system, biochemical tests evaluating copper metabolism, and molecular analysis of mutations in the ATP7B gene. Pharmacological treatment is lifelong and aims to remove excess copper by inhibiting intestinal copper absorption with chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, trientine or zinc salts. Acute liver failure often requires liver transplantation. This publication aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of WD in children. Methods: Questions regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of WD in children were formulated by a core group of ESPGHAN members. A systematic literature review on WD was performed from 1990 to 2016 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, focusing on prospective and retrospective studies in children. Evidence quality was assessed according to the GRADE system. Expert opinion supported recommendations that the evidence was considered weak. Members of the ESPGHAN core group and the ESPGHAN Hepatology Committee voted on each recommendation using the nominal voting technique.

3416,Genotype and clinical course in 2 Chinese Han siblings with Wilson's disease presenting with isolated disabling early osteoarthritis.,"Rationale: Early osteoarthritis (POA) is a rare condition in Wilson's disease (WD). Especially when POA is the only complaint of a long-term WD patient, there may be misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis followed by delayed treatment. Patient concerns and diagnosis: Two Chinese Han brothers were diagnosed with WD by corneal CF rings, laboratory testing, and mutation analysis. They presented with isolated POA in the first 2 decades or more of the disease course and had missed diagnoses during this long period of time. The affected older sibling was disabled by severe osteoarthritis at the age of only 38. Two compound heterozygous pathogenic variants c.2790-2792del and c.2621C>T in the ATP7B gene were revealed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). The Lessons: Puberty-onset POA may be the only complaint of a WD individual for at least 20 years. Long delay in POA treatment of WD can lead to disability in early adulthood.

3417,Hyperacute neurological symptoms with bilateral symmetrical lesions in the pons and basal ganglia in Wilson's disease,"Background: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive inherited copper metabolism disorder characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the liver, brain and other tissues with neuropsychiatric features that are an important part of the clinical picture. Aim Patients and Methods/Materials and Methods: A 43-year-old female was enrolled in our Neurology department with a 3-week history of rapidly progressive, severe ataxic gait, paraparesis, and dysarthria. Clinical examination revealed marked anxiety, finger dystonia, bilateral pyramidal findings, and clonus. Within two weeks, the patient became bedridden due to severe apraxia of walking. Blood serum transaminases were normal, ceruloplasmin levels were low, and urinary copper levels were high. Brain MRI, with a second MRI two weeks later, showed symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the pons, thalamus, and putamen, as well as bilateral involvement of the caudate nucleus, supporting the clinical deterioration observed in the first two weeks after enrollment. Kayser-Fleischer rings were present on ophthalmologic examination. Since the abdominal computed tomography showed normal liver structure, a liver fibroscan showing progressive cirrhosis was performed. Genetic studies showed a Glu1064Ala mutation in the ATP7B gene consistent with Wilson's disease. Penicillamine therapy was initiated with a slow, gradual improvement in the patient's neurological status. Results Conclusion: Neurological rapidly progressive ataxic gait and paraparesis as cardinal neurologic findings in this hyperacute Wilson's disease with symmetric bilateral involvement of basal ganglia and pons without involving other brain regions.

3418,Copper and zinc balance: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,"Maintaining metal homeostasis is crucial for many different enzymatic activities and therefore cell function and survival. In addition, cells exhibit detoxification and protective mechanisms against toxic metal accumulation. Disruption of any of these processes normally leads to cellular dysfunction and eventual cell death. In recent years, loss of metal regulation has been identified as a common pathological feature in many human neurodegenerative diseases. However, in most cases, whether such dyshomeostasis is a primary or secondary downstream defect is still a matter of debate. In this review, we will summarize and critically evaluate the contribution of Drosophila to modeling human diseases involving altered metal metabolism or in which metal dyshomeostasis affects their pathobiology. As a prerequisite for using Drosophila as a model, we will summarize and describe the main features of core genes involved in copper and zinc metabolism, which are conserved between mammals and flies. Drosophila offers some unique strengths to be at the forefront of neurobiological studies. The number of genetic tools, the ability to easily test for genetic interactions in vivo, and the feasibility to perform unbiased genetic and pharmacological screenings are some of the fruit fly's most obvious advantages. In this study, we will pay special attention to the most important results reported in fly models to reveal the role of copper and zinc in cellular degeneration and their effects in the development and progression of human neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease. disease, Friedreich's Ataxia or Menkes and Wilson diseases. Finally, we show how these immediate studies provide further insight into the impact of copper and zinc on molecular and cellular causes and the underlying outcomes of these diseases, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic strategies that have yet to be explored. described in other model systems.

3419,Wilson's disease in a cohort of pediatric patients in Slovakia. [Slovak],"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare metabolic, genetically conditioned disease. Patients may be asymptomatic for varying durations, or the disease may present with nonspecific symptoms up to organ-specific disability. The diagnosis of the disease is confirmed by the analysis of clinical manifestations and the results of targeted examinations. If diagnosed early, the disease can be treated with chelation therapy as the main approach. Patients with acute liver failure are indicated for liver transplantation. Material and Methods: The authors retrospectively evaluated a group of 17 patients diagnosed with WD during childhood or adolescence. Results: WD was confirmed in 17 patients aged 3 to 18 years between 2000 and 2015 in the 1st Department of Pediatrics of the Bratislava Medical Faculty and the Bratislava Children's University Hospital. The most common presentation was the liver with WD (n = 13 patients; 77%). In two patients, WD manifested with acute liver failure in adolescence. Long-term increase in aminotransferase activity was detected in nine patients. We detected WD in the cirrhotic stage in two patients. Neurological symptoms were observed in two patients. H1069Q, the most commonly confirmed genetic mutation in the Central European region, was confirmed in 6 homozygous carriers, while 10 patients were compound heterozygous carriers. In one patient, the pathological mutation could not be confirmed even with extensive genetic testing. From the cohort of 17 children, three patients received liver transplantation, 2 asymptomatic children received zinc, 11 patients received penicillamine, and 1 patient received trientine dihydrochloride. Conclusion: WD is a rare childhood disease. The most common manifestation is the hepatic form in the second decade. It can be very difficult to diagnose. There is no single, highly sensitive and specific parameter that clearly indicates a diagnosis. Serum ceruloplasmin level is the primary screening test. Plasma copper levels and renal excretion of copper serve as ancillary studies. The gold standard to confirm the diagnosis is to determine liver copper concentrations in dried liver tissue. Genetic testing is useful when confirming the diagnosis of WD in asymptomatic individuals, especially in first-degree relatives. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the progression of the disease. If left untreated, the disease is fatal.",,"Kosnacova, J.;Podracka, L.",2017,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14735/amgh2017476,0,0,
3420,Hyperammonemic encephalopathy and new onset seizures in a patient with Roux-en-y and short bowel syndrome,"Learning Objectives: Apart from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and small bowel resection surgeries, rare cases of hyperammonemia have been reported. Here, we discuss a patient with hyperammonemic encephalopathy complicated by new-onset seizures after RYGB surgery and small bowel resection. Methods: A 45-year-old female patient who had RYGB surgery 15 years ago and small bowel resection 5 years ago presented with decreased oral intake, weakness and altered mental status (AMS). She had a 7-month history of high ammonia levels and frequent admissions previously treated with rifaximin and lactulose for AMS. He was intubated for airway protection. Upon admission to our intensive care unit, after taking rifaximin and lactulose for 4 days, her ammonia level was found to increase by 140 mcg/dL (15-45 mcg/dL). Transaminase levels were normal. Previous liver biopsy was noted to be negative for cirrhosis but showed fatty liver changes. A previous study was negative for Wilson's Disease. These results raised suspicion of urea cycle disorder. Serum amino acid levels and urinary orotic acid were tested, urinary orotic acid high at 2.4 mmol/mol Cr (0.4-1.2) and low serum citrulline at 9 nmol/mL (17-46) at 24 nmol/mL ( 32) arginine appeared. -120) and ornithine at 21 nmol/mL (38-130), indicative of partial ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Following treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, and a low protein parenteral diet, ammonia levels returned to normal by hospital day (HD) 8. Her mental status improved and the patient was extubated and lowered to the hospital floor. In HD10, he was re-admitted to the intensive care unit after new-onset tonic-clonic seizures that resolved with Ativan. Micronutrient deficiency was suspected as the cause. Serum electrolyte levels were not compatible with refeeding syndrome. Serum laboratory values showed low levels of zinc, selenium and vitamin B6. Phenytoin, lamotrigine and clozabam were given. She remained seizure-free with supplementation of these micronutrients. Conclusions: Although rare, partial OTC deficiency can cause serious complications even years after RYGB and small bowel resection surgeries. In the treatment of these patients, it is important to change the micronutrients due to the malabsorptive state, as well as careful diet formulation.",,"Grogg, J.;Feinman, J.;El Husseini, I.;Hussain, S.",2018,January,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000528446.22292.0d,0,0,

3422,[52] Follow-up of fatty liver and fibrosis with transient elastography (Fibroscan) in children with Wilson's disease,"Introduction: Liver damage in Wilson's disease ranges from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis to severe fibrosis. Transient elastography (Fibroscan Echosens) has been applied for the non-invasive evaluation of liver stiffness/fibrosis and adiposity in many chronic liver diseases. We aimed to evaluate liver stiffness/fibrosis and steatosis and change in liver function over time in children with Wilson's disease using Fibroscan. Materials and methods: We included 33 children with Wilson's disease, mean age 11.5 years, who were treated with zinc or d-penicillamine. At baseline and after a mean period of 1.5 years, all patients underwent Fibroscan exams with media (M) probes to assess liver stiffness (E) and steatosis (Controlled Attenuation Parameter, CAP). At the same time, repeated laboratory liver function tests were performed. Results: At baseline, our patients had mildly elevated liver enzymes ALT-49.5 U/I (27.5-69), AST-34.5 U/I (25.5-45.5), GGTP-26 U/I (19.5-35.5) and were well. preserved liver function INR-1.1 (1.05-1.16) [median, lower, upper quartile]. Initial Fibros-can examination showed normal median liver stiffness 4.4 kPa (M probe) (4.0-5.4) and mildly elevated liver steatosis CAP-257 dB/m (235-283) [median, lower, upper quartile]. After a 1.5-year period, we detected a statistically insignificant decrease in ALT, AST and INR in our patients. Only GGTP was significantly lower than the baseline results (p = 0.02). Similarly, we did not observe any significant differences in fatty liver (CAP) or liver stiffness with Fibroscan compared with baseline and repeated measurements. Conclusion: According to Fibroscan measurements, liver stiffness/fibrosis and adiposity did not significantly improve in children with Wilson's disease in the short-term follow-up period. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) can be easily used to monitor liver stiffness/fibrosis and adiposity in children with Wilson's disease.",,"Janczyk, W.;Dadalski, M.;Socha, P.",2017,,,0,0,
3423,"[45] LiverMultiScan-new non-invasive method for assessing liver inflammation, adiposity and fibrosis-preliminary report","Introduction: Liver biopsy (LB) is an invasive procedure used in the diagnosis and follow-up of liver diseases. We present preliminary experience with LiverMultiScan (LMS), a new non-invasive method for assessing hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and inflammation. Material and methods: Diagnostic or control liver biopsy (LB) and LMS were performed in two children with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and one child with Wilson's disease. We compared the degree of liver fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis (based on LB) with the LIF score (based on multiparametric NMR, fat and iron liver content measurements). LMS analysis was also performed in a healthy child (as a control). Results: A 12-year-old man (recently diagnosed with AIH, not receiving treatment) showed LB, grade 3 fibrosis, and grade 3 portal and lobular infarction. - mating. LMS analysis reports are closely consistent with the following findings: 0.7% fat, 0.9 mg/g iron, LIF score 3.08%. In a 16-year-old woman with AIH (on Azathioprine) Biopsy showed: fibrosis 1c, portal (2<sup>nd</sup> grade) and lobular (1<sup>st</sup> grade) inflammation. In LMS: 3.2% fat, 0.8 mg/g iron, 1.97% LIF score. In a 7.5-year-old woman with Wilson's disease (on Zincteral) in LB: steatosis grade 3<sup>rd</sup>, ballooning grade 2<sup>nd</sup>, fibrosis grade 2<sup> nd</ sup> grade, portal and lobular inflammation 1<sup>st</sup> grade. In LMS: 32.6% fat, 1.4 mg/g iron, 3.08% LIF score. LMS analysis in a healthy 17-year-old girl without liver disease revealed: 1.2% fat, 1.2 mg/g iron, LIF score 1.73%. From experience in adults, the LIF score < 2% appears to be normal, and higher levels are associated with fibrosis and inflammation. Conclusions: The LIF score is very close to the degree of fibrosis and inflammation on liver biopsy, and liver steatosis defined by NMR is also confirmed by liver histopathology. LiverMultiScan is a promising new non-invasive method that can be used to monitor liver disease in children. Larger groups are needed to confirm and further describe these findings.",,"Banerjee, R.;Janowski, K.;Wozniak, M.;Janczyk, W.;Chelstowska, S.;Jurkiewicz, E.;Grajkowska, W.;Pronicki, M.;Socha, P.",2017,,,0,0,
3424,Quantitative transcranial sonography in Wilson's disease and healthy controls: Cut-off values and functional correlations,"To compare transcranial sonography (TCS) findings in patients with predominantly neurological Wilson's disease (WD) with those from controls and correlate TCS data with the clinical profile of WD. Patients with WD (n = 40/f = 18) and healthy, matched controls (n = 49/f = 20) were evaluated for clinical scales such as TCS, serum copper and iron parameters, and the Unified Wilson Disease Rating. Scale (UWDRS), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Review-Revised (ACE-R), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Beck Depression Inventory. Threshold values of lenticular nuclei and significant nigra echogenic area clearly differentiated WD patients from controls (area under the curve: 95.4% vs. 79.4%). The echogenic area of the substantia nigra was significantly larger in males than in female patients (p = 0.001). Compared with controls, patients also showed hyperechogenicity in the thalamus and midbrain tegmentum/tectum; the width of the third ventricle was increased and the midbrain axial area was decreased. In the WD group, male gender, substantia nigra with echogenic area (r = 0.515, p = 0.0007) and serum ferritin levels (r = 0.479, p = 0.002); lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity associated with dystonia (r = 0.326, p = 0.04) and dysarthria (r = 0.334, p = 0.035); third ventricular width dystonia (r = 0.439 p = 0.005), dysarthria (r = 0.449, p = 0.004), parkinsonism (r = 0.527, p < 0.001), UWDRS neurologic and total scores (both r = 0.504, p = 0.0009), MMSE (r = - 0.496, p = 0.001) and ACE-R (r = - 0.534, p = 0.0004). The lenticular nucleus echogenic area allowed for a highly sensitive distinction between patients and controls. Significant nigra echogenicity and sex differences in iron metabolism are of interest for further studies in WD. TCS reflects different dimensions of WD pathology that are clearly distinguishable from healthy controls and are associated with various clinical features of WD.

3426,First case of cross-assist double domino donor liver transplant,"We present a case of double domino liver transplantation in a 32-year-old woman diagnosed with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and liver dysfunction. A two-stage surgical plan was designed and a domino graft was implanted at each stage. In the first stage, an auxiliary domino liver transplant was performed with a domino graft taken from a 4-year-old girl with Wilson's disease. After removing the right lobe of the liver of the FAP patient, the graft was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and placed on the right side of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The holes of the left, middle and right hepatic veins were reconstructed using an iliac vein patch and then anastomosed to the right side of the IVC. Thirty days later, a second domino liver graft was placed. The second domino graft belonged to a 3-year-old girl with an ornithine carbamyl enzyme defect and has now replaced the native liver (left lobe). Percutaneous transcatheter selective portal vein embolization was performed to balance function and blood flow between the two grafts, and the ""left portal vein"" of the first graft was blocked 9 months after the second transplantation. At the end of 3-year follow-up, liver function indices, blood ammonia and 24-hour urine copper levels were normal. These two domino donor grafts from donors with different metabolic disorders restored normal liver function. Our experience demonstrated a new approach to resolving metabolic disorders with domino grafts and using livers from children. Copyright Â© Author(s) 2017. Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

3427,Zeb2: Inhibition of inhibitors in Schwann cells,"The development of Schwann cells is tightly regulated by the concerted action of activating and inhibitory factors. Most of the regulatory feedback loops identified to date are transcriptional activators that promote the induction of genes encoding integral myelin proteins and lipids. The mechanisms by which inhibitory factors are silenced during Schwann cell maturation are less well understood. We can recently demonstrate a crucial function for the transcription factor zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2) during myelination as a transcriptional repressor of Schwann cell development and maturation inhibitors. Zeb2 belongs to the family of highly conserved 2-handed zinc finger proteins and represses gene transcription by binding to E-box sequences in the regulatory region of target genes. The protein is known to suppress E-cadherin during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor malignancy and mediate its functions by interacting with multiple co-factors. During nervous system development, Zeb2 is expressed in neural crest cells, which are precursors of Schwann cells, which are myelination glial cells of peripheral nerves. Schwann cells lacking Zeb2 cannot fully differentiate and line and myelinate peripheral nerve axons. Maturation inhibitors Sox2, Ednrb and Hey2 emerge as targets for Zeb2-mediated transcriptional repression and show persistent aberrant expression in Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells. While indispensable for adult Schwann cells, reactivation of Zeb2 is essential to achieve remyelination and functional recovery after nerve injury. In summary, Zeb2 is emerging as an ""inhibitor of inhibitors"", a new concept in Schwann cell development and nerve repair. Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,"Brinkmann, B.

In this case, combined treatment with steroids and D-Penicillamine may be effective. Methods: After excluding common causes such as alcohol, viruses and drugs, we examined the clinical, histological and laboratory profiles of patients with chronic liver disease to find the etiology of the disease. Results: Of the 10 patients, 6 were male and 4 were female. The most common clinical presentations were abdominal distension (80%), abdominal pain (30%), pedal edema (60%), splenomegaly (40%), and upper GI bleeding (40%). Laboratory examination revealed anemia (50%), thrombocytopenia (70%), prolongation of prothrombin time (60%), normal liver function 60%, and abnormal liver function (40%). Hepatitis A, B, C and E were negative in all cases. Serum cereloplasmin <20 mg (30%), normal level (70%).

3432,Maintenance zinc therapy after initial penicillamine chelation to treat symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease in a resource-constrained setting,"Introduction and Aim: Experience with zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease (WD) is limited. The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of penicillamine followed by zinc in the treatment of symptomatic hepatic Wilson's disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of 31 symptomatic hepatic WD patients in whom disease severity scores (Child's, MELD, Nazer, and New Wilson Index score) and 24-hour Urinary copper scores were compared at 3 time points at admission, baseline, and transition. penicillamine to zinc and at the end of follow-up. Results: 10 of 31 patients with symptomatic hepatic WD had associated neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD. Penicillamine was changed to zinc sulfate because of financial constraints (in 28 patients) or because of the adverse effects of penicillamine (in 3 patients). The child's grade was A in 6 patients, B in 5 patients, and C in 17 patients (at baseline). The duration of initial penicillamine chelation therapy was 134 (2-320) weeks, the median (range) and duration of subsequent zinc therapy was 363 (35-728) weeks. There was a significant improvement from baseline in liver function tests and disease severity scores (Nazer's, New Wilson Index, Child's, and MELD score) in switching from penicillamine to zinc. This improvement was maintained until the end of the study period. 17 patients with Child C cirrhosis at presentation were treated with penicillamine for 111 (2-320) weeks followed by zinc for 344 (41-652) weeks, 15 of whom showed significant improvement in liver function and disease severity scores by the end of follow-up. Of the 31 study patients, 3 died at weeks 284, 112, and 437. No patient underwent liver transplantation. Conclusions: In a limited resource setting, penicillamine followed by zinc may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with symptomatic hepatic WD of all degrees of initial disease severity. Our data also suggest that some patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease can be managed with medical therapy by avoiding liver transplantation.",,"Gupta, P.;Choksi, M.;Goel, A.;Zachariah, U.;Sajith, K.

Patients with >=9 months of adequate follow-up were evaluated for response to chelation therapy. They were analyzed as the following categories: (a) complete recovery (asymptomatic+normalization of transaminases, serum albumin and coagulation); (b) partial recovery (asymptomatic+near normalization of transaminases+serum albumin or coagulation); (c) progression (impairment of synthetic functions, decompensation or death); (d) drug toxicity Results: 111 WD children 108 (36-180 months) had an overall PELD score of 16 (-11 to 60). Liver histology was consistent with 68% (n=27/40). Figure 1 shows the presentation and the result. Chelation was started in 84% (n=94) of them. 14% (n=16) patients died in hospital due to advanced disease. It was analyzed for 66 outcomes with 43 (9-144) months of follow-up. 92% (n=60) were receiving D-penicillamine monotherapy and 6% (n=4) were receiving D-penicillamine and zinc treatment with additional severe neurological picture.

3435,Wilsonian fulminant liver failure in children and adolescents: a systematic review of 274 cases.,"Background: Wilsonian Fulminant Liver Failure (WFHF) is a serious condition that typically requires liver transplantation (LT). As a result of its relative rarity, it has been difficult to study WFHF in depth. Data in the pediatric population (<18 years) are scarce and limited to case reports and small case series. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the clinical and biochemical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of children and adolescents with WFHF. Methods: Database searches were performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was limited to articles published in English between January-1984 and March 01, 2017. Articles were excluded if pediatric data could not be extracted. Wilson's disease (WH) was defined according to AASLD guidelines. Due to the heterogeneity of the definition of acute liver failure (ALF) in the literature, subjects were included if defined by the authors of the article as having ALF. The following data points were taken from the articles: study design, initial clinical and biochemical characteristics, genetic mutations, treatment, and clinical outcome. If not reported, the following ratios were calculated: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) - total bilirubin (TBIL) < 2 and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) - alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 4. Results: 56 total (case reports (30) , case series (23) and cohort studies (3)) Manuscripts involving 274 participants met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in Asia (21), followed by 19 in North America, 15 in Europe and 1 in Australia. Studies ranged from 1-61 subjects with a median age of 12.9 (range 4.0 to 17.6) at presentation. Women represented 74% (202/274) of all patients. Kayser-Fleischer rings were seen in 80% (153/191) and Coombs negative hemolytic anemia was reported in 98% (61/62). ALP/TBIL and AST/ALT ratios were evaluated in 60 (22%) and 63 (23%) participants, respectively, and <2 and >4 were found in less than 55% of subjects. LT was administered to 47% (128/274) of the reported subjects. Of these, 58% (74/128) underwent deceased donor LT and 20% (25/128) received living donor LT. The graft type was not reported in the remaining subjects. 24% (65/274) of reported cases achieved spontaneous liver healing with the aid of extracorporeal liver support systems. Plasmapheresis was the most commonly used extracorporeal system, and D-penicillamine was the most commonly used chelating agent in surviving subjects with a native liver. ATP7B mutations were reported in only 21 participants, thus limiting evaluation of genotype-phenotype relationships. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review to examine WFHF in a significant cohort of children and adolescents. The female dominance of the WFHF is clearly demonstrated in this analysis. It should be noted that only half of the reported subjects required LT and the remainder responded to medical therapy. This finding may be due to biased reporting of cases explaining the use of liver support systems. It may also reflect minor differences in WFHF disease definition. Prospective studies are needed to explore the true frequency and necessity of LT in WFHF.",,"Vandriel, S.;Ayoub, M.;Ling, S.;Ng, V.;Roberts, E.;Kamath, B.",2017,November,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000001805,0,1,
3436,A Copper sensor for in vivo MRI,"Copper is the third most abundant transition metal in the body and is an essential nutrient for human growth and development.1 Copper is bound to a number of proteins and enzymes in which it plays essential catalytic and structural roles.2 As a result of redox activity, cellular copper homeostasis is tightly regulated and deterioration causes a number of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Prion, Menkes, and Wilson's disease.3 These diseases cause the local concentration of copper ions to vary from a few mM to several mM.4 The relationship between dynamic copper concentration and its physiological or pathological role extensively studied, information on structural behavior in biologically relevant conditions is poorly understood due to the lack of real-time copper detection techniques.5 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable medical tool. diagnostic technique that allows non-invasive, three-dimensional visualization of all organisms. high spatial and temporal resolution. The design of contrast agents that alter the T1 relaxation times of water protons in response to a particular analyte is of great importance for MRI.

By biochemical techniques, we have also shown that GdL forms a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-mediated ternary complex with HSA (GdL-Cu<sup>2+</sup>-HSA). Initial in vivo studies were performed to confirm the ability of GdL to detect changes in copper levels in the liver using C57bl/6 wild-type mice (Figure 1).

3437,Functional characterization of the ZEB2 regulatory environment,"Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is an important regulator of development of the central nervous system (CNS). Although transcriptional regulation of ZEB2 is required for CNS development, the elements that regulate ZEB2 expression have yet to be identified. Here, we identified the proximal regulatory region of ZEB2 and characterized transcriptional enhancers during neuronal development. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for active (H3K27ac) and repressed (H3K27me3) chromatin regions in human neuronal progenitors, together with an in vivo zebrafish enhancer assay, we functionally characterized 18 candidate enhancers at the ZEB2 locus. Eight enhancers drove expression patterns specific to different mid/hindbrain regions (ZEB2#e3 and 5), trigeminal-like ganglia (ZEB2#e6 and 7), notochord (ZEB2#e2, 4 and 12), and whole brain (ZEB2#). e14). We further examined the minimal sequences that drive developer-specific activity in the mid/hindbrain and notochord. Using a reporter assay in human cells, we demonstrated an increased activity of the minimal notochord enhancer ZEB2#e2 in response to AP-1 and DLX1/2 expressions, with suppressed activity of this enhancer seen in response to ZEB2 and TFAP2 expressions. We show that Dlx1 but not Zeb2 and Tfap2 interacts with the Zeb2#e2 enhancer sequence in mouse notochord at embryonic day 11.5. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we deleted the ZEB2#e2 region, which leads to reduced ZEB2 expression in human cells. Thus, we characterized the distant transcriptional enhancers and transacting elements that govern the regulation of ZEB2 expression during neuronal development. These findings pave the way for future analysis of the role of ZEB2 regulators in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",,"Yaacov, R.

3438,Immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease: a case report and literature review,"Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and may be associated with liver disease. However, cases of Immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease are very rare. A 20-year-old Japanese man presented with microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. A kidney biopsy showed mesangial cell proliferation, immunoglobulin A deposition, and electron-dense deposition in mesangial areas, all consistent with Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Abdominal computed tomography revealed liver atrophy and splenomegaly, and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease with decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion, Kayser-Fleischer rings and copper deposition. The patient was successfully treated with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate and showed improvement in renal findings. Wilson's disease is a rare cause of secondary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. We suggest that Wilson's disease be considered as the cause of secondary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy in juvenile patients with hematuria, proteinuria, and splenomegaly, and that serum ceruloplasmin concentrations, urinary copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleischer rings should be evaluated in these patients.",,"Shimamura, Y.;Maeda, T.;Gocho, Y.;Ogawa, Y.;Tsuji, K.;Takizawa, H.",2018,2025-09-01 00:00:00,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13730-018-0365-7,0,0,
3439,[Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration],"Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration Summary. Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The most common clinical manifestations are liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Pathophysiologically, Wilson's disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that lead to defective biliary excretion of copper and subsequent copper deposition in the liver and other organs. Its prevalence is approximately 1:30 000, but its penetration, clinical presentation, and disease severity vary widely, from asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes to cirrhosis or acute liver failure with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore, Wilson's disease should be suspected and ruled out in cases of uncertain liver disease or neuropsychiatric disturbance. Diagnostic algorithms are complex and include clinical testing, ophthalmologic examination (Kayser-Fleischer rings in split lamp examination), blood and urine tests, genetic testing, imaging, and histology. In compensated liver disease, treatment of Wilson's disease with copper depletion (chelators, zinc) is usually effective. In the case of liver failure, liver transplantation may be required, which corrects the underlying defect in copper metabolism. New drugs with improved efficacy and tolerability are in clinical development.",,"Mensing, B.;Nowak, A.;Zweifel, S.;Terracciano, L.;Bernsmeier, C.;Filipowicz Sinnreich, M.",2018,Nov,https://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0040-5930/a000995,0,0,
3440,Copper Complexes in Cancer Treatment,"Copper homeostasis is tightly regulated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to ensure adequate amounts for cuproprotein biosynthesis and limit oxidative stress production and toxicity. In the last century, copper complexes have been developed as antimicrobials and for the treatment of diseases involving copper dyshomeostasis (for example, Wilson's disease). There is now a repertoire of copper complexes that can regulate bodily copper through numerous mechanisms. In addition, many copper complexes are being evaluated for a variety of therapeutic indications (eg, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) requiring a range of copper-related pharmacological effects. Cancer therapy is also of great interest, as copper is recognized as a limiting factor for many aspects of cancer progression, including growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Consequently, 'old copper complexes' (eg, tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol) have been reused for cancer therapy and have demonstrated anticancer activity in vitro and in preclinical models. Similarly, new custom-made copper complexes have been designed based on the structural and biological properties ideal for their anticancer activities. Human clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of copper complexes as anticancer agents, and significant progress has been made in understanding their pharmacological requirements. In this section, we provide a historical perspective on the major copper complexes currently being reused for cancer therapy and detail several of the more recently developed compounds that have emerged as promising anticancer agents. We also provide an overview of known mechanisms of action, including molecular targets, and discuss relevant clinical trials.",,"Denoyer, D.;Clatworthy, S. A. S.;Cater, M.

3441,D-penicillamine combined with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism enhances the response of lung and breast cancer cells to radiation and carboplatin via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidative stress,"D-penicillamine (DPEN), a copper chelator, has been used to treat Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent evidence suggests that DPEN in combination with biologically relevant copper (Cu) concentrations produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cancer cell cultures, but this has effects on cancer cell responses to ionization. . radiation and chemotherapy are unknown. Increased steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were detected in MB231 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells following treatment with DPEN (100 microM) and copper sulfate (15 microM). Clonogenic survival demonstrated that DPEN-induced cancer cell toxicity was Cu-dependent and significantly increased by inhibition of glutathione [using butionine sulfoxime (BSO)] before exposure, as well as by inhibition of thioredoxin reductase [using Auranophine (Au)]. Treatment with catalase inhibited DPEN toxicity and confirmed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the toxic species. Moreover, pretreatment of cancer cells with iron sucrose increased DPEN toxicity, inhibited DPEN toxicity when treated with deferoxamine, a Fe chelator that inhibits redox cycling. Importantly, DPEN also showed selective toxicity in human breast and lung cancer cells relative to normal untransformed human lung or mammary epithelial cells and increased cancer cell killing when combined with ionizing radiation or carboplatin. Consistent with selective cancer cell toxicity, normal untransformed human lung epithelial cells had significantly lower unstable iron pools than lung cancer cells. These results suggest that DPEN could be reused as an adjuvant in the treatment of metal ion-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidative stress and DPEN in conventional cancer therapy.",,"Sciegienka, S.

3443,"Safety, efficacy, and biomarker findings of PBT2 in targeting Abeta as a modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease: a phase IIa, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: PBT2 is a metal protein attenuating compound (MPAC) that affects Cu2(+)-mediated and Zn2(+)-mediated toxic oligomerization of Abeta seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strong preclinical efficacy data and completion of early, clinical safety studies preceded this phase IIa study, whose aim was to evaluate the effects of PBT2 on safety, efficacy, and biomarkers of AD. METHODS: Between December 6, 2006 and September 21, 2007, community-dwelling patients over 55 years of age were enrolled in this 12-week, double-blind, randomized PBT2 trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of PBT2, 250 mg of PBT2, or placebo. Inclusion criteria were early AD (mini mental state examination [MMSE] score (20 to 26 points) or Alzheimer's disease rating scale – cognitive subscale (ADAS gear) score 10 to 25 points) who received a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil). , galantamine, or rivastigmine) for at least 4 months, modified Hachinski score of 4 or less, and CT or MRI results consistent with AD. The main results were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were plasma and CSF biomarkers and cognition. The analysis was therapeutic. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471211. RESULTS: 78 patients were randomly assigned (29 to placebo, 20 to PBT2 50 mg, and 29 to PBT2 250 mg), and 74 (95%) completed the study. At least one treatment-emergent adverse event in 42 (54%) patients (10 [50%] PBT2 50 mg, 18 [62%] PBT2 250 mg, and 14 [48%] placebo). No serious adverse events were reported by patients receiving PBT2. There was a dose-dependent (p=0.023) and significant reduction in CSF Abeta(42) concentration in patients treated with 250 mg PBT2 compared to those treated with placebo (least squares mean change from baseline was 56.0 pg/mL, 95) % CI - 101.5 to - 11.0; p=0.006). PBT2 had no effect on plasma biomarkers of AD or serum Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) concentrations. The cognition test included the ADAS wheel, the MMSE, and a neuropsychological test battery (NTB). Of these tests, the two executive function component tests of NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group: the category fluency test (2.8 words, 0.1 to 5.4; p=0.041) and the trailing part B ( -48.0 s, ""83.0 to ""13.0; p=0.009).

3445,Complementary Naturopathic Medicine for Periodontitis,"This study aims to evaluate selected naturopathic drugs for adult periodontitis and to identify variables that affect successful outcomes when traditional and alternative approaches to prevent and treat periodontal disease are combined. The collaboration between Kaiser Permanente, Oregon Health Sciences University, and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine provides a unique environment for this type of research. Periodontitis is an important cause of tooth loss and adversely affects systemic health. The limitations of traditional periodontal therapy have forced scientists and clinicians to search for new drugs, and naturopathic medicine has many promising interventions. The three naturopathic medicines are potential adjuncts in the prevention and treatment of periodontitis, as they are used to ameliorate elements of host resistance known to be important in periodontal health and disease. In periodontitis, connective tissue components are broken down enzymatically. In naturopathy, Connective Tissue Nutrient Formula (CTNF) (vitamins A, C and D, glucosamine sulfate, oligoproanthocyanindins, copper, zinc, manganese, boron, silicon, magnesium and calcium) is specifically prescribed to increase the integrity of essential connective tissue elements. and improve their resistance to degradation. Periodontitis begins when the permeability of the oral sulcular epithelium allows pathogenic bacterial components to invade deeper periodontal connective tissues. In naturopathy, glutamine is prescribed to reduce oral-intestinal epithelial membrane permeability. Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during the stress response is a risk factor for periodontitis. Adaptogenic herbs (AH) (Panax ginseng, Withania somnifera, and Eleutherococcus senticosus) are prescribed by naturopathic physicians to reverse the effect of bacterial and psychosocial stressors. Because glutamine, CTNF, and AH target the pathophysiological mechanisms known to underlie periodontitis, they are attractive candidates in clinical and mechanistic investigations of complementary medicine approaches to the treatment of periodontitis. Kaiser Permanente adult periodontitis patients will serve as subjects and receive standard periodontal therapy. Three of the four randomly assigned groups will also receive supplements of glutamine, CTNF, or AH. We will determine the effects of these supplements on clinical outcomes (attachment loss, pocket depths, indicators of inflammation, plaque composition, need for periodontal surgery, acute periodontal problems, tooth loss). In addition to completing a battery of self-report measures (stress, coping, quality of life), study subjects will provide samples of blood, saliva, gingival cervical fluid, and bacterial dental plaque. These samples will be studied as part of the Lab Core to identify the biological and genetic traits associated with successful outcomes.

3446,Effect of Nutritional Supplementation in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Pilot Study,"The prevalence of type 2 DM and related complications continues to increase. Diet is an important factor in the etiology of type 2 DM. Intake of zinc and omega 3 fatty acids can regulate glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes in disease. Zinc is involved in many biological processes, including enzyme activity, stabilization of cell membranes, regulation of gene expression, and cell signaling. Zinc supplementation has been shown to improve glycemic control in both animals and humans. The normalizing effect of zinc on glucose homeostasis may be related to its involvement in insulin metabolism. Zinc functions in the synthesis, storage, secretion and action of insulin. Omega-3 also improves glycemic control, and dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with DM. Both zinc and omega-3 function to mediate lipid metabolism. Zinc supplementation has been found to be associated with a beneficial increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations in individuals with type 2 DM. The mechanism may again involve insulin, which has been proposed as an independent predictor of plasma HDL. Omega-3 directly activates transcription factors that regulate lipid metabolism and is known to reduce serum triglyceride levels in DM. Zinc appears to favorably influence oxidative stress-related parameters in DM through a number of mechanisms, including regulation of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, metallothionein, NFβ and nitric oxide signaling. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of zinc and omega 3 supplementation on hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in a population with type 2 DM. This study will recruit 48 postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups for a 12-week period: placebo, zinc, omega 3 or zinc + omega 3 supplement.

Maternal venous plasma copper and zinc concentrations at birth correlate with umbilical vein plasma copper and zinc concentrations. Infants fed formulas with higher copper content had a low mean plasma zinc concentration without a significant increase in mean plasma copper concentration. Current WHO recommendations on minimum copper intake for formula-fed infants cannot be achieved with currently available formulas and are likely incorrect.",,"Salim, S.;Farquharson, J.;Arneil, G.

3450,"WTX101 in patients newly diagnosed with Wilson's disease: final results of a global, prospective phase 2 trial","Background and Objectives: Current treatments for Wilson's disease, a copper metabolism disorder caused by the absence or dysfunction of the ATP7B protein, are limited in efficacy, safety, and multiple daily dosing. WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is a premium copper-modulating oral agent that acts by forming complexes with albumin, increasing bile copper excretion and decreasing serum copper (NCC) not bound to ceruloplasmin. Methods: In an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, 28 newly diagnosed patients with Wilson's disease (18-64 years of age, 46% male, 89% with some degree of neurologic symptom and approximately 50% with cirrhosis at baseline) mostly once daily He received WTX101 monotherapy using a response-guided dosing regimen with individualized doses of 15-120 mg/day. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to 24 weeks in copper-corrected NCC levels in triple tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin complexes in treated patients (NCCc). The end-stage Liver Disease (MELD) model and modified Nazer Score were used to monitor the stability and safety of liver disease. Neurological status was assessed using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS). Results: At 24 weeks, 71% of WTX101-treated patients either achieved or maintained normalized NCCc levels or experienced a >=25% reduction from baseline NCCc (p < 0.001). The mean NCCc decreased significantly from 3.6 µM at baseline to 0.9 µM at week 24 (p < 0.0001). The mean MELD score and modified Nazer score remained stable over the course of treatment, indicating stabilization of liver function. Reversible asymptomatic liver test elevations observed in 39% of patients (at a dose of 30 mg/day or higher) were generally mild to moderate and resolved with dose adjustments. Compared with baseline, patients showed significant improvements in mean UWDRS disability score (6.6 vs 4.1, p < 0.001) and neurological symptom score (22.8 vs 16.6, p < 0.0001) at week 24. There was no drug-induced neurological deterioration at baseline. Conclusions: Final data from the first global, prospective clinical trial in Wilson's disease demonstrate that WTX101 rapidly lowers and controls NCCc, resulting in improved disability and neurological status with stable liver function and a favorable safety profile. These findings, together with the simple dosing regimen, suggest that WTX101 has the potential to meet many unmet needs in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",,"Weiss, K. H.;Askari, F.

3451,Two-center randomized controlled feasibility study of insulin pump therapy in young children with diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: Our goals were to determine whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) could be safely used in young children, subjects using CSII, compared to continued multiple daily injections (MDIs), whether those using CSII would have superior glycemic control. have less hypoglycemia for control levels and if families using CSII report improved quality of life. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 1-year randomized feasibility study comparing CSII versus ongoing MDIs in preschool children with a history of type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months. Prospective results included measures of overall glycemic control (HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring system), incidence of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, percentage of glucose values below 3.9 mmol/l, and parents' quality of life report. RESULTS: 19 subjects were aged 1.7 to 6.1 (mean 3.6) years, duration of diabetes was 0.6 to 2.6 (mean 1.4) years, and baseline HbA1c was 6.7 to 9.6% (mean) was between 7.9%. Seven subjects were male. Nine subjects were randomized to begin CSII and 10 to continue MDI. All key features are well balanced. General metabolic control, diabetes quality of life, and incidence of hypoglycemia were similar in the two groups. While none of the subjects had diabetic ketoacidosis, one subject in each group had an episode of severe hypoglycemia. No CSII subjects stopped using the pump during or after the study. CONCLUSIONS: CSII may be a safe and effective method of administering insulin in young children.",,"Wilson, D. M.;Buckingham, B. A.;Kunselman, E. L.;Sullivan, M. M.;Paguntalan, H. U.;Gitelman, S.

3452,Zinc-carnosine and vitamin E supplementation does not improve the gastrointestinal side effects associated with cyclosporine treatment of canine atopic dermatitis.,"Chelated zinc-carnosine and vitamin E [GastriCalm (GCM); Teva Animal Health] is marketed as an anti-emetic supplement for dogs to help repair damaged gastric and intestinal mucosa. The aim of this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine whether GCM reduces the frequency of vomiting, diarrhea, and appetite changes during initiation of cyclosporine (Atopica; Novartis Animal Health) therapy for the treatment of canine atopic dermatitis. Sixty specific dogs diagnosed with atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to the GCM (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) groups. All dogs received ~5 mg/kg of cyclosporine (range, 3.5-5.8 mg/kg) once daily. Dogs <13.6 kg were given half a tablet of GCM or placebo; Dogs greater than 13.6 kg received one tablet once daily. GastriCalm or placebo was administered 30 minutes before the meal and cyclosporine was administered 2 hours after the feeding. Owners recorded episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, and changes in appetite. Dogs were examined on days 0 and 14. Forty-one out of 60 dogs (68.3%) had at least one episode of vomiting, diarrhea, or change in appetite, and nine placebo dogs (30%) and ten GCM dogs (33.3%) were released. adverse events (AE). 27 (45%) of 60 dogs vomited and 15 (25%) of 60 dogs had diarrhea. There was no significant difference in individual AE episodes, but the placebo group had a significantly lower overall AE score (sum of appetite changes, vomiting, and diarrhea episodes; P = 0.022). Small dogs (<6.82 kg) had significantly less total AE in both treatment groups and tolerated cyclosporine better than larger dogs (P < 0.05). 2010 Authors.

3453,A clinical trial of bone mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis caused by hepatolenticular degeneration.,"The efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) on liver fibrosis in animals has been proven, but few studies in the human body and such research in China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate the effect of BMSC treatment on hepatic fibrosis caused by hepatolenticular degeneration and its effect on serological indicators. Sixty patients with liver fibrosis caused by hepatolenticular degeneration were randomly divided into two groups, a penicillamine group of 30 patients each, and a BMSCs plus penicillamine group. The therapeutic effects on hepatic fibrosis, liver function and serological markers before and after treatment were recorded and data were compared. After treatment, serum levels of HA, PCIII, LN, CIV, TIMP-1 and MMP-1 were decreased in both groups (P < 0.05). However, cytokine levels in the BMSCs plus penicillamine group were significantly lower than those in the penicillamine group (P < 0.05). Combination therapy with BMSCs and penicillamine had a significant positive effect on liver fibrosis caused by hepatolenticular degeneration.
