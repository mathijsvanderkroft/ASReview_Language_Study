3,"Recommendations for a standardized avian coronavirus (AvCoV) nomenclature: Outcome of discussions within the European Union COST Action FA1207: ""Towards Control of Avian Coronaviruses: Strategies for Vaccination, Diagnosis and Surveillance""","Viruses within the Coronaviridae family show variations within their genomic sequences, particularly within the main structural protein, the spike (S) glycoprotein gene. Therefore, many different antigenic forms, serotypes or variant strains of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) exist worldwide. Only a few of them, the so-called protector types, protect against different serotypes. New serotypes arise through recombination or spontaneous mutations. Antigenic virus variants that differ significantly from known serotypes arise from time to time. The result of this variability is inconsistent nomenclature and classification of viral strains. In addition, no uniform classification methods are currently defined. As part of COST Action FA1207 ""Towards control of avian coronaviruses: Strategies for Diagnostic, Surveillance, and Vaccination"" (working groups ""Molecular Virology"" and ""Epidemiology""), we have set ourselves the goal of defining and developing a uniform and internationally standardized nomenclature develop classification of AvCoVs. We recommend using ""CoV Genus/AvCov/Host/Country/Sample ID/Year"" to refer to AvCoV strains.",,,2016.0,,10.1637/0005-2086-60.2.411,0

5,Genotyping of bovine leukemia virus isolates circulating in the Stavropol region,"The bovine leukemia virus (BLV) circulating on the territory of the Stavropol Territory of Russia is characterized according to the modern classification of subspecies. BLV proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was separated from the peripheral blood of animals naturally infected with this virus. Subsequent amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the env gene with a length of 444 nucleotide pairs (pn) made it possible to assign the investigated isolates to genotypes 4 and 6. In addition, we dissected the localized BLV isolate apart from clusters of isolates of all eight known genotypes, allowing for classification as atypical. In the course of sequencing a section of the env gene of BLV provirus isolates separated in this region, the presence of 31 point mutations in the studied locus was detected, 11 of which are significant: 2 transversions and 9 transitions.",,"Abakin, S.

6,"Identification and phylogenetic analysis of sheeppox during an outbreak of sheep in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt","Sheeppox virus (SPPV) is one of the listed and reportable diseases affecting sheep production with a significant impact on trade in new breeds of sheep. This study was conducted to identify sheeppox using cell culture, electron microscope (EM) and open reading frame (ORF) 103 gene during an outbreak of the local sheep breed that occurred in April 2017 in Sharia Governorate, Egypt. Affected adult sheep showed typical skin pox lesions on the face, inner lips, inner thigh and under the tail. The incidence rate of infection was 23.5% and the mortality rate in young lambs aged 3 to 6 months was 8.2%. Forty-three scab and tissue samples from clinically diseased adult sheep and dead lambs were collected and cultured on Vero cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed within 3 to 7 days in 40 specimens. A typical poxvirus had a brick-like shape with rounded ends when EM stained negatively and an ovoid structure with a dumbbell-shaped DNA core with concave body sides when EM positively stained. Bands of about 570 bp relative to SPPV were obtained by conventional PCR using the ORF103 gene. The sequence amplicon was analyzed by NCBI-BLAST and registered in GeneBank under accession number MG873537, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed showing that the isolated SPPV strain differed from other SPPV strains isolated in Egypt, India, China and the USA. resembled tribes. Finally, both EM and PCR are considered to be sensitive, rapid and powerful methods for identifying SPPV from tissue and scab samples without the need for further culture, in addition to the useful and easy use of the ORF103 gene to distinguish SPPV from other capripoxviruses.",,"Abd-Elfatah, E.

7,Isolation and molecular characterization of novel infectious bronchitis virus variants from vaccinated broiler flocks in Egypt,"The present study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of circulating strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in vaccinated broiler flocks in Giza and Fayoum governorates. Thirty-four isolates were collected and egg multiplication demonstrated its ability to induce typical IBV lesions after three to five consecutive passages. Three selected isolates were identified as IBV using a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and further characterized by partial spike (S) gene sequence analysis. The phylogenetic analysis revealed their grouping into two variant groups. Group I consisted of a variant (VSVRI_F3) that shared 99.1% nucleotide sequence identity with the Q1 reference strain. Group II consisted of variants VSVRI_G4 and VSVRI_G9, which shared 92.8% to 94.3% nucleotide identity with Egyptian variants Eg/12120S/2012, Eg/12197B/2012, and Eg/1265B/2012. With regard to the deduced amino acid sequence, the three variants had a similarity of 77.1% to 85.2% with the vaccine strains currently used in Egypt. These results underline the importance of monitoring the prevalence of IBV variants in vaccinated broiler flocks and adopting an appropriate vaccination strategy.",,"Abdel-Sabour, M.

8,Retrotransposable elements on the W chromosome of the silkworm Bombyx mori,"The sex chromosomes of the silkworm Bombyxmori are designated ZW(XY) for females and ZZ(XX) for males. The B. mori W chromosome does not recombine with the Z chromosome and autosomes, and genes for morphological traits on the W chromosome have not yet been mapped. In addition, femininity is determined by the presence of a single W chromosome, regardless of the number of autosomes or Z chromosomes. In order to understand these interesting features of the W chromosome, it is necessary to analyze the W chromosome at the molecular biological level. To first isolate W chromosome-specific DNA sequences as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, we compared the genomic DNAs between males and females by PCR with 10-mer random primers. To date we have identified 12 W-specific RAPD markers, and with the exception of one RAPD marker, all deduced amino acid sequences of these W-specific RAPD markers show similarity to previously reported amino acid sequences of retrotransposable elements from different organisms. After constructing a B. mori DNA lambda phage genomic library, we obtained two lambda phage clones, one with the W kabuki RAPD sequence and one with the W samurai RAPD sequence, and found that this DNA -Sequences included nested structures of many retrotransposable elements. To further analyze the W chromosome, we obtained 14 W-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from three BAC libraries and subjected these clones to shotgun sequencing. The resulting assembly of sequences did not produce a single contiguous sequence due to the presence of many retrotransposable elements. Therefore, we coupled the PCR with shotgun sequencing. Through these analyses, we found that many long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, retroposons, DNA transposons and their derivatives have stratified on the W chromosome. These results strongly suggest that retrotransposable elements are the major structural component of the W chromosome.",,"Abe, H.;Mita, K.;Yasukochi, Y.;Oshiki, T.;Shimada, T.",2005.0,,,0
9,A novel sapelovirus-like virus isolation from wild boar,"novel sapelovirus-like virus was isolated from a wild boar (Sus scrofa). In this study, partial viral genomic nucleotide sequences were determined using the rapid determination system for viral nucleic acid sequences (RDV) Ver. 3.1, which we recently developed for novel virus discovery. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 and 3A proteins and their nucleotide coding sequences from enteroviruses and sapeloviruses showed that the isolated virus was closely related to porcine sapelovirus.

10,Genomic and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of infectious bronchitis coronavirus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gamma-ray coronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analyzed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing, and genetic variation across the entire viral genome was examined at the sub-consensus level by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR were predicted. The relative frequencies of missense:silent SNPs were calculated to provide a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending order were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. The E and 3b protein products play a key role in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding showed that the mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs in the ORF of the spike (S) protein was 0.67%, below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were localized to the hypervariable region (HVR)1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was significantly more variable, containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four contiguous mutant amino acids mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modeling led to the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the subconsensus level, the tenet that the HVRs in the S1 subunit are highly tolerant to amino acid changes induced by genetic drift is challenged.",,"Abolnik, C.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.033,0
11,Development of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5: sequence data indicate stepwise changes of the cleavage site,"The genetic composition of an H5-subtype hemagglutinin gene quasispecies recovered from ostrich tissues infected with the H5-subtype influenza virus was analyzed using a next-generation sequencing approach. The first evidence for repeated copying of a stretch of poly(U) in the connecting peptide region in the hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is provided. Several mismatched RNA species were detected in the infected host, corresponding to probable intermediate sequences between the putative low pathogenic precursor nucleotide sequence of the H5 influenza strain and the highly pathogenic gene sequence of the avian influenza virus. In silico analyzes of the identified RNA sequences predicted that the intermediate H5 sequence PQREKRGLF plays an important role in subsequent mutational events that relocate the HACS coding region from stable base pair RNA regions to a single-stranded bulge and thereby the connecting Prepare peptide coding region for RdRP hatching.",,"Abolnik, C.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3337-x,0
12,Outbreaks of H6N2 avian influenza viruses in chickens resulted from a reassortment of ostrich viruses H6N8 and H9N2,"The first recorded outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in South African chickens (H6N2 with low pathogenicity) occurred in June 2002 in Camperdown, KwaZulu/Province of Natal (KZN). To determine the source of the outbreak, we defined the phylogenetic relationships between different H6N2 isolates and the previously unpublished gene sequences of an H6N8 virus isolated from ostriches in the Leeu Gamka region in 1998 (A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 ). We have shown that two distinct H6N2 genetic lineages (sublineages I and II) circulated in the Camperdown area, which later spread to other regions. Sublineages I and II shared a recent H6N2 common ancestor, resulting from a resorting event between two South African ostrich isolates A/Ostrich/South Africa/9508103/95 and (H9N2) A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 (H6N8). In addition, H6N2 sublineage I viruses displayed several molecular genetic markers, including a 22 amino acid stalk deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, predicted increased N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the HA protein gene associated with the Adaptation of AI viruses to chickens. The H6N2 NS1 and PB1 genes recently shared common ancestors with those of contemporary Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses. Our results suggest that ostriches are potential mixing vessels for strains of avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks and support other reports that H6 viruses are able to establish stable lineages in chickens. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Abolnik, C.;Bisschop, S.;Gerdes, T.;Olivier, A.;Horner, R.",2007.0,,10.1007/s11262-006-0007-6,0
13,Phylogenetic analyzes of low pathogenicity H6N2 avian influenza viruses from chicken outbreaks (2001-2005) indicate that they are reassortants of the historic low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses H9N2 and H6N8 from ostriches,"Low pathogenicity (LPAI) and high pathogenicity (HPAI) avian influenza viruses are regularly isolated from South African ostriches, but in 2002 the first documented outbreak of LPAI (H6N2) in South African chickens on commercial farms in the Camperdown area of KwaZulu /Natal occurred ( KZN) province. A sequence analysis of all eight genes was performed and a phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidasc sequences. Results of phylogenetic analysis indicated that the chicken H6N2 viruses most likely arose from a reassortment between two South African LPAI ostrich isolates: an H9N2 virus isolated in 1995 and an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998 of recent common ancestor. One of these sub-lines was limited to the province of KZN. The neuraminidase gene contained a 22 amino acid deletion in the NA stalk region implicated in adaptation to growth in chickens, while the other group, although lacking the NA stalk deletion, referred to commercial Farms spread to other provinces. The persistence of certain H6N2 types in some regions for at least 2 years supports reports from Asia and southern California suggesting that H6N2 viruses can form stable lineages in chickens. It is likely that the ostrich H6N8 and H9N2 precursors to the chicken H6N2 viruses were introduced into ostriches from wild birds. Ostriches, in which AI infections are often subclinical, can serve as mixing vessels for LPAI strains that occasionally spread to other poultry.",,"Abolnik, C.;Bisschop, S. P. R.;Gerdes, G.

14,Complete genomic sequence of an African avian Paramyxovirus type 4 strain isolated from a wild duck,"random amplification/deep sequencing approach was used to determine the complete genome sequence of an avian paramyxovirus type 4 (APMV-4) strain isolated in 2010 from a wild duck in South Africa. This sequence represents the fourth complete genome of APMV-4 in public sequence databases and the first for the African continent. A total of 87,402,081 paired-end reads were received from Illumina, of which 47,338,867 (54.16%) mapped to reference genome EU877976. The entire genomic sequence of 15,054 nt, including the intact termini, was recovered with high redundancy (coverage per base: average = 198,861.06, minimum = 52, and maximum = 1,790,889). Pairwise comparison of complete genomic nucleotide sequences showed that APMV-4/Egyptian goose/South Africa/N1468/10 had 97.3% sequence identity with APMV-4/KR/YJ/06 and 96.4% sequence identity with APMV-4/Mallard duck/Belgium shared /15129/07 and 90.8% nucleotide sequence identity with APMV-4/duck/HK/D3/75. Genomic features were consistent with previously sequenced viruses, including predicted open reading frames for the NP, P, F, and L genes, but variations in the coding regions for the M and HN genes were identified. The sequencing approach chosen in this study was able to successfully indicate quasi-species in the viral inventory.",,"Abolnik, C.;de Castro, M.;Rees, J.",2012.0,Dec,,0
15,Characterization of Pigeon Paramyxoviruses (Newcastle Disease Virus) isolated from 2001 to 2006 in South Africa,"Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), a variant of the Newcastle disease virus that mainly affects pigeons and pigeons, has been isolated in South Africa since the mid-1980s. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 viruses have been introduced into South Africa multiple times based on the presence of two separate lineages, 4bi and 4bii, which have been circulating in Europe and the Far East since the early 1990s. In 2006, a PPMV-1 virus was isolated from an African ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) that became acutely infected with PPMV-1 and died, probably after ingesting infected pigeon carcasses on a closely related PPMV-1 strain in the region was also isolated from pigeons collected nearby. The hornbill isolate had ICPI and MDT values characteristic of PPMV-1 strains. The threat of PPMV-1 to poultry production and biodiversity in southern Africa underscores the importance of monitoring the spread of this strain.",,"Abolnik, C.;Gerdes, G.

16,Characterization of a highly pathogenic H5N2 subtype influenza A virus isolated from ostriches in South Africa in 2004,"Objectives: The strain HPAI H5N2 that caused an outbreak in ostriches in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa in 2004 was characterized. Design: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed on sera from ostrich farms in the outbreak region, and intravenous pathogenicity testing (IVPI), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid on the isolated during the outbreak HPAI-H5N2 virus sequencing and phylogenetic comparisons were performed. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence at the HA0 cleavage site determined by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing was PQREKRRKKRGLF and thus the virus fell under the definition of a highly pathogenic virus but was isolated in a chicken IVPI test for the virus isolated from the index case and a value of 0.63 was measured, which is below the criterion for highly pathogenic viruses in this in vivo test. After another passage in fertilized eggs, a second IVPI was performed and an increased value of 1.19 was obtained. Cloacal swabs were taken from the initial IVPI birds, inoculated into incubated chicken eggs, and a third IVPI was then performed on the resulting hemagglutinating infectious allantoic fluid. An index of 2.73 was recorded. Conclusions: HI test appears to be the more sensitive test compared to AGID when testing sera for antibodies to avian influenza. An ostrich-derived virus with a virulent HA0 site was initially non-virulent in chickens, but virulence increased after passage in the latter. Phylogenetic analyzes showed the link between AI viruses transmitted by wild ducks and those infecting ostriches. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Abolnik, C.;Londt, B. Z.;Manvell, R.

17,Complete genome sequence of a velogenic Newcastle disease virus isolated in Mexico,"Cases of the highly virulent Newcastle disease virus are increasing in Mexico. In 2005, an outbreak of Newcastle disease occurred on a laying hen farm in Puebla state, despite vaccination with the LaSota strain. Farmers experienced a significant drop in egg production as a result of a field challenge virus. In this study, we characterize the virus responsible for the outbreak, APMV1/Chicken/Mexico/P05/2005. The virus is categorized as a velogenetic virus with an intracranial pathogenicity index of 1.99 and a mean time of death of chick embryos of 36 hours. The full genome length of the virus was sequenced at 15,192 bp. In addition, phylogenetic analysis classified the virus as a member of class II, genotype V.

18,Avian Influenza: Global Assessment of a Potential 21st Century Pandemic,"The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of Asian descent and subsequent spread to other parts of the world, as well as the continued spread of the Eurasian-African H5N1 epidemic to domestic, wild and human birds, has attracted unprecedented attention and threat in recent times from a potential pandemic about the bird-human connection. Historically, from 1878 to 1955, avian plaque was described in many countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Africa as an avian disease with high mortality, and the etiology was proven to be a filterable virus. In the 1930s to 1950s, avian plaque disappeared as an endemic disease in most parts of the world. In 1949 the first report of a low virulence disease in chickens caused by the LPAI virus was reported. In 1955, the etiology of fowl plaque was determined to be influenza A virus, which was subsequently identified as the H7 subtype. In 1959, an ""avian plaque-like"" outbreak was described in chickens, the first report of avian plaque caused by a non-H7 AI virus, ie the first avian plaque outbreak caused by the H5 subtype of AI virus. In 1961, the first wild bird infections and fatalities in South Africa's common terns were reported. In 1966 and 1971, the first H5 and H7 LPAI viruses were identified; Prior to this period, only HPAI viruses had subtypes H5 and H7. In 1970, the serological AGID test was introduced, which allowed easy and rapid identification of AI virus-infected poultry flocks. In 1972 there was the first isolation of LPAI viruses from asymptomatic wild birds: ducks in the United States and shorebirds in Australia. In 1981, the term ""highly pathogenic avian influenza"" was accepted as the standard nomenclature for avian plaque and related synonyms. In 1983, LPAI virus was observed to mutate to HPAI virus during the LPAI field outbreak, and specific genomic changes were identified in the proteolytic cleavage site of hemagglutinin responsible for the virulence change. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, molecular criteria were added to the definition for classifying an AI virus as HPAI. 2002 saw the first reported infections and deaths in a variety of wild bird species by AI virus H5N1 HPAI virus. The main objective of this review is to highlight the global situation of HPAI and provide baseline information to show the potential pandemic nature of the virus so that control and prevention strategies can be improved.",,"Abubakar, M.

19,Phylogenetic and molecular characterization of the coronavirus affecting bovine and avian species in Cuba,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are pathogens of veterinary importance affecting birds and cattle in Cuba; however, the molecular properties and genetic diversity of these viruses are unknown. This study aimed to determine the molecular properties and genetic diversity of both agents based on the spike S gene. Molecular analysis was performed on field strains of BCoV collected between 2009 and 2011, and phylogenetic studies were performed using partial or full S gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. Studies on phylogenetic inference in the S1 region of recent isolates of IBV were also performed. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were in a single cluster, supported by 100% bootstrap and 1.00 posterior probability values. The Cuban BCoV sequences were also clustered with the USA BCoV strains corresponding to GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This phylogenetic cluster was also the only group of sequences in which no recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in the Cuban strains, four were unique. On the other hand, two putative genotypes were found in the herds examined that were genetically distinct from the H120 strain of the Massachusetts genotype used in the Cuban vaccination program. In addition, a potentially nephropathogenic IBV isolate was found for the first time in Cuba.

20,Viromic analysis of wastewater input into a river basin reveals a diverse accumulation of RNA viruses,"The detection of viruses in the environment depends heavily on PCR-based approaches that require reference sequences for primer design. While this strategy can accurately detect known viruses, it does not find new genotypes or emerging and invasive virus species. In this study we investigated the use of viromics, ie high-throughput sequencing of the viral fraction of the biosphere, for the detection of human/animal pathogenic RNA viruses in the Conwy river basin in Wales, UK. Using a combination of filtration and nuclease treatment, we extracted the viral fraction from wastewater and estuary water and sediment, followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on the Illumina HiSeq platform to discover RNA viral genomes. We found a higher abundance of RNA viruses in wastewater samples than in river water and sediments, and we assembled a complete genome of norovirus genotype GI.2 from wastewater wastewater not simultaneously detected by conventional reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). became. . The co-presence of different rotavirus signatures in the effluent indicated the potential for zoonotic infections in the region and suggested effluents from pig farms as a possible origin of these viruses. Our results demonstrate that viromics can be an important tool in detecting pathogenic viruses in the environment and can be used to inform and optimize reference-based detection methods, provided that appropriate and rigorous controls are included. <b>IMPORTANT</b> Enteric viruses cause gastrointestinal diseases and are often transmitted fecal-orally. When wastewater is discharged into river systems, these viruses can contaminate the environment. Our results show that we can use viromics to find the range of potentially pathogenic viruses present in the environment and identify predominant genotypes. The ultimate goal is to trace the fate of these pathogenic viruses from origin to the point where they pose a threat to human health and inform reference-based detection methods and water quality management.",,"Adriaenssens, E.

21,Prevalence of porcine parvoviruses in some South African pig herds with a background of porcine circovirus type 2 infection,"Classical porcine parvovirus is an important causative agent of reproductive disorders in swine with a confirmed history of global distribution. However, detection of many novel porcine parvoviruses has increased in recent years, but there is a lack of information on the occurrence and prevalence of these viruses in South Africa. Molecular detection of some known parvoviruses, namely porcine parvoviruses (PPVs)-1, 2, 3 and 4, porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV1/2), was archived on 110 randomly selected individuals Pigs conducted samples collected in 2015 and 2016. Samples were drawn from previously screened and confirmed porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infected farms, with farm-level incidence ranging from 5.6 to 60%. The results showed that all parvoviruses screened were present as follows: PPV1 (29.1%), PPV2 (21.8%), PPV3 (5.5%), PPV4 (43.6%), PBo-likeV (21 .8%) and PBoV1/2 (44.6%). The frequency of double infections of the viruses was even 18.2% for PPV2/PPV4 and PPV4/PBoVs; while 17.3% and 7.3% of the samples screened showed multiple infections with the three and four viruses, respectively. Further phylogenetic analysis of partial PPV1, 2 and PBoV1/2 sequences revealed two major clades for each of the viruses. This study reports the first epidemiological investigation and molecular characterization of classical and emerging porcine parvoviruses in South African swine herds. It also provides insight into the diversity and distribution of these viral pathogens within the herds of the study area and confirms their potential for co-infection with PCV2.",,"Afolabi, K.

Studies by various investigators suggested some similarity to myxomavirus and swinepox virus, while another study characterized COTV SPAn232 as a vaccinia virus strain. Due to the lack of consensus, we performed an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximum yields at approximately 24-48 h and were accompanied by viral DNA replication and a characteristic early/late pattern of viral protein synthesis. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells up to 4 days post-infection and only generated viral plaques after 8 days. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV using a combination of next-generation 454 and Illumina DNA sequencing technologies. A unique contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp containing 185 genes, including the 90 genes conserved in all chordopoxviruses, was obtained. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) associated with host defense evasion, including two novel genes encoding CC chemokine-like proteins, each present in double copy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest values for amino acid identity with cervidpoxvirus, capripoxvirus, suipoxvirus, leporipoxvirus, and yatapoxvirus. However, COTV was grouped within this clade as a distinct branch, which clearly precluded its classification as an orthopoxvirus. Therefore, our data suggest that COTV may represent a new genus of smallpoxviruses. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Afonso, P. P.;Silva, P. M.;Schnellrath, L. C.;Jesus, D.

23,"Lumpy skin disease outbreaks in Greece in 2015-16, implementation of emergency vaccination and genetic differentiation between field isolates and vaccine virus strains","The aim of this study is to present epizootiological data from the lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreaks in Greece in 2015–16, following the introduction of emergency vaccination and total eradication, together with laboratory data on genetic differentiation between field isolates and live attenuated vaccine virus strains. A descriptive geographic chronology analysis was performed to show the progressive westward shift of outbreaks and concomitant absence of further outbreaks in previously affected regional units where high vaccination coverage was achieved. The isolation and molecular characterization of LSDV from the first recorded case in Greece (Evros/GR/15 isolate) was performed. The two live attenuated LSD vaccine viruses currently used for emergency immunization in Greece have been sequenced and linked to the Evros/GR/15 isolate in 3 genomic regions (GPCR gene, RPO30 gene and partial LSDV126/LSDV127 genes). compared. Sequence comparisons showed clear differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in the placement of the Evros/GR/15 isolate in the same clade with all field LSDV isolates, while grouping vaccine strains into a distinct cluster within the LSDV clade. Additional samples from animals with skin nodules (N=13) were characterized by sequencing in the 3 genomic regions mentioned above. Among them, the attenuated vaccine virus was identified in 5 vaccinated animals. A PCR-RFLP method targeting the LSDV127 gene was developed and proved to be able to discriminate between the characterized field and vaccine strains. The results of the present study support the importance of timely and intensive vaccination for the control of LSDV diseases and the genetic differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. This forms the basis for the development of PCR-based DIVA assays, which would be of great importance for effective disease surveillance and control during LSD vaccination campaigns.",,"Agianniotaki, E.

24,Spread of emerging infectious laryngotracheitis viruses in Australia,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a major viral disease in chickens in many countries around the world. In this report, the status of ILT in Australia was used as a model to assess the evolution of ILT viruses (ILTVs). Because of its geographic isolation, Australia harbored its own lineage of ILT viruses (ILTV) until 2007. However, investigation of the ILT viruses (ILTV) involved in outbreaks between 2007 and 2009 has found that many of the outbreaks were caused by two new virus genotypes, class 8 and class 9. These two were found to be recombinant Viruses arose as a result of recombination between pre-existing live vaccine strains (SA2 and A20) and another live vaccine strain (Serva) introduced into the country in 2007. The new recombinant ILTVs also showed significantly higher virulence and replication capability compared to a previously prevalent Class 2 ILTV. In the current study, examining a large number of ILTVs isolated in outbreaks between 2009 and 2015 revealed the emergence of another recombinant virus (class 10) which appears to have become a predominant genotype in New South Wales. However, in Victoria, recombinant class 9 gradually became the dominant virus, replacing class 2. As such, there was an unusual pattern in the geographic spread of the emerging viruses across different states in the country. These results suggest that ILTV is rapidly evolving towards greater portability and hence greater capacity to propagate in ILTV-free areas.",,"Agnew-Crumpton, R.;Vaz, P. K.;Devlin, J.

25,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of the Orf virus in the Kashmir Himalayas,"Orf virus (ORFV) is a zoonotic pathogen that mainly affects sheep and goats and is responsible for considerable economic damage. ORFV is endemic to all major sheep and goat farming areas of the world including the Indian subcontinent. However, the nature of ORFV circulating among sheep and goats in the Kashmir Himalayas has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we describe natural ORFV outbreaks in sheep and goats in the Kashmir Himalayas. We demonstrated the presence of ORFV in the eschar lesion by PCR amplification of the major envelope protein (B2L) gene. We sequenced the virus interferon resistance gene (VIR) and determined its phylogenetic relationship to that of the published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VIR gene revealed that the ORFV isolates from the Kashmir Himalayas were separated into two major clusters. The sheep isolates showed genetic homology with the sheep strains reported from Greece and Italy, whereas the goat-specific strain showed homology with the goat strains reported from China. This study demonstrates the presence of ORFV infection in sheep and goats and reports the first phylogenetic analysis of ORFV strains prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas.",,"Ahanger, S.

26,"Host-parasite relationships of bacteria and phages can be revealed by oligostickiness, a measure of relaxed sequence similarity","Motivation: Recent metagenome analysis has revealed a large number of host-unassigned viruses. Although assigning viruses to their hosts is fundamentally important not only for virology but also for disease prevention, it has been a tedious and difficult task so far. The only effective method for this purpose was to find them in the same microscopic view. Now, we tried a computational approach based on bacterial and phage genome sequences and introduced a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (Set of Oligostickiness Similarity Score), derived from oligostickiness, a measure of the binding affinity of oligonucleotides to template DNA. Results: We could confirm host-parasite relationships of bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all tested phages (25 species) had a remarkably higher SOSS score with their host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have a significantly higher similarity to its host than its non-lysogenic (shedding or virulent) ones such as fd and T4 (host : E. coli) or phage gamma and PZA (host: B. subtilis). This finding is very promising for associating host-unknown viruses with their host. We also examined the relationship between codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis and obtained evidence supporting the hypothesis that higher SOSS levels result from cohabitation in same environment, which can cause the common biased mutation. Therefore, lysogenic phages that remain inside longer resemble the host. Â© The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

27,Genetic diversity and comparison of diagnostic tests to characterize foot-and-mouth disease viral strains from Pakistan 2008–2012,"We report the laboratory analysis of 125 clinical specimens from suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in cattle and Asian buffalo collected in Pakistan between 2008 and 2012. 89 of these samples were found to contain viral RNA by rRT-PCR, 88 of which were also found by virus isolation (VI) to contain infectious foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), with strong correlation between these tests (κ = 0 ,96). Samples that were VI positive were serotyped by antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence acquisition and analysis. The sequence data identified FMDV serotypes A (n=13), O (n=36), and Asia-1 (n=41), including three samples in which both Asia-1 and O serotypes were detected. Serotype A viruses have been classified into three distinct Iran-05 sublineages: HER-10, FAR-11 and ESF-10. All Asia-1 serotypes were in group VII (Sindh-08 lineage) in a genetic group distinct from viruses isolated before 2010. All serotypes O have been classified as PanAsia-2 within two distinct sublineages: ANT-10 and BAL-09. Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotyping, the overall sensitivity of the Ag-ELISA to correctly determine the serotype was 74% and the serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% for Asia-1 and 89% for O. The serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 93% for Asia-1 and 94% for O. Interestingly, 12 out of 13 serotype A viruses were not detected by Ag-ELISA. This study confirms previous reports on the regional genetic diversity of FMD in Pakistan and underscores the importance of continued validation of diagnostic tests for rapidly evolving pathogens such as FMD.",,"Ahmed, Z.;Pauszek, S.

29,Whole genome analysis of porcine kobuviruses from pig faeces in Japan,"Porcine kobuviruses (PoKoVs) are ubiquitous in swine populations worldwide and are considered enteric viruses in swine. Although PoKoVs have been detected in pigs in Japan, complete genomic data for Japanese PoKoVs are not available. In the present study, 24 near-complete or complete sequences of the PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheal faeces and 14 non-diarrheal faeces of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomic approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2-100% identity with the full nucleotide coding sequences (nt) and the closest relatedness of 85.1-98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a 90 nt deletion in the 2B coding region. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to their geographic region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of genetic regions L, P1, P2, and P3 had distinct topologies from each other. Analysis of the similarity plots using strains from a single farm revealed partially different similarity patterns between strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that recombination events have occurred. These results indicate that different PoKoV strains are widespread and geographically unrestricted on pig farms worldwide, and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs.",,"Akagami, M.;Ito, M.;Niira, K.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Naoi, Y.;Kishimoto, M.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Aoki, H.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Oka, T.;Ichimaru, T.;Yamasato, H.;Ouchi, Y.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1464-9,1
30,"Two new ""legumoviruses"" (genus Begomovirus) naturally infecting soybeans in Nigeria","Two new ""legumoviruses"" (genus Begomovirus; family Geminiviridae) that naturally infect soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Nigeria have been molecularly characterized. Based on characteristic symptoms in soybeans, the two viruses are tentatively named Soybean Mild Mottle Virus (SbMMV) and Soybean Chlorotic Blotch Virus (SbCBV). SbCBV has a bipartite genome while SbMMV has only one DNA A component. The DNA A component of SbMMV is 2,768 nucleotides (nt) in length and the DNA A and DNA B components of SbCBV are 2,708 and 2,647 nt in length, respectively. In pairwise comparisons, the DNA A component of SbMMV and SbCBV showed 62% nt sequence identity, suggesting that these two viruses are different. While DNA A of SbMMV contains two virion and four complementary sense open reading frames, that of SbCBV lacks the viral sense AV2, a characteristic gene present in “old world” begomoviruses. A pairwise comparison with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of other begomoviruses in the databases showed that SbCBV had a maximum of 74% identity with Cowpea Golden Mosaic Virus and SbMMV had a maximum of 65% identity with Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus and Kudzu Mosaic Virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA A component of SbCBV and SbMMV, along with those of other begomoviruses available in the databases, indicated an accumulation of the two viruses within the ""Legumovirus"" clade of the begomovirus phylogenetic tree. In addition, the DNA A and B components of SbCBV from Centrosema pubescens Benth were found to be identical to those from soybean, suggesting that wild legume species are a potential alternative host for the virus. As soybean is an introduced crop, the identification of two distinct begomoviruses naturally infecting soybeans in Nigeria suggests the emergence of ""legumoviruses"" in plant species native to Africa and underscores their potential threat to sustainable cultivation of soybeans on the African continent. © Springer Verlag 2010.",,"Alabi, O.

Serological tests such as cross-agar gel precipitation test (AGPT), serum neutralization test (SNT), ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence test (IIF) and indirect immunoperoxidase test (IIP) showed that the viruses were closely related. However, serotyping of these isolates by homologous and heterologous titration of their hyperimmune sera (HIS) in SNT and ELISA showed contradictory results and did not allow classification of these viruses as of goat and sheep origin. Protein analysis of these isolates was performed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, and physical staining and immunodetection of blotted protein profiles. The results showed that these isolates differed mainly in the 41.5, 39.5 and 37.5 kD polypeptide bands. These analysis techniques allowed the classification of these isolates into four groups, GV1 and GV2 in the first, GV3 in the second, LBV and ORFII in the third, and NZ2 in the fourth.",,"Alajeeli, K.

However, the virus has been linked to multiple outbreaks of highly fatal hemorrhagic fever in non-human primates (NHPs), particularly cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) native to the Philippines. In addition, Reston virus was isolated from domestic pigs in the Philippines. To better understand virus spillover events and potential adaptation to new hosts, the entire genome sequences of representative reston virus isolates were obtained using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach, and comparative genome analysis and virus fitness analysis were performed . Nine viral genome sequences were completed for new and previously described isolates obtained from a variety of hosts including a human case, non-human primates and pigs.",,"Albarino, C.

These were compared to the sequences of 164 isolates published on GenBank and the resulting alignment analyzed phylogenetically using maximum likelihood. The results are presented as unrooted family trees. Briefly, the isolates were divided into six broadly distinct groups (lines 1 through 6). Lines 3 and 4 were further subdivided into four sub-lines (a through d) and line 5 into five lines (a through e). Considerable genetic heterogeneity has been identified in avian paramyxovirus type 1, which appears to be influenced by host, time and geographic origin.

35,The long view: a selective review of 40 years of Newcastle disease research,"This review was written for the series celebrating 40 years since the first issue of Avian Pathology. The authors' aim was to present developments in Newcastle disease (ND) research over the past 40 years that they considered significant. During these 40 years there have been several panzootia of this serious disease in poultry and in the last 30 years there has been persistent panzootia in domestic pigeons which has spread to wild birds and poultry. The 40-year period began with global outbreaks of severe ND, which served as an important impetus for ND research. Although early work focused on controlling the disease, particularly through the improvement and development of new vaccines and vaccination schedules, ND virus was considered a useful laboratory virus for replication and virulence studies even before the 1970s. This review covers historical developments in the following areas: understanding the molecular basis of virulence; Epidemiology and relationship of different ND strains, both antigenic and genetic; the emergence of virulent strains and their relationship to low virulence viruses; sequencing and understanding of the viral genome and genes; the development of molecular-based rapid diagnostic tests; and the phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of ND virus.

Recently, reproducible (from substrate to substrate), spatially homogeneous (over large areas), SERS-active substrates have been commercialized and are now commercially available. We used these patterned surfaces to acquire SERS spectral signatures from intact bovine papular stomatitis, pseudo-cowpox, and yaba monkey tumor viruses. Striking spectral signature features make it possible to distinguish between these genetically distinct Poxviridae-Chordopoxvirinae virions. In addition, partial least squares, a multivariate calibration method, was used to develop PC-based algorithms useful for the classification of unknown parapoxvirus samples (e.g., bovine papular stomatitis virus and pseudo-cowpoxvirus) unique to SERS spectral signatures are based.

Here we examine the involvement of AI H5N1 in acute respiratory disease outbreaks that occurred in several commercial chicken farms in Egypt in 2011 and we describe the pathology caused by the virus during the course of the outbreak. Twenty-one chicken farms with a history of acute respiratory symptoms and high mortality were screened for AI H5N1. Virus identification was based on a hemagglutination inhibition test and PCR detection and sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Virus distribution was determined by immunohistochemical staining for AI antigens in organs from infected birds. Standard H&E staining was performed for histological examination of the affected organs. 81% of the birds examined, representing 100% of the farms examined, were positive for the AI H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the isolated virus indicates its membership in clade 2.2.1. Viral antigens were localized to the endothelial cells of the heart, liver, lung and skin where pathologic lesions including congestion, hemorrhage, multifocal inflammation and necrosis were observed simultaneously. According to the pattern of viral antigen and lesion distribution in the visceral organs, we propose cardiovascular and circulatory failure as the probable cause of death during these outbreaks. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the epidemic status of the AI H5N1 virus in Egypt and demonstrates the highly pathogenic nature of the local isolates.",,"Ali, A.;Elmowalid, G.;Abdel-Glil, M.;Sharafeldin, T.;Abdallah, F.;Mansour, S.;Nagy, A.;Ahmed, B.;Abdelmoneim, M.",2015.0,,10.1515/pjvs-2015-0101,0

Recently, two new field isolates (Car1 and Car2) of CCMV derived from cowpeas showed marked phenotypic symptoms when inoculated into cowpeas. CCMV-Car1 induced severe mosaic and intervenal chlorosis, while CCMV-Car2 caused mild mottle and leaf curl. Both isolates resulted in an asymptomatic infection of Nicotiana benthamiana. The complete genome of both isolates was amplified, cloned and sequenced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using specific primers against the CCMV sequences available in the GenBank database. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared between the newly sequenced CCMV isolates and the three previously characterized CCMV strains (T, M1 and R). Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-1 sequence showed that CCMV-Car1 was in a separate branch from the remaining CCMV isolates, while CCMV-Car2 was grouped together with CCMV-R. Two main groups were obtained based on the RNA-2 and RNA-3 sequences. One group included CCMV Car1 and CCMV Car2 isolates, while the other contained CCMV T, CCMV M1 and CCMV R strains. Recombination programs detected a potential recombination event in the RNA-1 sequence of the CCMV Car2 isolate but not in the RNA-2 and RNA-3 sequences. The results showed that both mutations and recombination played important roles in the genetic diversity of these two new CCMV isolates. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Ali, A.;Shafiekhani, M.;Olsen, J.",2011.0,,10.1007/s11262-011-0613-9,0

41,A virus detection method involving DNase treatment and its application to identify two bovine parvovirus species,"The identification of previously unrecognized viral agents in serum or plasma samples is of great medical interest but remains a major challenge, mainly because of the abundance of host DNA. The current methods, library screening or representation difference analysis (RDA), are very laborious and require selected sample sets. We have developed a simple and reproducible method for detecting viruses in single serum samples, based on DNase treatment of the serum, followed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) of the fragments, and evaluated its performance against known methods viruses. Both DNA viruses and RNA viruses at a concentration of ≥106 genome equivalents per ml were reproducibly identified in 50 µl of serum. During the evaluation of the method, two previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in the bovine sera used as a diluent. The nearly complete genome sequence of each virus has been determined; their classification as two species (tentatively named bovine parvoviruses 2 and 3) was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Both viruses have been found to be common contaminants of commercial bovine serum. DNase treatment of serum samples can prove to be a very useful tool for virus detection. The DNase SISPA method is useful for screening large numbers of samples and also allows for rapid sequencing of high titer viruses.",,"Allander, T.;Emerson, S. U.;Engle, R. E.;Purcell, R.

The technology was applied to pooled human airway samples. The first experiments detected seven human virus types without the use of a specific reagent. Viruses detected included a coronavirus and a parvovirus, both of which were uncharacterized at the time. The parvovirus, tentatively named human bocavirus, was identified in a retrospective clinical study in 17 additional patients and associated with lower respiratory tract infections in children. The molecular virus screening method offers a general, culture-independent solution to the problem of detecting unknown virus species in individual or pooled samples.

43,Estimation of viral richness from shotgun metagenomes using an abundance counting approach,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are important drivers of ecosystem functions, yet little is known about the vast majority of viruses. Viral shotgun metagenomics enables the investigation of broad ecological questions in phage communities. An ecological feature is the richness of species, i.e. the number of different species in a community. Viruses do not have a phylogenetic marker analogous to the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to estimate richness, and thus contig spectra are used to measure the number of viral taxa in a given community. A contig spectrum is generated from a viral shotgun metagenome by assembling the random sequence reads into groups of sequences that overlap (contigs) and counting the number of sequences that group within each contig. Currently available tools for analyzing contig spectra to estimate phage richness are limited by relying on rank abundance data. RESULTS: We present statistical estimates of virus richness from contig spectra. The program CatchAll (http://www.northeastern.edu/catchall/) was used to analyze contig spectra in terms of frequency count data rather than rank frequency, allowing for formal statistical analysis. In addition, the impact of potentially false low-frequency counts on richness estimates was minimized by two methods, empirical and statistical. The results show higher estimates of virus richness than previous calculations in almost all environments analyzed, including pig feces and treated freshwater. CONCLUSIONS: CatchAll provided consistent estimates of richness across viral metagenomes from the same or similar environments. Furthermore, analysis of pooled viral metagenomes from different environments via mixed contig spectra resulted in larger estimates of richness than that of the component metagenomes. Using CatchAll to analyze contig spectra will improve estimates of the richness of viral shotgun metagenomes, particularly of large datasets, by providing statistical measures of richness.",,"Allen, H.

44,Antibiotics in the feed induce prophages in the microbiome of pig faeces,"Antibiotics are an inexpensive tool to improve feed efficiency and prevent disease in farm animals, but the full extent of their side effects is not yet known. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; Therefore, a side effect could be prophage induction throughout the gut microbiome. Here we used metagenomics to assess the effect of two dietary antibiotics (Carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sul-famethazine, and penicillin]) on porcine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromas). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes such as B. Multidrug-resistance efflux pumps were identified in the viromas, but antibiotics in the diet did not cause significant changes in their frequency. The frequency of genes encoding phage integrase was significantly increased in the viromas of drug-treated pigs versus the viromas of non-medicated pigs, demonstrating the induction of prophages by antibiotic treatment. Population dynamics of phages and bacteria were also studied. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phage (predators) were abundant, supporting the kill-the-winner ecological model of population dynamics in the pig fecal microbiome. The data show that the dynamics of the gut ecosystem are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a side effect of antibiotics in the feed. © 2011 Allen et al.",,"Allen, H.

47,Epidemiological study on air filtration systems to prevent PRRSV infection in large herds of sows,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is the most economically important pathogen in the US swine industry. Transmission of aerosols between herds is a major concern in regions with high swine density, and filtration of the incoming air, combined with standard biosecurity procedures, has been shown to prevent transmission of PRRSV to susceptible herds. To quantify the effects of air filtration in reducing the risk of PRRSV outbreaks, we compared the incidence rate of new PRRSV introductions in 20 filtered and 17 unfiltered control sow herds in a swine-rich region of North America during a 7-year study period. Events of introduction of new viruses were detected by phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV ORF5 gene sequences. Putative new viruses were defined as exogenous (introduced) based on differences in ORF5 nucleotide sequence compared to previous farm isolates. The impact of cutoff values for sequence differences ranging from 2 to 10% on case definition and relative risk was assessed. Unfiltered farms suffered about 0.5 outbreaks per year, with a seasonal increase in risk during cooler periods. The baseline risk before filtration was about 0.75 per year in treatment farms, about 50% higher than in control farms. Air filtration significantly reduced the risk of PRRSV introduction events to 0.06–0.22 outbreaks per year, depending on the cut-off values used to classify a virus isolate as new to the herd. Overall, air filtration resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in the risk of introducing novel PRRSV, suggesting that in large sow farms with good biosecurity in pig-rich regions, approximately four-fifths of PRRSV outbreaks could be due to aerosol transmission. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Alonso, C.;Murtaugh, M.

48,"Characterization of H5N1 influenza, a virus that caused the first highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in Saudi Arabia","Introduction: An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in domestic birds occurred in Saudi Arabia (SA) in 2007. METHODS: Forty-three hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes from HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically. Fully sequenced genes were performed to compare them with other viral HA and NA gene sequences reported in the public databases are available. Results: Molecular characterization of the H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct clades, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, of H5N1 viruses circulating in the area. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene showed that the virus from 2.2.2 contained the sequence SPQGERRRK-R/G at the cleavage site, while the virus from 2.3.1 contained the sequence SPQRERRK-R/G. In addition, a few mutations involving amino acid substitutions such as M226I at the N-link glycosylation site were identified in two of these isolates. The amino acid sequence of the NA gene revealed a 20 amino acid deletion in the NA stalk region, which is required for increased virulence of influenza viruses and their adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. Since close contact between humans and birds is inevitable, a thorough understanding of virus epidemiology, factors affecting virus spread, and molecular characterization such as phylogeny and substitution rates of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region is required. Conclusion: Two genetically distinct clades were found to be circulating in the country, which could likely lead to recombination and the emergence of more virulent virus strains. These results could be helpful to authorities developing control measures against these viruses.",,"Al-Qahtani, A. A.;Mubin, M.;Almajhdi, F. N.;Alarifi, S.;Cruz, D. M. D.;ul Rehman, M. S.

50,Molecular characterization of the first strains of bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) isolated from in vitro production of bovine embryos in Argentina,"Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is increasingly believed to be responsible for various reproductive tract problems. The virus mainly infects blood mononuclear cells and shows a specific tropism for vascular endothelia, reproductive and fetal tissues. Epidemiological studies suggest that it affects reproductive performance, and its presence at various sites in the reproductive tract underscores its potential transmission in transfer-stage embryos. This work describes the biological and genetic characterization of BoHV-4 strains isolated from an in vitro bovine embryo production system. BoHV-4 strains were isolated in 2011 and 2013 from granulosa cells and bovine oocytes from ovarian batches collected at a local slaughterhouse and used as “starting material” for in vitro bovine embryo production. Compatible BoHV-4 CPE was observed in the co-culture of granulosa cells and oocytes with MDBK cells. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR assays targeting three ORFs of the viral genome. The phylogenetic analyzes of the tribes suggest that they were not evolutionarily related. Therefore, it is possible that BoHV-4 ovarian infections, at least in Argentina, have periodically emerged during the development of the virus, which may have implications for in vitro embryo production systems. Therefore, although BoHV-4 does not appear to be a common risk factor for in vitro embryo production, data are still limited. This study demonstrates the potential of transferring BoHV-4 by embryo transfer. Furthermore, the high variability among the BoHV-4 strains isolated from aborted cows in Argentina underscores the importance of further research on the role of this virus as a pathogen with the potential to cause reproductive diseases in cattle. The genetic characterization of the isolated strains provides data for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of BoHV-4 infections. In addition, it will lead to fundamental insights into the molecular aspects of the virus and the way these strains circulate in the herds.",,"Altamiranda, E. G.;Manrique, J. M.;PÃ©rez, S.

54,"broad spectrum, one-step reverse transcription PCR amplification of the neuraminidase gene from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus","BACKGROUND: The emergence of highly pathogenic influenza A virus strains in a variety of human and animal hosts with wide geographic distribution has highlighted the importance of rapid virus identification and subtyping for outbreak management and treatment. Type A viruses can be divided into subtypes according to the viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Here we review the existing specificity and amplification of published primers for subtypes of neuraminidase genes and describe a new broad spectrum primer pair that can recognize all 9 neuraminidase subtypes. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two M13-tagged degenerate primers, NA8F-M13 and NA10R-M13, were designed from these regions and used to generate a 253 bp cDNA product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) cases using a touchdown protocol with RNA from over 32 different cultured influenza A virus strains representing the 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Frozen blinded clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates were also tested and were mostly of the N2 subtype. The amplified region was directly sequenced and then used in database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. The generated RT-PCR fragment contains one of the mutation sites associated with oseltamivir resistance, H274Y. CONCLUSION: Our one-step RT-PCR assay followed by sequencing is a rapid, accurate, and specific method for the detection and subtyping of different neuraminidase subtypes from a range of host species and from different geographic locations.",,"Alvarez, A.

55,High-throughput double-stranded RNA sequencing reveals a novel cytorhabdovirus in a transgenic common bean line resistant to bean golden mosaic virus,"Using high-throughput double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sequencing, we identified five RNA viruses in a golden mosaic bean virus (BGMV)-resistant transgenic line of common bean with symptoms of viral infection. Four of the identified viruses have previously been described as infecting common beans (Cowpea Mild Mottle Virus, Bean Rugose Mosaic Virus, Phaseolus vulgaris Alphaendornavirus 1 and Phaseolus vulgaris Alphaendornavirus 2) and one is a putative novel plant rhabdovirus (genus Cytorhabdovirus) tentatively named beans -associated cytorhabdovirus (BaCV). The BaCV genome presented all five open reading frames (ORFs) found in most rhabdoviruses: nucleoprotein (N) (ORF1) (451 amino acids, aa), phosphoprotein (P) (ORF2) (445 aa), matrix ( M) (ORF4) (287 aa), glycoprotein (G) (ORF5) (520 aa), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (ORF6) (114 aa), as well as a putative locomotor protein (P3) (ORF3) ( 189 aa) and the hypothetical small protein P4. The predicted BaCV proteins were compared to homologous proteins of the nearest cytorhabdoviruses and a low level of sequence identity (15-39%) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis shows that BaCV is clustered with yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus (YmCaV) and rice streak mosaic virus (RSMV). Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that BaCV is indeed a new virus species in the genus Cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), the first rhabdovirus identified to infect kidney bean.",,"Alves-Freitas, D.

57,Bovine-like coronaviruses in domestic and wild ruminants,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide range of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are known for their ability to alter tissue tropism, cross species barriers, and adapt to ecological variations. The inherent genetic diversity of CoVs, caused by the accumulation of point mutations and the high frequency of homologous recombination, is predicted to be the main determinant of these competencies. Several CoVs (eg, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - CoV) have been found to cross the interspecies barrier and cause various disease states in different animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a major cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in bovine calves, dysentery in lactating cows, and transport fever pneumonia in beef cattle. Although it has long been recognized as a restrictive bovine pathogen, CoVs closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans, and other ruminant species. Biological, antigenic and genetic analyzes of the so-called ""bovine-like CoVs"" suggested classifying these viruses as variants of the host spectrum and not as independent virus species. In this review, the various bovine-like CoVs identified in domestic ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary, llama, and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelope, giraffe, and wild goat) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission, and virus properties. The data presented demonstrate the importance of these viruses for the persistence of BCoV in nature, its spread into new geographic zones and the continued emergence of disease epidemics in cattle ranches.",,"Amer, H.

58,A metagenomic analysis shows the diversity of faecal vioma in asymptomatic pigs in East Africa,"Pigs harbor a variety of viruses that are closely related to human viruses and are suspected of having zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of viruses on smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to metagenomic analysis of viruses in feces of asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo assembled contigs were constructed and compared to sequences from the GenBank database. The Blastx search results showed that 1039 contigs (>200 nt) were related to viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to viral taxa because they shared little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, while 427 contigs shared a high degree of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most common contigs refer to mammalian viruses resembling members of the Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, and Kobuvirus genera. Other less common contigs were related to members of the Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus, and Picobirnavirus genera. This is the first report on the diversity of faecal vioma in pig populations in East Africa. The results of the present study help to elucidate the etiology of porcine diarrheal diseases and to identify potential zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region. Further research is needed to compare the occurrence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs to better elucidate their pathogenic role.",,"Amimo, J. O.;El Zowalaty, M.

59,Association of an increased conviction rate of broiler carcasses due to liver abnormalities with immunosuppressive disorders in the Saskatchewan broiler industry,"The aim of this study was to identify the causative agents of hepatitis observed in broilers at processing. Livers from chickens from 16 Saskatchewan broiler farms with gross hepatitis lesions were collected at processing. In addition to routine bacterial isolation and histopathological examination, serological examinations for infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV), calculation of the ratio of bursal weight of Fabricius (BF) to body weight (BBW), and histopathological examination of the BF were carried out. Of the 264 livers with gross lesions, 83% had multifocal to coalescent necrotizing hepatitis, 16% had perihepatitis, and 1% had bleeding. No definitive causative microorganisms were isolated from the liver lesions; however, no significant bacterial isolations were performed. Bursal atrophy, low BBW ratio, and high antibody titer to IBDV each correlated with the rate of overall convictions (P=0.0188, P=0.0001, and P=0.0073, respectively). Nucleotide sequencing of IBDV isolated from the BF identified variant strains Delaware-E and 586. Liver lesion conviction was correlated with antibody titer to IBDV and BBW (P=0.016 and P=0.027, respectively). The results of this study indicate that hepatic lesions in Saskatchewan chickens are currently not caused by a primary bacterial pathogen but are associated with evidence of immunosuppression that is likely due to an IBDV variant.",,"Amini, K.;Zachar, T.;Popowich, S.;Knezacek, T.;Goodhope, B.;Willson, P.;Gomis, S.",2015.0,,,0

62,"Genetic characterization of 2008 reassortant influenza A virus (H5N1), Thailand","In January and November 2008, outbreaks of bird flu were reported in 4 provinces of Thailand. Eight influenza A H5N1 viruses were recovered from these 2008 AI outbreaks and extensively characterized and analyzed for nucleotide identity, genetic relatedness, virulence determinants, and possible reassortment sites. The results show that the 2008 H5N1 viruses exhibited genetic drift characteristics (less than 3% genetic differences) commonly found in influenza A viruses. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, clade 1 viruses in Thailand have been divided into 3 distinct branches (subclades 1, 1.1 and 1.2). Six out of eight H5N1 isolates were identified as reassorted H5N1 viruses, while other isolates belong to an original H5N1 clade. These viruses have been reassorted between subclades 1.1 and 1.2 between lineages and thus represent new reassorted 2008 H5N1 viruses. The reassorted viruses acquired H5N1 subclass 1.1 (PA, HA, NP and M) and subclass 1.2 (PB2, PB1, NA and NS) gene segments in Thailand. Bootsscan analysis of concatenated full genome sequences of the 2008 H5N1 viruses supported the reassortment sites between subclass 1.1 and 1.2 viruses. Based on the estimate of the time of the most recent common ancestor of the 2008 H5N1 viruses, the potential date of a genetic rearrangement of the viruses could be traced back to 2006. Genetic analysis of the 2008 H5N1 viruses showed that most virulence determinants in all 8 genes of the viruses remained unchanged. In summary, two predominant H5N1 lineages were circulating in 2008. The original CUK2-like lineage circulated mainly in central Thailand and the re-sorted lineage (subclades 1.1 and 1.2) circulated mainly in lower northern Thailand. To prevent re-sorting, priority should be given to preventing the spread of H5N1 viruses in high-risk areas. In addition, surveillance and whole genome sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be routinely performed to monitor genetic drift of the virus and new reassorted strains, particularly given possible reassortment between avian and mammalian H5N1 viruses.",,"Amonsin, A.;Lapkuntod, J.;Suwannakarn, K.;Kitikoon, P.;Suradhat, S.;Tantilertcharoen, R.;Boonyapisitsopa, S.;Bunpapong, N.;Wongphatcharachai, M.;Wisedchanwet, T.;Theamboonlers, A.;Poovorawan, Y.;Sasipreeyajan, J.;Thanawongnuwech, R.",2010.0,2016-09-01 00:00:00,,0
63,"Perennial evolutionary dynamics of West Nile virus in suburban Chicago, USA, 2005-2007","West Nile virus has evolved in line with its spread across North America, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the virus at the local level. We analyzed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from a known transmission ""hot spot"" in suburban Chicago, USA. Within this approximately 11 × 14 km area, the viral envelope gene has increased in genetic diversity at the nucleotide level by approximately 0.1% per year. Each year, viral diversity was higher in densely built-up ""residential areas"" than in more open ""urban green spaces"" such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyzes showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Analyzes of times to the most recent common ancestor suggest that WNV may have arisen predominantly in 2005 and 2006 from viruses present in 2004 and 2005, respectively, but that WNV had an older common ancestor in 2007, possibly indicating a predominantly mixed or exogenous origin.

66,Analysis of the entire genome of the epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus identified constrained genome constellations and preferential rearrangement,"Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (EHDV) is a Culicoides-borne orbivirus that causes hemorrhagic disease in wild and domestic ruminants. A collection of 44 EHDV isolated between 2008 and 2012 was fully sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype in all years except 2012 when serotype 6 viruses accounted for 63% of isolates. A high genetic similarity (>94% identity) between the VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2 and NS3 segments of virus serotypes 1 and 2 prevented the identification of reassortment events for these segments . In addition, there was low genetic diversity (>96% identity) within the serotypes for VP2, VP5 and VP7. Preferential reassortment within the homologous serotype was observed for VP2, VP5 and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic type 6, with the remaining segments most similar to type 2 viruses. These results suggest that reassortment between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires the preservation of the VP2, VP5 and VP7 segment constellation, while type 6 viruses require only VP2 and VP5 and onto the type 2 -Line VP7 are restricted. Since type 6 VP2 and VP5 segments were identified exclusively in type 2-derived VP7 viruses, these results indicate functional complementation between the type 2 and type 6 VP7 proteins. © 2014 SGM.",,"Anbalagan, S.;Cooper, E.;Klumper, P.;Simonson, R.

67,Dietary energy drives the dynamic response of the bovine rumen viral communities,"BACKGROUND: Rumen microbes play a larger role in host energy uptake than gut microbes in monogastric animals. Although genome-based advances provide access to the vast diversity of uncultured microbes, our understanding of the variables that shape rumen microbial communities is still in its infancy. Viruses have been shown to affect microbial populations through a variety of processes, including cell lysis and reprogramming of host metabolism. However, little is known about the processes that influence the distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses can modulate microbially driven processes in the rumen. To this end, we investigated how the structure and function of the rumen bacterial and viral community responded in five steers fed four randomized diet regimens in a crossover design. RESULTS: Total digestible nutrients (TDN), a measure of dietary energy, best explained the variation in bacterial and viral communities. Other ecological drivers of viral communities were dietary zinc levels and microbial functional diversity. Using partial least squares regression, we show significant associations between the abundance of 267 virus populations and variables driving variation in rumen viral communities. Although rumen viruses were dynamic, 14 near-ubiquitous virus populations were identified, suggesting the presence of a central rumen virus composed largely of novel viruses. In addition, analysis of virally encoded metabolic auxiliary genes (AMGs) indicates that rumen viruses possess glycosidic hydrolases that may enhance the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to increase energy production. Other identified AMGs play a role in redirecting carbon to the pentose phosphate pathway and one pools carbon through folate to increase viral replication. CONCLUSIONS: We show that rumen bacteria and viruses have distinct responses and environmental drivers to nutritional disorders. Our results indicate that rumen viruses have implications for understanding the structure of the previously identified nuclear rumen microbiota and affect microbial metabolism through a variety of AMGs. Rumen AMGs appear to have implications for microbial metabolism that are broadly consistent with the current paradigm in marine systems.

68,Characterization of co-circulating swine influenza A viruses in North America and identification of a novel H1 genetic clade with antigenic importance,"Several genetically and antigenically distinct hemagglutinin genes of the H1 and H3 influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes co-circulate in North American swine. This diversity has evolved through repeated transmission of IAVs from humans to pigs and subsequent antigenic drift in pigs. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of these different HA lineages in North American swine, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 1576 H1 and 607 H3 HA gene segments, as well as 834 N1 and 1293 N2 NA gene segments, and 2126 M gene segments. These data showed annual co-circulation of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses, with three HA clades representing the majority of HA sequences: of H1 viruses, 42% became H1Δ1 and 40.6% became H1Δ and H1Δ classified the H3 viruses 53% were classified as Cluster IV-A H3N2. We have discovered a genetically distinct subgroup consisting of 37 H1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013 which we have classified as H1γ-2. We estimated that this clade had been circulating in pigs since about 1995, but was only detected in pigs in 2003. This group of viruses is antigenically distinct and when measured by antigenic mapping was up to 7 antigenic units from other H1γ viruses. Therefore, vaccines against modern H1γ viruses are unlikely to provide cross-protection against γ-2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these γ-2 viruses suggests that smaller populations of viruses may be under-reported given the long branch lengths and detection gaps in the national dataset. The identification of these γ-2 viruses demonstrates the need for robust surveillance to capture the full diversity IAVs in swine in the US and the importance of antigenic drift in the diversification and emergence of new antigenic variants in swine, complicating vaccine design .",,"Anderson, T.

69,A phylogeny-based global nomenclature system and automated annotation tool for swine influenza A virus H1-hemagglutinin genes,"The H1 subtype of influenza A viruses (IAVs) have been circulating in pigs since the 1918 human influenza pandemic. Over time, and aided by further introductions from non-pig hosts, porcine H1 viruses have diversified into three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 lineages were named based on colloquial context, leading to the proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose rigorous phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of porcine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) evolution. These criteria, applied to a dataset of 7,070 H1-HA sequences, resulted in 28 distinct clades as the basis for the nomenclature. We have developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can assign these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined dataset of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct clade more than 99% of the time. Our analyzes showed that 87% of porcine H1viruses from 2010 to date had HAs belonging to 7 contemporary cocirculating clades. Our nomenclature and web-accessible classification tool provide researchers, diagnosticians, and public health officials with an accurate method to assign clade designations to HA sequences. The tool can be easily updated to follow evolving nomenclature as new clades emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparisons within and between regions of IAVs infecting humans and swine, and can provide insight into the diversity of swine H1 influenza virus and its impact on the selection of vaccine strains, diagnostic reagents and test performance, and thereby the Communication simplify data. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A fundamental goal in the life sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of these groups. For swine influenza A viruses (IAVs), understanding the genetic lineage of the hemagglutinin (HA) of a circulating strain aids in the selection of vaccine antigen and allows inferences to be made about vaccine efficacy. Previous reports of H1 virus HA in swine have relied on colloquial names, often with burdensome and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies difficult. To overcome this, we developed an adaptive nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of global H1 porcine IAVs. We have also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will support agricultural production and pandemic preparedness by identifying key changes in porcine IAVs and providing terminology that enables discussion of porcine IAVs in a shared context between animal and human health initiatives.",,"Anderson, T.

Amino acid sequences from four regions of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) were used to analyze 101 NLV strains, including 2 bovine strains. Based on this analysis, a genetic classification scheme is proposed that distinguishes 99 human strains into 2 main genetic groups consisting of 5 and 10 genetic clusters, respectively. The 2 bovine strains form a newly defined third major genetic group consisting of 2 putative clusters represented by each strain. This classification scheme is well supported by the analysis of the entire ORF2 sequences from 38 strains chosen to represent the genetic diversity of the human strains used above. This scheme should provide a solid scientific basis for the unified classification of NLV strains detected worldwide.",,"Ando, T.;Noel, J. S.;Fankhauser, R. L.",2000.0,,10.1086/315589,0

72,Molecular Epidemiology and Phylogeny of Nipah Virus Infection: A Mini Review,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae, characterized by high pathogenicity and is endemic to South Asia. It is classified as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) medium. The mortality rate varies between 40% and 70% depending on the severity of the disease and the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. No antiviral drugs are currently available for NiV disease and treatment is supportive only. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyzes can help to understand the epidemiology and temporal origin of this virus. This review gives an overview of evolutionary studies performed on Nipah viruses circulating in different countries.

Phylogenetic analysis of 98 genome sequences revealed that they belonged to Cluster A and circulated in Vietnam for two years before appearing. CV-A6 movements between locations within Vietnam were common, while viral movements across international borders seemed rare. Skyline plots identified fluctuations in the relative genetic diversity of CV-A6 that correspond to major CV-A6-associated HFMD outbreaks worldwide. These data demonstrate that CV-A6 is an emerging pathogen and emphasize the need for active surveillance and understanding of the mechanisms shaping pathogen evolution and emergence, which is essential for the development and implementation of intervention strategies.",,"Anh, N.

74,Origin of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus studied by codon usage patterns and phylogenetic analysis,"The 1918 pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus, which is a negative-strand RNA virus; however, little is known about the nature of its direct ancestral tribes. Here we performed a broad genetic and phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of influenza virus genes, particularly the PB1 gene, to obtain information on the phylogenetic relationship of the 1918 H1N1 virus. We compared the RNA genome of the 1918 strain to many other influenza strains of different origins in a variety of ways, including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), and phylogenetic relatedness. We found that the 1918 pandemic virus PB1 gene had similar ENC values to classical H1N1 swine and human viruses, but different ENC values from avian and H2N2 and H3N2 human viruses. Also, according to the RSCU of the PB1 gene, the 1918 virus is grouped with all human isolates and “classic” H1N1 swine viruses a H1N1 swine virus that itself could have descended from an H1N1 avian progenitor that long ago completely separated from the mass of other avian viruses The high stability of the RSCU pattern of the PB1 gene indicated that the integrity of the RNA structure is more important for the evolution of the influenza virus than previously thought.Copyright © 2011 RNA Society.",,"Anhlan, D.;Grundmann, N.;Makalowski, W.

75,Characterization of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus from Egyptian domestic waterfowl in 2017,"In 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) H5N8 was detected in wild birds in Egypt for the first time. In the present study, we identified HPAI virus H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 from resident waterfowl in Egypt, suggesting that it is transmitted from migratory birds to domestic fowl. Based on the partial hemagglutinin gene sequence, this virus has a close genetic relationship to the H5N8 subtype viruses circulating in Asia and Europe. Pathologically, H5N8 virus induced nervous symptoms accompanied by encephalomalacia, hemorrhage, nonsuppurative encephalitis and nonsuppurative vasculitis in hybrid ducks. The granular layer of the cerebellum showed multifocal areas of hydropic degeneration and the neurons of Purkinje cells were necrotized or lost. In addition, lungs, kidneys and spleen were congested and necrotizing pancreatitis was also observed. The co-circulation of HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 subtypes with the weakly pathogenic H9N2 avian influenza subtype complicates the control of avian influenza in Egypt with the possibility of the emergence of new reassortant viruses. Therefore, continuous monitoring with the implementation of strict control measures is required. Research highlights: HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 was detected in domestic ducks and geese in Egypt in 2017. Phylogenetically, the virus was closely related to HPAI H5N8 viruses identified in Asia and Europe. Nonsuppurative encephalitis has been observed commonly in ducks infected with HPAI H5N8 virus. Degeneration of the cerebellar nuclear layer was found in most brain tissues examined.",,"Anis, A.;AboElkhair, M.;Ibrahim, M.",2018.0,,10.1080/03079457.2018.1470606,0
76,Two novel bocaparvovirus species identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"Bocaparvovirus (BOV) is a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses and a possible cause of respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in humans and animals. Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the liver and faeces of wild Himalayan marmots in China by viral metagenomic analysis. Five out of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five out of 99 fecal samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their almost complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, show a standard genomic organization and contain protein-coding motifs typical of BOVs. Based on their NS1, NP1 and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0% and 79.0, respectively %/54.0% amino acid identity). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOVs. According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different new species in the Bocaparvovirus genus. Their identification advances our knowledge of the genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs.

77,Various new astroviruses identified in wild Himalayan marmots,"With advances in virus surveillance and next-generation sequencing, vastly different novel astroviruses (AstVs) and different animal hosts have been discovered in recent years. However, the existence of AstVs in marmots has yet to be shown. Here we identified two strongly distinct AstV strains (tentatively named Qinghai Himalayanmarmot AstVs, HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2) by viral metagenomic analysis in liver tissues isolated from wild Himalayan Marmota in China. Overall, 12 of 99 (12.1%) M. himalayana fecal samples were positive for the presence of genetically distinct AstVs, while only HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were identified in 300 liver samples. The complete genomic sequences of HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were 6681 and 6610 nt in length, respectively, with the typical AstV genomic organization. Analysis of the complete ORF 2 sequence showed that these new AstVs are most closely related to the rabbit AstV, mamastrovirus 23 (sharing 31.0 and 48.0% amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 revealed that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 form two distinct clusters among mamastroviruses and possibly share a common ancestor with rabbit-specific mamastrovirus 23. These results suggest that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 are two new virus species of the genus Mamastrovirus in the Astroviridae. The remarkable diversity of these novel AstVs will contribute to a better understanding of AstV evolution and ecology, although additional studies are needed to understand the clinical significance of these novel AstVs in marmots as well as in humans.",,"Ao, Y.

80,Phylodynamics of the avian influenza clade 2.2.1 H5N1 viruses in Egypt,"Background: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype is widespread in poultry populations in Egypt and has caused several human infections. Linking the epidemiological and sequence data is important to understand the transmission, persistence and evolution of the virus. This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on the molecular characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from isolates collected from February 2006 to May 2014. Methods: Full-length HA sequences from 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and genetically analyzed to examine their genetic evolution. They were collected from different poultry species, production sectors and geographic locations in Egypt. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BCMMC) method was applied to estimate evolution rates between different virus clusters; In addition, an analysis of the selection pressure in the HA gene was performed using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method. Results: The phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 revealed the presence of a virus introduction of the classic clade (2.2.1), from which two main subgroups emerged, the variant subgroup, which was further subdivided into 2 subdivisions (2.2.1.1 and 2.2 .1.1a) and the endemic subgroup (2.2.1.2). The 2.2.1.2 clade showed a high rate of evolution over a 6-year period (6.9 × 10-3 sub/site/year) compared to the 2.2.1.1a variant cluster (7.2 × 10-3 over a period of 4 years). These two clusters are under positive selection since they have 5 different positively selected sites in the HA gene. The mutations at antigenic HA sites 120, 154, and 162, as well as the other two mutations (129γ, I151T) that occurred from 2009 to 2014 were found to be stable in the 2.2.1.2 clade. In addition, 13 groups of H5N1-HPAI viruses were identified based on their amino acid sequences at the cleavage site, and “EKRRKKR” became the predominant pattern as of 2013 in production systems in almost all regions of the country. The prevalence of the 2.2.1.2 clade with triple mutations (120, 129γ”, I151T) associated with increased binding affinity to human receptors is an alarming finding of public health importance.",,"Arafa, A.;El-Masry, I.;Kholosy, S.;Hassan, M.

81,Whole genome characterization of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 from a commercial quail flock in Egypt,"The suspected occurrence of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 in poultry in Egypt is of great concern as this subtype is widespread in various Middle Eastern countries, here we describe the full genetic characterization of an avian influenza virus A (Qa/Egypt/11 ; H9N2) des Subtype H9N2 previously isolated in May 2011 from a clinically normal quail flock in Giza, Egypt. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the isolated Egyptian virus showed the highest similarity to a group of recent Israeli strains (97%) circulating in 2006-2010. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Qa/Egypt/11 isolate belonged to the A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997-like lineage, identifying novel mutations in all viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the eight genes suggested placement of the Egyptian virus within the same lineage of H9N2 viruses that have been circulating in the region since 2006, particularly with a group of newer Israeli strains. However, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes such as PB2, NP, and PA genes identified possible rearrangement events for these genes with individual Israeli strains.

84,Migratory birds in southern Brazil are a source of several subtypes of avian influenza virus,"BACKGROUND: There is insufficient knowledge of the relationship of the avian influenza virus (AIV) to migratory birds in South America. Accordingly, we examined samples collected over a 4-year period (2009-2012) from wild birds at a large wintering site in southern Brazil. METHODS: We obtained 1212 oropharyngeal/cloaca samples from wild birds in Lagoa do Peixe National Park and analyzed them for influenza A virus by RT-PCR amplification of the matrix gene. Virus isolates were subjected to genomic sequencing and antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Forty-eight samples from 1212 (3.96%) contained detectable influenza virus RNA. Partial virus sequences were obtained from 12 of these samples, showing the presence of viruses H2N2 (1), H6Nx (1), H6N1 (8), H9N2 (1) and H12N5 (1). Since H6 viruses predominated, we generated complete genomes from all 9 H6 viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that they most closely resembled viruses of South American origin. The H6N1 viruses caused no signs of disease in infected ferrets and, despite genetic differences, were antigenically similar to North American isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Lagoa do Peixe National Park is a source of several AIV subtypes, with influenza virus concentrations highest in birds at the end of their wintering season in this region. H6N1 viruses were the predominant subtype identified. These viruses were more similar to viruses of South American lineage than to those of North American lineage.",,"Araujo, J.;Petry, M.

As observed in previous seasons, the pandemic A/H1N1 09 virus was detected in severe cases during the 2011-2012 winter season and eventually became the most prevalent influenza virus during the 2013-2014 winter season. Molecular and phylogenetic analyzes of the whole viral genome are necessary to determine the antigenic and pathogenic properties of influenza viruses that cause serious consequences of the disease. In this article we analyzed the evolution, antigenic and genetic drift of Mexican isolates from 2009, at the onset of the pandemic, to 2014. We found a clear variation of the virus in Mexico from the 2011-2014 season due to different markers and in agreement with previous reports. In this study we identified 13 new substitutions with important biological effects including virulence, T cell epitope presented by MHC and host specificity shift and some other substitutions might have more than one biological function.

Whether the 2012 invading strains were able to circulate and overwinter in states with their own endemic WNV population is unknown, and the effect of viral genetics on adaptation and persistence in a new ecological niche is unclear. In this study, we sequenced 70 mosquito isolates from multiple counties across Texas between 2012 and 2015. We identified isolates representative of previously described 2012 WNV groups (groups 8–10) and discovered a new group which we named group 11) were related to the invading 2012 strains and of these was group 10 ( 45/68) predominant. We also observed differences between the 2012 WNV groups that correlate with their genotype. Group 10 WNV in Texas, carrying two putative positive selected variants, had limited introductions in Texas, widespread distribution, and strong evidence of continued persistence possibly indicative of overwintering. In contrast, groups 8 and 11 with no positively selected variants had multiple introductions in Texas, limited distribution, and limited persistence. Finally, we identified a potential transmission source for incoming Group 8 WNV to Texas in New York.

91,Identification of a porcine pestivirus of different lineages in lactating piglets with congenital tremor and reproduction of the disease after experimental inoculation,"Congenital tremor is a sporadic disease in newborn pigs characterized by action-related repetitive myoclonus. Much of the outbreaks of congenital tremors have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were 1) to detect potential pathogens in samples from piglets with congenital tremors and 2) to develop an infection model to reproduce the disease. A pestivirus of different strains was detected in piglets with congenital tremors using next-generation sequencing. The virus was originally most closely related to a bat pestivirus but is now more closely related to a recently published novel porcine pestivirus tentatively named atypical porcine pestivirus. Real-time quantitative PCR detected the virus in samples from newborn piglets with congenital tremors from two separate farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To achieve the second objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with either serum containing the pestivirus or PBS (control) by the intravenous and intranasal routes simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic sacs by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. The vaccinations were carried out either on the 45th or on the 62nd day of pregnancy. All sows vaccinated with the novel pestivirus presented piglets with congenital tremors, while control piglets vaccinated with PBS were unaffected. The severity of shivering was assessed for each piglet using videos recorded at 0, 1 and 2 days after farrowing. Tremor severity remained relatively constant in most piglets 0 to 2 days after farrowing. The prevalence of congenital tremors in pestivirus-inoculated litters ranged from 57% (4 out of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 out of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors but not in control piglets. PCR-positive samples in more than 90% of the piglets included brainstem (37 out of 41), mesenteric lymph nodes (37 out of 41), tracheobronchial lymph nodes (37 out of 41), and whole blood (19 out of 20). Although congenital tremor was first described in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremor following experimental inoculation with a swine pestivirus of different strains. Studies examining disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors due to this pestivirus.",,"Arruda, B.

92,Genetic ancestor of external antigens of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The aim of the present study was to uncover the genetic relationships of the external antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of the 2009 pandemic novel influenza virus A/H1N1 (NIV) with other influenza viruses through phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analyses. Pedigrees of these two antigens show that the sequences of the NIV viruses are relatively homogeneous and that they originate from several viruses circulating in pigs. The phylogenetic tree of HA shows that NIV had the closest relationship to North American swine lines, while NA had to European swine lines. In both segments, NIVs had the closest genetic relationship to swine influenza virus lines. It strongly suggests that pigs are the most likely animal reservoir. Comparative analysis shows that NIVs among clade A showed very low genetic divergence as well as high similarity and also underwent strong purification selection, while the neighboring clade B shows moderate values compared to those of clades CF. This indicates that the classical swine influenza viruses present in clade B may be an ancestor of NIV external antigens. The process of reassortment took place in classical swine influenza viruses. The mutation sites fixed exclusively in pig and human NIV together with the vaccine strain provide an important clue for disease diagnosis and vaccine research.",,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,,10.1007/s12539-012-0136-7,0
93,Phylogenetic analysis of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus,"The principle of the present study was to determine the evolution of the 2009 pandemic novel influenza virus A/H1N1 (NIV) through phylogenetic, comparative and statistical analyses. The phylogenetic trees of eight genomic segments illustrate that the sequences of the NIVs (outbreak group A) are so far relatively homogeneous and were derived from Eurasian and North American porcine, avian and human viruses (group B) through the event of multiple genetic rearrangement. . This implied that some of the influenza viruses in group B had a higher evolutionary potential and acquired the ability for human-to-human transmission after animal-to-human cross-species transmission. The second analysis shows that NIV had attempted a small evolutionary change among humans and had a long evolutionary history before being introduced to humans. Statistical analysis shows that viruses of both the outbreak and the next group have homologous genes in their genomes that may reflect the phylogenetic relatedness of the strains, and also the presence of unique mutations between groups AB may be associated with increased virulence of NIVs. Both phylogenetic and cluster analyzes confirm that gene exchange occurs between viruses originating from different species and that NIV could be generated with unpredictable pandemic potential. Therefore, we conclude that an extensive study should be performed to identify which rearrangement groups are closely related to NIVs and to determine the sites in the genes of NIV under the greatest or least selection pressure, which ultimately matters for effective design will be vaccine and drugs against the ""swine flu"".",,"Arunachalam, R.;Paulkumar, K.;Annadurai, G.",2012.0,Feb,,0
94,Subgrouping of group A rotavirus recovered from piglets in Nigeria,"Subgroup analysis using a subgroup specific monoclonal ELISA showed a predominance of subgroup 2 specific antigens of group A swine rotavirus over subgroup 1. Of 113 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis positive test specimens obtained from 4 states of Nigeria, 31 (27.4%) and 45 (39.8%) had specificities for subgroup 1 and 2, respectively. However, 37 (32.7%) test specimens could not be assigned to any of the known group A rotavirus subgroups. These ""unclassifiable"" samples likely had neither subgroup 1 nor 2 specificities in the ELISA or could belong to a third subgroup that was unknown or not examined in this study. In all age groups examined, specific antigens of subgroups 1 and 2 were predominant. This was also observed after the annual analysis of subgroup specificity; However, in 1990 and 1991 a higher prevalence of subgroup 2 specificity was observed. Subgroup 1 rotavirus was found in all 4 states studied (Plateau, Benue, Oyo, and Cross River), while subgroup 2 rotavirus was only found in Plateau state. All rotaviruses recovered in this study, regardless of subgroup, exhibited long genomic electrophoretic migration patterns. Thus, the genomic diversity of group A rotaviruses does not necessarily reflect antigenic diversity since there is no compelling correlation between genomic electropherotype pattern and subgroup specificity.",,"Atii, D.

97,Effects of orally administered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on welfare and Salmonella colonization of young chicks,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a bacterium that preys on and kills gram-negative bacteria, including the zoonotic pathogens Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, but no reports have been published of it being tested on live animals, and there is no data on whether Bdellovibrio could spread between animals. In this study, we attempted to fill this knowledge gap by using B. bacteriovorus HD100 doses in poultry with normal gut microbiota or pre-dosed with a colonizing Salmonella strain. In both cases, bdellovibrio was administered orally along with antacids. After administering Bdellovibrio to non-Salmonella infected birds, we measured the health and welfare of the birds and any changes in their gut pathology and cultivable microbiota and found that although one dose of Bdellovibrio at 2 days of age altered the overall diversity of the birds natural gut microbiota in 28-day-old birds, there were no adverse effects on their growth and well-being. Drinking water and faeces from the pens in which the birds were housed as groups showed no contamination by bdellovibrio after administration. Orally administered predatory bdellovibrio to birds predosed with a gut-colonizing Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis phage type 4 strain (an important zoonotic pathogen) reduced, in comparison, Salmonella counts in avian gut contents and abnormal morphology of the cecum, indicating reduced inflammation of the cecum points to the cecum of the untreated controls or a non-predatory Î”pilA strain, suggesting that these effects are due to predation.

Phylogenetic analysis of viral protein 1 sequences revealed the emergence of a new topotype within serotype O, East Africa 4. In 2007, serotype SAT 1 was discovered in Ethiopia, forming a new distinct topotype (IX) and serotype SAT 2 emerged after an apparent gap from 16 years up again.

99,"Differentiation of proteins and viruses using pyrolysis gas chromatography, differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS) and pattern recognition","It is extremely important to develop novel analytical sensors for the detection of pathogens. Applications of such sensors range from ensuring environmental monitoring to providing human health diagnostic measures to early warning systems for bioterrorism. Certain viruses and bacterial pathogens are of particular concern because they can spread rapidly through the human population during a pandemic, and emerging variants of these pathogens are difficult to detect. This paper provides a reliable detection strategy to classify viruses from harmless proteins. Our novel instrumentation is based on pyrolysis gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS) and couples a genetic algorithm-based machine learning method for pattern recognition with a microfabricated solid-state biosensor. Together, this hardware and software combination enabled extremely high classification accuracy (94%) between the T4 bacteriophage from bovine serum albumin (BSA), an unrelated protein. This study suggests that this wearable sensor together with the sophisticated data mining method can be used as a fast, reliable and accurate virus detection tool.",,"Ayer, S.;Zhao, W. X.;Davis, C.

100,"Assessment of oxidative stress via total antioxidant status, sialic acid, malondialdehyde and RT-PCR findings in bluetongue affected sheep","INTRODUCTION: Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious infectious disease of ruminants. The pathogen bluetongue virus (BTV) is classified in the Reoviridae family Orbivirus. OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine serum malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant load (TAS), total sialic acid (TSA), ceruloplasmin, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma Glutamyltransferase (GGT), cholesterol, creatinine, albumin and total protein levels in sheep with and without bluetongue disease (BT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 13 Sakiz crossbreed sheep aged 1-4 years and usually in late pregnancy as the BT group and a control group consisting of 10 healthy sheep. All sheep were clinically examined prior to drawing blood samples. Serum ALT, AST, cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin, GGT, total protein, creatinine, and TAS levels were measured using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations using a Biochemistry Auto Analyzer (Sinnowa D280, China). Serum lipid peroxidation was estimated by a previously described method in which MDA reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to form a colored complex with a maximum absorbance of 535 nm. The TSA value was measured at 549 nm according to the method described by Warren (1959): sialic acid was oxidized to formylpyruvic acid, which reacts with TBA to give a pink product. The ceruloplasmin concentration was measured according to Sunderman and Nomoto (1970): ceruloplasmin and p-phenylenediamine formed a colored oxidation product which was proportional to the serum ceruloplasmin concentration. Real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR were performed as described by Shaw et al (2007). RESULTS: The biochemical analysis of the serum showed that in the BT group TSA, MDA, triglycerides and ALT and AST were higher and that ceruloplasmin and TAS were lower than in the control group. Serum albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, total protein and GGT did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Serum triglyceride, ceruloplasmin, TSA, MDA, and TAS concentrations may prove beneficial in the diagnosis, prognosis, and biochemical analysis of BT.",,"Aytekin, I.;Aksit, H.;Sait, A.;Kaya, F.;Aksit, D.;Gokmen, M.;Baca, A.

101,"Shift in enterovirus species in children in Cameroon - identification of a new enterovirus, EV-A119","BACKGROUND: Infections caused by human enteroviruses (EVs) are often asymptomatic or mild, although they can cause more serious conditions such as meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis. Electric vehicles pose a threat to children worldwide and outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and hand, foot and mouth disease are frequently reported. AIM: To identify EV strains circulating two years apart among healthy children in a small community in Limbe, Cameroon. STUDY DESIGN: Species and EV types were obtained by partial 5'UTR-VP4 and VP1 sequencing of RNA from stool samples collected in October 2009 and September 2011 from 150 children in Cameroon. RESULTS: A total of 74 children (49%) were infected with 28 different types of electric vehicles. In 2009 there were 29 (54%) infected children and in 2011 45 (47%). There was a significant difference between the types of EV detected, with 15 (47%) children infected with EV-A in 2009 and 22 (71%) with EV-B in 2011 (p=0.0001). In 2009, a child was infected with a divergent EV most similar to EV-A90. Based on the full VP1 sequence, it was shown to be a new EV, designated EV-A119. CONCLUSION: The current study shows a high heterogeneity of circulating EV types in children in Limbe, Cameroon, and a previously undescribed shift in the predominant EV types.",,"Ayukekbong, J.;Kabayiza, J.

The current study can be seen as the first molecular characterization of the Asia1 serotype in Iraq. The present study reports detection of the FMDV Asia1 serotype in outbreaks in 2012 and 2014 in local farms in the Sulaimani districts. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 gene showed that FMDV Asia1 field isolates were among the genetic novel variant Sindh-08 (Group VII), including PAK/iso/11 and TUR/13 strains. The VP1 protein sequence of the circulating FMDV Asia1 genotype showed heterogeneity of nine amino acid substitutions within the GH loop with vaccine strain As1/Shamir/89 (JF739177) currently used in the immunization program in Iraq.

106,Identification of a novel hepacivirus in domestic cattle from Germany,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains one of the greatest threats to human health. In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses and dogs, suggesting a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. Using unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus Hepacivirus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly resulted in a nearly complete genome encoding a polyprotein of 2,779 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a new species within the Hepacivirus genus. Viral RNA screening showed that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 cattle herds examined in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyzes of animals from a dairy herd demonstrated that a significant percentage of the cows were infected, some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and autopsy showed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from various organs and tissues together with the presence of a miR-122 binding site in the viral genome strongly suggest liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for human HCV infection.",,"Baechlein, C.;Fischer, N.;Grundhoff, A.;Alawi, M.;Indenbirken, D.;Postel, A.;Baron, A.

108,Monitoring and characterization of low pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from wild migratory birds in Korea,"Migratory waterfowl are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses. However, transmission between species had occasionally resulted in outbreaks in various hosts, including humans. Phylogenetic analyzes were performed to characterize the genetic origins of H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory birds in South Korea. A total of 53 H5 viruses were isolated between October 2005 and November 2008. Full genetic characterization showed that most of these viruses belong to the Eurasian bird lineage. However, some segments of isolates AB/Korea/W235/07 and AB/Korea/W236/07 were clustered with viruses of North American lineage rather than those of Eurasian lineage, suggesting the occurrence of rearrangement between these two avian virus lineages. The phylogenetic analysis further showed that the H5N2 and H5N3 virus isolates were of the H5 phenotype with low pathogenicity. The H5 viruses appear to be antigenically similar to each other, but could be distinguished from a newer HPAI H5N1 virus (EM/Korea/W149/06) by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) tests. Experimental inoculation of representative viruses showed that certain isolates, notably AB/Korea/W163/07 (H5N2), could be detected in chicken trachea and lungs, but none could be transmitted by direct contact. Furthermore, all viruses could be detected in the mouse lung without prior adaptation, indicating their pathogenic potential in a mammalian host. Taken together, our results underscore the important role that migratory birds play in the replication, transport, and redistribution of avian influenza viruses and emphasize the need for continuous monitoring of influenza virus activity in these bird populations. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Baek, Y.

Recent studies have shown high diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here we investigate this further by virus isolation and describe two new rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and with other bat-derived rubulaviruses such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in Eidolon helvum in sub-Saharan Africa and on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Longitudinal samples of E. helvum indicate virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggest spread of AchPVs through horizontal transmission. We also discovered possible serological evidence for human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania.

In this study, sequence and phylogenetic analyzes of structural protein genes, namely nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), fusion (F), and hemagglutinin (H) coding sequences of virulent and vaccine strains of PPR virus (PPRV) were performed. , were performed to determine the genetic variations between field isolates and vaccine strains. The open reading frame (ORF) of these isolates/strains genes was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced. The ORF of the N, M, F and H genes were 1578, 1008, 1641 and 1830 nucleotides (nt) in length and encode polypeptides of 525, 335, 546 and 609 amino acids (aa), respectively, as previously reported.

The phylogenetic analyzes of these isolates based on the aa sequences showed that all viruses belonged to lineage IV along with other Asian isolates. This is consistent with previous observations that only PPRV lineage IV has been circulating in India since the disease was first reported. Furthermore, the sequence analysis of the thermostable/thermoadapted vaccine strains showed no significant changes in the functional or structural surface protein-coding gene sequences. It is important to monitor the circulation of the PPRV in susceptible animals through H-gene-based sequence comparisons in addition to the F-gene and N-gene-based approaches to identify the distribution and spread of the virus in the regular outbreaks that occur in endemic countries like India. ©2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"Balamurugan, V.;Sen, A.;Venkatesan, G.;Yadav, V.;Bhanot, V.;Riyesh, T.;Bhanuprakash, V.;Singh, R.

114,Infectious bronchitis virus in different physiological systems of birds - A field study in Brazilian poultry flocks,"Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease with economic implications for the poultry farming industry. The disease presents multisystem clinical symptoms (respiratory, renal, enteric and reproductive) and is caused by a coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV). The infectious bronchitis virus is divided into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field variants). This study aimed to assess the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 major producing regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of the major circulating genotypes for 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical specimens indicative of IBV infection were collected from 432 different commercial poultry flocks (198 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the 3 physiological systems mentioned above obtained from farms from 3 major producing regions: Midwest, Northeast and South. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by reverse transcription, real-time PCR of the 5 inch untranslated region. Results showed 179 IBV positive flocks (41.4% of flocks), 107 (24.8%) from broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. There were similar frequencies of IBV positive flocks in farms from different regions of the country, most commonly in broilers (mean 54%) compared to breeders (mean 30.8%). Reverse transcription was more frequently detected in the digestive system of breeders (40%) and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory systems (37.7%) of broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by reverse transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene from a panel of 79 IBV positive flocks (45 broilers and 34 breeders). The majority of herds were infected with the Brazilian variant genotype than the Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results demonstrate the dominance of the Brazilian variant (mainly in the intestinal tract) in commercial poultry flocks from 3 major producing regions in Brazil. © 2014 Poultry Science Association Inc.",,"Balestrin, E.;Fraga, A.

The complete genome sequence of the isolate (9625/2012) was determined using next-generation sequencing. The virus belongs to a new branch within subtype 1, clade D, and shows the closest resemblance to PRRSV Olot/1991 and the Amervac vaccine strain.

116,Complete genome sequence analysis of a wild type 2 Hungarian PRRSV variant unrelated to MLV isolated in Europe,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is a widespread pathogen of swine causing significant economic losses to the swine industry. The increasing diversity of PRRSV strains is making the disease increasingly difficult to diagnose, control and eradicate. In the present study, the authors report the full genome sequencing of a type 2 PRRSV strain isolated from piglet carcasses in Hungary. Next generation sequencing was used to determine the full genomic sequence of the isolate (PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012). Recombination analyzes performed with the available full-length genomic sequences showed no evidence of such an event with other known PRRSV. When compared to the highly virulent prototype strains VR2332 and JXA-1, clear deletions and one insertion were found in the nsp2 region of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012. The majority of the amino acid changes in GP4 and GP5 of the virus were in the known antigenic regions, suggesting an important role of immunological pressure in the development of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that it belongs to lineage 1 or 2 of type 2 PRRSV. Given the absence of related PRRSV in Europe, apart from a partial sequence from Slovakia, the ancestor of PRRSV-2/Hungary/102/2012 was most likely transported from North America. It is the first documented type 2 PRRSV isolated in Europe that is unrelated to Ingelvac MLV.",,"Balka, G.;Wang, X.;Olasz, F.;Balint, A.;Kiss, I.;Banyai, K.;Rusvai, M.;Stadejek, T.;Marthaler, D.;Murtaugh, M.

117,Two amino acid changes at the N-terminus of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus spike protein result in loss of enteric tropism,"To study the molecular basis of TGEV tropism, a collection of recombinants was created between the PUR46-MAD strain of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), which infects the intestinal and respiratory tract, and the PTV strain, which only infects the respiratory tract infected, generated. The frequency of recombinant isolation was approximately 10 -9 recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher at the 5' end of the S gene than in other regions of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and phenotypically and genetically characterized. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited the 5' and 3' halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were divided into three groups named 1 to 3 depending on the site of crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was examined. Group 1 recombinants had enteric and respiratory tropism, while group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory but not the enteric tract. Viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may in principle be responsible for the loss of enteric tropism, but only the change of nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change what leading to a substitution at amino acid 219 of the S protein was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR46 isolates. The available data indicate that two distinct domains of S protein are involved in infection of intestinal tract cells with TGEV, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. A second factor of undefined nature is depicted in the other domain, but may be the binding site for a co-receptor essential for enteric tropism of TGEV.",,"Ballesteros, M. L.;SÃ¡nchez, C.

118,Investigating outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Mbala and Kazungula districts of Zambia,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals. It is known to be endemic to Zambia, with periodic outbreaks occurring in different geographic areas of the country. This study was conducted to investigate the presence of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) in reported cases of suspected foot-and-mouth disease in cattle from Kazungula and Mbala districts of Zambia. Sixty epithelial tissue or oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) swabs (probang specimens) were collected from Mbala (n = 51) and Kazungula (n = 9) and examined for FMD. FMDV viral RNA and serotypes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and antigen-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Twenty-two samples (36.7%) were positive for the FMDV genome by qRT-PCR with cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 13 to 31. The FMDV-positive samples from epithelial tissue showed relatively higher Ct values compared to those that scrapings were obtained from OPs, regardless of geographic location. Forty percent (40%; n=4) of Mbala epithelial tissues were serotyped into the SAT 2 serotype by antigen ELISA. Kazungula samples were serotyped in SAT 1. These results indicated that there were outbreaks of FMD in Mbala and Kazungula districts in 2012 that were attributed to at least field strains SAT 2 and SAT 1 of FMD serotypes. Furthermore, the regular interaction between buffaloes from Mosi-o Tunya Park and domestic animals from the surrounding areas could contribute to the occurrence of regular FMD outbreaks in Kazungula, while the uncontrolled animal movements across the Mbala-Nsumbawanga borders could be responsible for disease outbreaks in Mbala . In-depth molecular biology studies, including viral sequencing and phylogeny, should be carried out to elucidate the complex epidemiology of FMD in Zambia and thereby provide valuable information needed for the rational control strategy for FMD in Zambia and neighboring countries.",,"Banda, F.;Kasanga, C.

119,Isolation and metagenomic identification of avian leukosis virus associated with mortality in broilers,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) belongs to the Retroviridae family and causes significant economic losses in the poultry industry. Kidney tissues from affected chickens were submitted for virus isolation and identification in embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells following an outbreak with high mortality in a broiler flock in northern Malaysia. Evidence of viral growth was indicated by haemorrhage and embryo mortality in the egg culture. While viral growth in cell culture has been evidenced by the development of cytopathic effects. The isolated virus was purified by a sucrose gradient and identified using transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. Further confirmation was achieved by next-generation sequencing and nucleotide sequence homology searches. Analysis of the viral sequences using the NCBI BLAST tool revealed 99-100% sequence homology with the exogenous ALV viral envelope protein. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial envelope sequences showed that the Malaysian isolate was clustered with Taiwanese and Japanese ALV strains that were closer to ALV subgroups J, ALV subgroups E, and recombinant A/E isolates. Based on these results, it was concluded that ALV is related to the present outbreak. It was recommended to conduct further studies on the molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity of the identified virus isolate.",,"Bande, F.;Arshad, S. S.;Omar, A. R.",2016.0,,,0
120,Unique genomic organization of a novel birdpox virus discovered in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo),"Avipoxviruses are emerging pathogens affecting over 200 species of birds worldwide. Genetic characterization of avipoxviruses is performed by analysis of genomic regions encoding 4b and DNA polymerase. Whole genome sequence data are limited to a few avipoxvirus isolates. Based on phylogenetic analysis, three main genetic groups are distinguished. In this study, we report a novel avipoxvirus strain causing skin lesions in domestic turkeys. The virus was identified in Hungary in 2011 in a flock of turkeys vaccinated against avipoxvirus infection. The genome of the isolated strain TKPV-HU1124/2011 was uniquely short (~188.5 kbp) and was predicted to encode a reduced number of proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding 4b and DNA polymerase separated TKPV-HU1124/2011 from other avipoxviruses from Turkey and classified it into a new genetic clade.

However, the profound evolutionary dynamics of PPRV during an epidemic are not well understood. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequences of 25 PPRV strains from China 2013-2014. All of these phyla grouped into a new clade in lineage 4. An evolution rate of 2.61 × 10″6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day was estimated, dating the most recent common ancestor of the PPRV China 2013–2014 phyla to early August 2013 . Analysis of the transmission network revealed that all virus sequences could be classified into five infection clusters, suggesting that long-distance animal transmission plays an important role in the spread of PPRV in China. These results advanced our knowledge of PPRV evolution to achieve effective control measures.",,"Bao, J.;Wang, Q.;Li, L.;Liu, C.;Zhang, Z.;Li, J.;Wang, S.;Wu, X.;Wang, Z.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.018,0

123,Isolation and complete genome sequence of two reticuloendothelosis virus strains from mixed Marek's disease virus infections in China,"Classified as a gamma retrovirus, reticuloendothelosis virus (REV) has a wide variety of hosts, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and wild birds. REV causes a number of pathological syndromes, most notably host immunosuppression, which can lead to increased susceptibility to other pathogens, severely harming the poultry industry. Mixed REV and Marek's disease virus (MDV) infections have been reported from many countries including China. Previous reports indicated that MDV vaccines were not effective and even less virulent MDV strains would cause some losses due to mixed infections with REV. In addition, impurities in the MDV vaccine could be the main source of REV. In this study, two clinical samples were collected from two flocks of chickens diagnosed with MDV. Two REV isolates were then obtained from the clinical specimens. The isolates, named CY1111 and SY1209, were further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Complete genome sequences of the two REV strains were determined to test the relatedness between them and other REV strains. Pedigrees showed that the two REV strains were closely related to most REV strains isolated from a variety of hosts. Therefore, under natural conditions, REVs can spread freely between these hosts. Also, most of the REV tribes in China belonged to the same group. The present work provides some information on REV in China.",,"Bao, K. Y.;Zhang, Y. P.;Zheng, H. W.;Lv, H. C.;Gao, Y. L.;Wang, J.

124,"Blood feeding, susceptibility to Schmallenberg virus infection and phylogenetics of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) from the UK","Background: Culicoides mosquitoes (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are responsible for the biological transmission of internationally important arboviruses in livestock. In 2011, a novel orthobunyavirus was discovered in northern Europe that causes congenital malformations and abortions in ruminants. In field studies, Culicoides have been associated with the transmission of this virus, later named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but no assessment of the susceptibility to infection of field populations under standardized laboratory conditions has been performed to date. We evaluated the influence of membrane type (chicken skin, collagen, Parafilm M®) when offered in conjunction with an artificial blood supply system (Hemotek, UK) on blood supply rates of Culicoides from field collections. Susceptibility to infection with SBV following blood feeding was then compared to an SBV blood suspension provided via either (i) the Hemotek system or via (ii) a saturated cotton swab. Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was defined by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions from head homogenates and compared with Culicoides species and haplotype identifications based on the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COX1) gene in connected. Results: Culicoides blood eating rates were low for all membrane types tested (7.5% chicken skin, 0.0% for collagen, 4.4% Parafilm M®, with a total of 6029 female Culicoides being offered a blood meal). Susceptibility to infection with SBV by membrane blood supply (8 of 109 individuals tested) and pledglet blood supply (1 of 94 individuals tested) has been demonstrated for the Obsoletus complex with both C. obsoletus (Meigen) and C. scoticus Downes &. Kettles susceptible to infection with SBV through oral feeding. Potential evidence of cryptic species in UK populations was found for the Obsoletus complex in phylogenetic analyzes of cox1 DNA barcodes from 74 individuals assessed at a single field site. Conclusions: The methods described in this study offer the possibility to blood-feed Palearctic Culicoides for vector competence studies and colonization experiments. Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the subgenus Avaritia and 1.1% for pledglet-fed. Both C. obsoletus and C. scoticus have been confirmed to be susceptible to infection by SBV, with possible evidence of cryptic species within specimens of the British Obsoletus complex, however the impact of cryptic diversity in the Obsoletus complex on arbovirus transmission remains unknown.",,"Barber, J.;Harrup, L.

125,Mechanisms of persistence in tick-borne diseases,"Through the use of new, highly sensitive diagnostic methods, it has been found that stubborn infections are a common feature of various tick-borne diseases such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis and heart water. Antigenic variation can contribute to disease persistence through the continuous elaboration of new surface structures, and we know in several cases how this is achieved. Known or suspected mechanisms of persistence in Babesia parasites include cytoadhesion and rapid variation of the adhesive ligand in Babesia bovis and genetic diversity in several proteins at the merozoite stage of different Babesia spp. In Anaplasma, extensive variation in the pfam01617 gene family accompanies the cycle of organism levels in chronic infection. A result of the groundbreaking research at Onderstepoort is the definition of a related polymorphic gene family likely to be involved in immunity to heart disease. We are beginning to understand the size of the antigenic repertoire and full definition is imminent, with the possibility of applying high-throughput simultaneous sequencing to the order of 1000 small genomes. We can also, for the first time, consider modifying these genomes and studying the impact on persistence and virulence. However, important biological questions remain unanswered; for example why we are seeing emerging Anaplasma infection in humans and why infection of endothelial cells by Anaplasma is important for persistence in vivo.",,"Barbet, A.

Diagnosis should be based on three main points: the presence of compatible clinical signs, histopathologic lesions, and evidence of nucleic acid and/or viral antigen within the lesions. The method of immunohistochemistry (IHC) enables the detection of viral antigens through the use of specific antibodies and probes. In this study, two sample groups were analyzed by IHC. Group I consists of 32 autopsied pigs with clinical signs indicative of PMWS from commercial farms in the state of Minas Gerais. Group II consists of 109 tissues obtained from the histopathology laboratory with lesions indicative of PMWS. The first and second sampling yielded 7.60% and 60.55% positivity for the presence of the PCV2 antigen, respectively. In both groups, the viral antigens were more frequently detected in lymph nodes and lungs, as evidenced by the intense immunoreactivity of histiocytes.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques are applied to detected PCV-2 antigen in the animal tissue lesions. However, asymptomatic or subclinically infected pigs with PCV-2 could spread the virus in the herd. A serological test on apparently healthy pigs could indicate a risk of virus penetration. In this work, antigens and antibodies against PCVS-2 were investigated in pigs from commercial farms in seven and eight mesor regions of the state of Minas Gerais (MG). Thirty-two pigs aged five to eleven weeks showing clinical signs of SMDS were autopsied. PCV-2 antigens were assayed by IHC from either sacrificed pigs (Group I) and diagnostic demand samples (Group II). 7.60% and more than 60% of the first and second groups, respectively, were positive for viral antigen. In both, intense labeling of macrophages and histiocytes, particularly in the lymph nodes and lungs, revealed antigens against CVS-2. In parallel, the Immunoperoxidase Monolayer Assay (IPMA) was applied to antibodies against PCV-2 screened in 955 pigs from 35 full cycle commercial farms from the same mesor regions. All pig herds (100%) presented positive animals (90% to 100% confidence level) and the frequency of responding pigs varied by 96.6% (94.7% to 98.6% confidence level). PCV-2 antibody titers ranged from 1:320 (medium) to 1:10,240 (high). The results indicate that 2.66% and 9% of pigs from the Triangulo Mineiro and Zona da Mata regions, respectively, would be able to develop clinical SMDS and that this percentage reaches 3.35% in total serum.",,"Barbosa, C.

Comments are made on viral structure, classification, pathogenesis, symptoms, and treatment. The host's immunological response to protection from wild virus disease is reviewed and shows how after initial infection, reinfection is progressively less severe as severe diarrheal disease is prevented. Briefly, it discusses the epidemiology and burden of disease that shows how rotavirus is the cause of more than 600,000 deaths annually in underdeveloped countries, increased hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and nosocomial infections, and the consequent increased morbidity and mortality for the it stands healthcare. It is striking that the only possible intervention is preventive, since the improvements achieved in health care hygiene conditions, water potability, access to oral rehydration, etc. do not result in a significant decrease in disease incidence in both developed and developing countries have led A's. The most widespread rotavirus serotypes and genotypes known in the world and in our country are described. The focus is on the current emergent serotypes. A comprehensive overview is given of the most important studies that have recently appeared in the scientific literature on the new second-generation vaccines against rotavirus that have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and also in the United States. Although the two vaccines approved in Spain derive from different active ingredients, they have a common goal, which is to prevent severe diarrhea due to rotavirus in children. Extensive safety studies involving more than 70,000 children were required in view of the events related to Rotashield® (first human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine used in the United States and currently being withdrawn from the market) and its association with intestinal intussusception. There is ample evidence that vaccination with either vaccine, Rotarix® and RotaTeq™, is not associated with an increased risk of intestinal intussusception. Studies on efficacy, immunogenicity, adverse events, etc. were also reviewed. They are statistically significant relative to the placebos and are well tested within the acceptable ranges. A list of recent ACID (Advisory Committee Immunization Practices) recommendations for RotaTeq™ is provided. It briefly comments on some of the pharmacoeconomic studies found in the literature, some of which are inexpensive, although more advanced studies will be required once the vaccines are working and public health vaccine pricing is established. Finally, the chances, challenges and perspectives of the current 2nd generation vaccines are discussed. Some of the future ones state the difficulties they must face. It concludes on the importance of persuading pediatricians to use these new vaccines, making parents aware of them, and providing both regulators and them with health education to incorporate them into the general routine practice of vaccination.

The first clinical cases of bluetongue (BT) were reported in sheep farms in southern Portugal, near the Spanish border. A total of six BTV, five of serotype 4 and one of serotype 2 were isolated in sheep and cattle during the 2004-2006 animal epidemics. The nucleotide sequence of gene segments L2, S7 and S10 of BTV-4 prototype strain (BTV4/22045/PT04) obtained from the original outbreak and BTV-2 (BTV2/26629/PT05) has been completely determined and compared to those of others parts of the world. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that BTV4/22045/PT04 is related to other BTV-4 strains circulating in the Mediterranean basin since 1998 and sharing the highest identity (99%) with 2003 BTV-4 isolates from Sardinia and Corsica, while BTV2/26629/PT05 is almost indistinguishable from the live attenuated vaccine strain Onderstepoort BTV-2 and its related field strain isolated in Italy. Since BTV-2 live attenuated vaccine has never been used in Portugal, the isolation of this strain may represent a natural circulation of the vaccine virus used in other Euro-Mediterranean countries. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Barros, S.

134,Infection of macrophages by a lymphotropic herpesvirus: a new tropism for Marek's disease virus,"Marek's disease virus (MDV) is classified as an oncogenic lymphotropic herpesvirus of chickens. MDV productively and cytolytically infects B, αβT and αγT lymphocytes and latently infects helper T lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to determine whether MDV infects macrophages in vivo and, if so, whether quantitative differences in macrophage infection are associated with the virulence of the MDV strain. Chickens were infected with either virulent MDV (HPRS-16) or ""hypervirulent"" MDV (C12/130). Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies recognizing MDV pp38 antigen and leukocyte antigens was used to identify cells lytically infected with MDV. Macrophages from HPRS-16 and C12/130 infected chickens were pp38+. Macrophages are shown to be pp38+ because they are infected and not because they have phagocytosed MDV antigens, as determined by confocal microscopy using antibodies that recognize MDV antigens of the three kinetic classes of herpesviruses: infected cell protein 4 (ICP4, immediate early), pp38 (early), and glycoprotein B (gB, late). Spleen macrophages from MDV-infected chickens were ICP4+, pp38+ and gB+, and ICP4 had a nuclear localization indicative of infection. Finally, MDV pp38+ macrophages had high inherent death rates, confirming cytolytic MDV infection, although production of virus particles has not yet been demonstrated. These findings have two fundamental implications for understanding MDV pathogenesis: (i) MDV has evolved to disrupt innate immunity in addition to acquired immunity, and (ii) macrophages are excellent candidates for transporting MDV to primary lymphoid organs during the earliest stages of pathogenesis.",,"Barrow, A.

135,Viruses transmitted by ticks,"Tick-borne viruses (TBVs) belong to the largest biological group known as arboviruses, with a unique transmission route through blood-sucking arthropods (ticks, mosquitoes, sandflies, midges, etc.) to a susceptible vertebrate host. Taxonomically, it is a heterogeneous group of vertebrate viruses that occur in several virus families. With just one exception, African swine fever virus, all TBVs have an RNA genome. To date, at least 160 tick-borne viruses are known, some of which pose a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recently, a number of established TBVs have reemerged and spread to new geographic locations due to the impact of anthropogenic activity and the few available vaccines. In addition, new tick-borne diseases are being reported all the time. Significant advances in molecular biotechnology have led to the discovery of new TBVs and further genetic characterization of unclassified viruses, leading to changes in the TBVs classification prepared by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. Although TBVs spend over 95% of their life cycle in tick vectors and the role of ticks as vectors has been known for over 100 years, our knowledge of TBVs and molecular processes involved in virus-tick interactions is poor.",,"BartÃ­kovÃ¡, P.;HolÃ­kovÃ¡, V.;KazimÃ­rovÃ¡, M.;Å tibrÃ¡niovÃ¡, I.",2017.0,,10.4149/av_2017_403,0

137,"Novel full genome sequences of West Nile virus lineage 1a from human cases of infection in north-eastern Italy, 2011","In 2008-2009, several human cases of WNV disease caused by an endemic lineage 1a strain were reported in areas around the Po River in north-eastern Italy. Since 2010, cases have been recorded in nearby northern areas, where both lineages 1a and 2 were discovered in 2011. We describe here two new full-length WNV genome sequences from human cases of WNV infection that emerged in the Veneto region in 2011. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both genomic sequences belonged to lineage 1a and were related to western Mediterranean subtype WNV strains. The new WNV genomes showed a large nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence from each other and from the WNV strain circulating in Italy in 2008-2009. The presence of different WNV strains in a relatively small geographic area is a new finding with unpredictable implications for human disease that warrants further investigation. © 2012 The Authors.

138,Swine Flu Viruses in North Vietnam 2013-2014 article,"Pigs are an important intermediate host for the development of pandemic influenza. Vietnam is the largest pig producer in Southeast Asia. Systematic virological and serological surveillance for swine influenza virus was conducted in North Vietnam from May 2013 to June 2014 with monthly sampling of pigs at local and large collective slaughterhouses and at a live pig market. Influenza A seroprevalence in the local slaughterhouses and in the large community slaughterhouses was 48.7% and 29.1%, respectively. 77 influenza A viruses were isolated, all from the large community slaughterhouse. Genetic analysis identified six viral genotypes, including H1N1 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) viruses, H1N2 with H1 of human origin, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 reassortants, and triple reassorted H3N2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of porcine and human H1N1pdm09 viruses indicated evidence of repeated human-to-porcine transmission rather than the establishment of H1N1pdm09 as a long-term distinct lineage in pigs.

139,A new type of bovine papillomavirus in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus,"Papillomaviruses are a diverse group of viruses known to infect a wide variety of animal species. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are divided into at least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21), with most BPV isolates/strains described to date belonging to one of four genera, including delta papillomavirus, xipapillomavirus, epsilonpapillomavirus and dyoxipapillomavirus. Here we describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new type of BPV in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in New York State, USA, reported chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab specimens taken from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic evaluation. Conventional diagnostic assays gave negative results and vaginal swab specimens were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome 7480 bp in length (67% nt sequence identity to BPV16). In addition, a phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene of the papillomavirus identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it aggregates with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the recently identified BPV16, detected in bovine fibropapilloma lesions, also clusters within the dyokappapapillomavirus group. However, each virus forms a separate branch in the family tree. These results indicate that the putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the Dyokappapapillomavirus genus.",,"Bauermann, F.

140,Analysis of porcine circovirus type 1 detected in Rotarix vaccine,"metagenomic analysis of live human vaccines recently revealed the presence of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) DNA in the pediatric vaccine Rotarix, which is used to prevent acute gastroenteritis. Using real-time PCR for PCV1, titers of PCV1 DNA were found to be in the range of 6-7log10 copies per dose in multiple lots of Rotarix. Pretreatment of the reconstituted vaccine with the nuclease benzonase, followed by extraction of the nucleic acid and quantification of the PCV1 DNA by real-time PCR revealed that there was no loss in PCV1 DNA titer compared to the untreated controls, suggesting suggesting that the swine viral DNA was present in the vaccine in an encapsulated form. PCV1-permissive PS cells, human HEK293 and Vero cells used for vaccine production were infected with Rotarix and PCV1, respectively, and subjected to immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Viral genomes were present in both Rotarix-incubated and PCV1-infected cells, while viral transcription was only observed in PCV1-infected cells. Similarly, PCV1-specific protein expression was observed in PCV1-infected cells but not in Rotarix-treated cells. Passage of the supernatant revealed productive infection in PCV1-infected PS cells, but not in HEK293 and Vero cells or in any cell line incubated with Rotarix. The PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix was protected from benzonase digestion; However, PCV1 was not detected by immunoelectron microscopy and was unable to infect PS, HEK293, or Vero cells, suggesting that the large amount of PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix does not represent a corresponding proportion of biologically active virus particles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Baylis, S.

In this study, the identification and genetic characterization of a bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated from a calf with diarrhea is described. Two different next-generation sequencing platforms were used. Shotgun metagenomics performed by MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) enabled the identification of BEV RNA from a cell culture isolate. BEV was then confirmed by a specific real-time RT-PCR assay. To obtain the entire genome of this isolate, the sequence reads obtained from MinION were coupled with those from NextSeq500 (Illumina). Genomic relatedness and phylogeny with existing BEV strains is also reported. Overall, this manuscript underscores the use of the MinION portable sequence technology as a tool for supportive diagnostics in veterinary practice.",,"Beato, M.

143,Genetic and antigenic characterization of new pestivirus genotypes: implications for classification,"Currently, the Pestivirus genus includes four approved species, Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), and Border Disease Virus (BDV), as well as a tentative fifth species represented by a single strain is (H138) was isolated from a giraffe in Kenya more than 30 years ago. To further address the problem of pestivirus heterogeneity, we determined the entire Npro and E2 coding sequences for several novel pestivirus isolates. Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis revealed that a pestivirus isolated in Africa in the 1990s is closely related to strain H138. In addition, several new pestiviruses isolated from a group of sheep are found together with the previously described strain V60 (Reindeer-1) isolated from a reindeer, while one strain of ovine pestivirus (Gifhorn) differs significantly from all previously described pestiviruses, including BDV. We propose to name these mainly ovine pestiviruses BDV-2 (V60-like isolates) and BDV-3 (Gifhorn); consequently, the ""classical"" BDV isolates should be referred to as BDV-1. As an additional criterion for the segregation of pestiviruses, the antigenic relationship of pestivirus isolates covering all major genotypes observed was examined by cross-neutralization assays. Analysis of antigenic similarities revealed the presence of seven main antigenic groups corresponding to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2, BDV-3 and ""giraffe"". Taking into account the host origin, the lack of differences in disease progression, and the results of our genetic and antigenic analyses, we propose that BDV-1, BDV-2, and BDV-3 should be considered as major genotypes within the species BDV. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

BVDV was detected in 13 persistently infected (PI) cattle with a non-cytopathogenic biotype, while isolates from spleen samples were of the cytopathogenic biotype from five animals with fatal mucosal disease. To reveal the genetic typing of Croatian BVDV isolates, viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures and amplified by RT-PCR using primers targeted to the 5'-UTR and the Npro gene, followed by direct sequencing of the purified PCR products. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR genomic region revealed that all Croatian isolates belonged to BVDV genotype 1; 11 isolates were grouped with BVDV-lb and 7 with BVDV-If viruses. The phylogenetic tree derived by the Bayesian approach using combined 5'-UTR/Npro supported the clustering of Croatian isolates into two subgroups.

SBV caused a major epidemic in ruminants in Europe. As with related viruses such as Akabane virus, it appears to be transmitted by mosquitoes. Transplacental infection often results in the birth of malformed calves, lambs, and goat kids. Acute infections in adult ruminants or malformed SBV-positive offspring were found in more than 5000 farms in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland, and high seroprevalences in adult ruminants were observed Core regions in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The discovery of SBV, the spread of the epidemic, the role of vectors, the impact on livestock, public health issues, SBV diagnosis and actions taken are described in this overview. Lessons learned from the Schmallenberg virus epidemic and implications for future outbreaks will be discussed. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,"Beer, M.;Conraths, F.

We performed full genome sequencing to examine the relationship between wild bird and avian viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses are related to class H5 2.3.4.4 viruses discovered in Russia in May 2016, but have novel polymerase base 2 and nucleoprotein gene segments and two different variants of the polymerase acid segment contained. Molecular dating suggests that the rearrangement events most likely occurred in wild birds in Russia or Mongolia. In addition, 2 genetically distinct H5N5 reassortant viruses have been detected in wild birds in the Netherlands.

147,Molecular analysis of swine hepatitis E virus from North India,"Background and Objectives: Hepatitis E is the leading cause of enterally transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries. In developed countries like the US, Japan and Taiwan, the viruses that infect humans and pigs share the same genotype with a high degree of sequence similarity. Genotype 1 circulates in humans, while genotype 4 is found in swine in India. The present study was designed to investigate the presence of anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA in swine populations from North India, to examine the predominant genotype therein and to compare it with other swine and human HEV strains from India. Methods: A total of 67 serum samples were collected from pigs 1 to 6 months of age at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareily, and subjected to anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA detection. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method and assessed using the inner branch test method with MEGA 4 software. Results: Anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA were found in 38.8 and 4.5 percent of the pig samples tested, respectively. It was observed that the above samples were of genotype 4e. The three new sequences had nucleotide similarity to other porcine sequences in genotype 4 ranging from 80-98 percent. Interpretation and Conclusions: The three sequences observed in the present study showed nucleotide similarity to other porcine sequences from South and West Indies. The present study suggests that genotype 4 'e' is widespread in northern India.",,"Begum, N.;Polipalli, S. K.;Husain, S. A.;Kar, P.",2010.0,,,0
148,Relationships and history of live vaccine strains of Newcastle disease,"Previously, Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) strains were classified solely on the basis of their virulence, but recently grouping based on genetic relationships between the strains has become the method of choice. Live vaccine strains belong to the mild (lentogenic) or moderately virulent (mesogenic) categories, in contrast to the highly pathogenic epidemic viruses of the velogenic group. Using their genetic characteristics and lineage, the placement of vaccine strains in the “NDV world” can be viewed as described below (Figure 1). 1. Lentogenic vaccine strains are present in two of the dozen or so genotypes of NDV found in chickens. One is American group 11 (consisting of vaccine strains B-1, LaSota and F), the other is genotype I (comprising strains Ulster 2C, V4/Queensland and NDV-6/10) also found in wild waterfowl occurs. 2. Mesogenic strains are also present in only two genotypes: Group 11 (strains Roakin and Komarov) and Asiatic genogroup III (strains H and Mukteswar). 3. While the vaccine strains of Groups I and 11 aro are of natural origin, strains H, Mukteswar and Komarov were artificially attenuated, as reported in reports from the 1940s. However, discrepancies between the actual genetic identity and the postulated origin of mesogenic vaccine strains have been identified (Figure 2). a) Since the mesogenic strain H is unrelated to the virulent Herts'33, its putative parent, the reduced virulence of H cannot be attributed to the egg passage procedures performed in England, and even the presence of this strain is puzzling. b) Strains H and Mukteswar with a nucleotide distance of less than 0.3% must originate from the same isolate and therefore cannot be the result of independent developments in England and India. c) The reduced virulence (mesogenic) of the strain H/Mukteswar cannot be associated with an attenuation either; most likely it is a naturally occurring Indian field isolate. d) The mesogenic strain Komarov, intended to be attenuated in ducklings by intracerebral passage of a local velogenic virus in Palestine, is identical to the American (genotype 11) vaccine strain Roakin, for which no scientific explanation can be given.",,"Bela, L.",2008.0,Jun,,0
149,New viruses in veterinary medicine detected by metagenomic approaches,"In our world today, confronted with extraordinary environmental changes and dramatically intensifying globalization, we face challenges due to many new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of novel, previously ""unknown"" infectious diseases. Although we have a wide arsenal of diagnostic methods at our disposal, the majority of conventional diagnostic tests are highly virus-specific or entirely aimed at a limited group of infectious agents. This specificity makes it difficult or even hinders the detection of new or unexpected pathogens, such as. B. new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or novel virus variants. Recently developed viral metagenomics approaches offer a powerful new way to screen samples and detect viruses without prior knowledge of the infectious agent, enabling better diagnosis and disease control in line with One World, One Health principles (www.oneworldonehealth.org ). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently identified a variety of new viruses, including novel bocaviruses, torque tenoviruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses, and kobuviruses in swine disease syndromes, novel virus variants in honey bee populations, and a range of other infectious agents in additional host species. These results indicate that metagenomic detection of viral pathogens is now becoming a powerful, culture-independent, and useful new diagnostic tool in veterinary diagnostic virology. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"BelÃ¡k, S.;Karlsson, O.

150,Advances in viral disease diagnostics and molecular epidemiological technologies,"The early and rapid detection and characterization of specific nucleic acids of medical-veterinary pathogens has proven invaluable for diagnostic purposes. The integration of amplification and signal detection systems, including on-line real-time devices, has increased speed and sensitivity, and greatly facilitated the quantification of target nucleic acids. They have also allowed sequence characterization using melting or hybridization curves. Newer generation molecular diagnostic technologies offer unprecedented detection and discrimination methods that are critical for the positive detection and identification of pathogens and the impact of pathogens on the production of antibodies. The development phase of novel technologies requires a thorough understanding of how to accurately diagnose and differentiate current and emerging diseases. The development of novel technologies can only be successful if they are transferred and used in practice with a sustainable quality-assured application to enable optimal detection and effective control of diseases. The aim of these new tools is to detect the presence of a pathogen before the onset of the disease.

152,Propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) improve DNA array and high-throughput sequencing for the identification of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses,"Panviral DNA array (PVDA) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) are useful tools to identify novel viruses of emerging diseases. However, both techniques have difficulties in identifying viruses in clinical specimens due to host genomic nucleic acid content (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) have the ability to bind free DNA/RNA but are impermeable to cell membranes. Therefore, both are unable to bind protected nucleic acids such as viral genomes within intact virions. However, EMA/PMA modified genetic material cannot be amplified by enzymes. To evaluate the potential of EMA/PMA to reduce the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in specimens and improve virus detection, serum and lung tissue homogenates were spiked with porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) and processed with EMA/PMA. In addition, PRRSV RT-qPCR positive clinical samples were also tested. EMA/PMA treatments significantly reduced the amplifiable hg/cont and significantly increased the number of PVDA-positive probes and their signal intensity compared to untreated spiked lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased the sensitivity of HTS by increasing the number of specific PRRSV measurements and PRRSV coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two out of three clinical tissue samples. Therefore, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to lower the amplifiable hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS for virus identification.",,"Bellehumeur, C.;Boyle, B.;Charette, S.

A serotyping antibody capture enzyme-linked immunoassay for the detection of serotype 6 rotavirus using a serotype 6-specific monoclonal antibody was developed and evaluated for strain characterization. Characterization of 72 rotavirus-positive group A faecal samples from bovine herds and 43 faecal samples from dairy herds showed a dominance of serotype 6 rotavirus in bovine herds, but both serotype 6 and non-serotype 6 rotaviruses in dairy herds.

The etiology of the disease is an avian paramyxovirus type 1 or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whose isolates are grouped serologically into a single serotype, but are genetically grouped into a total of 19 genotypes due to the continuous emergence and evolution of the virus. In Nigeria, the molecular characterization of NDV is generally very sparse and mainly focuses on the amplification of the partial F gene for genotype assignment. However, with the introduction of the most objective NDV genotyping criteria using complete fusion protein coding sequences in the phylogenetic taxonomy, the enormous genetic diversity of the virus in Nigeria became very striking. In this review, we examine the current ecological distribution of different NDV genotypes in Nigeria based on the available full fusion protein nucleotide sequences (1662 bp) in the NCBI database. We then discuss the challenges of ND control due to the large genetic distance between the currently circulating NDV isolates and the most commonly used vaccines to combat the disease in the country. Finally, we suggest future directions in the war against the economically devastating ND in Nigeria.",,"Bello, M. B.;Yusoff, K. M.;Ideris, A.;Hair-Bejo, M.;Peeters, B. P. H.;Jibril, A.

157,"Novel polyphenol oxidase from a bovine rumen metagenome expression library: biochemical properties, structural analysis, and phylogenetic relationships","RL5, a gene encoding a novel polyphenol oxidase, was identified by activity screening of a metagenome expression library from bovine rumen microflora. Characterization of the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed a multipotent capacity to oxidize a variety of substrates (syringaldazine > 2,6-dimethoxyphenol > veratryl alcohol > guaiacol > tetramethylbenzidine > 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol > 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline- 6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) â‰« henol red) over an unusually broad pH range from 3.5 to 9.0. Apparent Km and k cat values for ABTS, syringaldazine and 2,6-dimetoxyphenol obtained from steady-state kinetic measurements at 40 °C, pH 4.5 gave values of 26, 0.43 and 0, respectively .45 μM and 18, 660 and 1175 s-1, respectively. The Km values for syringaldazine and 2,6-dimetoxyphenol are up to 5-fold lower and the kcat values up to 40-fold higher than previously for this class of enzymes reported values. RL5 is a 4-copper oxidase with oxidation potential values of 745, 400, and 500 mV versus a normal hydrogen electrode for copper sites T1, T2, and T3. A three-dimensional model of RL5 and site-directed mutants was constructed to identify the copper ligands. Bioinformatic analyzes of the gene sequence and the sequences and contexts of neighboring genes suggested a tentative phylogenetic assignment to the genus Bacteroides. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR analyzes provide unequivocal evidence that the hypothetical Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and E. coli proteins closely related to the derived protein encoded by the RL5 gene are also multicopper proteins with polyphenol oxidase activity. The present study shows that these three newly characterized enzymes form a novel family of functional multicopper oxidases with laccase activity, related to conserved hypothetical proteins harboring the domain of unknown function DUF152, and suggests that some other of these proteins are also laccases could.

159,"Prioritization of zoonotic viral diseases in wild boar, domestic pigs and the human interface","INTRODUCTION: Understanding the ecology of disease requires understanding pathogens at the interface between wildlife and livestock. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) pose a public health concern as countries work to prevent and control zoonotic diseases because their populations pose environmental and health concerns due to infectious agents transmissible to domestic pigs and other animal species, including humans. AIM: Prioritize zoonotic diseases at the interface between wild boar, domestic animals and humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evidence-based, semi-quantitative prioritization method included 27 criteria justified in recent publications. According to viral etiology, we have divided them into five categories: epidemiology (eight), prevention/control (three), economy/commerce (four), public health (nine), and society (three). Each criterion had a coefficient from 0 to 7 according to its impact based on evidence (maximum sum of 189). Evidence on the criteria for the nine viral diseases analyzed comes from reviewing 81 sources published between 1977 and 2015. RESULTS: The three diseases with the highest scores and zoonotic potential were swine influenza (133), and hantavirus infection (103), for which the highest scores were observed on epidemiological and public health criteria. CONCLUSION: The semi-quantitative methods of prioritization impartially contribute to evidence-based decision-making; However, due to the lack of data from public health surveillance, they are rarely used in developing countries. Controlling common diseases requires the development of strategies to reduce the transmission of pathogens between wild and domestic animals and humans.",,"Benavides-Arias, D.;Soler-Tovar, D.",2015.0,,10.7705/biomedica.v36i0.2950,0
160,Characterization of the surface proteins of influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated from humans in 1997-1998,"Influenza A (H5N1) virus infected people in Hong Kong between May and December 1997. Sixteen viruses were isolated during this outbreak, including 6 fatal cases. Molecular analysis of the surface protein genes encoding hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of these H5N1 isolates, a subtype not previously known to infect humans, is presented. The 16 human H5-HA sequences contain several basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, a motif associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The phylogenetic relationship between avian and human H5 hemagglutinin indicates that the human isolates are directly related to isolates circulating among chickens at the five Hong Kong poultry markets before and during the human outbreak. HA sequences from the human isolates and a more recent chicken isolate represent a separate clade within which there are two subgroups, antigenic and distinguishable by the presence of a potential glycosylation site. Likewise, the N1 neuraminidases of human H5 isolates represent a clade that is evolutionarily distinct from previously characterized N1 neuraminidases. The newer human H5N1 virus NA genes are avian-like, suggesting a direct introduction from an avian source rather than the evolution of a human N1 NA. All 16 human NA genes encode a truncated stalk due to a 19 amino acid deletion also found in recent Hong Kong avian H5N1 isolates. Two unique amino acids have been identified in the N1-NAs of recent human isolates; however, it is not known whether these residues affect the host range. Neither the HA nor the NA genes of the human H5N1 virus isolates show evidence of adaptive changes during the outbreak. Although analyzes of the surface protein genes of the HSN1 viruses from this outbreak did not provide immediate answers about the molecular basis of virulence, the analyzes did provide clues to potentially important regions of the genes that are worth further investigating.",,"Bender, C.;Hall, H.;Huang, J.;Klimov, A.;Cox, N.;Hay, A.;Gregory, V.;Cameron, K.;Lim, W.;Subbarao, K.",1999.0,,10.1006/viro.1998.9529,0
161,Analysis of the variability in the non-coding regions of influenza A viruses,"The genomes of influenza A viruses (IAVs) comprise eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments. In addition to the protein coding region, each segment has 5' and 3' non-coding regions (NCR) important for transcription, replication and packaging. The NCRs contain both conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the implications of variability in the NCRs are not fully understood. Full NCRs have been determined for some viruses, but a detailed analysis of the potential variability in these regions between viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To assess the level of conservation in NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced the NCRs of IAVs isolated from different wild bird host groups (ducks, gulls, and seabirds). We then extended our study to include NCRs available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) influenza virus database, which allowed us to analyze a greater diversity of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variability within the NCRs varied between segments, with the greatest variation found in the HA and NA segments and the least in the M and NS segments. Overall, the variability of the NCR sequences was correlated with the phylogeny of the coding region, indicating a vertical coevolution of the (coding sequence) CDS and NCR regions.",,"Benkaroun, J.;Robertson, G.

162,Molecular techniques: new possibilities in the light of adenovirus research,"The author summarizes the new possibilities that lie in modern molecular techniques that have revolutionized the methods of virus research and diagnostics by presenting their latest achievements in the field of adenovirus research. Among the new methods, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has the greatest importance. Due to the large and constantly growing number of known virus serotypes, the classic serological identification of new isolates has become extremely cumbersome. In addition, reliable reference strains and serum collections are rarely available in laboratories. PCR combined with sequencing offers a fast and efficient alternative. The new viruses identified and classified by such methods are called types rather than serotypes. In various veterinary laboratories, numerous adenovirus strains that have been isolated in various veterinary laboratories over the past decades have not yet been characterized. Now these viruses can be typed and classified by sequence analysis of certain genes. The other major advantage of the method is that it allows the molecular characterization of non-isolated viruses. This is particularly valuable for studying adenoviruses from wild animals, when isolating the virus is not usually a realistic option. The author's research group was the first in the world to determine the complete genome sequence of an adenovirus solely by PCRs from infected organ samples from diseased and dead birds, without successfully isolating the virus. Organ samples from various vertebrates found dead in zoos, pet shops or in the wild are continuously screened by PCR in the author's laboratory. Fecal samples are also suitable for screening purposes. In addition to birds and reptiles, a high rate of adenoviral infection in native bats has recently been demonstrated.",,"Benko, M.",2011.0,Aug,,0

164,Does a common architecture reveal a viral lineage that spans all three walks of life?,"Our discovery that the major coat protein of bacteriophage PRD1 resembles that of human adenovirus raised the unexpected possibility that viruses that infect bacteria might be evolutionarily related to those that infect animal hosts. We first consider the development of this idea. We then describe how we used structure-based modeling to show that several other viruses with no detectable sequence similarity likely have envelopes constructed from similar proteins - the ""double-barrel trimer"". Evidence suggests that the clade includes a variety of viruses infecting very different hosts in all three domains of life: eukarya; Bacteria; and Archaea, which diverged billions of years ago. The current classification of viruses obscures such similarities. We propose that the appearance of a double-barreled trimer coat protein in a large-faceted icosahedral dsDNA virus, regardless of its host, is a very strong predictor of its belonging to a viral lineage with a common ancestor.",,"Benson, S.

165,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical syndrome, and genetic diversity","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the major tick-borne viral disease in humans, causing sporadic cases or outbreaks of serious disease across a vast geographic area, from western China to the Middle East and southeastern Europe and most of Africa. CCHFV is maintained in vertical and horizontal transmission cycles affecting ixodid ticks and a variety of wild and domestic vertebrates that show no signs of disease. The virus circulates in a number of tick genera, but Hyalomma ticks are the primary source of human infection, likely because both immature and adult forms are actively seeking hosts for the blood meals required at each stage of maturation. CCHF is most common in farm workers after being bitten by an infected tick and to a lesser extent in slaughterhouse workers who are exposed to the blood and tissues of infected animals and medical staff through contact with the body fluids of infected patients. CCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the arboviruses, with nucleotide sequence differences between isolates ranging from 20% for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. Viruses with different sequences can be found within the same geographic area, while closely related viruses have been isolated in distant regions, suggesting that CCHFV was at times widespread in the past, possibly by ticks carried by migratory birds or from abroad livestock trade. The rearrangement between genome segments during tick or vertebrate co-infection appears to have played an important role in generation of diversity and represents a potential future source of new viruses. In this article, we first review and summarize the current knowledge of CCHFV molecular biology, conservation and transmission, epidemiology and geographic range together. We also include a detailed discussion of the genetic diversity of CCHFV, including maps of the virus' range with overlaid phylogenetic trees. We then review the characteristics of CCHF, including the clinical syndrome, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, vaccine development, and laboratory animal models of CCHF. The paper ends with a discussion of the potential future geographic spread of the virus.

166,Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of host genes of camelpox virus isolates from India,"Camelpox virus (CMLV), a close variant of variola virus (VARV), infects camels worldwide. The zoonotic infections reported from India indicate the need to study the host range genes responsible for host tropism. We report sequence and phylogenetic analyzes of five host genes: cytokine response modifier B (crmB), chemokine-binding protein (ckbp), viral sleep-like (v-slfn), myxomavirus T4-like (M-T4-like ) and b5r from CMLVs isolated from outbreaks in India. Comparative analyzes revealed that these genes are conserved in CMLVs and are 94.5–100% identical at both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) level. All genes showed identity (59.3-98.4%) with vaccinia virus (CPXV), while three genes - crmB, ckbp and b5r - shared similarity (92-96.5%) with VARVs on both the nt and aa level. Interestingly, three consecutive insertions of serine residues were observed in the CKBP protein of the CMLV Delhi09 isolate, which was similar to CPXV-BR and VACVs, and five point mutations (K53Q, N67I, F84S, A127T, and E182G) were also similar to zoonotic OPXVs. In addition, some inconsistent point mutations have also been observed in other genes in Indian CMLVs. These indicate that different strains of CMLVs are circulating in India and these mutations may play an important role in the adaptation of CMLVs in humans. The phylogeny showed an accumulation of all CMLVs together, except for CMLV-Delhi09, which was grouped separately due to the presence of specific point mutations. However, the topology of the chained phylogeny showed a close evolutionary relationship of CMLV with VARV and TATV, followed by CPXV-RatGer09/1 from Germany. The availability of this genetic information will be useful in unveiling new strategies to control emerging zoonotic poxvirus infections.",,"Bera, B.

167,"Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of host range (E3L, K3L and C7L) and structural protein (B5R) genes of Buffalopox virus isolates from buffalo, bovine and humans in India","Buffalopox virus (BPXV), a close variant of vaccinia virus (VACV), has emerged as a zoonotic agent. The host tropism of poxviruses is determined by host range genes. Among host range genes: E3L, K3L and C7L are essential for virus replication by preventing interferon resistance while B5R is essential for virus spread and evasion of host immune response as in VACV. We report sequence analyzes of host genes: E3L, K3L, C7L and membrane protein gene (B5R) of buffalo, bovine and human BPXVs from recent outbreaks in India - their phylogenetic relationship with the reference strain (BP4) and other orthopoxviruses. BPXVs showed sequence homology with VACVs, including zoonotic Brazilian VACV-like viruses. The aa sequences of the E3L and K3L genes were 100% similar in buffalo, bovine and human isolates. However, four significant point mutations (I11K; N12K and S36F in the C7L gene and D249G in the B5R gene) specific only to buffalo isolate were observed. This means that different BPXV strains were circulating during the outbreak. The mutations in C7L and B5R could play an important role in the adaptation of BPXV in humans and cattle, which requires further functional studies. The BPXV strain isolated from buffalo must not be transmitted to humans and cattle. Various point mutations were observed in the host range genes of the reference strain (BPXV-BP4), possibly due to multiple viral passages in cell culture. The phylogeny constructed on the basis of concatenated gene sequences showed that BPXVs are not as closely related to the vaccinia strain (Lister and Lister-derived strain - LC16m8) as previously thought, but more closely related to the reference strain (BPXV-BP4) and other vaccinia and vaccinia-like viruses such as Passatempo and Aracatuba viruses.

169,Phage-bacteria relationships and CRISPR elements revealed by a metagenomic study of the rumen microbiome,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We performed random pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes (viromas) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analyzed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. With up to 28,000 different viral genotypes recovered from each environment, a high level of diversity was observed. The majority (~78%) of the sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outperformed lytic phages approximately 2:1, with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types associated with members of the dominant rumen strains (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.

170,Using non-invasive metagenomics to characterize wild animal viral communities,"Microbial communities play an important role in the health of organisms and ecosystems. While high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, the generation of comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and the limited amounts of viral nucleic acid pose particular challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons between host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected fecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and pets, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction methods, and enrichment steps affect the detection of viral communities. Based on evidence of viral contamination in fetal calf serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another non-biological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs and not from supernatant or pelleted material that contained undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid and improve virus detection. Finally, by applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven sites in Peru, we showed that the detected viral communities were saturated at the depth of sequencing achieved, allowing for unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods described here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments, and time.",,"Bergner, L. M.;Orton, R.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, which included comparison to other rabies strains from across the Americas, identified three major groups of Brazilian viruses, arbitrarily named BRL-1 through BRL-3. BRL-1 has been found in terrestrial carnivores and clusters with other American cosmopolitan lineage strains. BRL-2 consisted of two distinct isolates obtained from two species of non-hematophagous bats that had evolutionary links to insectivorous bat-derived phyla of North America. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and from livestock species likely infected through contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was further divided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated exclusively with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found exclusively in gray foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian gray fox as a rabies reservoir. Screening of representative Brazilian rabies viruses against a collection of anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified a small panel of mAbs that could be used to discriminate between all Brazilian subgroups as defined by the genetic classification in this study. © 2005 SGM.",,"Bernardi, F.;Nadin-Davis, S.

No significant association between HHV-7 and CFS could be established by means of seroepidemiology. HHV-7 is a T-lymphotropic virus that infects primary CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. HHV-7 can also infect SUP-T1, an immature T cell line, with variable success. Southern blot analysis using DNA probes that scan 58.8% of the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome and hybridize to all HHV-6 strains tested to date revealed only 37 homology to HHV-7 .4% of total probe length. HHV-7 contains the GGGTTA repetitive sequence, as does HHV-6 and Marek's disease chicken herpesvirus. DNA sequencing of a 186 base pair fragment of HHV-7(JI) revealed 57.5% and 36% identity with HHV-6 and human cytomegalovirus, respectively.

174,Absence of transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus from persistently infected cattle to naïve cattle under field conditions in Vietnam,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD), caused by FMD virus (FMD virus; aphthovirus, Picornaviridae), is a highly contagious and economically important disease of domestic and wild ungulate species worldwide. Following the clinical phase of FMD, a large proportion of FMD-infected ruminants become persistently infected carriers, defined by the detection of FMD in oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) specimens 28 days or more post-infection. The aim of this prospective study was to characterize FMD carrier status in cattle after natural infection under typical husbandry practices in Vietnam. Ten persistently infected cattle on eight farms in Long An province of southern Vietnam were monitored for 12 months by monthly screening of serum and oropharyngeal fluid samples. To assess transmission of FMD carriers, 16 naïve cattle were intentionally placed in direct contact with the persistently infected animals for 6 months and monitored by clinical and laboratory methods. The restricted mean duration of FMD carrier status was 27.7 months and the rate of decrease in the proportion of carriers was 0.03 per month. There was no evidence of transmission to naïve animals throughout the study period. In addition, no FMD infection or seroconversion was detected in three calves born to carrier animals during the study. The infection rate for carrier-to-contact transmission was 0 per month, with a 95% upper confidence limit of 0.064 per month. Phylogenetic analysis of viral protein 1 (VP1) coding sequences obtained from carriers indicated that all viruses recovered in this study belonged to the O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage and were phylogenetically grouped with temporally and geographically related viruses .

175,Allergic vasculitis during ORF,"ORF is an infectious disease that affects sheep and goats and is caused by a parapox virus. It can be transmitted to humans and is considered an occupational hazard for handling sheep. The authors describe a case of ORF associated with allergic vasculitis with a development suggesting a pathogenetic role of the virus. A 69-year-old woman presented with target-like erythematous plaques indicative of ORF. Ten days after the onset of the first lesion, both non-defeasible purulent papules and necrotic purpura became evident on the legs, ankles, and dorsum of the feet. The histological evaluation revealed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These latter lesions resolved in ten days without therapy. At the same time, the ORF lesions also regressed spontaneously three weeks after their appearance. After six months of follow-up, neither ORF lesions nor allergic vasculitis had recurred. Viral infections are well known as etiological factors of vasculitis. Many elements led us to believe that this case of allergic vasculitis correlates with ORF viral infection: time of onset, duration, resolution related to the clinical course of ORF, no need for therapy for recovery, and a 6-month follow-up without relapses. This points to the possibility of classifying the ORF virus in the group of viruses responsible for allergic vasculitis.",,"Bettoli, V.;Trovato, C.;La Malfa, W.;Pazzaglia, M.",1997.0,,,0
176,Dynamics of acute Montipora-White syndrome: bacterial communities of healthy and diseased M. capitata colonies during and after an outbreak,"Coral diseases contribute to the decline of coral reefs worldwide and threaten the health and future of coral reef communities. Acute Montipora-White Syndrome (aMWS) is a tissue-loss disease that has resulted in the death of hundreds of Montipora capitata colonies in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii in recent years. This study describes the analysis of coral-associated bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing generated by the PacBio RSII platform. Samples from three health states of M. capitata (healthy, healthy-ill, and ill) were collected during an ongoing aMWS outbreak and period without an outbreak, and the bacterial communities were identified to determine whether a shift in community structure had occurred between the two periods . The bacterial communities associated with outbreak and non-outbreak samples were significantly different, and an important factor was a large number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified as Escherichia spp. have been identified. in the breakout sequences. Tracing of in silico bacterial sources indicated that this OTU was likely due to sewage contamination from livestock rather than human origin. The most abundant coliform OTU was a culturable E. ferguonii isolate, strain OCN300, but it did not induce disease in healthy M. capitata colonies when used in laboratory infection experiments. In addition, screening of the sequencing result revealed that the most abundant OTUs corresponded to the previously described M. capitata pathogens. The synergistic combination of known coral pathogens, wastewater contaminants and other stressors, such as fluctuating seawater temperatures and bacterial pathogens, have the potential to escalate the degradation of coral reef ecosystems.",,"Beurmann, S.;Ushijima, B.;Videau, P.;Svoboda, C.

177,Prospects for Control and Eradication of Capripox from the Indian Subcontinent: A Perspective,"Sheeppox and goatpox, two capripox infections endemic to India, pose a significant economic threat to small ruminant productivity in the subcontinent. Vaccination of all susceptible sheep and goats is the viable and sustainable means of control. The availability of effective live attenuated vaccines that are inherently thermostable and the development of improved diagnostics offer the opportunity to initiate effective control measures for Capripox. All animals older than 4.5 months can be vaccinated with the current homologous vaccines using a single vaccination by the intradermal or subcutaneous route. The success of the control program must be monitored by active surveillance, particularly for the presence of viruses, since seromonitoring does not allow differentiation between infection and vaccination. And the seroconversion after the Capripox vaccination cannot be adequately detected with the available instruments either. Sustained control efforts require socioeconomic and political stability, adequate infrastructure, and logistical support for vaccine storage and transportation to get vaccines to distant end-users. The availability of veterinary services, improved advisory services to raise awareness among farmers contribute significantly to control campaigns. Poor immunization coverage and inadequate infrastructure in large parts of the country are some of the key elements standing in the way of effectively implementing herd immunity building through vaccination. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Bhanuprakash, V.;Hosamani, M.;Singh, R.

178,The current status of sheeppox disease,"Sheep are the shepherd's benches and their economic contribution in terms of meat, wool and hide/skin is immense. Various infectious diseases threaten optimal productivity; among which sheeppox are more important, since the disease restricts the export of sheep and their products, among other economic losses. Although the clinical signs are indicative of the disease, laboratory confirmation is required for a definitive diagnosis and study of the epidemiology. The causative agent, sheeppox virus (SPV), is antigenically and genetically closely related to goatpox virus (GPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), the other members of the Capripoxvirus genus. In some countries, SPV and GPV are cross-infectious to small ruminants, posing diagnostic and epidemiological problems. However, recent studies have shown that the viruses are phylogenetically distinct and can be distinguished by molecular tools. Prophylaxis with attenuated vaccines is the choice of control measure because immunity is long-lasting. Detailed information on isolation, identification, pathology, epidemiology, diagnosis and prophylaxis would not only help update the knowledge of the scientific community, but would also be useful for policy makers to take appropriate measures to control and eradicate the disease to formulate. This summary is intended to provide an up-to-date overview of the disease and how to combat it in order to provide the reader with an overview of the problem. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

179,Fluorogenic RT-PCR assay (TaqMan) for the detection and classification of bovine viral diarrhea virus,"single-tube, fluorogenic RT-PCR-based TaqMan test was developed for the detection and classification of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV). TaqMan PCR has been optimized for BVD virus quantification using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System and dual-labeled fluorogenic probes. Two different gene-specifically labeled fluorogenic probes for the 5-inch untranslated region (5-inch UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD type I and II. The sensitivity of the single-tube TaqMan Assay was compared to the two-tube TaqMan Assay and standard RT-PCR using 10-fold RNA dilutions. The single-tube TaqMan assay was 10-100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and standardized single-tube RT-PCR. The specificity of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or individual serum samples, field isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantification of BVD virus type I and II cRNA was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold (CT) versus copy number. The single-tube TaqMan PCR assay was sensitive, specific, and rapid for the detection, quantification, and classification of BVD virus. © 2001 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Bhudevi, B.;Weinstock, D.",2001.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(01)00390-x,0

Based on the genetic and phylogenetic analyses, the viruses have a stable gene constellation with a clade 2.3.2.1c HA , a PB2 gene derived from H9N2 and the other six genes of Asian H5N1 origin. The clade 2.3.2.1c H5N1 reassortants showed a high genetic relatedness to a human H5N1 strain (A/Alberta/01/2014). Further analysis showed that similar viruses circulated in wild birds in China, Russia, Dubai (West Asia), Bulgaria and Romania (Europe) and in domestic poultry in some regions of Africa. Affected areas include the Central Asia, East Asia-Australasia, West Asia-East Africa and Black Sea/Mediterranean air routes. These results indicate that the new clade 2.3.2.1c reassortant viruses are circulating worldwide and may have gained a selective advantage in migratory birds, thereby posing a serious threat to wild birds and possibly humans.

Analysis of nucleotide sequence variability and detection of signature patterns for overlapping genes suggested that ORFs 1 and 2 are likely functional. However, this was not the case for a putative third ORF, ORF3. Several nucleotide or amino acid motifs have been identified throughout the viral genome that are conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus. The phylogenetic analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMV and enabled the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, faeces and saliva.

These sequences are also compared to partial G gene sequences of VSV IND type 2 (Cocal) and type 3 (Alagoas) viruses and the complete G gene sequences of the more distantly related VSV New Jersey (NJ) and Chandipura viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene sequences by maximal parsimony revealed four major lineages or subtypes within the classic VSV IND (type 1) viruses, each with a distinct geographic distribution. A high level of VSV genetic diversity has been identified in Central America, with multiple viral subtypes of both the VSV IND and NJ serotypes occurring in this primarily enzootic disease region. Nineteen percent sequence variation but no deletions or insertions were evident within the 5' non-coding and the coding regions of the VSV-IND type 1 G genes. In addition to numerous base substitutions, the 3' non-coding regions of these viruses also contained numerous base insertions and deletions. This resulted in striking variations in G gene sizes, with gene lengths ranging from 1,652 to 1,868 nucleotides. As the VSV IND type 1 subtypes have diverged from the common ancestor with the NJ subtypes, their G mRNAs have accumulated more 3' noncoding sequence inserts, up to 303 nucleotides long. These consist primarily of an inaccurate repeat of the sequence UUUUUAA, which appears to have been generated by a unique polymerase stuttering error. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence differences between VSV IND type 1 viruses revealed numerous substitutions within defined antigenic epitopes, suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the evolution of these viruses.",,"Bilsel, P.

186,Different genotypes of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis viruses co-circulating in the chicken population in China,"Nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis (IB) in chickens has been prevalent in most chicken farms in recent years, although the IB vaccination program has been widely implemented in China. To characterize the S1 protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from China, five representative nephropathogenic IB viruses isolated from chickens in different provinces were genetically and phylogenetically analyzed. The results showed that the length of the S1 genes of the isolates was quite different (1617, 1620, 1623, 1629 and 1632 nucleotides, respectively). The nucleotide and amino acid homology between the five isolates was 76.7% ± 92.1% and 73.9% ± 89.5%, respectively, indicating a large variation in the S1 genes of the isolates. The variation of the S1 genes could affect the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the viruses. Genetically, point mutations, insertions and deletions can be observed at many positions in the S1 protein, particularly at the first 150 amino acids in the N-terminus of the S1 protein. Two motif cleavage sites (RRXRR/S, HRRRR/S) were observed in the five sequenced strains. Phylogenetic analyzes suggested that they belonged to different lineages. These results indicated that different genotypes of nephropathogenic IB viruses co-circulated in the chicken population in China. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bing, G.

Enteroviruses have recently been implicated in regional and global epidemics, including major diseases (Enterovirus A71 and D68), and are of interest as emerging viruses. Here we typed enterovirus AD (EV) from the central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory infections in Vietnam. METHODS: Data and samples from prospective observational clinical studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were used. Species and serotypes were determined using type-specific RT-PCR and viral protein 1 or 4 (VP1, VP4) sequencing. RESULTS: Samples from patients with CNS infection (51 children - 10 CSF and 41 respiratory/rectal swabs) and 28 adults (28 CSF) and respiratory infections (124 children - 124 respiratory swabs) were analyzed. Twenty-six different serotypes from the four enterovirus (AD) species have been identified, including EV-A71 and EV-D68. Enterovirus B has been associated with viral meningitis in children and adults. Enteroviruses A (EV-A71 and coxsackievirus [CV] A10) associated with hand, foot and mouth disease have been identified in children with encephalitis. Various serotypes of all four enterovirus species were found in respiratory samples, including 2 polio vaccine viruses, but also 8 CV-A24 and 8 EV-D68. With the exception of EV-D68, the relevance of these viruses in respiratory infections remains unknown. CONCLUSION: We describe the diverse spectrum of enteroviruses from patients with CNS and respiratory infections in Vietnam between 1997 and 2010. These data confirm the worldwide distribution of enterovirus genera and their associations and are important for clinical diagnosis, patient management and response Outbreaks.",,"B'Krong, N.;Minh, N.

These physicochemical properties place this isolate in the adenovirus group of viruses. The disease was experimentally reproduced by intratracheal inoculation of day-old turkey poults. Snicking occurred in 100% of the birds and mortality reached 50%. CELO (Phelps strain) antiserum neutralized uncloned and cloned CUA-2 in chick embryos and uncloned virus in chick embryo fibroblast cell cultures.

189,Variable and constant regions in African swine fever virus DNA,"Analysis of the SalI restriction pattern of African swine fever virus DNA showed that the SalI recognition sites did not change after more than 100 virus passages in swine macrophages. The virus strain BA71V, obtained from the virus isolate BA71 by adaptation to growth in VERO cells, differed from the unadapted virus by two deletions with a length of 2.5 and 7 kb, which were close to the DNA ends. Restriction analysis of several virus clones obtained from a naturally infected pig revealed length heterogeneity in both variable regions. A comparison of SalI restriction maps of 23 African swine fever virus field isolates (8 African, 11 European and 4 American) has shown that the viral genome consists of a central region of constant length of approximately 125 kb and two variable regions close to the DNA ends with a length of 38-47 kb for the left DNA end and 13-16 kb for the right DNA end. The total length of ASF virus DNA varied between 178 (BA71) and 189 (MOZ64) kb. The 23 African swine fever virus isolates were divided into five groups according to the arrangement of the SalI sites in the central region. Four groups contained only African isolates, while all European and American isolates belonged to the same group.

KOOLV had previously shown to be antigenically related to Kotonkon virus, an ephemerovirus that has caused an ephemeral febrile illness in cattle in Nigeria, but YATV was not antigenic to any other virus tested. Here we report the complete genome sequences of KOOLV (16,133 nt) and YATV (14,479 nt). Each has a complex genomic organization with multiple genes, including a second nonstructural glycoprotein (GNS) gene and a viroporin (α1) gene, between the G and L genes, as is characteristic of ephemeroviruses.

Further characterization by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sequencing of the 5-UTR and partial VP1 coding region, and phylogenetic analysis classified the virus isolate as bovine enterovirus type 1 (BEV-1). No other significant pathogens were detected. This is the first report of isolation of BEV-1 in the United States from an animal with fatal enteric disease in more than 20 years.

Microscopic findings consisted of acute, multifocal meningoencephalitis with neuronal degeneration and necrosis and gliosis.

Immunohistochemical labeling for BVDV antigens with the BVD MAb 3.12F1 clone was in the cytoplasm of neurons, glial cells, ependymal epithelium, perivascular macrophages and spindle cells, smooth muscle cells and intravascular monocytes of the cerebrum and brainstem. Laboratory results support that tissue changes occurred as a result of BVDV type 2 infection. In the absence of other clinical signs associated with BVDV infection and using the microscopic and laboratory evidence presented, we propose that the BVDV type 2 isolated from this case may represent a neurovirulent strain of the virus.

The viral genomes were related in size and genome organization to vertebrate circoviruses and plant geminiviruses, but with a different position for the stem loop structure involved in rolling circle DNA replication. The replicase genes of these viruses were most closely related to those of the much smaller (similar to 1 kb) circular DNA chromosomes of plant nanoviruses.

A panel of flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were tested in blocking assays using serum samples from WNV-infected chickens and crows. Selected MAbs were further tested against serum samples from birds representing 16 species and 10 families. Serum samples were collected from birds infected with WNV or Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and from uninfected control birds. Serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were included in these experiments because WNV and SLEV are antigenically closely related, are maintained in similar transmission cycles, and have overlapping geographic distributions. The ELISA using MAb 3.1112G possibly discriminated between WNV and SLEV infections since all serum samples from WNV-infected birds and none from SLEV-infected birds were positive in this assay. Assays with MAbs 2B2 and 6B6C-1 readily detected serum antibodies in all birds infected with WNV and SLEV, respectively, and in most birds infected with the other virus. Two other MAbs partially discriminated between infections with these two viruses. Serum samples from most WNV-infected birds but no SLEV-infected birds were positive for MAb 3.67G, while almost all serum samples from SLEV-infected birds but few from WNV-infected birds were positive for MAb 6B5A-5.

197,Detection of a novel porcine Boca-like virus in the background of post-weaning porcine circovirus type 2-induced multisystem wasting syndrome,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been identified as the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the pig population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Various factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, no proven link between any of these factors and disease development has been found to date. In this study, we investigated the possible presence of other previously unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes of Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS by random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genomic sequences of torque tenovirus (TTV) and a novel parvovirus. Detection of TTV was to be expected since TTV, like PCV-2, has been found to have a high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. Through comparative nucleotide sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies, we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus with genetic relatedness to bocaviruses. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A.

We applied viral metagenomics to study the virome of lymph nodes from Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) and healthy pigs. The aim is to increase knowledge about potential viruses other than porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) involved in PMWS development, as well as knowledge about the virome of healthy individuals. A diverse viral flora with several viruses present at the same time has been observed in healthy individuals. The majority of viruses identified were small linear and circular DNA viruses such as various circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. As expected, high levels of PCV2 sequences were detected in pigs infected with PMWS, but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. In addition to DNA viruses, RNA viruses have also been identified, including a porcine pestivirus that bears close resemblance to a recently (2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the United States. The majority of viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences have also been identified in healthy pigs, but to a much lower extent than in PMWS-affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative, the very marked difference in the amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS-affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflects the very high replication of PCV2, which is known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a substantial viral flora made up largely of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these virus types will help better understand the role these ubiquitous viruses may play in swine health and disease. We also demonstrate for the first time in Europe the presence of a novel porcine pestivirus.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A. L.;Fossum, C.;Wallgren, P.;Berg, M.",2016.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0166863,1
199,A metagenomic analysis reveals the diverse microbial community of a vermicomposting system in Uganda,"Background: Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process that uses earthworms to efficiently and cost-effectively process large volumes of organic waste. In addition to increasing soil fertility, it has been proposed to increase the biomass of beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful bacteria. The aim of this study was to develop a strategy to investigate and characterize the viral as well as the bacterial composition of a vermicomposting system. Materials and Methods: The vermicomposting unit used in this study was set up at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute in Kabanyolo on the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda and fed 80% cattle manure and 20% food waste. On day 172, composting was terminated and compost samples were collected from three tiers of the unit: the top, middle, and bottom tiers. A metagenomic approach was then applied to characterize the viral and bacterial composition of the vermicomposting system. Results and Discussion: A high abundance and diversity of bacteria was found. Proteobacteria were the largest phyla in the compost (mainly alpha, gamma, and beta proteobacteria), accounting for nearly 65% of the bacterial reads in the datasets. DNA samples from several possible pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. were detected in the vermicompost, suggesting that harmful bacteria may still be present in the vermicast. Phage formed the main viral group; In addition to phages, insect viruses in particular were identified. The only animal or human virus identified was Kobuvirus. In conclusion, metagenomic analysis has been shown to be an efficient technology to characterize the microbial composition of vermicast. The data from this study contributes to a better understanding of the microbes present in this type of composting system and can help determine actions needed to safely manage manure.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A.

201,Viral metagenomic analysis of bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) in Uganda identifies new variants of porcinem parvovirus 4 and torque teno sus virus 1 and 2,"Background: As a result of rapidly growing human populations, intensification of animal production, and increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal husbandry, the interface between wildlife, livestock, and humans is expanding, with potential impacts on domestic animal and human health. Wildlife serves as a reservoir for many viruses that can occasionally lead to novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. With this in mind, we used metagenomics to examine the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal wild suid species known for migrating between national parks and farmland in Uganda. Results: Application of 454 pyrosequencing revealed the presence of torque tenosus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB hepatitis C-like virus, and a sclerotinia Hypovirulence-associated virus in sera from bush pigs. PCR assays for each specific virus in combination with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant and PPV4 in the serum samples, thereby confirming the 454 sequencing results. Conclusions: Using a viral metagenomic approach, we performed a first analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African suid. In addition, we identified new variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bush pigs. © 2012 Blomstrom et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A. L.;StÃ¥hl, K.;Masembe, C.;Okoth, E.;Okurut, A.

202,Characterization of the tonsil virus of conventional pigs and specific pathogen-free pigs,"Swine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms as well as non-infectious factors such as animal husbandry and environment. It is widely accepted that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in relation to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing in combination with viral metagenomics to characterize the viral community of porcine tonsil samples obtained from a conventional herd with respiratory tract lesions at slaughter. At the same time, samples from specifically pathogen-free pigs were analyzed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate among the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but at individual pigs. Some viruses, such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses, have been found in most pigs, while others, such as various parvoviruses and anelloviruses, have only been identified in a few pigs. In addition, the entire coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the entire genomes of two testoviruses. The results of this study will help elucidate which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and pigs with respiratory disease. This knowledge is needed for future studies on the role of viral-viral interactions in disease development.",,"BlomstrÃ¶m, A. L.;Ye, X.;Fossum, C.;Wallgren, P.;Berg, M.",2018.0,,10.3390/v10070382,1
203,Phylogenetic analysis of partial S1 and N gene sequences of isolates of infectious bronchitis virus from Italy revealed genetic diversity and recombination,"total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analyzes based on partial S1 gene sequences showed that five field viruses were grouped together with 793/B-type strains and shared 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group, and one isolate showed very close sequence relatedness ( 94.6% identity) with 624/ I charge. These two IBV types were previously identified in Italy. The other three variant isolates formed a new genotype recently discovered in many countries in Western Europe. For one of these virus variants, Italy-02, which later became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences spanning 1-300 nucleotides revealed differential clustering. Thus, three IBV variants of the new Italy-02 genotype, sharing 96.7-99.2% nucleotide identity of the S1 gene with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on the N gene sequences. The 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 along with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity in the N gene region, respectively, with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain, which had 99.3% partial N gene identity, while the other four isolates were genetically distant from them ( only 87.7–89.7% identity) and formed separate homogeneous subgroups. The results indicated that both mutational and recombination events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian isolates. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Bochkov, Y.

204,Basic research on the transmission of BSE to humans,"Prion diseases in animals and humans belong to the group of neurological diseases with amyloid deposits of the corresponding proteins. Regarding prion disease, the cellular prion protein in its abnormal isoform(s) is an essential component of prion protein aggregates found in affected tissues. In contrast to all neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, prion diseases are transmissible. Therefore, prion diseases have been termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). The diseases have been known for decades. Scrapie was first described around 1750, a case of BSE was reported in 1850, most likely a misdiagnosis, and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was described in 1920/1930. Transmission of CJD dh kuru was suspected in the early 1950s and incorrectly classified as a slow viral disease. CJD transmission posed a problem for people when transplants from CJD cases were used for treatment. Fortunately, these iatrogenic transmissions have remained limited. But with the rise of BSE and the emergence of CJD cases in the UK and some places in Europe, scientists suspected that bovine-to-human transmission may have occurred. From animal models we know of successful transmission via multiple pathways. Species barriers do not completely prevent transmission. Rather, barriers to transmission may exist that control individual susceptibility to prions. Pathways of transmission, susceptibility to transmission, identification of receptor molecules and molecular mechanisms of the transmission process are being intensively investigated. The current state of knowledge suggests that inapparent stages of prion infection simulate a (nonexistent) species barrier. This inapparent infection precedes overt disease, and therefore most research has focused on the development of highly sensitive test systems to detect minute amounts of pathological prion protein in suspected cases. The no-show should also warn us not to underestimate cases of BSE or human vCJD; currently 124 in Europe and a probable case in Hong Kong (7 March 2002). Whether BSE has spread to other parts of the world through animal food components or meat can neither be ruled out nor confirmed at this time.

206,Novel viruses in birds: fly through the ceiling or does it need a cage? Verification,"Emerging viral diseases continue to have a major global impact on humans and animals. In order to be able to take appropriate measures in the event of an outbreak of a newly emerging disease, rapid detection of the pathogen is a crucial first step. In this Review, various aspects of virus discovery are discussed, with a particular focus on recently discovered viruses in birds. Novel viruses with potentially large impacts have been discovered in domestic and wild bird species in recent years using various virus detection methods. Few studies report the detection of novel viruses in endangered bird species, although it is important to gain more knowledge about the viruses circulating in these species. Additional studies that focus on the precise role of a novel virus in disease and on the impact of a novel virus on bird populations are often lacking. Obtaining useful information about the role of these novel viruses requires intensive collaboration between different disciplines.",,"Bodewes, R.",2018.0,3,,0

209,"Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Genetic Diversity of Seal Influenza A(H10N7) Virus, Northwestern Europe","UNLABELING: Influenza A viruses are important pathogens affecting humans, domestic animals and wildlife, and these viruses occasionally cross the species barrier. In spring 2014, increased mortality in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) associated with infection with an influenza A(H10N7) virus was reported in Sweden and Denmark. Within a few months, this virus spread to seals in the coastal waters of Germany and the Netherlands, causing the deaths of thousands of animals. Genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of this seal influenza A(H10N7) virus revealed that it was most closely related to several avian influenza A(H10N7) viruses. The collection of samples from infected seals during the course of the outbreak provided a unique opportunity to follow the adaptation of the avian virus to its new seal host. Sequence data for samples collected between April 2014 and January 2015 from 41 different seals from four different countries were obtained by Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of the seal influenza A(H10N7) virus describe. The majority of the sequence variations occurred in the HA gene, and some mutations corresponded to amino acid changes not found in H10 viruses isolated from Eurasian birds. In addition, the sequence variation in the HA gene was greater at the beginning than at the end of the epidemic, when a number of the mutations observed earlier had been resolved. These results imply that when an avian influenza virus crosses the species barrier from birds to seals, amino acid changes in HA can occur rapidly and are important for the virus' adaptation to its new mammalian host. IMPORTANT: Influenza A viruses are important pathogens affecting humans, domestic animals and wildlife. In addition to the continuous circulation of influenza A viruses between different host species, cross-species transmission of influenza A viruses occasionally occurs. Wild waterfowl and shorebirds are the main reservoir for most influenza A virus subtypes, and spillover of influenza A virus from birds to humans or other mammalian species can lead to larger outbreaks. In the present study, different sequencing methods were used to elucidate the genetic changes that occurred following the introduction and subsequent spread of an avian influenza A(H10N7) virus among harbor seals of northwestern Europe using different samples collected during the outbreak. Such detailed knowledge of genetic changes required for introduction and adaptation of avian influenza A viruses to mammalian hosts is important for rapid risk assessment of such viruses shortly after they have crossed the species barrier.",,"Bodewes, R.;Zohari, S.;Krog, J.

Although feed particles are the main component of these dusts in many agricultural settings, the inflammatory responses they produce are likely to be attributed to particle-associated bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi and viruses. In this study, we performed shotgun pyrosequencing metagenome analyzes of DNA from pig cage or grain elevator dust, with comparisons to pet-free household dust. DNA sequence alignment showed that 19% and 62% of shotgun pyrosequencing metagenomic DNA sequence readings from porcine facility and household dust were porcine and human, respectively. In contrast, only 2% of such readings came from mammalian granary dust. These mammalian metagenomic shotgun readings were excluded from our analyzes of agricultural dust microbiota. The ten most prevalent bacterial taxa identified in swine facilities compared to grain silos or household dust consisted of 75%, 16%, and 42% gram-positive organisms, respectively. Four of the five most important dust genera in pig facilities were assignable (Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus and Eubacterium with a relative frequency of 4% to 19%). The relative abundances of these four genera were lower in dust from grain silos or in pet-free homes. These analyzes also highlighted the prevalence of Firmicutes (70%) at the stem level, Clostridia (44%) at the class level, and Clostridiales at the order level (41%) in pig facility dust. In summary, shotgun pyrosequencing metagenome analyzes of agricultural dusts indicate that they differ qualitatively and quantitatively at the level of microbial taxa present, and that the bioinformatic analyzes used for such studies need to be carefully designed to account for the potential contribution of non-microbial DNA, e.g of resident mammals.",,"Boissy, R.

215,Genetic characterization of bovine viral diarrhea viruses isolated from persistently infected calves born to dams vaccinated against bovine viral diarrhea virus prior to breeding,"Objective - To collect and partially characterize strains of bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDVs) isolated from persistently infected (PI) calves of vaccinated dams, determine the genetic diversity of the isolated viruses, and identify the regional distribution of genetically similar virus subpopulations. Sample population - 17 non-cytopathic (NCP) BVDVs from PI calves from 11 beef or dairy herds. Methods - Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures and BVDV-specific PCR primers were used to amplify >1,000 bases of the viral genome. Deduced sequences were used for molecular phylogenetic analysis to determine viral genotype and genogroup and to assess genetic similarity between BVDVs. Results - Analysis of the 17 NCP strains of BVDV failed to detect a viral genotype or viral genogroup whose existence has not been previously reported in the United States. One virus was classified as genotype 1, genogroup 1b, and 16 viruses were classified as genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Genotype 2 strains were genetically diverse, and genetic similarities were not apparent between viruses from geographic regions larger than a small locality. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE - Viruses isolated from flocks given a genotype 1, genogroup 1a BVDV vaccine prior to breeding were mainly genetically distinct genotype 2, genogroup 2a BVDV. Vaccination with multiple BVDV genotypes may be required to improve protection. The field strain extraction and analysis methods used in this study are applicable to the evaluation of the efficacy of current BVDV vaccines. Candidates for future vaccines are viruses that appear to be able to evade the immune response of cattle vaccinated against BVDV with existing vaccines.",,"Bolin, S. R.;Lim, A.;Grotelueschen, D.

217,Unexpected diversity and expression of avian endogenous retroviruses,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were identified and characterized in three avian genomes to gain insight into early retroviral evolution. Using the RetroTector computer program to detect relatively intact ERVs, we identified 500 ERVs in the chicken genome, 150 in the turkey genome, and 1,200 in the zebra finch genome. Previous studies suggested that endogenous alpharetroviruses were present in chicken genomes. In this analysis, a small number of alpharetroviruses were seen in the genomes of chickens and turkeys; However, these were vastly outnumbered by beta-like, gamma-like, and alphabeta proviruses. While the avian ERVs belonged to the same major groups as the mammalian ERVs, they were more heterogeneous. The beta-like viruses in particular showed an evolutionary continuum with the gradual acquisition and loss of beta-retroviral markers and a transition from beta- to alpha- and then to alpha-retroviruses. Therefore, birds appear to resemble a melting pot for early ERV evolution. Many of the ERVs were integrated in clusters on chromosomes, often near centromeres. About 25% of chicken ERVs were located in or near cellular transcription units; that's almost random. The majority of these integrations were in terms of orientation in introns. A higher than random number of integrations were >100 kb from the nearest gene. Deep sequencing studies of chick embryo fibroblasts revealed that approximately 20% of the 500 ERVs were transcribed and translated. A subset of these was also transcribed in vivo in chickens and showed tissue-specific expression patterns. SIGNIFICANCE Studies on avian endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have given us a glimpse into an earlier retroviral world.

218,Avian host range of avipoxviruses,"An overview of the occurrence of smallpoxviruses in different bird species is given. The first publications appeared in Europe around 1850. At that time smallpox was diagnosed as a clear disease entity on the basis of clinical signs, while later the detection of Bollinger inclusion bodies (1877) enabled an etiological diagnosis through microscopically visible virus aggregates. Virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and direct electron microscopy gained prominence as diagnostic tools in the 1950s. Also briefly described is avipoxvirus taxonomy, virus characteristics, clinical signs, types of prevention, and diagnostic procedures. Of the approximately 9000 bird species, approximately 232 species in 23 orders have been reported to have acquired natural smallpox virus infection. However, it is likely that many more birds are susceptible to avipoxviruses.",,"Bolte, A. L.;Meurer, J.;Kaleta, E. F.",1999.0,Oct,,0

225,Identification and full genome characterization of a novel picornavirus in Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),"Members of the Picornaviridae family are important human and animal pathogens, although few (n = 11) picornaviruses have been identified from avian sources compared to the thousands of known bird species (>10 000). This study reports metagenomic detection and full genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from fecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two out of three) and diseased (seven out of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or growth retardation syndrome shed virus in seven (88%) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank Accession No. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96%) with the partial P3 genomic region of a picornavirus recently reported in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In regions P1 and P2, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is most closely related to, but distinct from, kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. A full genome analysis revealed the presence of distinctive picornavirus amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5â€² UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified in picornaviruses of avian origin), and a conserved 48 nt ""dumbbell-like"" structure located at the 3rd -inch UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera Avihepatovirus and Kobuvirus. The general occurrence of turkey picornavirus - a new species of picornavirus - in fecal samples from healthy and diseased turkeys in Hungary and the US indicates the worldwide occurrence and endemic spread of this virus in turkey farms.

The virus was detected in seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically distinct from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), showing distant phylogenetic relatedness and shared genomic features (e.g., uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A).

229,Comparative whole genome analysis of chicken and turkey megriviruses (family Picornaviridae): long 3'-untranslated regions with a potential second open reading frame and evidence for possible recombination,"UNLABELING: Members of the family Picornaviridae are small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses that can infect various vertebrate species, including birds. One of the recently identified avian picornaviruses with a remarkably long (>9,040 nucleotides) but still incompletely sequenced genome is turkey hepatitis virus 1 (THV-1; species Melegrivirus A, genus Megrivirus), a virus associated with liver necrosis and Enteritis has been implicated in commercial turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). This report presents the results of genetic analysis of three complete genomes of megriviruses from fecal samples from chickens (chicken/B21-CHV/2012/HUN, GenBank accession number KF961186, and chicken/CHK-IV-CHV/2013/HUN, GenBank accession number KF961187) (Gallus gallus domesticus) and turkey (Turkey/B407-THV/2011/HUN, GenBank Accession No. KF961188) (Meleagris gallopavo) with the largest picornavirus genome described to date (up to 9,739 nucleotides). The close phylogenetic relationship to THV-1 in the non-structural protein coding region of the genome and the possession of the same type of internal ribosomal entry site (IVB-like) suggest that the study strains belong to the genus Megrivirus. However, the genome comparisons revealed numerous unique variations (e.g. different numbers of potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3' genome parts with different lengths of a potential second open reading frame, and multiple repeating sequence motifs in the 3' untranslated region) and heterogeneity between sequence relationships the structural and non-structural regions of the genome. These differences suggest the classification of chicken Megrivirus-like viruses into a new candidate species in the genus Megrivirus. Based on the different phylogenetic positions of chicken Megrivirus-like viruses in the structural and non-structural regions of the genome, the recombinant nature of these viruses is plausible. IMPORTANCE: Comparative genomic analysis of turkey and novel chicken Megriviruses revealed numerous unique genomic features, e.g. heterogeneous sequence relationships (possibly due to a recombination event) between the structural and non-structural regions of the genome. Our results could help us to better understand the evolution and diversity (in terms of sequence and genome layout) of picornaviruses.",,"Boros, A.;Pankovics, P.;Knowles, N.

232,Characterization of neutralization sites on circulating variant swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV): A new site is shared by SVDV and the related Coxsackie B5 virus,"Using a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), five neutralizing, conformational sites on the antigenic variant swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) currently circulating were identified. In studies of the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four described antigenic/genetic groups of SVDV showed distinguishable patterns, supporting this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, the five sites were accurately mapped and located on a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be oriented towards the outer surface of the capsid to varying degrees. Three of the five sites found in VP1, VP2 and VP3 correspond to epitopes previously identified in historical isolates as sites 1, 2a and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 258 of VP1, corresponds to a recently reported epitope and is described in this study as specific for isolates of the youngest antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and corresponds to the unique neutralizing site common to both SVDV and Coxsackie B5 viruses; it maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also contain nearby positions belonging to site 1 on VP1's BC loop, suggesting the classification of site Ia. These results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, since mAbs at the new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, while the specificity of mAbs at site IV makes them unique markers for the youngest SVDV strains.",,"Borrego, B.;Carra, E.;GarcÃ­a-Ranea, J.

233,The role of viral population diversity in the adaptation of bovine coronavirus to new host environments,"The high mutation rate of RNA viruses allows a diverse genetic population of viral genotypes to exist in a single infected host. Genetic diversity in the host could make the viral population better able to respond and adapt to a variety of selection pressures such as host switching events. Several new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples in just the past decade, showing the potential of coronaviruses as emerging human pathogens. Deep sequencing has been used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during a simulated host transition. Three bovine coronavirus-infected bovine nasal specimens were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus replicated relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non-laboratory adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced with average coverages of nearly 950x (454 sequencing) and 38,000x (Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and several point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present in the unpassaged samples but was very rare and could quickly shift to dominate the population if placed in a different environment. The insert encoding three arginine residues occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data showed that two distinct genotypes were circulating in each sample at different levels of abundance, and supports the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were 'selected' from a pre-existing pool and not by de novo Mutation and subsequent population fixation.",,"Borucki, M.

234,Capripoxvirus vaccine against livestock diseases in Africa,"Five different livestock viral diseases, lumpy skin disease (LSD), sheeppox (SPP), goatpox (GTP), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and small ruminant plague (PPR), circulate in the same regions of Africa, imposing a great burden for economic activity and public health. Although commercial vaccines against these viruses are available, the cost of implementing regular multi-disease vaccination regimens is prohibitive for most African farmers. A single, affordable, multivalent vaccine that protects against all 5 diseases simultaneously would therefore be of great benefit to the livestock industry in Africa. It could also serve as a platform for developing new vaccines of importance to other developing countries around the world. In this article we provide an overview of the economic importance of livestock farming in Africa, the pathogens responsible for RVF, PPR, SPP, GTP and LSD and the vaccination strategies currently used to combat them. We then review the experience with the development of attenuated capripoxvirus vaccines against LSD, SPP and GTP and recombinant capripoxvirus vector vaccines against RVF and PPR. We conclude the article by presenting the rationale for a single, multivalent capripoxvirus vector vaccine that would protect against all five livestock diseases and describe the approach a consortium of Canadian and South African researchers are taking to develop such a vaccine.

237,"Genetic characterization and codon usage bias of full-length hepatitis E virus sequences shed new light on genotypic distribution, host restriction and genome evolution","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) occurs in different species and ecological niches. It has been divided into 4 major mammalian genotypes. In this study, 3 new full-length porcine HEV genomes were sequenced and the results revealed no distinct host determinant compared to human isolates belonging to the same genotype. Nucleotide composition and codon usage bias were determined to characterize HEV host restriction and genome evolution. A particular nucleotide bias was observed for A and C nucleotides in all HEV genotypes. Apart from the hypervariable region ORF1 and the overlapping region ORF2/3, no nucleotide bias was observed between the 3 codon positions. It has also been shown that CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in HEV as in most RNA viruses. The effective number of codons used in the HEV genome was high, indicating a lack of codon bias. A correspondence analysis of the relative usage of synonymous codons was performed and showed that the evolution of HEV is not driven by geographic or host factors but is representative of HEV phylogeny. These results confirm that the evolution of the HEV genome is mainly based on mutational pressure. Natural selection, which involves, for example, fine-tuning of translational kinetics and escape from the host immune system, may also play a role in shaping the HEV genome, particularly in the hypervariable region of ORF1 and the overlapping region of ORF2/3. These regions could be involved in host restriction.

Twenty-nine percent of the polymorphic sites found in HEV from the human sample were conserved throughout infection of the heterologous host. Transmission of HEV quasispecies between species is the result of genomic negative selection pressure for random mutations that can be deleterious to the viral population. The intrahost nucleotide diversity of HEV was found to be in the low range of other human RNA viruses but correlated with values found for zoonotic viruses. Human-pig HEV transmission does not appear to be modulated by host-specific mutations, suggesting that adaptation is mainly regulated by environmental drivers. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Bouquet, J.;Cheval, J.;RogÃ©e, S.;Pavio, N.;Eloit, M.",2012.0,,10.1128/jvi.06843-11,0
239,Whole genome deep pyrosequence analysis of duck influenza A virus development in pig cells,"We studied the subpopulation level evolution of a duck influenza A virus isolate during passage in porcine tracheal cells. The whole genomes of the A/mallard/Netherlands/10-Nmkt/1999 strain and its porcine cell-passaged progeny were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with a coverage depth of several hundred to several thousand reads at each point. This allowed the characterization of defined minority subpopulations of gene segments 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 present in the original isolate. These minority subpopulations ranged from 9.5% (for segment 2) to 46% (for segment 4) of their respective gene segments in parental stock. They were likely contributed by one or more viruses circulating in the same area, at the same time, and in the same or a sympatric host species. The minority subpopulations of segments 3, 4, and 5 died out upon viral passage in pig cells, while the minority subpopulations of segments 2, 7, and 8 completely replaced their majority counterparts. The virus passaged with porcine cells was therefore a three-segment reassortant and also contained point mutations in segments 3 and 4. The passaged virus was more homogeneous than the parental strain, with only 17 single nucleotide minority polymorphisms present overall at a frequency of over 5% of the genome . Although limited to one sample here, this deep-sequencing approach highlights the evolutionary versatility of influenza viruses, using their genetic diversity, propensity for mixed infections, and rearrangement to adapt to a new niche of the host environment.",,"Bourret, V.;Croville, G.;Mariette, J.;Klopp, C.;Bouchez, O.;Tiley, L.;Guerin, J.

240,Complete genome-based molecular characterization of encephalitis-associated bovine astroviruses,"Novel species of astroviruses have recently been identified in connection with bovine neurological diseases. These viruses include the Bovine Astrovirus CH13 (BoAstV CH13), which was detected in a cow with encephalitis in Switzerland. Molecular testing by a combination of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) showed that astrovirus infection accounts for about a quarter of cases of bovine viral encephalitis of unknown etiology. However, whether these animals were infected with BoAstV CH13 or other astrovirus species had yet to be investigated. In the present study, we sequenced the entire Astrovirus genome in brain tissue from eight RT-PCR and/or ISH positive cattle. Phylogenetic comparison of the genomic RNA and the encoded non-structural and structural proteins revealed that all of these astrovirus strains were very similar to BoAstV CH13, as well as a bovine encephalitis strain (BoAstV NeuroS1) reported from the US, and differed significantly from other previously reported astroviruses . Conserved 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) have been predicted to have distinct secondary RNA structures that likely play a role in viral RNA replication and/or protein translation. Based on these data, we propose that BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 represents a novel genotypic species within the Mammastrovirus genus. The high degree of similarity between the strains and their relative distance to other genotype species suggest that some astroviruses have evolved to acquire factors that specifically contribute to neuroinvasion.

241,Neurotropic astrovirus in cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis in Europe,"Encephalitis is a commonly diagnosed condition in cattle with neurological disorders. Many affected animals show a non-purulent inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative agent remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. In addition, BoAstV RNA was detected by reverse transcription PCR and in situ hybridization in about a quarter (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was mainly found in neurons and at the site of pathology. These results support the assumption that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and one human patient.

243,viral metagenomic approach to a non-metagenomic experiment: Mining next-generation sequencing datasets from porcine DNA identified several porcine parvoviruses for a retrospective assessment of viral infections,"Shot-gun next generation sequencing (NGS) on whole DNA extracted from samples collected from mammals often produces reads that are not mapped to the host's reference genome (i.e., unmapped reads) and are usually identified as by-products of the experiments are discarded. In this study, we mined Ion torrent reads obtained by sequencing DNA isolated from archived blood samples from 100 performance-tested Italian large white pigs. Two reduced representation libraries were prepared from two DNA pools each constructed from 50 equimolar DNA samples. Bioinformatic analyzes were performed to identify unmapped reads on the reference pig genome obtained from the two NGS datasets. In silico analyzes included read-mapping and sequence assembly approaches for viral metagenomic analysis using the NCBI Viral Genome Resource. Our approach identified sequences matching several viruses of the Parvoviridae family: porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2), PPV4, PPV5 and PPV6, and porcine bocavirus 1-H18 isolate (PBoV1-H18). The presence of these viruses was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of individual DNA samples. PPV2, PPV4, PPV5, PPV6, and PBoV1-H18 were all identified in samples collected in 1998-2007, 1998-2000, 1997-2000, 1998-2004, and 2003, respectively. For most of these viruses (PPV4, PPV5, PPV6 and PBoV1-H18), previous studies reported their first emergence much later (5 to more than 10 years) than our identification period and in different geographical areas. Our study provided a retrospective analysis of apparently asymptomatic parvovirus-infected pigs and provided information that may be important to define the occurrence and prevalence of different parvoviruses in southern Europe. This study demonstrated the potential of mining NGS datasets not originally derived from metagenomics experiments for viral metagenomics analysis in a livestock species.",,"Bovo, S.;Mazzoni, G.;Ribani, A.;Utzeri, V.

244,"Molecular characterization of Menangelvirus, a novel paramyxovirus infecting pigs, fruit bats and humans","Menangle virus (MenV), isolated in August 1997 after an outbreak of a reproductive disease in a pig pen in New South Wales, is the second previously unclassified member of the Paramyxoviridae family to be identified in Australia since 1994. Similar to Hendra virus (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit bats (fruit bats) of the genus Pteropus. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses, and to facilitate virus classification, a cDNA subtraction method was used to obtain virus-specific cDNA from MenV-infected cells. The cloning and sequencing of the products allowed the determination of the entire sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F and HN genes. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for each gene with members of the Paramyxoviridae family, determination of the P gene mRNA editing strategy, and phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that MenV is a novel member of the Rubulavirus genus. However, the deduced protein sequence of MenV HN showed only limited sequence homology compared to binding proteins of other paramyxoviruses. Major differences within the amino acid residues considered important determinants of neuraminidase activity suggest that MenV HN is unlikely to possess the same level of neuraminidase activity characteristic of other rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins. © 2001 Academic Press.",,"Bowden, T.

246,Analysis of the host cell differential nuclear proteome induced by attenuated and virulent hemorrhagic arenavirus infection,"Arenaviruses are important emerging pathogens and include a number of hemorrhagic fever viruses that are classified as NIAID Category A Priority Pathogens and CDC Potential Biothreats. Infection of guinea pigs with New World Arenavirus Pichindé virus (PICV) was used as a level 2 biosafety model for Lassa virus. Despite continued research, little is known about the molecular basis of the pathogenesis, which has hampered the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Modulating the host response is a potential strategy for treating infectious diseases. We have previously studied the global host response to attenuated and fatal arenavirus infections using high-throughput immunoblotting and kinomics approaches. In this report, we describe the differential nuclear proteomes of a murine cell line induced by mock infection and infection with attenuated and lethal variants of PICV, analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot identification using tandem mass spectrometry revealed the involvement of a range of proteins that regulate inflammation via possible modulation of NF-κB activity and several heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins. Pathway analysis revealed a potential role for the transcription factor XBP-1, a transcription factor involved in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) expression; differential DNA binding activity was revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and differences in surface MHC II expression were seen after PICV infection. These data are consistent with the results of several previous studies and highlight potential differences between transcriptional and translational regulation. This study provides a number of differentially expressed targets for further research and suggests that key events in pathogenesis can be identified early in infection.

247,Genomic sequences of prototype Australian bluetongue virus serotypes reveal global relationships and possible routes of entry into Australia,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by mosquitoes (Culicoides spp.). It causes disease mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and other species. BTV has spread to northern Europe, causing disease in sheep and cattle. The introduction of new serotypes, changes in vector species, and climate change have all contributed to these changes. Ten BTV serotypes have been isolated in Australia with no apparent associated disease. Simplified methods for preferential isolation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and template preparation enabled high-throughput sequencing of the 10 genome segments of all Australian BTV prototype serotypes. The phylogenetic analysis reinforced the previously characterized western and eastern topotypes, but revealed unique features of several Australian BTVs. Many of the Australian BTV genome segments (Seg-) were closely related and clustered within the eastern topotypes. A new Australian topotype for Seg-5 (NS1) was identified, with taxa spread across multiple serotypes and over time. Seg-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -9 and -10 of BTV_2_AUS_2008 were most closely related to the related segments of viruses from Taiwan and Asia and not to other Australian viruses, leading the conclusion supports that BTV_2 recently entered Australia. The Australian BTV_15_AUS_1982 prototype proved unusual among Australian BTV isolates, with Seg-3 and -8 being distantly related to other BTV sequences from all serotypes. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Boyle, D.

248,The evolution of human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006: A full genome study,"Background: Knowledge of the complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza A viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding strain evolution and migration. At present, only a few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available, and there are few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses. We have studied the evolution of circulating H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, we have analyzed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterized 24 complete genomes. Results: H3N2 was the predominant strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000-2001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002-2003. After years of little genetic change in the H1N1 viruses, the 2005-2006 season revealed H1N1 with greater variability than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 is likely to be the dominant strain again soon. In general, the influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages have also been observed circulating together within the same season. Evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, particularly with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002-2003. Evolutionary periods of stasis have also been observed, which may indicate well-suited viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses was also influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were affected by strong positive selection pressure. Antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic alterations during the study period, probably because site A was masked by glycosylation. Substitutions at CTL epitopes in the genes encoding neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and particularly the nucleoprotein (NP) have been observed. The N-linked glycosylation pattern varied over the study period and the H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten predicted sequences in HA, the highest level of glycosylation observed in this study period. Conclusion: The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to characterize the evolution of complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a seven-year period from 1999-2006. More accurate knowledge of the circulating strains could have implications for predicting the following season's strains and thus for better matching of vaccine composition.",,"Bragstad, K.;Nielsen, L.

249,Genomic evolution of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) isolates revealed by deep sequencing,"Most studies on the development of PRRSV have been limited to a specific region of the viral genome. A thorough genome-wide understanding of the impact of different mechanisms on shaping PRRSV genetic diversity is still lacking. For this purpose, deep sequencing was used to obtain genomic sequences of a diverse set of 16 isolates from a Hong Kong region with a complex epidemiological record of PRRSV. Genome assemblies and phylogenetic typing revealed the co-circulation of strains of both genotypes (type 1 and type 2) with different Nsp2 deletion patterns and different evolutionary lineages (""high fever""-like and local endemic type). Recombination analyzes revealed genomic breakpoints in both structural and non-structural regions of the genomes of both genotypes, with evidence for many recombination events originating from a common ancestor. In addition, the high coverage per nucleotide allowed the characterization of smaller variants arising from the quasi-species of each strain. Overall, 0.56-2.83% of the sites turned out to be polymorphic with respect to related consensus genomes. The distribution of minor variants across each genome was not uniform, indicating the influence of selective forces. The proportion of variants capable of causing an amino acid change in their respective codons ranged between 25-67%, with many predicted to be non-detrimental. Low-frequency quenching variants have also been discovered, presenting a possible mechanism for their sudden occurrence, as mentioned in previous reports.",,"Brar, M. S.;Shi, M.;Hui, R. K.;Leung, F.

250,Border disease in cattle,"Within the family Flaviviridae, viruses within the genus Pestivirus, such as border disease virus (BDV) of sheep, can cause large economic losses in livestock. Originally, the taxonomic classification of pestiviruses was based on the host species from which they were isolated, but many pestiviruses are now known to exhibit broad species tropism. This review provides an overview of BDV infection in cattle. The clinical, haematological and pathological-anatomical findings in cattle transiently or permanently infected with BDV are broadly similar to those of cattle infected with the closely related pestivirus Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV). Accordingly, diagnosis of BDV infection can be difficult as it must be distinguished from various bovine pestiviruses. The latter is very relevant in countries with control programs to eradicate BVDV in bovids, since in most cases pestivirus infections in sheep, which serve as reservoirs for BDV, are not included in the eradication programme. Transmission of BDV between sheep and cattle occurs regularly, but BDV in cattle appears to be of little general concern. Nonetheless, BDV outbreaks at farm or local level can be very costly.",,"Braun, U.;Hilbe, M.;Peterhans, E.;Schweizer, M.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.01.006,0

We isolated influenza virus (H1N2) from a pig in a backyard production farm in central Chile and showed that the HA gene was identical to that in a previous report. Its HA and neuraminidase genes were most similar to human H1 and N2 viruses from the early 1990s, and the inner segments resembled influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo and was transmitted in ferrets by droplet infection. Antigenic it differed from other swine viruses. Analysis of hemagglutination inhibition suggested that antibody titers against the Chilean swine H1N2 virus were reduced in those born after 1990. Further studies are needed to characterize the potential human risk and ecology of swine influenza in South America.",,"Bravo-Vasquez, N.;Karlsson, E.

253,Shotgun metagenomics of biological dyes with ultra-deep DNA sequencing,"Detailed molecular analysis of blood or other biological evidence at a crime scene is often hampered by the low quantity and quality of extractable DNA. In most cases, however, determining the origin and composition of a stain is a prerequisite for the final clarification of criminal proceedings. standard methods, e.g. B. Amplification of DNA followed by microsatellite typing or mitochondrial DNA sequencing, are often not sensitive enough to provide sufficient and conclusive data. We applied ultra-deep DNA sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing technology to a whole genome amplification (WGA) environmental biology stain that was unsuccessfully analyzed using standard post-WGA methods. However, with the combination of WGA and 454 pyrosequencing, we were able to generate 7242 individual sequences with an average length of 195 bp. A total of 1,441,971 bp DNA sequences were generated and compared to public DNA sequence databases. Using RepeatMasker and BLAST (Basic Logical Alignment Search Tool) searches against known microbial and mammalian genomes, it was possible to determine the metagenomic composition of the dye, ie 4.2% bacterial DNA, 0.3% viral DNA, 2,7 % fungal DNA, 10.3% repetitive mammalian DNA, 0.9% porcine DNA, 0.13% human DNA and 81.5% DNA of unknown origin.

July 2008","Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox and zoster, was the first human herpesvirus to be fully sequenced and the first for which vaccines were approved and widely used. Three groups have published genotyping schemes based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and identified five distinct phylogenetic clades between them, with two additional putative clades. The sequencing of over 23 complete VZV genomes from around the world further refined the phylogenetic distinctions between SNP genotypes. Widespread surveillance in countries where the varicella vaccine is now used and the difficulties arising from three unique genotyping approaches prompted an international meeting where a common nomenclature based on phylogenetic clades was agreed. In this article we review the original genotyping schemes and discuss the basis for a new common nomenclature for VZV strains. We propose a minimum set of SNPs that we recommend for genotyping these viruses. Finally, we propose criteria by which novel clades can be recognized.",,"Breuer, J.;Grose, C.;Norberg, P.;Tipples, G.;Schmid, D. S.",2010.0,,10.1099/vir.0.017814-0,0
255,Sequencing of the nucleocapsid protein gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus confirms that this virus is a coronavirus related to human coronavirus 229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"The nucleotide sequence of 1.7 kbp cDNA encompassing the region closest to the 3' end of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) genome was independently determined for two European isolates of PEDV. Almost identical results were obtained for the two isolates derived from cases of PEDV infection in Belgium and Great Britain in 1977 and 1987, respectively. The sequences contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1323 nucleotides (nt) that showed moderate identity with the nucleocapsid (N) gene of other coronaviruses. The closest similarity, both at the nucleic acid and protein levels, was to human coronavirus 229E. However, the PEDV-N gene was significantly larger than that of human 229E and swine transmissible gastroenteritis viruses. This reflects the presence of a putative insertion of approximately 135 nt located towards the middle of the N gene. A second 336 nt ORF, possibly encoding a leucine-rich protein similar to but shorter than the bovine coronavirus internal protein, was found in the PEDV-N gene. Several RNA motifs typical of coronaviruses have also been observed. These results confirm the earlier preliminary classification of PEDV as a coronavirus.",,"Bridgen, A.;Duarte, M.;Tobler, K.;Laude, H.;Ackermann, M.",1993.0,,,0

257,Prberprüfung der weltweiten Verbreitung des Maul- und Klauenseuche-Virus von 2007 bis 2014,"The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus affects farm animals worldwide. There are seven different serotypes, each with a variety of topotypes, genetic lines, and strains. Some lineages have distinct characteristics that can contribute to sporadic spread beyond their recognized endemic areas. The aim of this study was to review the main epidemiological events of FMD that occurred worldwide between 2007 and 2014. Serious epidemics caused by O/Asia/Mya-98 lineage foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in Japan and South Korea in 2010 were previously disease-free. In India, where FMD is endemic, the most important event was the reappearance in 2008 of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage. Remarkably, this lineage, usually restricted to India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, was also found in Saudi Arabia and Libya in 2013 and caused multiple outbreaks in Tunisia and Algeria in 2014-2015. In January 2011, FMD-positive wild boar were found in Bulgaria, where the disease was last seen in 1996, followed by 12 outbreaks in livestock infected with FMD O/ME-SA/PanAsia2. In 2012, FMDV SAT2 caused outbreaks in Egypt and the Palestinian Territories. Another significant event was the appearance of FMDV Asia1 Sindh-08 in the Middle East. In South America, an outbreak of FMD serotype O, topotype Euro-SA, was reported in Paraguay in 2011, which was then vaccinated to be FMD-free. Lessons learned from past events point to the need for an integrated strategy that includes coordinated global and regional efforts to control and monitor FMD. Specific local characteristics related to the host, environment and virus that condition the occurrence of FMD should be carefully considered and taken into account to adapt appropriate strategies into local plans. In this overview we have compiled relevant epidemiological FMD events to provide a global overview of the current situation.

259,Nonmaternal transmission is the major transmission route of ovine lentivirus in a flock of sheep: A molecular epidemiological study,"Transmission of ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV), a lentivirus of sheep, occurs through both maternal and non-maternal means. At present, the contribution of each route of transmission to the overall prevalence of OPPV in herds is poorly understood, as previous serological-epidemiological studies have not been able to accurately trace routes of transmission within an infected herd. In this study, the amount of maternal OPP transmission in a naturally infected ewe flock was assessed by applying molecular analyzes to proviral sequences derived from peripheral blood leukocytes of OPP-positive mother-daughter pairs (N=40). Both proviral envelope (env) and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences were used separately and combined in the following 2 sequence analysis methods: phylogenetic analysis and pairwise distance calculations. True maternal transmission events were defined as agreement in 2 of the 2 sequence analysis methods. Using this criterion, proviral env sequences resulted in a maternal transmission frequency of 14.3% and proviral LTR sequences in a maternal transmission frequency of 10%. Both proportions of maternal transmission differed significantly from equality (P < 0.0001). This indicates that the remaining 85.7-90% of daughters become infected through non-maternal transmission. This is also the first study to calculate the proviral OPP change rate for the env gene and the LTR promoter. Accurately defining OPPV transmission routes provides important epidemiological data that support management aimed at reducing herd transmission and virus dose. © 2010.",,"Broughton-Neiswanger, L.

260,Antigenic and genetic analysis of H1N1 influenza A virus from European swine,"H1N1 influenza A viruses, which have been isolated from pigs in Europe since 1981, were examined both antigenically and genetically and compared with H1N1 viruses from other sources. Swine and avian H1N1 viruses can be divided into three groups: avian viruses, classical swine viruses and ""bird-like"" swine viruses. Little or no reactivity of swine ""bird-like"" viruses in HI assays with monoclonal antibodies against swine classical viruses was associated with amino acid substitutions within antigenic sites of hemagglutinin (HA). The phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that classical swine viruses from European swine are most similar to each other and closely related to North American swine strains, while the ""bird-like"" swine viruses cluster with avian viruses. ""Bird-like"" viruses introduced into pigs in the UK in 1992 appear to have originated directly from strains in pigs in continental Europe at the time. The HA genes of the swine viruses examined had undergone limited variation at antigenic sites and also contained fewer potential glycosylation sites compared to human H1N1 viruses. The HA showed an antigenic drift that was more pronounced in ""bird-like"" swine viruses than in classical swine strains. Genetic analyzes of two recent ""bird-like"" swine viruses revealed that all RNA segments are most closely related to those of avian influenza A viruses.",,"Brown, I. H.;Ludwig, S.;Olsen, C.

The results confirmed that subgroup C viruses were more closely related to HMPV than to the other AMPV subgroups in the study. This was consistent with previous findings on partial genome sequences. Closer relationships between AMPV-A, B and D were also evident in the majority of the results. Three metapneumovirus ""clusters"" HMPV, AMPV-C and AMPV-A, B and D were further supported by codon bias and phylogenetics.

263,"Viral meningitis epidemics and a single, recent, recombinant, and anthroponotic origin of swine vesicular disease virus","Background and Objectives: Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is a close relative of the human enterovirus B serotype, coxsackievirus B5. As the etiological agent of an important emerging animal disease, several studies have attempted to explain its origin. However, some key questions remain, including the full biological lineage of the virus and its geographic and temporal origin. Methods: We sequenced near-complete genomes from 27 SVDV and 13 coxsackievirus B5 specimens, all originally isolated between 1966 and 2006, and analyzed them in conjunction with existing sequences and historical information. Results: While analyzes involving 24 additional nearly complete SVDV genomic sequences show clear evidence of intra-SVDV recombination, all 51 SVDV isolates remain monophyletic. This supports the hypothesis of a single anthroponotic transmission origin. Analysis of individual coding and non-coding regions supports that SVDV is of recombinant origin between coxsackievirus B5 and another enterovirus B serotype, most likely coxsackievirus A9. Extensive Bayesian sequence-based analysis of the time of the most recent common ancestor of all analyzed sequences places this within a few years of 1961. Epidemiological evidence points to China as an origin, but there are no available samples to test this conclusively. Conclusions and Implications: The historical investigation and clinical aspects of the enterovirus B serotypes involved put the current results in line with a hypothesis that SVDV transmutes through co-infection, recombination, and a single anthroponotic event during large viral meningitis epidemics 1960/ 1961 including the ancestral serotypes.

Analysis of the mean incubation time at 20°C relative to time at 28°C (tÌ„20, tÌ„28) for each agD clone compared to the range of similar data for wild-type viruses allowed us to define 4 classes of agD -Mutants: (1) mutants equally affected at both temperatures, (2) cold-sensitive mutants in Drosophila (csD), (3) heat-sensitive mutants in Drosophila (tsD), and (4) mutants whose mean incubation time could not be reduced to either 20 can still be estimated at 28°C. All agD mutants are listed. The majority of them were also ts in chick embryo cells (CEC) and some were divided into complementation groups. Some correlations have been noted. For example, the agD mutants that were ts+ in CEC were often (7 out of 12) weakly cold-sensitive in Drosophila. Those tsD mutants that were also ts in CEC all belonged to complementation group I (L protein). True csD mutants, whose incubation time divergence increased regularly with wt and which were also ts in CEC, all belonged to group I except one, which belonged to group V (G protein). Three mutants fell into a distinct subclass of csD mutants characterized by a defect in CO2 sensitivity symptom expression below a certain temperature. One of these was further characterized and was in complementation group V. Some fourth class mutants were examined for their ability to invade flies. He was more or less affected. Among these mutants, mutations have been assigned to L, N, and G proteins independently of this phenomenon, suggesting that different physiological defects are involved. A comparison of the phenotypes in Drosophila of some of the agD mutants with other members of the vesiculovirus family was performed. The analogy of sigma rhabdovirus with tsD mutants is also reported.",,"Brun, G.",1991.0,,10.1016/0923-2516(91)90018-x,0

267,"Bovine herpesvirus 4 genome: cloning, mapping, and strain variation analysis","The restriction map of the genome of bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV-4) (V. test strain) was generated for the restriction enzymes EcoRI, BamHI and HindIII by analysis of clones from a lambda library (Sau3AI partial digest) and from a plasmid library (EcoRI fragments) . A genome unit was defined as the length of the unique central portion flanked at both ends by one of the terminal tandem repeats, termed polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA), estimated at 113 ± 2 kbp. A restriction map of test strain V prDNA revealed internal 200 bp tandem repeats of different sequences. This region in the prDNA was highly polymorphic between BHV-4 strains, even in a viral DNA preparation from a plaque-purified strain. The right-hand junction between the repeated and unique sequences of the genome occurred at an almost constant location, but the left-hand junction contained a modified prDNA and was variable between BHV-4 strains. The unique central part of the genome was very similar among the four strains considered, with some variations due to the presence or absence of a restriction site and four length variations were observed, located at positions 0.006 to 0.034 (left end), 0.211 to 0.225, 0.864 to 0.881 and 0.962 to 0.984 (right end).

268,The ancient evolutionary history of polyomaviruses,"Polyomaviruses are a family of DNA tumor viruses known to infect mammals and birds. To probe the deeper evolutionary history of the family, we used a combination of viral metagenomics, bioinformatics, and structural modeling approaches to identify and characterize fish and arthropod-associated polyomavirus sequences. Analyzes based on the divergent new sequences indicate that polyomaviruses have gradually co-evolved with their animal hosts for at least half a billion years. Phylogenetic analyzes of single polyomavirus genes suggest that some modern polyomavirus species arose after ancient recombination events involving distantly related polyomavirus lineages. The improved evolutionary model provides a useful platform for the development of a more accurate taxonomic classification system for the Polyomaviridae virus family.",,"Buck, C.

270,"Rift Valley fever seroprevalence and abortion rates in livestock in Kisoro District, Southwest Uganda (2016): A prerequisite for zoonotic infection","Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is classified as a viral hemorrhagic fever and is endemic to East and West Africa. RVF is caused by an arthropod-borne virus (RVFV); The disease is zoonotic and affects human and animal health and international trade. In livestock it leads to abortion, while human infection occurs through close contact with infected animals or animal products. Methods: A quantitative observational study with stratified sampling was conducted in the western region of Uganda. Blood samples and abortion events from 1000 farm animals (goats, sheep and cattle) were collected and recorded. The serum was analyzed for RVFV IgG reactive antibodies using a competitive ELISA assay. Results: The overall RVFV seroprevalence was 10.4% (104/1000). Cattle had the highest seroprevalence (7%), followed by sheep (2.2%) and goats (1.2%). The species-specific RVFV seroprevalence was highest in cattle (20.5%), followed by sheep (6.8%) and goats (3.6%). RVFV seroprevalence was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the northern highlands (21.8%) than in the southern lowlands (3.7%). The overall prevalence of miscarriage was (17.4%), sheep had the highest prevalence of miscarriage (7.8%), followed by goats (6.3%) and cattle (3.3%). The species-specific abortion prevalence was highest in sheep (24.1%), followed by goats (18.8%) and 9.7% in cattle. Conclusion: RVFV is endemic in Kisoro District and livestock in the highland areas are more likely to be exposed to RVFV infection than those in the southern lowlands. Livestock outbreaks will most likely lead to zoonotic infection in Kisoro District.",,"Budasha, N. H.;Gonzalez, J. P.;Sebhatu, T. T.;Arnold, E.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1596-8,0
271,Molecular analysis of H7 avian influenza viruses from Australia and New Zealand: genetic diversity and relationships from 1976 to 2007,"The complete genome sequencing of 11 Australian and 1 New Zealand avian influenza A virus isolates (all subtype H7) has allowed comparison of the sequences of each of the genome segments with those of other avian influenza A viruses of the H7 subtype. Inferences about phylogenetic relationships for each segment were used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment shows that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with long-term independent development, which in this case is associated with geographic regions. Based on analysis of the other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three additional geographic regions were confirmed for which similar monophyletic clades were observed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of the neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results, coupled with the occurrence of five different neuraminidase subtype combinations (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance host(s) is almost exclusively associated with Australia . The single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool giving rise to a variety of reassortants rather than the existence of a small number of stable viral clones. This evolutionary pattern likely occurs in each of the above regions.",,"Bulach, D.;Halpin, R.;Spiro, D.;Pomeroy, L.;Janies, D.;Boyle, D. B.",2010.0,Oct,,0
272,Influence of hepatitis C virus 3-untranslated region on IRES-dependent and Cap-dependent translation initiation,"Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA is directed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 inch untranslated region (5-UTR), and the HCV-3 UTR enhances IRES activity. Since the HCV 3″-UTR has a unique structure among 3″-UTRs, we examined a possible communication between the 5″ and the 3″-UTR of HCV during translation using chimeric reporter RNAs. We show that translation driven by the HCV IRES and the HCV-like IRES of porcine technovirus (PTV), which belongs to a completely different family of viruses (picornaviruses), or the EMCV IRES, is also mediated by the HCV-3 UTR is enhanced or by a poly(A) tail in different cell types. © 2010 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.",,"Bung, C.;Bochkaeva, Z.;Terenin, I.;Zinovkin, R.;Shatsky, I.

This is particularly evident with data derived from modern high-throughput DNA sequencing, where errors can result in sequences being incorrectly assigned to new taxa instead of being matched to existing, observed taxa. We consider a spectrum of methods to address this problem, with a particular focus on fitting a parametric mixture model and deleting the component with the highest diversity; We also consider the data to be left-censored, effectively clustering two or more low-frequency counts. We find that these purely statistical “post-processing” corrections are highly dependent on the underlying assumptions, but that such methods can still be useful.",,"Bunge, J.;BÃ¶hning, D.;Allen, H.;Foster, J.

274,Clinical and pathological characterization of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N8 in commercial turkeys in southern Indiana,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a systemic fatal poultry disease caused by multiple subtypes of influenza A virus and classified based on serological responses to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface glycoproteins. In January 2016, a new subtype of HPAI-H7N8 was diagnosed in a flock of commercial turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in southern Indiana. Clinical signs and history included increased mortality, dyspnea, head tremors, recumbency, and sleepy or unaware birds. Postmortem examination of six recently dead birds revealed reddish mucus in the choanae and trachea and marked pulmonary edema. Histologic lesions in the brain included severe, multifocal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with foci of malacia, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. All anatomical sites of the brain were affected, although histological changes in the cerebellum were considered mild. Other histological lesions included pulmonary congestion and edema, splenic congestion and lymphoid depletion, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels within the spleen, and multifocal acinar necrosis of the pancreas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was weakly positive for influenza A in the brain; IHC was negative in other tissues tested. The clinical and pathologic features of this case were consistent with previously published material on HPAI and are additional to cases of known or suspected mutation of a low pathogenic virus to a highly pathogenic virus.",,"Burcham, G.

Type A miliary necrotic foci and nuclear inclusion bodies were observed on CAM and in embryonic livers and spleens. In chick embryo fibroblast tissue cultures, type A syncytia, giant cells and nuclei appeared. These features, along with biochemical and biophysical properties described in another article, allowed the HSIS virus to be classified as a herpes virus. No serological cross-reaction was observed between HSIS virus on the one hand and infectious laryngotracheitis virus, Marek's virus and 5 non-avian herpesviruses on the other hand. The HSIS virus is therefore considered a new avian herpes virus.

278,bovine adenoviruses. III. Division into two subgroups using immunodiffusion tests,"Bovine subgroup II adenoviruses, actually represented by the officially recognized serotypes 4 to 8, possess soluble antigens that do not cross-react with either classical mastadenovirus (human or bovine subgroup I) or aviadenovirus antigens or their respective antibodies in immunodiffusion assays. Previously, small amounts of the antigen reactive with the classic mastadenovirus group were detected in bovine subgroup II adenoviruses by cross-complement fixation. However, no bovine subgroup II specific adenovirus antigen was detected in classical mastadenoviruses. So far, the serodiagnosis of bovine adenoviral infections has been severely hampered by ignoring these facts, which has led to a severe underestimation of the frequency of such infections. We propose a third genus, Paramastadenovirus, within the family Adenoviridae, including currently known and future strains, that mainly contain the novel group-reactive soluble antigen shown here.",,"Burki, F.;Hinaidy, B.;Bockmann, J.",1979.0,,,0
279,Classification as a separate equine herpesvirus of isolate 53/69 from equine coital rash,"During an outbreak of equine coital rash (ECE), a virus strain designated ECE 53/69 was isolated from a vaginal swab. It induced plaques, polykaryotic giant cells and Cowdry type A nuclear inclusion bodies in horse cell cultures. The replication of ECE 53/69 was completely inhibited by IUDR. It proved sensitive to ether, trypsin, heat and low pH. All of these features, as well as the electron microscopic data described elsewhere, allowed the strain to be classified as a herpesvirus. That it was an equine herpesvirus was demonstrated by natural and experimental infections in horses and by replication occurring exclusively in equine cell cultures. Equine cytomegaloviruses also replicate exclusively in equine cells. However, they do so much more slowly and remain cell-bound. ECE 53/69, in contrast, causes a very rapid cpe and is released into the tc medium at a high titer. Equine rhinopneumonitis virus differs from ECE by replication in a broad spectrum of heterologous cells, lack of cross-neutralization, cross-complement fixation, and different clinical manifestations. ECE 53/69 is thus a separate equine herpes virus species.",,"Burki, F.;Pichler, L.;Sibalin, M.",1973.0,,,0

283,Influenza A virus subtypes in wild birds in north-eastern Spain (Catalonia),"Since the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in 2005, many surveillance programs for poultry and wild birds have been initiated worldwide. This study describes for the first time the detection of different subtypes of avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds in the western Mediterranean (Catalonia, northeastern Spain). During a 3-year period (from mid-2006 to mid-2009), 1374 birds from 16 different families were examined and a total of 62 AIV were detected using a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay. AIV have been recorded more frequently in the families Anatidae, Phoenicopteridae, Rallidae and Laridae. Of the 62 positive samples, 28 AIV could be isolated in embryonated eggs. All isolates were subtyped by hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition techniques and 10 different hemagglutinins (HA) and 7 neuraminidases (NA) were found in 13 different subtype combinations. The most common combinations were H4N6 (22.2%) and H1N1 (18.5%). The HA and NA gene sequences of different AIV subtypes were compared and aligned with the available AIV strains from genome databases. Our studies of AIV phylogenetic analysis revealed that all AIV genes sequenced from wild birds in northeastern Spain were clustered within Eurasian bird clades, including the sequences of the H8, N4, and N5 genes, which are found in Europe for the first time were analyzed.

After a brief introduction to the subject, the author's negative results on inhibitors are commented on. Then the special features of the three methods examined are discussed using the NADH determination as a measure of the silaidase activity. The spectrofluorometric measurement of NADH concentration is a more sensitive and convenient method than spectrophotometry, although less sensitive than that based on bioluminescence. Sialidase activity is generally higher in type A than type B influenza virus; However, some differences were noted between the three subtypes A analyzed. In addition, thermal stability and stability to changes in pH are higher for duck influenza viruses, followed by those of humans and finally by those of pigs. O-acetyl terase of type C influenza virus shows broad specificity; it acts on O-acetyl containing compounds which need not be sialic acids. It seems that this enzyme could help to facilitate the action of influenza virus type A and B sialidase. The peculiarities of influenza virus type C suggest including this type as a new genus in the future classification of viruses.",,"Cabezas, J. A.",1991.0,,,0

Transmission to humans occurs primarily through the bite of domestic or wild animals infected with the virus. This paper shows the circulation of this virus in non-hematophagous bats in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: A survey was conducted on the number of bats sent for diagnosis by the Seção de Virologia of the Instituto Municipal de Medicina Veterinaria Jorge Vaitsman that were positive for rabies. The positive animals were identified and the isolated viruses sent for antigenic typing using indirect immunofluorescence. The results were compared to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention antigen panel. Results: Between 2001 and 2010, the laboratory received 555 non-hematophagous bats for rabies diagnosis, of which 198 (35.7%) were from Rio de Janeiro City. A total of 11 (5.5%) animals were positive for this disease. Antigenic typing revealed the predominance of variant 3 in 9 (81.8%) of the viruses isolated; 1 virus was classified as variant 4 and 1 variant was identified that segregated with the viruses in insectivorous bats. Conclusions: The data obtained in this study demonstrated the presence of rabies virus in synanthropic populations of non-hematophagous bats in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

A total of 21,832 clinical specimens were examined for EV between 2010 and 2013 and the detection rate was 6.5% (1,430). Of the total EV-negative samples, only 1,873 samples were available for HPeV testing in 2011-2013. HPeV was detected in 42 (2%) of them. Positive samples were genotyped by PCR and sequencing. EV infections occurred in all patient age groups: neonates (17%), children aged 28 days to 2 years (29%), children aged 2 to 14 years (40%) and adults (14%). 34 different EV types were identified. HPeV infections were only detected in infants < 8 m (70% neonates, P < 0.05). All but one HPeV were HPeV-3. Differences in the detection of type frequency were found depending on age and clinical manifestation. Coxsackievirus (CV)-B4 (61%), CV-B5 (83%) and HPeV-3 (64%) were more common in neonates than in elderly patients (p<0.05). Echovirus (E)-3 (60%), E-18 (47%), E-25 (62%), CV-A6 (61%), CV-A16 (72%) and EV-71 (75%) were mainly detected in children aged 28 days to 2 years (P < 0.05), while E-6 (79%), E-20 (88%) and E-30 (85%) in children > 2 years and adults were predominant (P<0.05).

To follow the development of SIV in Guangdong, China, we conducted an epidemic investigation in 2016-2017. Nine H1N1 influenza viruses have been isolated from swine nasal swabs. Antigenic analysis revealed that these viruses belonged to two distinct antigenic groups represented by A/Swine/Guangdong/101/2016 and A/Swine/Guangdong/52/2017. In addition, three genotypes known as GD52/17-like, GD493/17-like and GD101/16-like were identified by phylogenetic analysis. Importantly, the genotypes containing at least 4 pdm/09 internal genes have become prevalent in China in recent years. A total of 2966 swine serum samples were used to conduct haemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and the results showed that the seroprevalence values of SW/GD/101/16 (32.2% in 2016, 32.1% in 2017) were significantly higher were than the seroprevalence values of SW/GD/52/17 (18.0% in 2016, 16.7% in 2017). Our study showed that the three reassortant genotypes of H1N1 SIV currently circulating in China are stable, but H1N1pdm09 poses human health challenges as internal genes are introduced into these reassortant genotypes.

Pathogenicity tests in chick embryos and chickens show that D3 and R8 are lentogenic and W4 and P4 are mesogenic strains. Phylogenetic analysis using all six genes provides a high resolution profile for genotype designation as genotype I for D3 and R8 strains and genotype VI for W4 and P4 strains. In addition, molecular dating based on various genes suggests that D3 and R8 diverged from their common ancestor around 1998; W4 and P4 diverged from their common ancestor around 1999. Subsequent selective pressure analysis revealed specific features of gene evolution in all 4 phyla since their divergence from the most recent common ancestor. Furthermore, the geographic origins of 4 phyla via two independent introduction events were inferred to be from Europe by phylogeographic analysis.

289,Identification and analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs in PK-15 cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus using deep sequencing,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, causes acute viral encephalitis with high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are important modulators of intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. However, our knowledge of the changes that occur in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the level of post-transcriptional regulation, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in infected and uninfected cells, respectively. A total of 132 miRNAs were significantly differently expressed after challenge with JEV: 78 were upregulated and 54 downregulated. The sequencing results for selected miRNAs were confirmed using RT-qPCR. GO analysis of host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular signaling pathways, including the metabolic pathway, the inflammatory response, and the immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the comparative expression of miRNAs in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our results will support further studies on the role of miRNAs in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for antiviral therapies against JEV.",,"Cai, Y.;Zhu, L.;Zhou, Y.;Liu, X.;Liu, X.;Li, X.;Lang, Q.;Qiao, X.;Xu, Z.",2015.0,2020-01-01 00:00:00,,0

291,RUMINNAT NUTRITION SYMPOSIUM: Small but mighty: The role of rumen microbes in livestock farming,"The microbes that live in the rumen convert low-grade, fibrous plant matter into usable energy for the host ruminant. Comprised of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and viruses, the rumen microbiome forms an elaborate symbiotic network essential for host ruminant maintenance, immune function, and overall production efficiency. Robert Hungate laid the foundation for research into the rumen microbiome. This area of research has expanded tremendously with advances in methodology and technology that have improved not only the ability to describe microbes in taxonomic and density terms, but also to characterize populations of microbes, their functions, and their interactions with each other and with the host. The interplay between the rumen microbiome and the host contributes to the variation in many phenotypic traits that the host animal expresses. A better understanding of how the rumen microbiome affects host health and performance may lead to new strategies and treatments to improve traits. Furthermore, elucidating maternal, genetic, and environmental factors that influence the establishment and development of the rumen microbiome may provide new insights into potential mechanisms for manipulating rumen microbial composition to improve long-term host health and performance. The potential of these tiny but powerful rumen microbes to play a role in improving livestock production is estimated, although relatively unclear.",,"Cammack, K. M.;Austin, K. J.;Lamberson, W.

293,First detection and molecular characterization of nebovirus in Brazil,"Nebovirus is a new genus of viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae that has recently been characterized in cattle and is associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, anorexia and intestinal lesions, particularly in calves. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of neboviruses in Brazilian cattle and to phylogenetically analyze the detected virus strains. A prevalence of 4·8% of neboviruses was found in fecal samples from 62 cattle from different Brazilian states. All positive animals were < 20 days old and had diarrhea. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the virus sequences into the Newbury1 clade. There was >96*0% nt (100% aa) sequence identity between the virus sequences in this study and >88*8% nt (>94*4% aa) identity with Newbury1/UK.

294,Lambda display phage as a mucosal vaccine delivery vehicle for peptide antigens,"Bacteriophages are structurally stable in the gastrointestinal tract and have favorable properties in terms of safety, stability, ease of manufacture, and immunogenicity. These properties make them potential candidates for oral delivery vehicles for vaccines, but little is known about their ability to induce mucosal immune responses in the small intestine. Whole-body imaging of mice confirmed that lambda bacteriophage (LP) were distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract 24 hours after oral administration. In newborn calves, targeting of LP to the small intestine confirmed that LP were dose-dependently immunogenic and taken up by Peyer's patches. LP-specific IgA responses were induced within both Peyer's patches and draining mesenteric lymph nodes. A lambda display phage (LDP) was constructed to display three immunogenic disease-specific epitopes (DSE) from cervid prion protein (amino acids 130-140 [YML]; 163-170 [YRR]; and 171-178 [YRR]). fused to phage capsid head protein D (LDP-DSE). Targeting purified LDP-DSE to gut segments induced IgA responses to all three peptide epitopes. In addition, delivery of bacteria expressing soluble D-DSE also induced epitope-specific IgA responses in the targeted Peyer's patches. These are the first studies to report the use of LDP to induce epitope-specific IgA responses in the small intestine and confirm that Peyer's patches act as a site for LP uptake. In addition, IgA responses to peptide epitopes on LDP were observed in the absence of mucosal adjuvant. These observations confirm that LDP has the ability to function as a mucosal transport vehicle with protein D as an efficient carrier for peptide epitopes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

295,Two novel parvoviruses in frugivorous New and Old World bats,"Bats, a globally distributed group of mammals with high ecological importance, are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral pathogens important to human and animal health. In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples derived from two phylogenetically distant bat families, specifically fruit bats (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae). Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high-throughput sequencing to detect two new parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus called Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). These viruses circulated in the respective bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high levels: up to 10E8 and up to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1, respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs excised from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestines) and the spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites for viral replication to occur. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known human and livestock parvoviruses. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are capable of causing active infection in bats and that they are widespread in these animals with diverse geographic origins, ecologies, and climates. © 2011 Canuti et al.",,"Canuti, M.;Eis-Huebinger, A.

296,The outbreak of swine flu in Argentina reveals a non-contemporaneous human H3N2 virus that is highly transmissible among swine,"Sporadic outbreaks of H3N2 human influenza A virus (IAV) infection in swine populations have been reported in Asia, Europe and North America since 1970. In South America, serological studies in pigs indicate that IAVs of subtypes H3 and H1 are currently circulating; However, no virus isolation or characterization has been reported. In November 2008, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs related to swine influenza virus (SIV) infection was detected in Argentina. The current study describes the clinical epidemiology, pathology, molecular and biological properties of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus isolate shared 96-98% nucleotide identities with H3N2 IAVs circulating in humans from 2000-2003. Antigens, sera from experimentally vaccinated animals were mainly cross-reactive with non-contemporary H3N2 influenza viruses of human origin. In an experimental infection in a commercial breed of pig, the virus was of low virulence, but was transmitted efficiently to contact pigs and caused severe disease if an infected animal acquired a secondary bacterial infection. This is the first report of a fully human H3N2 IAV associated with clinical disease in swine in South America. These studies underscore the importance of the cross-transmission of IAVs and SIVs between pigs and humans and call for increased influenza surveillance in swine populations worldwide. © 2011 SGM.",,"Cappuccio, J.

It affected factory reared poultry, merchant flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 reported outbreaks up to December 31, 2000. Virological studies identified virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus producing intracerebral pathogenicity indices from 1-6 to 2-0 and which, due to their monoclonal antibody binding pattern could be classified as belonging to group C1. The clinical, gross, and microscopic findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different bird species were susceptible to varying degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological investigation highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in starting the epidemic and of traders in its continuation.

Virus-induced virulence is commonly quantified by measuring the median time to death or onset of symptoms following viral inoculation. In this review we distinguish between general virulence and neurovirulence. We define neurovirulence as the level of pathogenesis in the nervous system, but intend it to be broader than the virus' simple ability to grow in the central nervous system (CNS). This distinction is made possible by recent advances that allow an integrated assessment of the degree of pathology, reactive gliosis, and the inflammatory response to infection in the intact organism with specific antisera and molecular probes.",,"Card, J.

Orthopoxvirus infection was suspected based on negative staining electron microscopic results. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology, virus isolation and molecular analysis performed on various organs of all animals. An epidemiological investigation could not determine the source of infection in the area. Captured rodents were negative on virologic tests, but specific IgG was detected in 27.27% of small rodents and 14.28% of rats. A live attenuated vaccine was administered to the susceptible monkey population and no side effects were observed; a detectable humoral immune response was induced in most vaccinated animals.

301,Virological and phylogenetic characterization of attenuated lentivirus isolates from small ruminants that evade efficient serological detection,"Three field isolates of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) originate from a mixed herd of goats and sheep that have been certified free of capric arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) for many years. Phylogenetic analysis of pol sequences allowed these isolates to be classified as an A4 subtype. None of the animals showed clinical signs of SRLV infection, confirming previous observations suggesting that this particular subtype is highly attenuated, at least in goats. A real-time quantitative PCR strategy based on primers and probes derived from a highly variable env region allowed us to classify the animals as uninfected, singly or doubly infected. The performance of various serological instruments based on this classification revealed their profound inadequacy in monitoring animals infected with this particular SRLV subtype. In vitro, the isolates showed differences in their cytopathicity and a tendency to replicate more efficiently in goat cells than in sheep cells, particularly in goat macrophages. In contrast, these viruses reached significantly higher viral loads in vivo in sheep than in goats. Both env subtypes infected goats and sheep with equal efficiency. However, one of them achieved significantly higher viral loads in both species. In summary, we have characterized three isolates of SRLV subtype A4 that circulate efficiently in a mixed herd of goats and sheep despite their apparent attenuation and a strict physical segregation between goats and sheep. The poor performance of the applied serological tools indicates that to support an SRLV eradication campaign, it is imperative to develop new subtype-specific tools. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Cardinaux, L.;Zahno, M.

302,An outbreak of pseudo-cowpox in fattened calves in southern Brazil,"Pseudocowpox virus is a parapoxvirus commonly associated with papulovesicular and scab lesions on the teats and udders of dairy cows and is commonly transmitted to humans. An unusual outbreak of skin diseases in fattened calves in southern Brazil is described. Fourteen of 17 male cattle (82%) aged 6 to 48 months feeding on grass pastures were affected. The animals developed papules, vesicles and scabby proliferative lesions on the snout in a clinical course of about 10-15 days. The scabby lesions often presented with exudation and bleeding. The histological examination of the mucocutaneous tissue with detached crusts revealed acanthosis with thickening of the corneal layer and premature cornification (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis). The dermis showed multifocal lymphoplasmic infiltrates. Electron microscopic examination of scab samples revealed typical parapoxvirus particles: oval shaped (260 nm × 160 nm), encased and covered with a helical layer. The polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers targeting the B2L gene amplified a 590 bp product from DNA extracted from common scab. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons revealed 97% nucleotide homology with pseudocowpox virus and less homology with other parapoxviruses: bovine papular stomatitis virus (84%) and orf virus (94%).

303,Diagnosis and control of an LPAI H5N8 outbreak in a commercial flock of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) in California's Central Valley,"In April 2014, an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 of North American genetic lineage was diagnosed at a commercial quail farm in Stanislaus County, California. The sudden increase in mortality prompted the submission of 20 Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica) to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, Turlock Branch. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs tested positive for H5N8 influenza A virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The virus was then isolated. In vivo assays and sequencing of the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site classified the virus as a North American genetic lineage with low pathogenicity for chickens. After the diagnosis, a quick and coordinated response was taken to contain the outbreak. The affected premises were depopulated, cleaned and disinfected. Three areas around the affected site - a 3 kilometer (km) radius (high risk zone), a 3-10 km area (buffer zone) and a 10-20 km area (surveillance zone) - have been established for commercial avian influenza testing and non-commercial poultry farms.

It is one of the earliest described members of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes the viruses that cause smallpox and monkeypox in humans. Both the historical and current literature describe ""cowpox"" as a disease with a single etiological agent. The genotypic data presented here indicate that CPXV is not a single species but a composite of multiple (up to 5) species capable of infecting cows, humans and other animals. The practice of naming drugs after the host in which the resulting disease manifests obscures the true taxonomic relationships of ""cowpox"" isolates.

307,Vaccinia and Other Viruses With Available Vaccines Show Extensive Homology With The HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein: The Prospect Of Using Existing Vaccines To Curb The AIDS Pandemic,"Cross-reactive immunity occurs when infection with or vaccination against a virus protects against another related family member. A search for homologues of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein revealed that it consists of thousands of intercalating and overlapping viral matches of longer gapped pentapeptides or consensus, which belong to over 70% of the currently sequenced virome, infecting all kingdoms from bacteria to humans . It was also highly homologous to proteins from Visna/Maedi and other ovine viruses, while other proteins (nef/tat/gag/pol) were homologous to proteins from equine infectious anemia virus and HTLV-2/HTLV-3 viruses. This phenomenon suggests that horizontal gene transfer from co-infecting RNA and DNA viruses to retroviruses is extensive and provides a route for the subsequent insertion of non-retroviral genes into human and other genomes via retroviral integration. This homology includes all viruses for which vaccines already exist. Cross-reactive immunity may be effective in AIDS because vaccinia vaccination decreases viral replication in the cells of HIV-1 infected patients for the CCR5 tropic form. Measles, dengue virus, or GB virus C infections also reduce HIV-1 viral loads. A resumption of vaccinia/smallpox vaccination is expected to have a significant impact on the AIDS pandemic, and careful investigation of the potential uses of other existing viral and bacterial vaccines deserves particular attention. This phenomenon may also be relevant to other recalcitrant viruses, bacteria and parasites for which no vaccine exists, and the arsenal of existing vaccines may play a role in diseases other than those for which they were developed. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",,"Carter, C.

The presence of viral RNA in human and porcine samples was also assessed and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV positive samples. Samples were taken from forty-two pig farms; 142 workers were included in the study and divided into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with pigs (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited from the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with pigs. Forty-one of 42 (97%) pig farms gave a positive result in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). The overall seroprevalence in pigs was 50% (441/879), with a higher seropositivity rate in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 out of 42 farms tested (31%) and a higher positivity was found in piglets (40/246, 16.3%). The phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All people were negative for HEV virus genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates between zoonotic risk workers and controls (5.7% vs. 1.3%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup comprising short-term exposed subjects (veterinarians) versus long-term exposed subjects (farmers), suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the probability of indicates HEV infection.

The viruses have been tentatively named Circa-like Virus-Brazil (CLV-BR) strains hs1 and hs2 and have genome lengths of 2526 and 2533 nucleotides, respectively. Four large open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in each of the genomes, and differences between the two genomes were mainly observed in ORF 2. However, only ORF 3 showed significant amino acid similarities to a putative rolling circle replication initiator protein (Rep). with low identity (36%). Our phylogenetic analysis, based on the Rep protein, showed that the CLV-BRs do not cluster with members of the Circoviridae, Nanoviridae, or Geminiviridae families and are more closely related to Circo-like genomes previously found in purified water and feces a wild rodent and a bat have been identified. The CLV-BRs are members of a putative novel family of circular Rep-encoding ssDNA viruses.

In this study, a deep Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed to provide information on the genetic diversity and distribution of HEV genotypes in Bulgaria. Three different datasets of the HEV virus were created for genotyping using the maximum likelihood method, estimating the evolution rate using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, studying the demographic history, and selective pressure analysis. The evolution rate for genotype 3e was 351 × 10 3 substitution/site/year (95% peak posterior density [95% HPD]: 145 × 10 3-575 × 10 3). The root of time to the most recent common ancestor of the Bayesian maximum clade belief tree of the HEV-3e genotype corresponded to the year 1965 (HPD 95% 1949-1994). The Bulgarian sequences grouped mainly in the main group (Group A). The monophyletic clade included all Bulgarian genotype 3e sequences. The demographic history showed a slight growth from 1995 to 2000, followed by a kind of bottleneck in the 2010s, a peak in 2011 and new growth until 2015.

Samples were tested for Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AMV), Cowpea Mild Mottle Virus (CPMMV), Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and Tospovirus Group (I, II and III) Genera Potyvirus by DAS-ELISA PTA-ELISA and for Begomovirus by PCR. CPMMV was detected in three plants with different symptoms. Feather-like inclusions formed by virions were observed in these plants by transmission electron microscopy. ORF2 to ORF6 (2462 nucleotides) from the CPMMV viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the coat protein gene (CP - ORF5) of the chiavirus isolate was obtained and compared to 31 CPMMV sequences reported in GenBank. Results showed between 75.5% and 99.0% of nt identity, which exceeds the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for carlavirus species differentiation. Phylogenetic analysis using the CP gene nt sequences revealed that the CPMMV chia isolate clumped with other CPMMV isolates from other plant species from Brazil, Ghana, India, Puerto Rico, Taiwan and the US, but from four others India were separated. This is the world's first report of the presence of CPMVV in Chia. Although the other viruses were not detected in this work, it is possible that the different symptoms observed could be caused by a mixture of viruses, since CPMMV was found in chia plants with different symptoms.

314,Taxon ordering in family trees using evolutionary algorithms,"BACKGROUND: In a typical ""left-to-right"" phylogenetic tree, the vertical order of taxa is meaningless, since only the branch path between them reflects their degree of similarity. To make unsolved trees more informative, we propose here an innovative Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) method to seek the best graphical representation of unsolved trees to give biological meaning to the vertical order of taxa. METHODS: Starting from a West Nile Virus phylogenetic tree, we developed it in a (1+1)-EA by randomly rotating the inner nodes and choosing the tree with the better fit for each generation. Fitness is a sum of genetic distances between the taxon under consideration and the r (radius) nearest taxa. After adjusting the radius for best performance, we developed the trees with (Lambda + Mu) EAs to study the influence of population on the algorithm. RESULTS: The (1+1)-EA consistently outperformed a random search, and better results were obtained when the radius was set to 8. The (lambda + mu) EAs performed as well as the (1 + 1) except for the larger population (1000 + 1000). CONCLUSIONS: The trees showed improvement in both fitness (based on a genetic distance matrix, then close taxa are indeed genetically close) and biological interpretation after evolution. Samples collected in the same state or year moved close together, making the tree easier to interpret. Biological relationships between samples are also easier to observe.",,"Cerutti, F.;Bertolotti, L.;Goldberg, T. L.;Giacobini, M.",2011.0,2001-07-01 00:00:00,,0
315,Phylogenetic characterization of classical swine fever viruses isolated in Korea between 1988 and 2003,"Twenty-four classical swine fever (CSF) virus isolates obtained from classical swine fever (CSF) outbreaks in the Republic of Korea in 1988 and 2003 were genetically characterized for the partial E2 gene (190 nucleotides) and compared with classical swine fever (CSF) genes reported from other countries. compared viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes between 1988 and 1999 classified Korean field isolates into subgroup 3.2, forming an independent clade distinct from the CSF viruses identified in other countries. In contrast, the viruses isolated during the 2002-2003 classical swine fever epidemics were classified into a different subgroup (2.1). The 2.1 viruses showed close genetic relatedness (92.1-100% nucleotide similarity) to CSF viruses reported from China and Taiwan in 1998-2001. Since no evidence of classical swine fever virus infection was found in the wild boar (Sus scrofa coreanus) population native to Korea, the results of the molecular characterization strongly suggest that the outbreaks of classical swine fever epidemic in Korean swine populations in 2002-2003 were related to the Introduction of a new virus were traced strain or strains, probably from neighboring countries. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Cha, S.

316,Molecular characterization of ephemeral bovine fever virus in Thailand between 2013 and 2017,"Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is an arthropod-borne disease caused by bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. BEFV is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions including Thailand, a country in mainland Southeast Asia. However, there are few studies on BEFV and no available information on the molecular properties of BEFV in Thailand. Therefore, the aim of this study was to genetically characterize Thai BEFVs and uncover their evolution through phylogenetic analysis of G gene ectodomain sequences. From 2013 to 2017, blood samples were collected from cattle matching the BEF case definition from three regions of Thailand. Thai BEFV G genes and a full genome of one isolate, East Asia/TH/LRI0045/2016, were sequenced and characterized. In addition, their phylogenies were constructed. This is the first report on the genetics of BEFV in Southeast Asia. The G-ectodomain coding region of Thai BEFV found between 2013 and 2017 is closely related to the second and third subclades of the East Asian lineage. In addition, we observed a mutation in the putative P' ORF of all Thai BEFVs that generated a premature stop codon. The Thai G gene sequences are closely related to those of isolates from mainland China and Taiwan. The overall genomic sequences of Thai BEFV and East Asia/China/JT02 L/2002 share common features, suggesting a common evolutionary relatedness between East and Southeast Asian strains. Further studies on the relationship between animal translocation, circulation of BEFV in the Greater Mekong subregion, and acquisition of additional G gene sequences could improve the understanding of BEFV epidemiology in mainland Southeast Asia.",,"Chaisirirat, T.;Sangthong, P.;Arunvipas, P.;Petcharat, N.;Thangthamniyom, N.;Chumsing, W.;Lekcharoensuk, P.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.10.013,0
317,Metagenomic analysis of antibiotic resistance genes in faeces of dairy cows after therapeutic administration of third-generation cephalosporins,"Although dairy manure is widely applied on land, it is relatively understudied compared to other livestock as a potential source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for the environment and ultimately human pathogens. Ceftiofur, the most widely used antibiotic for dairy cows in the US, is a 3rd generation cephalosporin, a class of antibiotics critical to human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of typical ceftiofur antibiotic treatment on the prevalence of ARGs in the faecal microbiome of dairy cows using a metagenomic approach. Fecal β-lactam ARGs were found to be increased in Holstein cows administered ceftiofur (n=3) compared to control cows (n=3). However, the total number of ARGs in all classes was not measurably affected by ceftiofur treatment, likely due to the dominance of unaffected tetracycline ARGs in the metagenomics libraries. Functional analysis using MG-RAST also revealed that ceftiofur treatment resulted in an increase in gene sequences associated with 'phages, prophages, transposable elements and plasmids', suggesting that this treatment also had the ability for horizontal transmission enriched by ARGs. Additional functional shifts were noted with ceftiofur treatment (eg, increases in genes associated with stress, chemotaxis, and resistance to toxic compounds; decreases in genes associated with aromatic compound metabolism and cell division and the cell cycle ), along with measurable taxonomic shifts (increase in Bacterioidia and decrease in Actinobacteria). This study demonstrates that ceftiofur has a broad, measurable and immediate effect on the metagenome of cow feces. Given the importance of 3rd generation cephalospirins to human medicine, their continued use in dairy cattle should be carefully considered and waste treatment strategies investigated to slow the spread of ARG from dairy manure.

318,Cross-species transmission and emergence of novel viruses in birds,"Birds, the only living members of the Dinosauria group, are flying warm-blooded vertebrates that exhibit high biodiversity, roosting and migratory behaviors, and unique adaptive immune systems. Birds are the natural reservoir for numerous virus species and therefore gene sources for the evolution, origin and spread of novel viruses. Human encroachment on the natural habitats of wild birds, domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and increased human consumption of poultry have allowed avian viruses to cross species barriers and cause zoonosis. Recently, a novel adenovirus was found exclusively in birds, causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infections in birds and humans. Instead of being the main cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from birds to humans, a novel avian virus can be an augmenter of another zoonotic agent causing the outbreak. A comprehensive avian virome will improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of birds.",,"Chan, J. F. W.;To, K. K. W.;Chen, H.;Yuen, K. Y.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.coviro.2015.01.006,0

320,"Analysis of genomic sequences of 95 papillomavirus types: uniform typing, phylogeny and taxonomy","Our aim was to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of all known papillomaviruses (PVs) and the possibility of constructing a supratypical taxonomic classification based on this information. Of the many detectably homologous segments present in PV genomes, a 291 bp segment of the L1 gene is notable because it is flanked by the MY09 and MY11 consensus primers and contains highly conserved amino acid residues that encode the Simplify sequence alignment. We determined the MY09-MY11 sequences from human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48 , HPV-50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5 and BPV-6 and created a database that now includes HPV-1 through HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven as yet untyped HPV genomes, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed based on other sequence data. We constructed phylogenies based on partial L1 and E6 gene sequences and distinguished five major clades, which we call supergroups. One of them brings together 54 genital PV types, which can be further divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and combines most of the PVs typically found in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, but also includes several types typical of other skin lesions such as HPV-4. The third supergroup combines the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous ungulate PVs BPV-3, BPV-4 and BPV-6, and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, the oral PV of the dog , and the cottontail rabbit PV. The chaffinch PV and two rodent PVs, Micromys minutus PV and Mastomys natalensis PV, are not grouped due to the relative isolation of their respective lineages. Within most supergroups, groups formed on the basis of cladistic principles unite phenotypically similar PV types.

The genomes of the two ILTV vaccine strains were sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer 2X in 36 cycles of single-ended reads. The results showed that only a few nucleotide differences (23 in Vaccine 1; 31 in Vaccine 2) were found and indicate that the US CEO strains are virtually identical to the Australian Serva CEO strain that produced a European vaccine is of origin. The sequence differences demonstrated the spectrum of variability between vaccine strains. Only eight amino acid differences were found in ILTV proteins including UL54, UL27, UL28, UL20, UL1, ICP4 and US8 in Vaccine 1. Similarly in Vaccine 2 eight amino acid differences were found in UL54, UL27, UL28, UL36. UL1, ICP4, US10 and US8.

324,"Lessons from the largest avian flu virus epidemic in Taiwan, 2015","The largest avian flu (AI) epidemic in history began attacking poultry and wild birds across Taiwan on January 6, 2015. This study analyzed surveillance results, epidemiological characteristics, and viral sequences using government-released information with the intention of making recommendations to minimize future pandemic influenza. The highly pathogenic H5 2.3.4.4 class AI viruses (HPAIVs) were not detected in Taiwan prior to 2015. Four types of pathogens were identified during this epidemic: the three new subtypes H5N2, H5N8 and H5N3 of class 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs and an endemic chicken H5N2 (Mexican lineage) subtype of weakly pathogenic AI viruses. Mixed subtypes also co-circulated, with H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs being accompanied by the H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or ancient H5N2 viruses in the same farm. More than 90% of domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; Geese were hardest hit in the early outbreaks. The epidemic peaked in mid-January for all three new H5 subtypes. Spatial epidemiology revealed that the most affected areas were in southwestern coastal areas. Different geographic distributions of AI virus subtypes were found in terrestrial fowl (mainly chickens), with hot spots of H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 compared to previously endemic ancient H5N2 viruses in Changhwa (P=0.03) and Yunlin counties (P=0.007). , or from central Taiwan. Phylogenetic and sequence analyzes of all early 10 Taiwan H5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolates covering the three subtypes showed that they differed strongly from the HA of earlier local H5viruses of domestic ducks (75%-80%) and chickens (70% -75%). However, they had the highest percentages of sequence identity (99.53%-100%), with the HA from A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) isolated on December 7, 2014 in Japan being higher than that of the most recent American and Korean H5-HPAIVs [A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) and A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 (H5N8): 99.02% - 99.54% and A/Baikal teal /Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8): 98.61%-99.08%], suggesting a likely common ancestor of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. The multiple subtypes of the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs imply high viral reassortment.

325,Dual infection of gnotobiotic calves with bovine group A strains and porcine group C rotavirus affects the pathogenesis of group C rotavirus,"There is serological evidence that group C bovine rotavirus exists in the United States, but there are no reports of its isolation. Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three adult cow diarrheal samples were positive by RT-PCR only, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey (WD534tc/C) kidney cells (MA104). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the group C Cowden swine strain than to the bovine Shintoku strain. Since the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual rotavirus infections might play a role in rotavirus pathogenesis and host adaptation. Therefore, we investigated the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or in combination with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) group A bovine rotavirus in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea with no (or limited) virus shedding in vaccinated calves (n=3). In contrast, all calves (n=2) co-infected with WD534tc/C and IND/A developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, while calves (n=3) co-infected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A developed diarrhea but neither excreted viruses. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villus atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), while dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more widespread small bowel lesions occurred in calves co-infected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, co-infection of calves with group A rotavirus enhanced the faecal shedding of a group C bovine rotavirus and the extent of histopathologic lesions in the small intestine. Thus, our results suggest a possible new hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.",,"Chang, K. O.;Nielsen, P. R.;Ward, L. A.;Saif, L.

326,Nipah Virus: Phylogeny and Replication,"Phylogenetic analysis of Nipah virus isolates from Malaysia, Bangladesh and Cambodia indicated the presence of at least two distinct clusters of NiV strains. Based on the major glycoprotein (G) gene, the Nipah virus tambun isolate clustered with Nipah virus isolates from Cambodia and Bangladesh, while the remaining isolates from Malaysia were clustered in a separate cluster. Sequence heterogeneity among Malaysian Nipah virus isolates was noted, but the overall genomic sequence divergence value was low, suggesting a possible recent introduction of the virus. Nipah virus replicated well in stable porcine kidney cells and human lung fibroblast cells. On the other hand, human monocytes were infected with Nipah virus, but the cells did not support productive infection. Similarly, infection of human neuronal cells did not result in the release of high yields of infectious virus. The monocytes can serve to spread Nipah virus from the site of infection, including across the blood-brain barrier. And in the brain, the Nipah virus is probably spread through the cell-to-cell spread mechanism.",,"Chang, L. Y.;AbuBakar, S.",2009.0,,,0

Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cases of cervicitis and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population. METHODS: 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from the histopathological records of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 62% of the samples tested were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% of SCC cases. For cervicitis, 48% of cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct, two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with previously reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). In addition, three of the isolated cervical tumors (JQ734980, JQ734981, and JQ734982) were arranged in a different cluster.

329,"Host specificity, pathogen exposure, and superinfections affect the distribution of Anaplasma phagocytophilum genotypes in ticks, deer, and livestock in a fragmented agricultural landscape","Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a bacterial pathogen that is mainly transmitted by Ixodes ricinus ticks in Europe. It infects wild mammals, livestock, and occasionally humans. Roe deer are considered the main reservoir, but the genotypes they carry differ from those found in livestock and humans. Here we investigated whether roe deer are the main source of the A. phagocytophilum genotypes circulating in searches for I. ricinus nymphs in a fragmented agricultural landscape in France. First, we assessed pathogen prevalence in 1837 I. ricinus nymphs (sampled along georeferenced transects) and 79 roe deer. The prevalence differed dramatically between ticks and deer: 1.9% and 76%, respectively. Second, we characterized the diversity of A. phagocytophilum genotypes found in 22 infected ticks and 60 infected deer using high-throughput amplicon sequencing; The aim was to determine the frequency of co-infections. Only 22.7% of infected ticks carried genotypes associated with roe deer. This finding fits with others suggesting that cattle density is the main factor explaining the density of infected ticks. To study epidemiological scenarios that can explain these patterns, we constructed compartment models that focused on how exposure to A. phagocytophilum and infection dynamics affected pathogen prevalence in roe deer. At the exposure levels predicted by the results of this study and the literature, the high prevalence in roe deer was observed only in the model where superinfections could occur during all stages of infection and when the probability of infection after exposure was greater than 0.43. We then interpreted these results from the perspective of livestock and human health.",,"Chastagner, A.;Pion, A.;Verheyden, H.;Lourtet, B.;Cargnelutti, B.;Picot, D.;Poux, V.;Bard, E.;Plantard, O.;McCoy, K.

331,Variations in lentiviral gene expression in monocyte-derived macrophages from naturally infected sheep,"79 1-year-old lambs from three individual farms and one fattening farm were examined for natural lentivirus infection. We used three different methods to detect infection and identify the stage of the ovine lentivirus life cycle in blood-derived macrophages. Cytopathic infectious virus was obtained from 14/14 Border Leicester animals derived from a naturally infected herd. No virus particles, virus proteins, virus-specific antibodies, or viral DNA were detected in samples from 34 lambs from two South Kansas City farms. However, we identified 11 infected animals among 31 fattening lambs. Specific viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from animal macrophages, but no infectious cytopathic virus was isolated from these cells. Cells from ten of the other feedlot animals contained viral DNA, but neither viral particles nor proteins could be detected by our techniques. Thus, in these naturally infected animals, the virus life cycle either proceeded to completion, dependent on the differentiation of infected progenitor cells in the blood, or remained arrested at the DNA stage despite maturation of monocytes to macrophages. Sequence analysis of the env gene of viral genomes from two of the ten fattening sheep revealed sequences that differed from known ovine and caprine lentiviruses. Surprisingly, these sequences have higher identity (of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences) with caprine arthritis encephalitis virus than with the ovine prototype, Maedi Visna virus. These data suggest that the ovine and caprine lentiviruses found in North American sheep may share a common ancestral genotype that is closely related to the caprine virus.",,"Chebloune, Y.;Karr, B.;Sheffer, D.;Leung, K.;Narayan, O.",1996.0,,,0

High-throughput sequencing of a viral population subsequently contains a mixed signal from the underlying clones. We want to identify the underlying evolutionary structures. We use two sources of information to attempt this; within segment linkage information and mutation prevalence. We show that clone haplotypes, their prevalence, and maximal parsimony can be identified from reticulated evolutionary structures, although the solutions may not be unique, even for complete information sets. This is applied to an influenza infection chain, where we infer evolutionary structures, including reassortment, and demonstrate some of the interpretation difficulties that arise from deep sequencing due to artifacts such as template switching during PCR amplification.",,"Chedom, D.

However, concerns remain about unwanted co-transmission of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we evaluated FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, each receiving a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; The reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transmission of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be easily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in one recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these viruses have been known to replicate on human cells. Instead, viral contigs were either assessed as bacteriophage or could not be assigned taxonomically, suggesting an unstudied phage. The two most commonly transmitted gene types have been implicated in temperate phage replication. In addition, it has been found that members of Siphoviridae, the group of typically temperate phages that includes lambda phage, are transmitted with significantly greater efficiency than other groups. Based on these results, we propose that temperate phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between human individuals. In summary, we have documented the transmission of multiple viral lineages between human individuals by FMT, but in this case series none were from viral groups known to infect human cells. IMPORTANCE The transmission of entire viral communities between humans has rarely been studied but is likely to be of medical importance. Here we investigated fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and possibly other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. We studied viral community transmission during FMT and documented transmission of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal cells or were known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophages that form stable associations with their hosts were significantly more likely to be transmitted during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral moderate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.",,"Chehoud, C.;Dryga, A.;Hwang, Y.;Nagy-Szakal, D.;Hollister, E.

334,Complete genome sequence of the mesogenic vaccine strain R2B of Newcastle disease virus from India,"Mesogenic vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are widely used in many countries in Asia and Africa to control Newcastle disease in poultry. In India, the mesogenic strain R2B was introduced in 1945; It protects adult chickens pre-vaccinated with a lentogenic vaccine virus and provides long-lasting immunity. In this article we report the complete genome sequence of the hitherto unsequenced Indian vaccine strain R2B. The viral genome is 15,186 nucleotides long and contains the polybasic amino acid motif in the cleavage site of the fusion protein, indicating that this vaccine strain evolved from a virulent virus. The phylogenetic analysis of this mesogenic vaccine virus classified it with the viruses belonging to genotype III of class cluster II of NDV. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Chellappa, M.

335,Minimal nuclear genome sequence typing of bacterial pathogens: a unified approach for clinical and public health microbiology,"Bacterial pathogens represent a major health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genomic typing of infectious agents, and particularly those with potentially serious clinical consequences, promises to guide clinical care to reduce the harmful effects of Limit infections and prevent potential local infections or global outbreaks. Here we sequenced and compared 85 isolates of Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic pathogen in humans and swine, analyzing 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types, representing species diversity and human clinical isolates of high public health importance . We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes are common to all isolates. Excluding 201 common but mobile genes, 876 genes were defined as the species' minimal nuclear genome (MCG). Of 190,894 identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 58,501 were located in the MCG genes and were termed MCG SNPs. A population structure analysis of these MCG SNPs classified the 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 includes all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our S. suis MCG typing system provided a clear separation of groups containing human-associated isolates from those containing animal-associated isolates. It also separated the group containing outbreak isolates, including those causing the life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia-only isolates. The typing system facilitates the application of genomic data in the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and surveillance of S. suis. The MCG groups can also be used as S. suis taxonomic units to define bacterial subpopulations with the potential to cause severe clinical infections and large-scale outbreaks.",,"Chen, C.;Zhang, W.;Zheng, H.;Lan, R.;Wang, H.;Du, P.;Bai, X.;Ji, S.;Meng, Q.;Jin, D.;Liu, K.;Jing, H.;Ye, C.;Gao, G.

336,Genetic analysis of virulence and antimicrobial resistant plasmid pOU7519 in Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis,"Background: Zoonotic Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis), which causes paratyphoid fever in pigs and bacteremia in humans, usually carry a virulence plasmid and sometimes a separate antimicrobial resistant plasmid or fuse together. This study aimed to analyze the probable mechanism how a virulence-resistance chimera plasmid is formed in S. choleraesuis. Methods: The entire plasmid sequence of pOU7519 in S. choleraesuis strain OU7519 was determined using shotgun cloning and sequencing. Sequence annotation and comparison were performed to determine the sequence responsible for the formation of a chimeric virulence resistance pOU7519. Other chimeric plasmids among the pooled strains of S. choleraesuis were also confirmed. Results: The sequence of pOU719, 127,212 bp long, was identified as a chimera of the virulence plasmid pSCV50 and a multidrug resistant plasmid pSC138 found in S. choleraesuis strain SC-B67. The pOU7519 is a conjugative plasmid carrying various mobile DNAs including prophages, insertion sequences, integrins and transposons, in particular a Tn. 6088-like transposon. By dissecting the junction of the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera in pOU7519, defective sequences at the integrase gene scv50 (int) and its attachment site (att) were found and this probably resulted in a stable chimeric plasmid due to failure of excision from pSCV50-pSC138 -Chimera. A similar chimeric structure was also found in other large plasmids. Conclusion: Deletion of both int and att strains could likely block chimera excision and result in an irreversible, stable pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. The emergence of conjugative virulence and antimicrobial resistant plasmids in S. choleraesuis could pose a public health threat.",,"Chen, C. L.;Su, L. H.;Janapatla, R. P.;Lin, C. Y.;Chiu, C.

The 135,038 nt sequence contains the entire ANT2 cDNA plus four other candidates suggested by computational analysis. One of the putative genes is homologous to a gene involved in Graves' disease and it, ANT2 and two others, are confirmed by EST matches.

Histology showed villous atrophy, the samples positive for RVB by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation metagenomic sequencing identified only RVB and orf virus. In the VP4 gene segment, the goat RVB strain had a higher percent nucleotide identity with the Indian bovine RVB strains than with the Japanese bovine RVB strains, but the VP7, VP6, VP2, NSP1, NSP2 and American goat RVB NSP5 gene segments genetically related to the Japanese RVB bovine strains.

339,Evolutionary relationships between large double-stranded DNA viruses infecting microalgae and other organisms as inferred from DNA polymerase genes,"To examine the genetic relationship between viruses infecting microalgae, fragments of the DNA polymerase gene (DNA pol) were amplified and sequenced from 13 virus clones representing three genera of distantly related microalgae (Chlorella strains NC64A and Pbi, Micromonas pusilla and Chrysochromulina spp.) infect. . Phylogenetic trees d on DNA pol sequences and hybridization of total genomic DNA showed similar branching patterns. The genetic relatedness calculated from the hybridization and sequence data showed good agreement (r=0.90), indicating that DNA pol sequences can be used to determine genetic relatedness and infer phylogenetic relationships between these viruses. The phylogenetic tree derived from the deduced amino acid sequences of DNA pol of 24 dsDNA viruses, including phycodnaviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, baculoviruses and African swine fever virus, agreed well with groupings based on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Microalgae viruses are more closely related to each other than to the other dsDNA viruses and form a distinct phyletic group, suggesting that they share a common ancestor and belong to the Phycodnaviridae. In addition, the Phycodnaviridae are more closely related to the Herpesviridae than to other virus families for which DNA pol sequences are available.",,"Chen, F.;Suttle, C.

However, the differences between somatic cells and immune cells after infection remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the differential responses of chickens to infection with ALV-J in different cell lines. In this study, we detected changes in transcriptome expression during infection with ALV-J in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and HD11 cell lines. RNA-Seq was used to determine the expression levels of mRNA transcripts from the two cell types after infection with ALV-J at 1, 4, and 7 dpi, and genomic analyzes were used to group differentially expressed genes into signaling pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the expression of 336 and 269 differentially expressed genes in CEF and HD11 lines, respectively, involved in innate immunity (OASL, CCL4), adaptive immunity (LYZ, CD72), apoptosis, and autophagy (WISP2 , COMP) are involved.

Timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we used RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences from three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also conducted a study of CoVs in domestic poultry in China using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. The survey identified a total of 102 CoV positives. Phylogenetic analysis of viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic chickens have diverged into several region- or host-specific clades or subclades around the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. In addition, this study provided new data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the new duck-specific CoV identified by RNA-Seq in this study, Some CoVs are genetically closer to circulating in wild waterfowl.

342,"Evolution of the complete matrix and the Matrix1, Matrix2 gene of H3N8 equine influenza virus","In our study, the H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) M, M1, and M2 genes were analyzed phylogenetically. The aa sequences of the M1 and M2 proteins have also been aligned and mapped. The result showed that the M, M1 and M2 genes of all recent Florida-2 clade EIV strains isolated after 2007 underwent divergent evolution. It evolved into another group called the Aisan group, which was distinct from the Florida-2 group EIV strains isolated before 2007 and more genetically similar to the European group.

344,Molecular epidemiology of porcine epidemic diarrheal virus in China,"Since the beginning of 2006, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has reappeared in immunized pig herds. Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is the only accessory gene in the PEDV genome. The entire ORF3 genes of 12 PEDV field strains and one vaccine strain were sequenced. The ORF3 genes of Chinese PEDV field strains (except CH/GSJIII/07) contain a single ORF of 672 or 675 nucleotides (nt) encoding a 223 or 224 amino acid peptide. However, the CV777 vaccine strain and CH/GSJIII/07 contain a 276 nt ORF due to a 49 nt deletion at nt 245-293. The Chinese PEDV field strains and PEDV reference strains are divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic relationship of their ORF3 genes. Chinese PEDV field strains (except CH/GSJIII/07) have a close phylogenetic relationship with Korean strains and are genetically distinct from the PEDV vaccine strains.

Some experts claimed it was an unusually mixed mix of human, avian and swine flu viruses, while others concluded it was an entirely simple rearrangement of two lineages of swine flu viruses. Here, the phylogenetic diversity of the viral PB1, PA, and PB2 gene sequences using online web servers and the results suggest that all 8 genetic segments of the new virus may have originated from two swine influenza virus lineages and one of the lineages a mongrelized mix human, avian and swine flu viruses that appeared in the world about 10 years ago. Considering the recent epidemiological trends of the new virus, we believe it will continue to spread globally and persist in human populations for a long time. It could also spread among swine populations. The future widespread distribution of the new virus may coincide with the disappearance of a subtype of the earlier human influenza A virus.",,"Chen, J.

347,"Isolation, genome sequencing and functional analysis of two T7-like coliphages from avian pathogen Escherichia coli","Avian pathogen Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, which results in significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. Because of drug residues and increased antibiotic resistance caused by antibiotic use, bacteriophage and other alternative therapeutics are expected to control APEC infection in poultry. We then studied their biological properties and performed high-throughput genome sequencing and homology analysis of these phages. Assembly results from high-throughput sequencing showed that the structures of both the P483 and P694 genomes consist of linear and double-stranded DNA. The results of electron microscopy and homology analysis showed that both P483 and P694 belong to the T7-like virus, which is a member of the Podoviridae family of the order Caudovirales. Comparative genomic analysis showed that most of the predicted proteins of these two phages had the strongest sequence similarity to Enterobacteria phage BA14 and 285P, Erwinia phage FE44 and Kluyvera phage Kvp1; however, some proteins such as gp0.6a, gp1.7 and gp17 showed lower similarity (<0.85%) to the homologues of other phages in the T7 subgroup. We also found some unique properties of P483 and P694, such as the two types of genes of P694 and no lytic activity of P694 against its host bacteria in liquid medium.

348,Detailed sequencing shows the cross-over map of chimeric genes in two infectious clones of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,"BACKGROUND: Recombination is an important factor in the genetic diversity of most viruses. A reverse genetics system using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Enhanced GFP (EGFP)-expressing infectious clones was developed to study the requirements for recombination. However, it is still unclear what types of cross-over events occurred to produce the viable offspring. AIM: We used 454 sequencing to infer recombination events in this system. METHOD: Two infectious Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) clones, P129-EGFP-97C and P129-GFPm-d(2-6), were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. P129-EGFP-97C is a fully functional virus containing a non-fluorescent EGFP. P129-GFPm-d (2-6) is a defective virus but contains a fluorescent GFPm. Successful recombination was evident by the appearance of a fully functional progeny virus expressing fluorescence. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells expressing fluorescence and the entire fluorescent gene was amplified to produce an amplicon library for 454 sequencing. RESULTS: Deep sequencing showed that nucleotide identities increased from ~37% (in the variable region from 21 nt to 165 nt) to 20% (T<sub>289</sub>C) and then to ~38% (456- 651 nt) changed 100% (672-696 nt) compared to EGFP. The results showed that crossover events occurred in three conserved regions (166–288nt, 290–455nt, 652–671nt), which were also supported by sequence alignments. Remarkably, the short conserved region (652–671nt) turned out to be a crossover hotspot. In addition, four crossover patterns (two single and two double crossovers) could be used to produce viable recombinants. CONCLUSION: The reverse genetics system, which involves the use of high-throughput sequencing, creates a genetic platform to study the generation of viable recombinant viruses.",,"Chen, N.;Chand, R.

Real-time RT-PCR showed a unique course of infection for the SCID group. During the course of infection, viremia was initially significantly lower than in normal littermates, but was significantly increased after 21 days. Deep sequencing of viral structural genes at days 11 and 21 identified seven amino acid substitutions in both normal and SCID pigs. The most significant change was a W99R substitution in GP2, which was present in the inoculum at a frequency of 35% but eventually disappeared in all pigs regardless of immune status. Therefore, amino acid substitutions that occur during an acute infection are likely the result of adaptation of the virus to replicate in pigs and not of immune selection.",,"Chen, N.;Dekkers, J.

However, the virome of PEDV-infected pigs and its effect on the severity of the disease are still unknown. Advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for each host. Methods: The aim of this study was to characterize the RNA vioma in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrhea-affected piglets in 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. Results: Bioinformatic analysis based on the Kraken algorithm revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (genus Alphacoronavirus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217) and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). 58 of 217 piglets (27%) had only one PEDV infection, while the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 to 9 different viruses.

351,"A novel astrovirus species in the gut of yaks with diarrhea in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 2013","The yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Diarrhea is a common disease in yaks, leading to large economic losses. To examine the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomic-derived virome in a pooled fecal sample from 20 diarrheal yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhea samples were, in order of nucleic acid sequence: influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine -Enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared to healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhea samples, suggesting a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a nearly complete genome was obtained from a diarrheal sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4-66.2% similarity to other related bovine faecal AstVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome showed that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting that a new AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had greater similarity and genetic relatedness to deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that a possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2. In conclusion, this study has advanced our understanding of diarrhea yak viral communities and identified a new AstV that has been associated with diarrhea in yaks.",,"Chen, X.;Zhang, B.;Yue, H.;Wang, Y.;Zhou, F.;Zhang, Q.;Tang, C.",2015.0,,10.1099/jgv.0.000303,1
352,Cloning and molecular characterization of the ORF5 gene from a PRRSV-SN strain from southwest China,"To monitor the genetic variation of PRRSV, the ORF5 gene of PRRSV-SN strain found in Suining City, Sichuan Province was cloned and sequenced. The results indicated that the PRRSV-SN strain was a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) variant strain with the North American (NA) genotype. Homology analysis showed that the ORF5 gene of the PRRSV SN isolate shared 89.4% (86.5%) nucleotide (amino acid) sequence similarity to the North American strain VR-2332, 98.8% (96%) similarity to JXA1 and 63.8% (57.7%) similarity to the Lelystad virus strain representative of the European type. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRRSV-SN belongs to the NA genotype and shares the same subtype as other highly pathogenic PRRSV strains. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that PRRSV-SN has different degrees of variation in the signal peptide, transmembrane region (TM), primary neutralizing epitope (PNE), non-neutral epitopes and N-glycosylation sites compared to VR2332 strain. Antigenicity analyzes showed that the ORF5 gene products of PRRSV-SN and JXA1 have similar antigenic properties and the antigenic epitopes are mainly located in the aa30-39, aa50-60, aa128-141, aa146-155 and aa161-183 regions. In contrast, the antigenic properties of PRRSV-SN are quite different from those of the VR2332 strain. The main differences were that the PRRSV SN strain was significantly narrower than the VR2332 strain in the aa30-39 and the aa50-60 regions, but was significantly broader in the aa136-141 region. The results of this study showed that the epidemic strains causing outbreaks of PRRSV in the farm are still mainly JXA1 variants, but due to the more frequent use of live vaccine immunizations, the genes of the PRRSV epidemic strain still show constant variation. Vaccination with live PRRSV should be reduced and surveillance of PRRSV strains improved.",,"Chen, X. W.;Li, L.;Yin, M.;Wang, Q.;Luo, W. T.;Ma, Y.;Pu, Z. H.;Zhou, J. L.",2017.0,Nov,,0

METHODS: Eight genes from Sw/GX/13/06 were cloned and genetically analyzed. RESULTS: The hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M), and nonstructural (NS) genes of Sw/GX/13/06 were most closely related to genes from the classical swine H1N1 influenza virus lineage related. The neuraminidase (NA) and PB1 genes were most closely related to the corresponding genes from the human influenza H3N2 virus lineage. The remaining two genes, PA and PB2 polymerase genes, were most closely related to the genes from the avian influenza virus lineage.

354,Gene expression profile upon activation of RIG-I in 5'ppp dsRNA-challenged DF1,"The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) can recognize influenza viruses and trigger the innate immune response. RIG-I is absent from the chicken genome but conserved in the duck genome. The absence of RIG-I makes chickens more susceptible to avian influenza infection and the clinical signs are more pronounced than in other poultry. It is not known whether introduction of duck RIG-I into chicken cells can establish immunity as seen in ducks, and the role of RIG-I in established immunity is unknown. In this study, a chicken cell strain with stable expression of duRIG-I was established by lentiviral infection, resulting in DF1/LV5-RIG-I, and a control strain DF1/LV5 was established in parallel. To verify stable, high-level expression of duRIG-I in DF1 cells, duRIG-I mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Furthermore, double-stranded 5'-triphosphate RNA (5'ppp-dsRNA) was used to mimic RNA virus infection and the infected DF1/LV5-RIG-I and DF1/LV5 cells were subjected to high-throughput RNA sequencing , which yielded 193.46 M reads and 39.07 G bases. A total of 278 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), ie duRIG-I-mediated responsive genes, were identified by RNA-seq. Among the 278 genes, 120 DEGs are annotated in the KEGG database, and the most reliable KEGG pathways are probably the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. Functional analysis by gene ontology (GO) reveals that the functions of these DEGs are primarily related to type I interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-β-mediated cellular responses, and upregulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway. Based on the common genes of different signaling pathways, a network representing the crosstalk between RIG-I and other signaling pathways was constructed using Cytoscape software. The network suggests that RIG-mediated signaling may interact with Jak-STAT signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Wnt signaling, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and MAPK signaling during the transmission of antiviral signals . After screening, a panel of important responsive genes in RIG-I-mediated signaling pathways, such as ISG12-2, Mx1, IFIT5, TRIM25, USP18, STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, IRF7, and IRF8, were analyzed for differential expression by real-time RT-PCR. In summary, by combining our results and the current literature, we propose a RIG-I-mediated signaling network in chickens.",,"Chen, Y.;Xu, Q.;Li, Y.;Liu, R.;Huang, Z.;Wang, B.;Chen, G.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.dci.2016.07.009,0
355,Characterization of a newly discovered bacteriophage infecting Bordetella bronchiseptica in pigs,"novel virulent bacteriophage, vB_BbrM_PHB04, infecting Bordetella bronchiseptica was isolated from wastewater collected from a pig farm in China. The phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 showed growth over a wide range of temperature and pH conditions and showed different efficiencies of plating values and lytic spectra within the same strains at 25°C and 37°C. High-throughput sequencing revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative open reading frames. Overall, the genome of vB_BbrM_PHB04 showed very little similarity (the highest nucleotide identity 82%, 1% coverage) to other phage sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the family Myoviridae. Furthermore, detection of phage genes in phage-resistant B. bronchiseptica variants based on the polymerase chain reaction did not indicate any lysogenic activity of the phage vB_BbrM_PHB04.",,"Chen, Y.;Yang, L.;Sun, E.;Song, J.;Wu, B.",2019.0,,10.1007/s00705-018-4034-0,0

Genomic sequences of 66 PRRSV strains were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the US in 2014 to examine contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the coat proteins identified four to eight distinct lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To examine the impact of observed genetic diversity on antigenicity, genomic regions encoding either GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were mutated by alleles from each of eight different PRRSV strains using reverse replaced genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region from only four of the eight strains yielded viable recombinant virus. When viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M affected antigenicity differently. A strain-dependent significant loss of cross-reactivity was variably observed by indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with commercial modified live vaccines after replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using antisera from naturally exposed PRRSV pigs.

Bayesian phylogenetics was used to assess the evolution of this virus. A mean substitution rate of 1.4 x 10 x 3 substitutions/site/year was found for both BVDV1 and BVDV2. Evolution rates in the E2 gene were slightly faster than in other regions. We also identified population structures below the subgenotype level that are likely to have phenotypic effects. Two distinct clusters within BVDV2a are present and can be distinguished in part by a tyrosine to isoleucine mutation at position 963 in the E2 protein, a position associated with the antigenicity of BVDV1 isolates. Pronounced accumulation within all subgenotypes, particularly BVDV2a, is evident and could lead to new levels of genotypic classification.

365,Genome analysis of orf virus isolates from goats in Fujian province in southern China,"Orf virus (ORFV), a species of the genus Parapoxvirus of the family Poxviridae, causes a non-systemic, highly contagious and outbreak disease in sheep, goats and other wild and domestic ruminants. Our work to date shows that ORF is ubiquitous in Fujian province of China, a region where there is considerable heterogeneity among ORFVs. In this study, we sequenced whole genomes of four Fujian goat ORFV strains (OV-GO, OV-YX, OV-NP and OV-SJ1). The four strains were 132-139 kb in length, each containing 124-132 genes and approximately 64% G+C content. The most notable differences between the four strains were found near the ends of the genome. Compared to other ORFVs, OV-NP lacked seven and OV-SJ1 three genes near the right terminus. We also examined the skin virulence of the four Fujian ORFVs in goats. The ORFVs with gene deletions showed low virulence, while the ORFVs without gene deletions showed high virulence in goats, suggesting that gene deletion may result in attenuation of ORFVs. Gene 134 has been disrupted in the OV-NP genome due to the absence of the original code. The phylogenetic tree based on complete parapoxvirus genomes showed that ovine and caprine ORFV formed distinct branches with 100% bootstrap. Based on the phylogenetic single gene tree of 132 genes of ORFVs, 47 genes can be easily distinguished as ovine or caprine. To further uncover the genetic variation presented in goat ORFVs and sheep ORFVs, we analyzed the deduced amino acid sequences of gene 008, multiple alignment of gene 008 amino acid sequences from the genomes of five goat ORFVs and four sheep ORFVs yielded 33 unique amino acid acids , distinguishing it as having sheep or goats as its host. The availability of genomic sequences of four Fujian goat ORFVs supports our understanding of the diversity of orf virus isolates in this region and may aid in distinguishing between ovine and caprine orf strains.",,"Chi, X.;Zeng, X.;Li, W.;Hao, W.;Li, M.;Huang, X.;Huang, Y.;Rock, D.

Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyzes of the entire ORFV genes 011 (B2L), 059 (F1L), 032 and 080 showed that the virus phylogeny, although clustered in branches of conventional ORF virus strains, still showed high variation within this subgroup . Furthermore, the sequences of the ORFV 080 gene allowed us to discriminate between the different strains with a higher resolution and these observations provided us with a comparative view of the ORFV 080 gene.

The PCV2 genome has three major open reading frames (ORFs), of which ORF2 encodes the capsid protein. In this study, the ORF2 nucleotide sequences of 30 Brazilian isolates were analyzed. The sequences were compared to other GenBank sequences using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. Our results show a high sequence variability in Brazil, since in this work the Brazilian isolates were divided into subgroups 1AB, 2D and 2, showing that the virus was introduced into Brazil more than once. On the other hand, most Brazilian isolates appear to have descended from just one introduction. According to the Pig Breeders' Association, the virus was probably introduced several times by importing animals with an asymptomatic form of the virus or by importing contaminated semen.

368,Ranaviruses and other members of the Iridoviridae family: their place in the virosphere,"Members of the family Iridoviridae, collectively referred to as iridovirids, are large, double-stranded DNA-containing viruses that infect invertebrates and cold-blooded (ectothermic) vertebrates. Infections in the former often result in massive viral replication, causing the infected animal to become scaly and eventually fatal. Among the latter, infections target a variety of organs and can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality in commercially and ecologically important fish and amphibian species. The viral replication strategy was elucidated primarily by examining frog virus 3 (FV3) with additional input from other iridovirids of ecological or commercial importance. Replication occurs within both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and involves synthesis of genome length and concatemeric DNA, extensive methylation of the viral genome (vertebrate viruses only), coordinated expression of three classes of viral gene products, and formation of icosahedral virions within the cytoplasmic viral assembly sites. Phylogenetic analyzes describe five genera within the family and suggest that members of the families Iridoviridae, Ascoviridae, and Marseilleviridae form a monophyletic lineage in which ascoviruses are most closely related to invertebrate iridoviruses.",,"Chinchar, V.

369,Genetic diversity of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains from Iran,"Background: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae family and the Nairovirus genus. It has a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 19.2 kb in size and contains small, medium, and large segments. CCHFVs are relatively diverse in their genomic sequence and are grouped into seven distinct clades based on S-segment sequence analysis and six clades based on M-segment sequences. Our aim was to gain new insights into the molecular epidemiology of CCHFV in Iran. Methods: We analyzed partial and complete nucleotide sequences of the S and M segments from 50 Iranian patients. The extracted RNA was amplified using one-step RT-PCR and then sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using Mega5 software. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of partial S-segment sequences showed that clade IV-(Asia 1), clade IV-(Asia 2) and clade V-(Europe) accounted for 80%, 4% and 14% of the circulating genomic variants of CCHFV However, one of the Iranian tribes (Iran-Kerman/22) was not associated with any other sequence and formed a new clade (VII). Phylogenetic analysis of complete S-segment nucleotide sequences of selected Iranian CCHFV strains, complemented by representative strains from GenBank, revealed a similar topology as subsequences with eight major clusters. A partial M-segment phylogeny positioned the Iranian tribes in association with either Clade III (Asia-Africa) or Clade V (Europe). Conclusion: Phylogenetic analysis revealed subtle links between distant geographic locations, which we suggest could originate either from international livestock trade or from long-distance transmission of CCHFV by infected ticks via bird migration.",,"Chinikar, S.;Bouzari, S.;Shokrgozar, M.

One isolate (CT-PCV-P7) was from a neonatal pig with CT, type A2, in the late 1960's. Two recent PCV isolates (CT-PCV-P5, CT-PCV-P6) were from 2 affected newborn pigs from different farms with independent CT outbreaks; Type A2. Four isolates (PMWS-PCV-P1, PMWS-PCV-P2, PMWS-PCV-P3, PMWS-PCV-P4) were from pigs with PMWS from 4 different herds. A comparative analysis of these PMWS and PCV isolates showed 99% sequence identity to each other and over 96% sequence identity to previously sequenced PCV2 isolates. However, the CT-PCV-P5 and CT-PCV-P6 isolates shared 99% the same identity with each other and, interestingly, with PMWS-PCV isolates as well. There were no consistent genomic differences between PMWS and more recent CT isolates. The CT-PCV-P7 showed 98% identity similarity with PK-15-derived PCV1 and showed only 72% identity similarity with either CT-PCV-P5 or CT-PCV-P6. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the old isolate (CT-PCV-P7) and the new isolates (CT-PCV-P5, CT-PCV-P6, PMWS-PCV-PI, PMWS-PCV-P2, PMWS-PCV-P3 , PMWS-PCV-P4) were correctly classified as PCVI and PCV2, respectively.",,"Choi, J.;Stevenson, G.

In this study, viral metagenomics was used to identify which viruses are present in Rhipicephalus spp. available. Ticks collected from the Zambezi Valley in Mozambique. Methods: RNA was amplified using sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were quality checked and classified by BLAST. CodonCode aligners and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. Results: The majority of viral sequences showed the closest sequence identity to the family Orthomyxoviridae, although viruses resembling Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2 and PA) were obtained, which showed 32-52% amino acid identity to known quaranjaviruses. The sequences were most closely related to Wellfleet Bay virus, which was discovered and isolated from eider ducks during a mortality event in the United States.

There were a maximum of four AA differences within epitopes in the first three seasons (2011–14) and fifteen in the final season (2014–15). Deviation to a greater number of AA differences was found to be more significant in isolates from vaccinated compared to unvaccinated patients (P=0.0005 in 2011-14; P=0.0096 in 2014-15). AA difference rates within epitopes were also significantly higher in isolates from vaccinated than non-vaccinated patients (2.64% vs. 2.14% for 2011–14, P=0.033; 7.78% vs. 6, 59% for 2014-15, P=0.058). . The AA differences at seven sites (48I-278K, 128A-142G, 145S, 158K, and 193S) became dominant in subsequent seasons. At all of these sites, dominance was maintained during isolate mismatch with vaccine strains and was lost after vaccine match. Our data suggest that in humans, vaccination-induced immune pressure helps to select for influenza variants that are genetically distant from vaccine strains.",,"Chong, Y.;Ikematsu, H.",2017.0,01 05,,0

In this study, NGS was applied to poultry clinical specimens from Jordan to detect eleven low pathogenic H9N2 avian influenza viruses (LPAIV). All viruses tested belonged to the Middle Eastern genetic group A of the G1 lineage. Deep sequencing revealed a high degree of heterogeneity of the glutamine and leucine residues at position 226 in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, increasing specificity for avian or mammalian-type receptors. In addition, additional amino acid changes were identified in PB1, PA, M1, M2 and NS1 in the viruses tested. Compared to single gene amplification, the application of NGS to monitor and characterize H9N2-LPAIV provides a complete genetic profile of emerging isolates and a better understanding of the potential for zoonotic transmission to mammals.",,"Chrzastek, K.;Lee, D.

Aims: To identify novel viruses in human stool samples from patients with diarrhea and to study the ecology and clinical significance of such viruses. Study design: Nucleic acids extracted from stool samples from patients with diarrhea of no known etiology were subjected to random PCR amplification and Roche/454 pyrosequencing. Newly identified viruses were characterized genetically and epidemiologically. Results: Four gyroviruses, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus (HGV)/avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV3), and a novel gyrovirus (tentatively designated gyrovirus 4 (GyV4)) were identified in human stool samples. GyV4 as well as CAV and AGV2/HGV have also been detected in chicken skin and meat for human consumption. Conclusions: A novel gyrovirus (GyV4) was identified in human stool and chicken meat sold for human consumption. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from previously reported chick and human gyroviruses (chicken anemia virus, human gyrovirus, avian gyrovirus 2, and recently reported gyrovirus 3).

384,Pathotyping and phylogenetic characterization of Newcastle disease viruses isolated in Peru: definition of two new subgenotypes within genotype XII,"Infections of poultry with virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1), also known as Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs), cause Newcastle disease (ND). This highly contagious disease affects poultry and many other bird species worldwide. In countries where the disease is widespread, constant monitoring and characterization of the isolates causing outbreaks is required. In this study, we report the results of pathogenicity testing and phylogenetic analysis of seven NDVs isolated from several regions of Peru between 2004 and 2015. Six viruses had intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPIs) between 1.75 and 1.88, consistent with a velogenic pathotype. The remaining virus had an ICPI of 0.00, consistent with a lentogenic pathotype. These results were consistent with the amino acid sequences at the cleavage site of the fusion protein (F). All velogenic isolates had the polybasic amino acid sequence 112RRQKRâ†“F117 at the F cleavage site. Phylogenetic analyzes of complete F gene sequences showed that all isolates are classified in class II of APMV-1. The velogenic viruses are assigned to genotype XII, while the lentogenic virus is assigned to genotype II, which is closely related to the LaSota vaccine strain. In addition, tree topology, bootstrap values, and genetic distances observed within genotype XII led to the identification of new subgenotypes XIIa (in South America) and XIIb (in China), and possibly two clades within genotype XIIa. All velogenous Peruvian viruses belonged to subgenotype XIIa. Overall, our results confirm the presence of genotype XII in Peru and suggest that it is the genotype currently common in our country. The phylogenetic characterization of these isolates helps characterize the evolution of NDV and can aid in the development of vaccines specific to our regional needs.",,"Chumbe, A.;Izquierdo-Lara, R.;Tataje, L.;Gonzalez, R.;Cribillero, G.;GonzÃ¡lez, A.

385,Introduction to the Ecology of Arboviruses (Russian),"Arboviruses represent the largest group of vertebrate viruses. By 1972, around 400 arboviruses had been registered worldwide, of which around 260 viruses were divided into 41 groups based on their antigenic properties; 130 viruses are not yet grouped. In the universal classification system of viruses, arboviruses are classified into 6 genea: alfavirus, flavivirus, rhabdovirus, reovirus, arenavirus, and enterovirus. Members of these genera differ markedly in biology, morphology, and biochemical and antigenic properties, indicating the heterogeneous character of the arbovirus group. The heterogeneity of this group suggests that the arthropod transmission route of the viruses originates independently from different systematically removed virus genera. All known arboviruses are only pathogenic to vertebrates. They also multiply in arthropod tissue (in vivo and in vitro), but have no pathogenic effect there. It is noteworthy that arthropod specific viruses do not replicate in vertebrate tissues. Cycles of arbovirus circulation are largely determined by trophic relationships of hematophagous arthropods to vertebrates. These relations are most numerous in the group of mammals parasitized by ca. 2500 species of midges, midges, sand flies and ixodid, argasid and gamasid ticks. The trophic relationships of arbovirus vectors with birds are significantly inferior to those with mammals. Apparently, no more than 500 species of hematophages of this category are associated with birds. The most numerous relatives of this group of vertebrates are found in mosquitoes and argasid ticks. Close trophic relationship reptilia reptilla is shown by mosquitoes of the genus Deinocerites, some sandflies of the genus Sergentomyia and all ixodid ticks of the genus Aponoma. The total number of species of arbovirus vectors parasitizing on reptiles does not exceed 50. From an ecological point of view, 212 arboviruses can be classified as mammalian, 39 avian and 3 reptilian arboviruses. There is a close positive correlation (coefficient 0.90) between the number of vectors trophically related to one or another group of soil vertebrates and the number of arboviruses specific to that group. The majority of arboviruses are found on one continent, but spread across two to three continents when they have connections to the mainland (North and South America, Africa, and Eurasia). Arboviruses found in the western and eastern hemispheres are ecologically associated with humans (dengue 2 and 3, yellow fever), domestic animals (sheep bluetongue, wad medani), or with migratory birds and their narrowly specific parasites (Tyuleniy virus).

390,Metasecretome-selective phage display approach to unlock the functional potential of a ruminal microbial community,"BACKGROUND: In silico, secretome proteins can be predicted from fully sequenced genomes using various available algorithms that identify membrane targeting sequences. For metasecretomes (collection of surface, secreted, and transmembrane proteins from environmental microbial communities), this approach is impractical, considering that the metasecretome open reading frames (ORFs) represent only 10% to 30% of the total metagenome and in the overdue data set poorly represented lead to an overall poor coverage of the metagenomic gene pool, even in large projects. RESULTS: By combining secretome-selective phage display and next-generation sequencing, we focused sequence analysis of the complex rumen microbial community to the metasecretome component of the metagenome. This approach achieved high accumulation (29-fold) of secreted fibrolytic enzymes from the plant-adherent microbial community of bovine rumen. In particular, we have identified hundreds of previously rare modules belonging to cellulosomes, cell-surface complexes specialized for plant fiber recognition and degradation. CONCLUSIONS: As a method, metasecretome phage display combined with next-generation sequencing has the ability to probe the diversity of surface and secreted proteins at low abundance that would otherwise require extraordinarily large metagenomic sequencing projects. As a resource, the metasecretome display library, supported by the data set obtained by next-generation sequencing, is ready for i) affinity selection by standard phage display methodology and ii) easy purification of displayed proteins as part of the virion for the individual functional analysis.",,"Ciric, M.;Moon, C.

BVDV is an RNA virus with high genomic variability that has practical implications for epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease control. Genetic surveillance has been proposed as a first step in combating BVDV. Thirty-seven bovine viral diarrheal viruses were identified and genetically characterized in persistently infected cattle, animals affected by mucosal disease and in bulk milk. The 5-UTR region was amplified and sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed comparing all Italian sequences of BVDV available in the Genbank database. An unusual number of persistently infected animals were detected on more than one farm. Phylogenetic analysis assigned all our viruses to BVDV type I and distinguished four distinct subgroups within this genotype.

392,Detection of Tunisian-like pestiviruses in small ruminants in Italy since 2007,"The genus Pestivirus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, includes ssRNA+ viruses responsible for infectious diseases in swine, cattle, sheep, goats and other domestic and wild ruminants. Like most RNA viruses, pestivirus has high genome variability with practical implications for epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease control. In addition to the officially recognized species of the genus Pestivirus, such as BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BDV and CSFV, other pestiviruses have been detected. In addition, most ruminant pestiviruses show little or no species specificity, which has been observed in serological tests, and are capable of infecting multiple species. Small ruminants in particular are susceptible hosts for the most heterogeneous group of pestiviruses. The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of pestiviruses isolated from sheep and goats in Sicily, Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two viral genomic regions (a fragment of the 5'-UTR and the entire Npro regions) revealed the presence of different pestivirus genotypes in the goat and sheep herds analyzed. Two out of five viral isolates were clustered with BVDV-1d viruses, a strain widespread in Italy but never reported in Sicily. The other three isolates formed a distinct cluster with high similarity to Tunisian isolates recently proposed as new pestivirus species. This is the first evidence of the presence of Tunisian-like pestiviruses in small ruminants in Italy. In addition, one of the isolates was collected from a goat, representing the first isolation of a Tunisian pestivirus from this species.",,"Ciulli, S.;Purpari, G.;Agnello, S.;Di Marco, P.;Di Bella, S.;Volpe, E.;Mira, F.;de Aguiar Saldanha Pinheiro, A.

393,Correlates of protection from human rotavirus disease and the factors affecting protection in low-income settings,"Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and children worldwide and is associated with high mortality, especially in low-income areas. The virus is classified into G and P serotypes and further into P genotypes based on differences in the surface-exposed proteins VP7 and VP4, respectively. Infection results in a variable level of protection from subsequent reinfection and disease. This protection is predominantly homotypic in some situations, while broader heterotypic protection is reported in other cohorts. Two antigenically distinct oral RV vaccines are licensed and being widely distributed, including in resource-constrained settings, with funding from the GAVI Alliance. The first is a monovalent vaccine derived from a live attenuated human RV strain, while the second is a pentavalent bovine-human reassortment vaccine. Both vaccines are highly effective in high-income settings, but greatly reduced levels of protection are reported in low-income countries. Here, the current challenges facing mucosal immunologists and vaccinators aiming to define immunological correlates and to understand the variable levels of protection that these vaccines confer in humans are considered. Such an understanding is critical to maximize the public health impact of current vaccines and also for the development of the next generation of RV vaccines that are needed.",,"Clarke, E.;Desselberger, U.",2015.0,,10.1038/mi.2014.114,0

The individual genome segments of each isolate were characterized by partial digestion of terminally radioactively labeled RNA with a base-specific nuclease. This analysis showed that while mobility variations were always associated with detectable changes in nucleotide sequence, sequence changes at least as large as those found in segments that showed electrophoretic mobility variation were also detected in segments that did not show mobility variation. Evidence for the occurrence of genomic segment rearrangement between viruses in the field was obtained by analysis of species 11 RNAs from these five isolates. The general conclusion from these results is that great care is needed in interpreting simple genomic profile analyzes of different isolates for epidemiological purposes and that classifying these viruses solely on the basis of genomic electropherotype could be misleading.",,"Clarke, I.

The two Hong Kong strains could be easily distinguished from the earlier A(2) strains by the resistance of their hemagglutinins to trypsin treatment and their inability to regain hemagglutination capacity after removal of dithiothreitol from treated virus preparations. In this respect, the horse strain most closely resembled the Hong Kong variants. The pattern of hemagglutination inactivation also distinguishes the porcine, PR8 and CAME strains from each other and from the other five strains. The results suggest that the classification of type A viruses into groups according to the pattern of inactivation of their hemagglutinins can be a valuable adjunct to standard serology for a more accurate classification of these viruses.",,"Cleeland, R.;Grunberg, E.;Prince, H.

397,"A complex mosaic of enteroviruses shapes the transmission and evolution of community-acquired hand, foot, and mouth disease within a single hospital","Human enteroviruses (EV) pose a major public health risk. This is particularly true in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are increasing numbers of cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and large outbreaks of severe neurological disorders associated with EV-A71 have occurred. Despite their importance, key aspects of EV emergence, epidemiology, and evolution remain unclear, and most studies on EV evolution have focused on a limited set of genes. Here we describe the genomic evolution of EV-A viruses collected from pediatric patients with mild disease who attended a single hospital in western Sydney, Australia over an 18 month period. This analysis revealed the presence of eight viral serotypes - Coxsackievirus (CV) A2, A4, A5, A6, A8, A10, A16 and EV-A71 - with up to four different serotypes circulating each month. Although no large-scale outbreaks have occurred, a high degree of geographic and temporal mixing of serotypes has been identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple strains of the same serotype were present in the community and that this diversity was characterized by multiple introductions into the Sydney population, with only a single lineage of CV-A6 showing in situ transmission throughout the study period . Genomic analyzes also revealed the presence of new and historical EV recombinants. Notably, our analysis found no association between viral phylogeny, including serotype, and age, sex, or disease severity (in uncomplicated disease). This study highlights the contribution of EV-A viruses other than EV-A71 to mild EV disease, including HFMD in Australia, and underscores the need for increased surveillance of these viruses to improve outbreak preparedness strategies and vaccine design .",,"Cobbin, J.

399,Characterization of ncRNAs in human pathogenic protists using high-throughput sequencing technology,"ncRNAs are key genes in many human diseases, including cancer and viral infections, and have critical functions in pathogenic organisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and protists. Until now, the identification and characterization of ncRNAs associated with disease has been slow or imprecise, requiring many years of testing to understand intricate RNA and protein-gene relationships. High-throughput sequencing now offers the ability to characterize miRNAs, siRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and long ncRNAs at the genomic level, making it faster and easier to elucidate how these ncRNAs contribute to disease state. However, this technology is still relatively new and ncRNA discovery is not a high-priority application for optimized bioinformatics. Here we summarize background concepts and practical approaches to ncRNA analysis using high-throughput sequencing and how it relates to understanding human disease. As a case study, we focus on the parasitic protists Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, for which the large evolutionary distance has led to difficulties in comparing ncRNAs with those of model eukaryotes. A combination of biological, computational, and sequencing approaches has enabled easier classification of ncRNA classes such as snoRNAs, but also aided in the identification of new classes. It is hoped that a better understanding of ncRNA expression and interaction can aid in the development of less harsh treatments for protist-based diseases.",,"Collins, L. J.",2011.0,,,0
400,The recently identified flavivirus Bamaga virus is transmitted horizontally by Culex mosquitoes and disrupts West Nile virus replication in vitro and transmission in vivo,"Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as yellow fever (YFV), Zika, and dengue viruses continue to cause significant human disease worldwide. These viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes when a female ingests an infected blood meal from a viraemic vertebrate host and spits the virus out into a subsequent host. Bamagavirus (BgV) is a flavivirus recently discovered in mosquitoes of the Culex sitiens subgroup collected from the Cape York Peninsula in Australia. This virus groups phylogenetically with the YFV group but may be restricted to most vertebrates. However, high levels of replication in a possum cell line (OK) indicate a possible association with marsupials. To determine whether BgV could be horizontally transmitted by mosquitoes, the vector competence of two members of the Cx. Sitiens subgroup, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, for the BgV was examined. Eleven to thirteen days after ingestion of an infectious blood meal, the infection rates were 11.3% and 18.8% for Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens or Cx. Annulirostris transmitted the virus at low levels (5.6% had BgV positive saliva overall); Cx. Sitiens did not transmit the virus. When mosquitoes were intrahorassially injected with BgV, the infection and transmission rates for both species were 100% and 82%, respectively. These results provided the first evidence that BgV can be transmitted horizontally from Cx. annulirostris, the main vector of pathogenic zoonotic flaviviruses in Australia. We also investigated whether BgV might disrupt in vitro replication and in vivo infection and transmission of superinfecting pathogenic Culex-associated flaviviruses. BgV significantly reduced the growth of Murray Valley encephalitis virus and West Nile virus (WNV) in vitro.

401,Viromes as a genetic reservoir for the microbial communities in aquatic environments: A focus on antimicrobial resistance genes,"Although studies of viromas isolated from aquatic environments are becoming more common, most of them are limited to characterizing viral taxonomy. Bacterial readouts in viromas abound, but the extent to which this genetic material plays a role in the ecology of aquatic microbiology remains unclear. To this end, we have developed a useful approach to characterize viral and microbial communities of aquatic environments, with a particular focus on identifying microbial genes contained in the viromas. Virus-like particles have been isolated from water samples collected across the Lambro River, from the source to the highly urbanized area of Milan. The derived viromes were analyzed by metagenomic shotgun sequencing looking for the presence and relative abundance of bacterial genes, with a focus on the genes involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes were identified in all virome samples, along with a large number of reads that were assigned to cellular processes and signaling pathways. Virome data compared to those identified in the microbiome isolated from the same sample showed differences in terms of functional categories and their relative abundance. To verify the role of the aquatic virus population in bacterial gene transfer, water-based mesocosms were perturbed or unperturbed with a low dose of tetracycline. The results obtained by qPCR assays revealed variations in the abundance of tet genes in the virome and microbiome, highlighting a relevant role of viral populations in microbial gene mobilization.",,"Colombo, S.;Arioli, S.;Neri, E.;Della Scala, G.;Gargari, G.;Mora, D.",2017.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01095,0

403,Identification of a recombinant enterovirus with torovirus-like gene insertion during an outbreak of diarrhea in fattening pigs,"Outbreaks of diarrhea in pig farms have raised major concerns in Europe and the US because they can result in dramatic pig losses. During a suspected Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) outbreak in Belgium, we performed viral metagenomics to assess other potential viral pathogens. Although PEDV was detected, its low frequency indicated that other viruses were involved in the outbreak. Interestingly, a porcine bocavirus and several enteroviruses were the most common in the sample. We also observed the presence of a porcine enterovirus genome with a gene insertion resembling a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed by resequencing, bioinformatics, and proteomics approaches. Furthermore, the predicted sites for insertion suggest that this gene was expressed as a single protein rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been described as a major mechanism for generating genetic diversity, but gene insertions across viral families are rather uncommon. Although such recombinations between families are rare, our results suggest that these events can contribute significantly to viral evolution.",,"Conceicao-Neto, N.;Theuns, S.;Cui, T.;Zeller, M.;Yinda, C.

406,Hepatitis E virus is widespread in the swine population of Lao People's Democratic Republic and there is evidence of homogeneity with human Chinese genotype 4 isolates,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotypic spectrum of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the swine population of the northern Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). We collected 181 fecal samples from domestic pigs aged 6 months and the fecal samples were stored in RNA stabilization buffer due to cold chain and transport limitations. Twenty-one (11.6%) pigs had detectable HEV RNA and 43.5% of the village pig herds were infected. Based on a 240 base pair nucleotide sequence flanking the junction of open reading frames 1, 2 and 3 (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3), the isolates were classified phylogenetically within genotype 4. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed distinct genetic groupings of the Laotian HEV isolates and two groups of human and porcine HEV isolates from China. This was the first study to detect HEV genotype 4 in the PDR Laos and indicates that pigs are a potential reservoir for human HEV infection. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Conlan, J. V.;Jarman, R.

407,Highly divergent hepaciviruses from African cattle,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV; genus Hepacivirus) is a human pathogen of high relevance. Unique hepaciviruses (HV) have recently been discovered in animal hosts. The direct ancestor of HCV has not been found, but the most genetically related animal HVs exist in horses. To investigate whether other peridomestic animals also carry HVs, we analyzed sera from Ghanaian cattle for HVs by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Nine out of 106 samples from different sampling sites contained HV RNA (8.5%) at a mean viral load of 1.6 × 105 copies/mL. The infection did not appear to be related to the age and sex of the cattle. Nearly complete genome sequencing of five representative viruses confirmed the taxonomic classifications. Bovine HVs formed two distinct phylogenetic lineages that differed by up to 17.7% at the nucleotide level in the polyprotein coding region, suggesting cocirculation of different virus subtypes. A conserved microRNA122 binding site in the 5' internal ribosomal entry site indicated liver tropism of bovine HVs. Phylogenetic analyzes indicated the circulation of HVs in cattle for several centuries. Bovine HVs were genetically very different from all other HVs, including HCV. HVs from genetically related equine and bovine hosts were not monophyletic, confirming host shifts during evolution of the Hepacivirus genus. Similar to equine HVs, the genetic diversity of bovine HVs was low compared to that of HCV genotypes. This suggests an impact of human-modified ecology of peridomestic animals on viral diversity. Further studies should investigate the occurrence of bovine HVs in other geographic areas and breeds, viral pathogenicity in cattle, and the potential exposure of human risk groups such as farmers, butchers, and slaughterhouse workers.",,"Corman, V.

409,Heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies are produced by individuals immunized with a seasonal influenza vaccine,"The target of neutralizing antibodies that protect against influenza virus infection is the viral protein HA. The genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is believed to be specific to some antigenically related isolates within a particular subtype. Although heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have recently been isolated from phage display libraries, it is not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response to influenza virus infection or a vaccine. Here we report that after vaccination with a seasonal influenza vaccine containing influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to multiple HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including pandemic A/ Isolate California/07/09 H1N1. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. With the exception of one mAb that bound to the spherical HA head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA stem region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with influenza viruses representative of different subtypes. These results indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with swine pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and with highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.",,"Corti, D.;Suguitan Jr, A.

Six groups of five animals each received a virulent suspension of different virus strains at a concentration of 103 TCID50/mL and the goats were observed 15 days after infection. PPRV strains Côte-d'Ivoire 89 (CI89), Guinea Conakry and Bissau Guinea caused peracute disease; the India Calcutta tribe caused an acute illness; the Sudan-Sennar strain caused acute to mild disease, while the wild-type Nigeria 75/1 strain caused mild disease and the animals recovered.

Part of the 5"" untranslated region and the 5"" end of the gp53 (E2) coding sequence were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most field isolates segregated into genotypes Ib or II. Only one of 28 field isolates belonged to genotype Ia. Interestingly, some type I strains differed equally from types Ia and Ib and clustered into additional subtypes within genotype I. Immune sera from young calves experimentally vaccinated with field isolates, first identified on the basis of their sequences, were obtained used in two-way neutralization experiments. The results clearly distinguished Type I from Type II strains, although some degree of cross-neutralization was observed. Within type I, the new clusters could not be antigenically distinguished from the more common type Ib strains or from the type Ia strain NADL, suggesting that BVDV genotype I is antigenically homogeneous. The isolation of BVDV type I and II strains from cell lines and from a bovine vaccine suggests that molecular epidemiological surveillance for BVDV is warranted. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Couvreur, B.;Letellier, C.;Collard, A.;Quenon, P.;Dehan, P.;Hamers, C.;Pastoret, P.

412,Animal genomics in natural reservoirs of infectious diseases,"Natural virus reservoirs such as wild bats, birds, rodents and non-human primates are generally not model organisms, which until recently have offered limited opportunities for in-depth studies. Next-generation sequencing offers a way to partially circumvent this limitation, as the methods required for data acquisition and analysis are largely species-independent. Comparative genomics and other omics offer new opportunities to study the structure and function of diverse biological systems in wild species that are otherwise unattainable. Genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help identify dominant pathways of virus-host interaction and reveal differences between susceptible and resistant organisms, populations and species. This is of great scientific interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments for viral diseases in humans and livestock. In this way we will “learn from nature” and one day apply this knowledge to breed disease-resistant livestock or to develop novel therapy and prevention strategies. The genomics of the reservoir host will also open up opportunities for the development of novel vaccines for wildlife, aid in the development of new diagnostic platforms, and have far-reaching implications for developmental and evolutionary biology. In this review, the authors focus on natural reservoir hosts of viral pathogens, although most of the discussion points should be equally applicable to natural reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, or other parasites.",,"Cowled, C.;Wang, L.

413,Pseudorabies virus infection in Oklahoma hounds,"Pseudorabies are caused by suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although pigs are the natural host of pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a wide host range and can cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States gained PRV-free status in 2004 after eradicating the virus from native swineherds, but the virus is still present in feral pig populations. The current report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs used to hunt wild boar. The dogs developed clinical signs including facial itching with facial abrasions, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle stiffness and death. Two were euthanized and 1 died within approximately 48 hours of the onset of clinical symptoms. The prominent histological changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neuronophagia and equivocal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissue from 2 of the dogs and immunohistochemistry detected the virus in the third dog. Virus sequencing and phylogeny, based on available GenBank sequences, indicated that the virus was likely a field strain closely related to a group of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Although PRV has been eradicated from domestic pigs in the United States, it is present in feral pig populations and should therefore continue to be considered as a possible cause of disease in dogs and other domestic animals with compatible clinical histories and symptoms.

To understand the relationship between H5N1 viruses circulating in poultry and the viruses isolated from humans, extensive phylogenetic and molecular analyzes of viruses derived from both hosts in Vietnam between 2003 and 2010 were performed. We examined the temporal and spatial distribution of human cases relative to H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and characterized the genetic lineages and amino acid substitutions in each gene segment identified in humans in comparison to closely related avian host viruses. Six emagglutinin clades and 8 genotypes have been identified in humans, all of which were originally identified in poultry.

While Clade 1.1 viruses existed in southern regions, there were three genetically distinct subgroups of Clade 2.3.2.1 found in northern and central Vietnam.

417,Main molecular aspects of human coronaviruses and homologies with animal coronavirus strains,"Beginning in 1965, following the discovery of several new human respiratory pathogens, a group of viruses that had been known since 1937, though not under the name of coronavirus, emerged. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and some newly described human respiratory viruses named OC43 and 229E showed a similar appearance. These viruses displayed a characteristic fringe of large, prominent, petal-shaped peplomers, or spikes, resembling a crown. They were named “coronaviruses” after this characteristic. Shortly after, several new viruses were added to the coronavirus group, causing disease in pigs, rats, turkeys, dogs, cats and cattle. The variety of infected animal species and the large number of organ systems involved have made Coronaviridae one of the most important virus families in veterinary medicine. The two human coronaviruses (HCV) HCV-OC43 and HCV-229E belong to different antigenic groups. HCV-OC43 has an antigenic correlation with neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus (NCDCV), swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and MHV. HCV-229E is antigenically related to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCV). Coronaviruses as a group contain a single-stranded, positive RNA genome of 27 to 31 kb with an estimated molecular weight of 6 x 106 to 8 x 106 daltons. In infected cells, the viral RNA genome is first transcribed into a full-length negative-strand RNA, which is in turn transcribed into a positive genomic RNA and six to eight subgenomic mRNAs by a mechanism of leader-primed transcription.",,"Cristallo, A.;Gambaro, F.;Battaglia, M.;Cereda, P.

The progeny were tested for resistance to representative viruses of the A, B and tentatively defined C subgroups on both the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture. The segregation ratios of resistance to subgroups A and B viruses were consistent with the previously proposed hypothesis that single autosomal recessive genes control resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection on the CAM and replicated slab infection in tissue culture with subgroup A and B virus showed that resistance to subgroups A and B was inherited independently. Assays of viruses tentatively classified as subgroup C showed that they consisted largely of a mixture of subgroups A and B viruses, or of particles with the host range specificity of both. However, virus stocks in the subgroup C category, as well as some stocks classified as subgroup B, produced small numbers of smallpox or herds in individuals known to be resistant to subgroups A and B viruses.

In this study, seven H3-AIVs (four H3N2 and three H3N8) were isolated from poultry in the live poultry market (LPM) in China. Phylogenetic analyzes of whole genomes showed that all viruses were grouped in Eurasian ancestry, except that N8 genes from two H3N8 isolates fell in North American ancestry. Interestingly, the N8 gene of an H3N8 and PB2, PB1, NP and NS of two H3N2 isolates are closely related to those of the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses circulating in Korea and the United States, suggesting that the H3 Similar AIV internal genes could contribute to the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses. HA gene lineage and antigenic cross-reactivity results showed that two antigenically distinct H3 viruses circulate in LPM in China. Most H3 viruses replicated in the lungs and turbinate of mice without prior adaptation, and the representative H3 viruses infected chickens without causing clinical symptoms.

420,"Phylogeny, pathogenicity and transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus in chickens","We analyzed five H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from different birds in China in 2012. We divided the viruses into four genotypes based on whole genome sequences. Viruses DKE26, GSE43 and DKE53 belonged to genotypes 1-3, respectively. The CKE93 and CKE96 viruses have been classified into genotype 4. Genotypes 1-3 correspond to the viruses carrying the clade 2.3.2 HA gene, and genotype 4 is the virus carrying the clade 7.2 HA gene. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of the viruses, we infected chickens with 103 EID50 /0.1 ml GSE43 (clade 2.3.2) or CKE93 (clade 7.2) virus. Our results showed that 6 of 7 specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens vaccinated with GSE43 virus were dead before 7 days post-infection, but all SPF chicks vaccinated with CKE93 virus survived the infection survived. Both GSE43 and CKE93 viruses replicated systemically in chickens. The virus titers of the GSE43 virus in the tested organs were apparently higher than those of the CKE93 virus. Our results showed that the pathogenicity and replication of GSE43 in chickens was much higher than that of CKE93. The GSE43 virus could be transmitted between chickens, but the CKE93 could not be transmitted between chickens by naïve contact. Therefore, different clades of H5N1 AIVs possessed different pathogenicities and transmissibility among chickens.

Since April 2010, the outbreak of DTMUV has caused major economic losses in China's southeastern provinces. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important regulatory role in viral infections by binding to host target genes, or viral genomes. Here, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interaction, we identified the miRNA expression profiles in DTMUV-infected and uninfected DEF cells by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 287 known and 63 new miRNAs were identified. 48 miRNAs, including 26 known miRNAs and 22 new miRNAs, were differentially expressed in response to DTMUV infection. Among these miRNAs, 37 miRNAs were upregulated and 11 miRNAs were downregulated. 9 miRNAs were randomly selected for validation by qRT-PCR experiment. The results of the qRT-PCR experiment agreed with the sequencing data. GO enrichment showed that the predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly involved in the regulation of the immune system, cellular processes, and metabolic processes. Analysis of KEGG signaling pathways revealed that predicted target genes were involved in multiple signaling pathways such as Wnt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway. This is the first study examining changes in miRNA expression in DEF cells after DTMUV infection.

424,Precision Surveillance for Viral Respiratory Pathogens: Virome Capture Sequencing for Detection and Genomic Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Uganda,"Background: Precise public health is a novel set of methods for targeting disease prevention and reduction in high-risk subpopulations. We applied a precise public health strategy to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) syndrome surveillance in Uganda by combining spatio-temporal analysis with genome sequencing to detect and characterize respiratory viral agents with epidemic potential. Methods: Using a national surveillance network, we identified patients with unexplained, influenza-negative SARI from 2010-2015. Spatio-temporal analyzes were performed retrospectively to identify clusters of unexplained SARI. Within clusters, respiratory viruses were detected and characterized in naso- and oro-pharyngeal swab specimens using a novel oligonucleotide probe capture (VirCapSeq-VERT) and high-throughput sequencing platform. Linkage to conventional epidemiological strategies further characterized the transmission dynamics of identified pathogens. Results: Among 2,901 unexplained SARI cases, 9 clusters were detected, corresponding to 301 (10.4%) cases. Clusters were more likely to occur in urban areas and during bi-annual rainy seasons. Within the recognized clusters, we identified an unrecognized outbreak of measles-associated SARI; Sequence analysis implied the co-circulation of the endemic B3 genotype and the D4 genotype, probably imported from England. We also discovered a probable nosocomial SARI cluster associated with a novel picobirnavirus most closely related to porcine and dromedary viruses. Conclusions: Using a rigorous public health surveillance approach, we have identified and characterized the genomics of vaccine-preventable and zoonotic respiratory viruses associated with clusters of severe respiratory infections in Uganda.

Although this shared vision survived through the 19th century, it was all but forgotten by the early 20th century. It is now experiencing a renaissance, coinciding with an awakening of the role evolutionary biology plays in human and animal health, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A number of STIs in humans have comparable infections in animals; Likewise, both humans and animals have STIs that are unique to each mammalian camp. These similarities and differences offer opportunities for fundamental medical and public health studies, including evolutionary insights, to be gleaned from ongoing interdisciplinary investigations—particularly with the available molecular analysis tools—in a golden age of mutually beneficial discoveries. © 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Currier, R.

426,Preliminary characterization of D'Aguilar virus and three Palyam group viruses new to Australia,"Between 1974 and 1980, 424 viruses were isolated at the Long Pocket Laboratories of the Division of Animal Health, CSIRO, either from insects or from the blood of sentinel cattle, and of these 165 cross-reacted with D'Aguilar virus (a Australian Palyam group virus) in a complement fixation assay. Using neutralization tests, these viruses were divided into four serotypes with the isolates D'Aguilar B8112, CSIRO 11, CSIRO 58 and CSIRO 82 as type strains. The last three were new to Australia. Like other orbiviruses, these four serotypes were partially sensitive to either or chloroform treatment. Neutralizing antibodies to D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11, and CSIRO 58 viruses were detected in bovine, buffalo, deer, and sheep sera, but not in human, equine, porcine, or marsupial sera. Antibodies to CSIRO 82 virus were detected in 85% of 26 buffalo and 0.4% of 495 bovine sera tested. Antibody distribution in Australia for D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11 and CSIRO 58 viruses fell within the distribution limits of Culicoides brevitarsis, the insect from which these viruses were most commonly recovered. The antibody distribution for CSIRO 82 virus isolated from a pool containing C. schultzei and C. peregrinus fell within the much more restricted distribution limits of these species. None of these viruses have been linked to disease.",,"Cybinski, D. H.;St George, T. D.",1982.0,,,0
427,Third category of genome size of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (Newcastle disease virus) and evolutionary implications,"The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a connection between molecular patterns and virus evolution. Therefore, the complete genome sequence of two different apathogenic strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was determined and a third genome size category of 15,198 nucleotides was identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two major divisions occurred in the history of NDV, resulting in three genome size categories. An ancient division in the ancestral reservoir (wild waterfowl species) resulted in two basal sister clades, class I and II, with genome sizes of 15,198 (due to a 12-nucleotide insert in the phosphoprotein gene) and 15,186 nucleotides, respectively. Progenitors of class II viruses colonized chicken populations and were subsequently converted to virulent forms. These occurred more than once and resulted in an early lineage [including genotypes I-IV and H33(W)] with a genome size of 15,186 nucleotides. A second division occurred in the secondary host (chicken) in the 20th century. This led to the branching of a clade (including recent genotypes V-VIII consisting only of pathogenic viruses) with the simultaneous insertion of six nucleotides into the 5-inch non-coding region of the nucleoprotein gene, increasing the genome size to 15,192 nucleotides. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"CzeglÃ©di, A.;UjvÃ¡ri, D.;Somogyi, E.;Wehmann, E.;Werner, O.;Lomniczi, B.",2006.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2005.11.009,0

In this communication we present a detailed characterization of the causative virus strain. Based on different epitope configurations detected by different monoclonal antibodies, the isolate could be distinguished from other OPV species and was classified as vaccinia virus (CP). This classification was confirmed by a species-specific PCR assay and by physical mapping for the restriction enzymes HindIII and XhoI. Evidence that the infection was acquired from a stray cat is provided based on serological data from neutralization tests, blocking ELISAs and Western blot analysis.",,"Czerny, C.

429,Outbreaks of zoonotic vaccinia viruses in Brazil,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as a live vaccine during the WHO-led campaign to eradicate smallpox in the second half of the 20th century. The program culminated in the eradication of the disease, one of modern medicine's most important achievements. Interestingly, one of the key factors in the successful vaccination campaign - VACV itself - is poorly understood in terms of its natural reservoirs, evolutionary history and origin, since as a naturally occurring virus it is often thought to be extinct. However, orthopoxviruses other than variolavirus have been known to circulate in Brazil since the early 1960s. In particular, VACV has been associated with naturally acquired infections in humans, cattle and possibly other pathogens since 1999, when outbreaks of bovine vaccinia were consistently reported year after year. In this article, we list and discuss the major VACV outbreaks that have occurred in Brazil over the past 20 years.

Here the complete genome sequence of a new type of BPV (BPV 04AC14) recovered from a papillomatous lesion is reported. The genome is 7,282 bp in length and exhibits the classic genetic organization and motifs of members of the Papillomaviridae. Phylogenetic maximum likelihood analyzes revealed that BPV 04AC14 clusters with members of the genus Xipapillomavirus. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 capsid protein of the novel BPV is closely related to its counterpart, BPV3, with which it shares 79% similarity. These results indicate that this virus is a new type of BPV in the genus Xipapillomavirus.",,"Da Silva, F. R. C.;Cibulski, S. P.;Daudt, C.;Weber, M. N.;GuimarÃ£es, L. L. B.;Streck, A. F.;Mayer, F.

At the beginning of the outbreak, little was known about Zika virus morphology, genome structure, modes of transmission, and potential to cause neurological malformations and disorders. As basic research progressed, discoveries of the mechanisms of strain variability, viral transmission to the fetus, and neurovirulence were published. These will surely lead to the development of strategies to block vertical virus transmission, neuronal invasion and pathogenesis in the near future.

432,A fatal case of Louping-ill in a dog: immune localization and full genome sequencing of the virus,"Louping-ill (LI), caused by Louping-ill virus (LIV), causes an often fatal encephalitis that mainly affects sheep and black grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), but also occurs in other species. An adult male border collie dog was diagnosed with definitive lethal LI, and the lesion profile, LIV antigen distribution, and full genome sequence of the responsible LIV were examined to determine if it differed significantly from ovine-derived LIV. There were no gross lesions. The histological lesions were restricted to the central nervous system and included lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, glial foci, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. Immunolocalization of the viral antigen showed that only small amounts were present in neurons. These histological and immunohistochemical findings were similar to those reported in affected sheep. Compared to published complete genome sequences of ovine-derived LIV, there were only very minor differences, and phylogenetically the virus grouped individually between a subclass containing Scottish strains LIV 369/T2 and G and another subclass containing an English isolate LIV A contained. The isolated canine LIV shares a common ancestor with LIV A. These findings suggest that there is no canine-specific strain of LIV, dogs are susceptible to sheep-associated strains of LI, and with the increase in tick prevalence and therefore exposure to LIV a safe, effective vaccine for dogs may be needed.",,"Dagleish, M.

433,Evolutionary analysis of Tembusu virus: Evidence for the emergence of a dominant genotype,"We recently identified Tembusu virus (TMUV) as the causative agent of duck contagious disease, which has been spreading in China since 2010. A recent study has pointed to a possible case of human infection by TMUV, underscoring the need for further investigation of TMUV, particularly its evolution. In the absence of information on the evolution of TMUV, we performed extensive phylogenetic analyzes using the largest collection of complete TMUV open reading frame (ORF) sequences. Our results showed that two viral lineages have been associated with the 2010 outbreak in China, and lineage II, specifically sublineage II-c, has emerged as the dominant lineage currently circulating. We concluded that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of this TMUV arose around 1996. Evidence of natural recombination was also discovered in the TMUV. Molecular fit analyzes showed that strong negative selection shaped the evolution of TMUV, while also identifying a number of codons that were subject to positive pressure. Our study illustrated for the first time the evolutionary history and character of TMUV and will be helpful for the development of vaccines and diagnostics.",,"Dai, L.;Li, Z.;Tao, P.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.004,0
434,Next-generation sequencing strategies to characterize the turkey genome,"The turkey genome sequencing project was initiated in 2008 and relies primarily on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Our initial effort used a synergistic combination of 2 NGS platforms (Roche/454 and Illumina GAII), detailed bacterial artificial chromosome maps (BAC) and unique assembly tools to sequence and assemble the genome of the domesticated turkey Meleagris gallopavo. Since it was first published in 2010, efforts to improve genome assembly, gene annotation, and genome analysis have continued. The initial assembly build (2.01) represented approximately 89% of the genome sequence with 17x depth of coverage (931 Mb). Sequence contigs were assigned to 30 of the 40 chromosomes, with approximately 10% of the assembled sequence corresponding to unassigned chromosomes (ChrUn). The sequence was refined by both genome-wide and area-focused sequencing, including shotgun and paired-end sequencing, and targeted sequencing of chromosomal regions with poor or incomplete coverage. This additional effort has improved sequence assembly, resulting in two consecutive higher genome coverage genome builds (25X/Build3.0 and 30X/Build4.0) with a total current sequence of 1,010 MB. Furthermore, BAC with end sequences mapped to Z/W and MG18 (MHC) chromosomes, ChrUn or not in the previous build were isolated, deeply sequenced (Hi-Seq) and incorporated into the latest build (5.0). To support the annotation and to create a gene expression atlas of the most important tissues, a comprehensive set of RNA samples at different developmental stages was collected from female and male turkeys. Transcriptome sequencing data (using Illumina Hi-Seq) will provide information to improve final assembly and ultimately improve sequence annotation. The most current sequence covers more than 95% of the turkey genome and should yield a significantly improved level of gene annotation, making it a valuable resource for studying genetic variation underlying economically important traits in poultry.",,"Dalloul, R.

435,Characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolates obtained from outbreak cases in commercial chickens and wild pigeons in Ethiopia,"Newcastle disease (ND), caused by the virulent avian paramyxovirus type 1, is one of the major diseases responsible for devastating outbreaks in poultry flocks in Ethiopia. However, information on the genetic properties of Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) circulating in commercial chickens and wild birds is sparse. In this study, we characterized isolates obtained from 2012-2014 ND-suspicious outbreaks from poultry farms (n=8) and feral pigeons (n=4). The NDVs isolated from pathological specimens by inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs were characterized biologically by conventional intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPI) and genetically based on phylogenetic analysis of partial F gene sequences (260 bp) encompassing the cleavage site. The ICPI values of isolates from chickens ranged from 0.9 to 1.8; whereas the ICPI of pigeon isolates was 1.4. All isolates contained several basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial cleavage site of the F gene (260 bp) showed that all virus sequences obtained from pigeons were identical and clustered within genotype VIh, while the virus sequences obtained from chickens were clustered within genotype VIf. The similarity between the viruses obtained from chickens and those obtained from pigeons was between 82.5 and 85.6%. This suggests that different subgenotypes of genotype VI are circulating in the chicken and wild pigeon population in Ethiopia. This warrants further studies to understand the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of NDV in Ethiopia and also highlights the importance of continuous surveillance in both wild and domestic birds.",,"Damena, D.;Fusaro, A.;Sombo, M.;Belaineh, R.;Heidari, A.;Kebede, A.;Kidane, M.;Chaka, H.",2016.0,,,0

A specific PCR method for the detection of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) was developed, which proved to be suitable for diagnostic purposes. PCR screening of organ samples from pigs suspected of having PMWS or PDNS revealed the presence of PCV-2 in 80% of cases. Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates have been fully sequenced. The phylogenetic comparison with all available PCV-2 sequences showed that the porcine circoviruses circulating in Hungary are more variable than in several other European countries. Two Hungarian tribes grouped together with the Spanish tribes and formed a group of their own; two others fell into a common group with the French, British and Dutch strains, while two other strains showed the closest relationship to two of the three known German PCV-2 sequences.",,"DÃ¡n, Ã;MolnÃ¡r, T.;Biksi, I.;GlÃ¡vits, R.;Shaheim, M.;Harrach, B.",2003.0,,10.1556/AVet.51.2003.4.13,0

439,Development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for the rapid detection of parapox viruses,"Parapoxviruses (PaPVs) cause widespread infections in ruminants worldwide. All PaPVs are zoonotic and can infect humans after direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Here we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for the rapid detection of PaPVs. The new assay (referred to as the RVSS assay) was specific only for PaPVs and showed no cross-reactivity with other poxviruses. Using a recombinant plasmid as a positive control, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to 16 genome copies of PaPV per assay. The amplification efficiency estimate (91-99%), the intra- and interassay variability estimate (standard deviation [SD]: 0.28-1.06 and 0.01-0.14, respectively), and the operator variability estimate (SD: 0.78 between laboratories and 0.28 between operators within a laboratory) were within the acceptable range. Diagnostic specificity was evaluated on 100 samples from healthy, normal animals and all but 1 tested negative (99%). Diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was evaluated on 77 clinical specimens (skin/scab) from infected sheep, goats and cattle and all tested positive (100%). The assay was multiplexed with beta-actin as an internal positive control and the multiplex assay showed the same DSe as the singleplex assay. Further characterization of the PaPV samples by species-specific real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products after conventional PCR showed the presence of the orf virus not only in sheep and goats, but also in 1 cow. The validated RVSS assay demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and robustness, which are critical for laboratory detection of PaPVs.",,"Das, A.;Ward, G.;Lowe, A.;Xu, L.;Moran, K.;Renshaw, R.;Dubovi, E.;Reising, M.;Jia, W.",2017.0,,10.1177/1040638716680676,0

Six putative new PV types that could not be detected with current PCR protocols were identified. Their overall L1 nucleotide identities were less than 90% compared to the described PV species and types. L1 nucleotide BLAST sequence hits showed that each new type was related to beta, gamma, dyokappa, dyoeta, and xipapillomaviruses, as well as to two likely new, unclassified genera. Our results show that the use of NGS is relevant for the detection and characterization of distantly related PV and is of great importance in co-infection studies.

For the past decade, BD epidemiology has been debated. First, its geographic distribution appears to be wider than previously thought. Second, the disease can affect a large number of warm-blooded animal species, including humans.

However, extensive PCV2 ORF2 sequence databases in veterinary diagnostic laboratories have not been systematically analyzed to determine the genetic diversity of field isolates. Here we interrogated >1100 PCV2 ORF2 nucleotide sequences to assess population diversity and genetic variation. We discovered a new PCV2 genotype that differs significantly from all known PCV2 mainly in the ORF2. Notably, ORF2 contains a unique carboxy-terminal amino acid insertion, resulting in an ORF2 of 238 amino acids. All other ORF2 proteins of PCV2 are 233 or 234 amino acids long.

Originally causing a relatively mild and sporadic disease, PEDV has been more recently associated with severe diarrheal disease outbreaks in Asia and later in North America. PEDV shares some important properties with two major porcine pandemic viruses (porcine reproductive and respiratory virus; porcine circovirus type 2), which have high mutation rates and high host specificity, and were present in the porcine virome for decades before emerging to cause severe clinical disease. A unique feature of the PEDV in North America has been the implication of feed as a vehicle for transmission, with particular concerns related to porcine ingredients.

Electron microscopy has historically been used to identify suspect viruses, with many small, round viruses defying classification based solely on morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed that suspect viruses are constantly circulating in United States poultry, with many viruses occurring simultaneously and in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of determining the complete genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We used the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to assemble an RNA virus metagenome from flocks of turkeys suffering from enteric disease. This approach resulted in numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not yet been described in turkeys.

448,Comparative analysis of intestinal bacterial and RNA viral communities of sentinel birds housed on selected broiler farms,"There is considerable interest in characterizing the complex microbial communities in the poultry gut and understanding the impact of these dynamic communities on poultry performance, disease status, animal welfare and microbes of importance to human health. Research to characterize the avian enteric vioma has identified new avian viruses, but the role these viruses play in disease and performance problems has yet to be fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the poultry gut influences gut development, immune status and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic study was performed to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen-free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-exposure gut microbiome with the altered microbiome after exposure to field-reared poultry. Analysis of the intestinal virome of contact birds (""sentinels"") placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae and Astroviridae, which were absent or present in proportionally lower numbers in pre-contact birds. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in the birds after exposure, particularly by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well characterized and historically associated with intestinal disease in poultry; Members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have only recently been described in poultry and avian guts, and their role in recognized disease syndromes and poultry performance in general has not been determined.

450,Investigation of enteric picornavirus of turkey and its association with enteric diseases in chicks,Previous research on the viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry has revealed a number of new and partially characterized enteric viruses. It is evident that the avian gut viral community is minimally characterized and incompletely understood. Studies of the avian gut microbiome have provided some insight into the geographic distribution and rapidly evolving taxonomy of avian enteric picornaviruses. The present study was conducted to provide a comparative metagenomic analysis of gut vioma in a healthy flock of turkeys compared to a field flock. This study revealed a number of enteric picornavirus sequences that were present in the commercial birds in the field but were completely absent from the healthy flock. A novel molecular diagnostic assay was used to monitor the shedding of field strains of turkey enteric picornavirus in commercial chicks vaccinated with picornavirus-positive intestinal homogenates prepared from turkeys suffering from moderate enteric disease. Propagation of this novel enteric picornavirus in commercial chicks resulted in a significant reduction in weight gain and suggests that this common inhabitant of the turkey gut may lead to performance problems or enteric disease in the field.,,"Day, J.

451,Molecular characterization of enteric picornaviruses in archival turkey and chicken specimens from the United States,"Recent metagenomic analyzes of enteric viromes in turkeys and chickens have revealed complex viral communities composed of multiple virus families. Of particular note are the new avian picobirnaviruses (family Picobirnaviridae), several genera of tailed phages (family Siphoviridae), and undescribed avian enteric picornaviruses (family Picornaviridae). In addition to these largely undescribed - and therefore relatively poorly understood - avian enteric virus families, these metagenomic analyzes have also revealed the presence of known groups of enteric viruses, such as the chicken and turkey astroviruses (family Astroviridae) and the avian rotaviruses and reoviruses ( family Reoviridae). The order Picornavirales is an evolving group of viruses, particularly among the avian picornaviruses, as several new genera have recently been described based on community analysis of enteric viromes of poultry and other avian species worldwide. Our previous study of turkey enteric picornaviruses suggests that avian enteric picornaviruses may contribute to the enteric disease syndromes and performance problems commonly seen in turkeys in the southeastern United States. This report describes our most recent phylogenetic analysis of enteric-coated turkey and chicken specimens archived at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory from 2004 to the present, and is a first step in placing these novel avian picornaviruses within the larger family Picornaviridae.",,"Day, J.

452,High global diversity of cycloviruses among dragonflies,"Members of the family Circoviridae, particularly the genus Circovirus, have been thought to infect only vertebrates; Recently, however, members of a sister group in the same family, the proposed genus Cyclovirus, have been detected in insects. In an effort to explore cyclovirus diversity and better understand the evolution of these novel ssDNA viruses, we present here five cycloviruses isolated from three dragonfly species (Orthetrum sabina, Xanthocnemis zealandica, and Rhionaeschna multicolor) native to Australia, New Zealand and the USA were collected. and The genomes of these five viruses have a similar genome structure to other cycloviruses, with a circular genome of ~1.7 kb and two large bidirectionally transcribed ORFs. The genomic sequence data collected during this study was combined with all cyclovirus genomes available in public databases to identify conserved motifs and regulatory elements in the intergenic regions as well as to determine diversity and recombinant regions within their genomes. The genomes reported here represent four different cyclovirus species, three of which are new. Our results confirm that cycloviruses are widespread in winged insect populations; in eight different cyclovirus species identified so far in dragonflies, some of which have a wide geographic distribution. Recombination analyzes revealed both intra- and interspecies recombination events between cycloviruses, including genomes obtained from disparate sources (e.g. goat meat and human feces). Similar to other well-characterized circular ssDNA viruses, recombination may play an important role in cyclovirus evolution. © 2013 SGM.",,"Dayaram, A.;Potter, K. A.;Moline, A. B.;Rosenstein, D.

453,"Detection of hepatitis E virus in liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, serum, bile and faeces of naturally infected pigs affected by various pathological conditions","The aim of the present study was to detect the hepatitis E virus (HEV) in various samples from naturally infected pigs and to genetically characterize the detected strains. Serum, bile, liver, lymph nodes and faeces from 69 animals aged 1 week to 4 months with different pathological conditions were collected. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of HEV and histopathology of tissues was performed. Positive RT-PCR samples were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically. HEV was detected in at least one sample in 26 of 69 animals (37.7%). Bile was the most frequently positive sample, followed by mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, faeces and serum. HEV was detected in pigs aged 1 (n=7), 2 (n=8) and 3 (n=11) months. A total of 22 out of 69 (31.9%) pigs had mild to moderate hepatitis and 15 of them were HEV-RT-PCR positive live pigs in at least one of the tested samples such as liver, mesenteric lymph node and bile. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that all detected Spanish swine HEV strains belonged to genotype III. Therefore, genotype III strains are present in a relatively high proportion of pigs between the ages of 1 and 3 months. From this study it cannot be ruled out that co-infections can influence the distribution of HEV in infected pigs. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"de Deus, N.;Seminati, C.;Pina, S.;Mateu, E.;MartÃ­n, M.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.08.027,0
454,Antigenic and molecular heterogeneity in recent swine influenza A(H1N1) virus isolates with possible implications for vaccination policy,"To investigate the occurrence of antigenic drift in swine influenza A(H1N1) viruses and the concordance between epidemic and vaccine strains, 26 virus isolates from outbreaks of respiratory disease in fattening pigs in the Netherlands in the 1995/1996 season and reference strains from previous outbreaks were associated with investigated using serological and molecular methods. In contrast to porcine H3N2 viruses, no significant antigenic drift was observed in porcine H1N1 viruses isolated from the late 1980s through 1996. However, in the 26 newer porcine H1N1 virus strains, marked antigenic and genetic heterogeneity was found in hemagglutination inhibition assays and nucleotide sequence analysis. Interestingly, the observed antigenic and molecular variants were not randomly distributed across the farms. This result indicates independent introductions of different swine H1N1 virus variants in the different farms of the study and indicates a clear difference between the epidemiologies of human and swine influenza viruses. The observed heterogeneity may complicate swine influenza control by vaccination and suggests that the efficacy of current swine influenza vaccines needs to be re-evaluated and that the antigenic reactivity of swine influenza viruses should be monitored regularly. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

455,Evolutionary origin of 2A-like sequences in Totiviridae genomes,"In recent years, the number of new species that may belong to the Totiviridae family has increased significantly. Most of these new viruses have not yet been included in the official classification of the Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). In this study, a phylogenetic analysis involving novel sequences of Totiviridae candidates revealed a clade including Giardiavirus and a large variety of novel totiviruses infecting arthropods, protozoa, and molluscs. This extended Giardiavirus clade includes two monophyletic groups, one including Giardia lamblia virus (GLV) grouped with viruses that infect arthropods and vertebrates (GLV-like group), and the other the previously proposed artivirus group (IMNV-like group). Screening the members of the GLV-like group looking for genomic elements previously described in the IMNV-like group revealed the existence of sites with a high propensity to become 2A-like oligopeptides, mainly in a specific subgroup of arthropod viruses, suggesting that these viruses retained ancestral traits. The existence of these ""pseudo 2-A sites"" associated with phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that these sequences appear at a crucial stage in viral evolution. When they are altered into functional 2A-like sequences, an irreversible pathway to increase genome complexity is initiated.",,"de Lima, J. G. S.;Teixeira, D. G.;Freitas, T. T.;Lima, J. P. M.

456,"Akabane, Aino and Schmallenberg viruses - where do we stand and what do we know about the role of domestic ruminants and Culicoides vectors in virus transmission and overwintering?","Akabane, Aino, and Schmallenberg viruses belong to the Simbu serogroup of orthobunyaviruses and depend on Culicoides vectors for their spread between ruminants. Adult infections are mostly asymptomatic or associated with only mild symptoms, while transplacental transmission of these viruses to the developing fetus can have significant teratogenic effects. Research, primarily focused on congenital malformations, has found a correlation between the developmental stage at which a fetus becomes infected and the outcome of Akabane virus infection. Available data suggest that a similar association also applies to Schmallenberg virus infections, but is not yet fully conclusive. Experimental and field data also suggest that Akabane virus is more efficient than Aino and Schmallenberg viruses in inducing congenital malformations, certainly in cattle. The mechanism by which these Simbuviruses cross annual periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climates is not yet defined. Annual windborne reintroductions of infected mosquitoes from tropical endemic regions with year-round vector activity have been proposed, as has overwintering in long-lived adult mosquitoes. However, experimental and field data indicate that a role of vertical virus transmission in the ruminant host cannot currently be ruled out as an overwintering mechanism. Further studies on Culicoides biology and on specific groups of transplacentically infected newborn ruminants without gross malformations are needed to shed light on this matter.",,"De Regge, N.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.coviro.2017.10.004,0

The three HEV sequences showed relatively large nucleotide spacings (p-spacing > 0.129) compared to the other defined HEV subtype references and unclassified strains. The HEV classification criteria and high sequence similarity suggest that these strains can be assigned to a putative new subtype of genotype 3, HEV-31.",,"De Sabato, L.;Lemey, P.;Vrancken, B.;Bonfanti, L.;Ceglie, L.;Vaccari, G.;Di Bartolo, I.",2018.0,03 15,,0
458,Bovine papular stomatitis in dairy cows and milkers in central western Brazil,"Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a parapoxvirus associated with papular and erosive lesions on the snout, lips, and oral mucosa of cattle. Dairy cow teats are occasionally affected and the infection is commonly transmitted to humans. The present report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection in cows in central western Brazil with human involvement. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand milking farms and affected 20 dairy cows. Signs included painful reddish papules, ulcers and scabbing proliferative lesions on the teats with a clinical course of 7-12 days. Affected cows showed severe local pain that prevented milking from being completed. Histologically, acanthosis, spongiosis and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with adjacent focally extensive ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies have been identified in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Personnel milking the affected cows developed hand lesions, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and scabbing lesions within 4-7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers targeting the B2L gene, performed on DNA extracted from scab, amplified a 590 bp product which, on sequencing, showed similarities of 99%, 85% and 84 % with BPSV, the Pseudocowpox virus, or Orf virus. A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed showing that the virus is clustered with BPSV isolates. Although clinical cases consistent with BSPV infection have been frequently reported in Brazil, the present report identifies the pathogen implicated in bovine and human diseases in the country. © 2012 American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians.",,"de Sant'Ana, F.

459,Laboratory decision-making during the 1997-1998 classical swine fever epidemic in the Netherlands,"The National Reference Laboratory for Classical Swine Fever (CSF) virus in the Netherlands tested more than two million samples for CSF virus or serum antibodies during the 1997-1998 CSF outbreak. The sheer volume of specimens and the prevalence of Border Disease (BD) virus and Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD) virus infections in Dutch pig herds required that the laboratory's diagnostic efforts be focused on generating CSF-specific test results during the eradication campaign focused. Detection of 82% of the 429 outbreaks was achieved through the combined use of a direct immunofluorescence and peroxidase assay (FAT/IPA) with specimens (tonsils) from clinically suspect pigs. This indicates that in most outbreaks, the pigs showed clinical signs, recognized by farmers and/or veterinarians, that indicated the presence of classical swine fever virus in a pig herd. A positive diagnosis of 74% of all tissue samples (tonsils) collected from infected pig farms was established by FAT. More than 140,000 heparinized blood samples were tested by virus isolation, resulting in the detection of 4.5% of infected flocks. CSF virus was isolated in approximately 29% of all blood samples from pigs on infected or suspect farms. Multiple serological studies, each performed in a different setting, resulted in the detection of 13.5% of the total number of outbreaks. CSF virus antibodies in the serum were detected by semi-automatic blocking ELISA. About 28.5% of the sera that reacted in the ELISA were classified as positive for CSF virus neutralizing antibodies and 26.5% as positive for other pestiviruses by the virus neutralization test (VNT). We concluded that two of the described CSF laboratory diagnostic methods were critical to the eradication campaign: first, the FAT for screening diseased pigs; and second, ELISA and VNT, when millions of mostly healthy pigs had to be screened for the presence of CSF serum antibodies. However, decision-making based on the results obtained with both methods can be seriously hampered when examining samples from swine herds with a high prevalence of non-CSF pestiviruses.",,"De Smit, A.

Diagnosis was based on virus growth characteristics, electron microscopy and molecular biology techniques. Molecular characterization of the virus was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning and DNA sequencing of conserved orthopoxvirus genes such as vaccinia growth factor (VGF), thymidine kinase (TK) and hemagglutinin. We used VGF homologs and TK gene nucleotide sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree for comparison to other poxviruses. Gene sequences showed 99% homology with vaccinia virus genes and were clustered together with the isolated virus in the pedigree. Araçatuba virus is very similar to Cantagalo virus and shares the same signature deletion in the gene.

461,Novel parvoviruses from wild and domestic animals in Brazil provide new insights into parvovirus distribution and diversity,"Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary, and environmental importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to examine the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including 12 near-complete genomes and 9 partial genomes) in samples from rodents, bats, possums, birds and cattle from the states of Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. These sequences were examined using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been previously described), representing six different genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our results extend the known biogeographical range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (dependovirus, aveparvovirus, and tetraparvovirus). Furthermore, our investigation provides insight into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, showing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sublineages that are widespread within specific taxonomic host groups worldwide.",,"De Souza, W.

463,Neurological clinical signs in cattle with Astrovirus-associated encephalitis,"Background: The detection of neurotrophic astroviruses was achieved using novel genetic methods in cattle suffering from viral encephalitis of unknown cause. Aims: To describe the clinical signs observed in cattle with Astrovirus-associated encephalitis. Animals: Eight cattle (4 cows, 3 heifers and 1 bull of 4 different breeds) were admitted to the ruminant clinic for neurological disorders and 1 cow was examined in the field. METHODS: Cases were selected based on the neuropathologic diagnosis of nonsuppurative encephalitis, a positive in situ hybridization result for astrovirus, and the availability of physical and neurologic examination results. Where available, laboratory results were evaluated. RESULTS: The most commonly observed clinical symptoms were decreased awareness of the surroundings (7), cranial nerve dysfunction (5), and recumbency (5). The cow seen in the field was the only animal showing serious behavioral changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts were increased in 4 animals and protein concentration was increased in 3 out of 5 samples. In one case, the presence of Astrovirus in a CSF sample could be identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Other laboratory abnormalities were nonspecific. Conclusions and clinical significance: Astrovirus infection can be an important differential diagnosis in cattle with clinical signs of brain disease and should be considered after other causes have been ruled out. The clinical and epidemiological relevance of encephalitis associated with astrovirus infection should be further investigated.",,"Deiss, R.;Selimovic-Hamza, S.;Seuberlich, T.;Meylan, M.",2017.0,Jul-Aug,,0
464,Swine vesicular disease: characteristics of the virus strain France 1/73,"The France 1/73 strain of swine vesicular disease has the biological and physicochemical properties of an enterovirus. Single cycle growth on IBR'S2 cells can be detected as early as 2 hr 30 min and the maximum is reached in 5 hrs. Replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. Fluorescein immunofluorescence can show a specific green fluorescence in the cytoplasm within four hours after infection. Virions obtained from this cell system were concentrated with PEG and analyzed by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. In this way, two particle populations were separated. The first has a sedimentation coefficient of 150S, the other - 75S. After isopycnic centrifugation, the heavier particles are assigned a density of 1.34 g/cm3 and the lighter particles 1.30 g/cm3. The electron microscopic examination shows that the particles have a diameter between 30 and 32 nm. The particles with a density of 1.30 g/cm³ are all dye-permeated and correspond to empty capsids. A potent specific antiserum was produced in pigs with these viral antigens. It can be used for all serological reactions. It is therefore used for differential diagnosis by complement fixation tests (classic reaction at 37°C) using vesicle fluid taken from sick pigs. An inactivated oil adjuvant vaccine was also prepared. The protection rate of vaccinated animals is between 75% and 100% with a probability of 95%.",,"Delagneau, J.

Data were generated using the Illumina MiSeq 2 × 250 bp and HiSeq 2 × 150 bp sequencing platforms for 16S amplicon and WGSM sequencing, respectively. Each approach revealed a different microbial community profile, with Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter as the predominant genus for the WGSM dataset and Clostridium and Methanosaeta for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon dataset. Viroma characterization revealed the presence of two virus families with bacteria and archaea as hosts, Myoviridae and Siphoviridae. A great functional diversity has been found, with genes involved in the metabolism of acetone, butanol and ethanol synthesis predominating; and one-carbon metabolism (eg, methanogenesis). Genes associated with the acetotrophic methanogenetic pathways were more abundant than methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic, confirming the taxonomic results showing the prevalence of the acetotrophic genus Methanosaeta. In addition, the dataset pointed to a variety of metabolic genes involved in sulfur, nitrogen, iron, and phosphorus cycles, with many genera capable of functioning in all cycles. BLAST analysis against the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) revealed that the microbial community contained 43 different types of antibiotic resistance genes, some of which have been implicated in growth promotion in chickens (e.g. bacitracin, tetracycline and polymyxin).",,"Delforno, T.

469,The physicochemical characterization of bovine ephemeral fever virus as a member of the Rhabdoviridae family,"This study of the physicochemical properties of bovine ephemeral fever virus was initiated to determine whether or not it should be classified as a rhabdovirus. In contrast to the regular spherical morphology of some rhabdoviruses, the virus particles are often cone-shaped or slight variants of spherical. The virion contains single-stranded RNA sedimenting at 42S and six proteins with mol. Wt. of 164, 101, 64, 53, 43 and 29 x 103. The P101 protein is found on the virus surface and is glycosylated. It is removed by treating the virus particles with trypsin. It was found that protein P64, the nucleoprotein, is a phosphoprotein, like the N protein of rabies virus, while in vesicular stomatitis virus, NS is the phosphorylated protein. Virus harvests contain defect-interfering particles. The particles are short conical shapes about one-third the length of the infectious virion and resemble in morphology the defect-interfering particles of vesicular stomatitis virus. These particles disrupt the replication of bovine ephemeral fever virus but not the Indiana serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus. They contain single-stranded RNA that sediments at 18 to 20 S. The particles appear to have a protein composition identical to that found in the virus particle. The physicochemical properties of bovine ephemeral fever virus justify its inclusion in the Rhabdoviridae family. The protein composition differs in detail from that found for vesicular stomatitis and rabies viruses, but is similar to that found for Obodhiang and Kotonkan, two serogroup rabies viruses isolated from insects in Africa.",,"Della-Porta, A.

472,Monitoring of the immune response to vaccination with an inactivated vaccine in the context of bovine neonatal pancytopenia by deep sequencing transcriptome analysis in cattle,"Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a new fatal alloimmune/alloantibody-mediated disease of newborn calves caused by ingestion of colostrum from cows vaccinated with a specific vaccine against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Pathogenic MHC class I molecules in the vaccine had been hypothesized, but formal evidence for specific causal MHC class I alleles had not yet been provided. However, the unique properties of the vaccine appear to result in extremely high specific antibody titers in the vaccinated animals, but also appear to lead to other BNP-inducing molecules. Therefore, a comprehensive picture of the immune response to the vaccine is essential. Using the novel next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approach, our study provides a new holistic, comprehensive analysis of the regulation of the blood transcriptome after vaccination with the specific BVDV vaccine. Our RNAseq approach identified a novel cytokine-like gene in the bovine genome that is highly upregulated after vaccination. This gene has never been described before in any other species and may be specific to the immune response of ruminants. In addition, our data demonstrated a highly coordinated immune response to double-stranded (ds) RNA or a dsRNA analogue following vaccination with the inactivated single-stranded (ss) RNA vaccine. This would indicate either significant contamination of the vaccine with dsRNA from host cells after virus culture or a dsRNA analogue applied to the vaccine. The first option would highlight the potential risks associated with virus culture on homologous cells during vaccine manufacture; the latter option would highlight the potential risks associated with immunostimulatory adjuvants used in vaccine manufacture.",,"Demasius, W.;Weikard, R.;Hadlich, F.;Muller, K.

473,Chicken skin virus analyzed by high-throughput sequencing shows a composition that is very different from human skin,"Recent studies indicate that at homeostasis, human skin is a complex ecosystem whose viromes include circular DNA viruses, particularly papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses. To determine the chicken skin virus in comparison to the human skin virus, a chicken swab pool sample from fifteen healthy barn chickens with five genetic backgrounds was examined for the presence of DNA viruses using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The results indicate a predominance of herpesviruses of the Mardivirus genus, which originate either from vaccination or a presumably asymptomatic infection.

474,Phylogenetic analysis of classical swine fever virus isolated from Taiwan,"Analysis of the E2 sequences of classical swine fever virus from field outbreaks in Taiwan between 1993 and 2001 identified three viral populations with different genotypes, including one historical (subgroup 3.4) and two exotic (subgroup 2.1) strains. The first subgroup 2.1 virus was isolated in 1994, and sporadic outbreaks continued after 1996. Phylogenetic analysis using the E2 region has separated the Taiwanese strains of 2.1 virus into two distinct genotypes (designated 2.1a and 2.1b). The 2.1b viruses were only isolated in 2001 and shared approximately 94.8% nucleotide identities with the 2.1a viruses across the entire genomic sequences. The results suggest that the 2.1a and 2.1b viruses can be introduced from different origins. © 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Deng, M. C.;Huang, C. C.;Huang, T. S.;Chang, C. Y.;Lin, Y.

475,"Phylogenetic and genetic characterization of a 2017 clinical isolate of H7N9 virus in Guangzhou, China, during the fifth epidemic wave","Pathogenic H7N9 influenza viruses continue to pose a public health concern. The H7N9 virus has caused five outbreaks of human infection in China since 2013. In the present study, a novel H7N9 strain (A/Guangdong/8H324/2017) was identified during the fifth wave of the 2017 H7N9 epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the H7N9 viruses collected during the fifth wave belong to two different lineages: the Pearl River Delta lineage and the Yangtze River Delta lineage. The novel isolate is closely related to the Pearl River Delta H7N9 viruses isolated from patients in Guangdong province. The novel H7N9 isolate has an insertion of three basic amino acids into the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, which could increase virulence in poultry. The 2017 isolate also possesses an R292K substitution in the neuraminidase (NA) protein that confers oseltamivir resistance. This study underscores the pandemic potential of the novel H7N9 virus in mammals; therefore, future characterization and monitoring is warranted.",,"Deng, Y.;Li, C.;Han, J.;Wen, Y.;Wang, J.;Hong, W.;Li, X.;Liu, Z.;Ye, Q.;Li, J.;Zhou, C.;Yu, L.;Qin, C.;Zhang, F.;Jiang, T.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11427-017-9152-1,0

477,Transmission of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus in Australian pigs,"Background Pigs possess receptors for both human and avian influenza viruses and are a natural host for influenza A viruses. The 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (H1N1pdm), derived from avian, human and swine influenza viruses, has infected pigs in several countries. Objectives To investigate, by phylogenetic analysis, the relationship between the H1N1pdm viruses isolated from outbreaks in pig farms in Australia and human specimens associated with any of the outbreaks and to determine whether it existed during the human-pig interspecies -Transmission came to a reassortment event. Methods Real-time RT-PCR and whole genome sequencing were performed on RNA isolated from nasal swabs and/or virus cultures. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Geneious package. Results Outbreaks of H1N1pdm influenza were detected on three pig farms in three different states of Australia. Further analysis of the Queensland outbreak led to the identification of two different virus strains in the pigs. Two employees working in the same pigsty were also infected with the same two strains found in the pigs. A complete genome sequence analysis of the viruses isolated from pigs and humans revealed no resorting of these H1N1pdm viruses with seasonal or avian influenza A viruses. Conclusions This is the first report of influenza-infected pigs in Australia and marks the end of the influenza-free era for the Australian swine industry. Although no reassortment was observed in these cases, the ability of these viruses to interbreed between pigs and humans underscores the importance of surveillance of pigs for novel influenza infections. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Deng, Y.

478,The swine virus and xenotransplantation,"The composition of the porcine virome includes viruses that infect porcine cells, ancient virus-derived elements including endogenous retroviruses inserted into the porcine chromosomes, and bacteriophages that infect a wide range of bacteria inhabiting pigs. Viruses that infect pigs, including viruses that also infect human cells, and porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are of importance in evaluating the viral safety of xenotransplantation. Bacteriophages, which are associated with bacteria mainly in the gut, are not relevant in this context. Xenotransplantation using porcine cells, tissues or organs is under development to alleviate the shortage of human transplants. Here, for the first time published data describing the viromes in different pigs and their relevance for the virus safety of xenotransplantation are analyzed. In summary, the analysis of the swine vioma has led to the description of numerous new viruses, although their impact on xenotransplantation is unclear. Most importantly, viruses with known or suspected zoonotic potential were often not detected by next-generation sequencing, but instead were discovered by more sensitive methods.",,"Denner, J.",2017.0,,10.1186/s12985-017-0836-z,0
479,Identification of the new Ghanaian G8P 6 human bovine reassortant rotavirus strain by next-generation sequencing,"Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are the most important causative agents of acute gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age worldwide. The monovalent rotavirus vaccine Rotarix was included in Ghana's national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in May 2012. However, there is a lack of genetic and phylogenetic data on the full genome of human RVAs circulating prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The common bovine rotavirus VP7 of genotype G8 has been detected sporadically in Ghanaian children, mostly in combination with VP4 genotype P[6]. To study the genomic constellations and phylogeny of circulating RVA strains prior to vaccine introduction, the full genomes of two uncommon G8P[6] strains, GH018-08 and GH019-08, discovered during disease burden monitoring were discovered were characterized by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The Ghanaian isolates, GH018-08 and GH019-08, presented the unusual, previously unreported genotype constellation G8-P[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H3. Phylogenetic analyzes confirmed that 10 of the 11 genes of GH018-08 and GH019-08 were identical/nearly identical, with significant variations noted only in their VP1 genes, and clearly the occurrence of multiple independent interspecies transmissions and rearrangement events between co- circulating bovine/ovine/caprine rotavirus and human DS-1-like RVA strains. These results underscore the contribution of rearrangements and interspecies transmission events to the high rotavirus diversity in this region of Africa and justify the need for simultaneous monitoring of animal and human rotavirus strains.",,"Dennis, F.

480,Insights into the circovirus host range from the genomic fossil record,"variety of DNA sequences derived from circoviruses (family Circoviridae) have been identified in specimens from humans and domestic animals, often associated with pathological conditions. In most cases, however, little is known about the natural biology of the viruses from which these sequences are derived. Endogenous circovirus elements (CVe) are DNA sequences derived from circoviruses found in animal genomes and provide a useful source of information about circovirus-host relationships. In this study, we screened genome arrays from 675 animal species and identified numerous circovirus-related sequences, including the first examples of cycloviral-derived CVe. We confirmed the presence of these CVe in the germline of the elongated branch ant (Pseudomyrmex gracilis), thereby establishing that cycloviruses infect insects. We examined the evolutionary relationships between CVe and contemporary circoviruses and showed that CVe from ants and mites group relatively closely with cycloviruses in phylogenies. Furthermore, the relatively random mixing of CVe from insect genomes with cyclovirus sequences recovered from vertebrate specimens suggested that contamination might be an important consideration in studies reporting these viruses. Our study shows how endogenous virus sequences can influence metagenomics-based virus discovery. In addition, it raises doubts about the role of cycloviruses as pathogens in humans and other vertebrates.",,"Dennis, T. P. W.;Flynn, P. J.;de Souza, W. M.;Singer, J. B.;Moreau, C. S.;Wilson, S.

481,Deep sequencing of viral genomes provides insight into the evolution and pathogenesis of the varicella-zoster virus and its vaccine in humans,"Vaccination with the vOka vaccine prevents varicella (chickenpox) in children and susceptible adults. The vOka vaccine strain consists of a mixture of genotypes and, despite attenuation, causes rash in a small number of recipients. Like the wild-type virus, the vaccine builds up a latency in neuronal tissue and can later be reactivated to cause herpes zoster (shingles). Using hybridization-based methods, we purified and sequenced vOka directly from skin lesions. We show that alleles present in the vaccine can be recovered from the lesions and demonstrate the existence of a severe bottleneck between inoculation and lesion formation. Genotypes in each lesion appear to derive from one to three vaccine genotypes with a low frequency of new mutations. No single vOka haplotype and no new mutations are consistently present in rashes, indicating that neither new mutations nor recombination with wild-type are critical for the development of vOka rashes. Instead, alleles derived from attenuation (i.e., not derived from free-living viruses) are present at lower frequencies in rash genotypes. We identify 11 loci at which the ancestral allele is selected in vOka rash formation and demonstrate genotypes in rashes reactivated from latency that cannot be distinguished from rashes occurring immediately after inoculation. We conclude that the vOka vaccine, although heterogeneous, did not evolve to form rashes by positive selection in a quasi-species mode, but rather alleles that were essentially neutral during vaccine manufacture were found in the human subjects, allowing us to identify key sites for rash formation.",,"Depledge, D.

482,Molecular aspects of varicella zoster virus latency,"Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection causes varicella (chickenpox) and the establishment of a lifelong latent infection in ganglionic neurons. VZV reactivates in about a third of infected individuals and causes herpes zoster, often accompanied by neurological complications. The limited host range of VZV and, until recently, a lack of suitable in vitro models have severely hampered molecular studies of VZV latency. Nonetheless, recent technological advances have enabled a series of exciting studies, leading to the discovery of a VZV latency-associated transcript (VLT) and providing new insights into our understanding of VZV latency and factors that can trigger reactivation. Deducing the function(s) of the VLT and the molecular mechanisms involved should now be considered a priority to improve our understanding of the factors that determine VZV latency and reactivation. In this review, we summarize the implications of recent discoveries in the VZV latency domain from both viral and host perspectives and provide a roadmap for future studies.",,"Depledge, D.

483,Deep sequencing of different preparations of live attenuated varicella zoster vaccine reveals a conserved core of single nucleotide attenuating polymorphisms,"UNLABELING: The continued success of live-attenuated varicella zoster vaccine in preventing varicella zoster and herpes zoster is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to the attenuation of vOka virus for replication in the skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, using deep sequencing of seven lots of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken), we demonstrate that 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are mutations present in all vaccine batches. This includes six sites where the vaccine allele is fixed or near fixation that we speculate are likely important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in vaccine populations between preparations, lot-to-lot variations are minimal, as is the number and frequency of mutations unique to individual lots. This indicates that vaccine manufacturing processes do not introduce new mutations and that live VZV vaccines are extremely stable regardless of the mixture of variants present. IMPORTANT: The continued success of vaccines in preventing chickenpox and shingles, combined with the extremely low incidence of side effects, demonstrates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself consists of a heterogeneous live attenuated virus population and therefore requires deep sequencing technologies to study the differences and similarities in virus populations between different preparations and batches of vaccines. Our data demonstrate minimal inter-lot variability, an important safety feature, and provide new insight into the extent of mutations present in this attenuated virus.",,"Depledge, D.

489,Kinetics of expression of the transcript and product of the UL28 homologue of bovine herpesvirus 1,"We report that the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) UL28 ORF, a homologue of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL28 gene, is a functional gene encoding a viral specific protein. The BHV1 UL28 ORF, located at positions 53,058 → 55,538 of the viral genome, encodes a 3.4 kb viral specific transcript that was detected 6 h post-infection (pi), after which its levels increased up to accumulated to 12 hr pi and then remained constant up to 24 hr pi. BHV1 UL28 transcription was found to initiate 95 bases upstream from the start codon of the ORF, which corresponds to 33 nucleotides downstream from a putative TATA box. A BHV1-UL28-specific antiserum raised against a T7-tag/UL28 fusion protein expressed in E. coli specifically reacted with a 100 kDa protein in Western blots of BHV1-infected protein cell lysates. The expression kinetics of the protein were delayed by 6 h relative to those of its transcript, suggesting that the gene is regulated at the translational level. In contrast to the HSV and pseudorabies virus UL28 genes, which belong to early class (β) viral genes, BHV1 has been clearly classified as a β2 gene.

Of particular interest are the viral agents associated with RSS, which have so far been difficult to fully characterize. Previous research on the etiology of RSS has implicated a variety of RNA and DNA viruses, but to date no single virus has been identified as the main causative agent of RSS, and the current opinion is that it may be caused by a community of viruses. collectively known as Virom. This paper attempts to characterize the viral pathogens associated with 2-3 week old RSS affected and unaffected broilers using next-generation sequencing and comparative metagenomics. Analysis of the viromes identified a total of 20 DNA and RNA virus families and 2 unidentified categories consisting of 31 distinct virus genera and 7 unclassified genera. The most prevalent virus families identified in this study were the Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Coronaviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae. This study identified historically important viruses associated with the disease, such as chicken astrovirus, avian nephritis virus, chicken parvovirus, and chicken calicivirus, along with relatively new viruses such as chicken megrivirus and sicinivirus 1, and will help advance knowledge of enteric disease in broiler chickens, provide insight into the viral components of a healthy avian gut, and identify a variety of enteric viruses and viral communities amenable to further study.",,"Devaney, R.;Trudgett, J.;Trudgett, A.;Meharg, C.;Smyth, V.",2016.0,,,1
491,Enrichment of viral nucleic acids by solution hybrid selection with genus-specific oligonucleotides,"Despite recent advances, our knowledge of potential and rare human pathogens is far from exhaustive. Current molecular diagnostic tools rely mainly on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may miss infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; Due to the extremely low proportion of pathogen material in clinical samples, however, the use is only economical in special cases and not in routine cases. In this study, we present a method for semispecific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in an HTS library by in-solution hybridization with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Furthermore, enterovirus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Enterovirus) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to background nucleic acid was approximately 1000-fold. Because hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide matching requirements than PCR, a few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover potential sequence variation across the genus, and can even enrich for nucleic acids from viruses of other related genera. The efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-effective.",,"Deviatkin, A. A.;Lukashev, A. N.;Markelov, M. M.;Gmyl, L. V.;Shipulin, G. A.",2017.0,2029-08-01 00:00:00,,0
492,Megaphages infect Prevotella and variants are widespread in gut microbiomes,"Bacteriophages (phages) dramatically shape microbial community composition, redistributing nutrients through host lysis, and driving evolution through horizontal gene transfer. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phages in the human microbiome. We examined the gut microbiomes of Bangladeshi and Tanzanian humans, two groups of African baboons, and Danish pigs; Many of these microbiomes contain phage belonging to a clade with genomes >540 kilobases in length, the largest reported to date in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phage. We refer to these as Lak phages. CRISPR spacer targeting indicates that Lak phages infect bacteria of the genus Prevotella. We manually curated 15 different Lak phage genomes derived from metagenomes to completion. The genomes exhibit several interesting features, including use of an alternative genetic code, large intergenic regions that are highly expressed, and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have different phage genotypes, and shifts in the frequency of variants over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative frequencies of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in an extensive genome mix of nine baboon Lak phage populations.

Recently, a novel PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here called PRV-3) was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, a molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV, and blood samples collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as the virus source. Viral particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete coding sequences of PRV-3 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. Compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1% and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins varied from 96.7% (lambda1) to 79.1% (sigma3). The phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belongs to a separate cluster. The sigma3 coding region was sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences clustered but were distant from PRV-3 isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyzes of PRV-3 proteins revealed that predicted secondary structures and functional domains were conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1. Rabbit antisera raised against purified virus or various recombinant viral proteins of PRV-1 all cross-reacted with PRV-3.

494,Recent epidemiology of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV),"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an economically important viral disease of goats and sheep that was first described in West Africa in the 1940s. The virus has been circulating in parts of sub-Saharan Africa for several decades and in the Middle East and South Asia since 1993, although the virus was first described in India in 1987. To investigate the genetic relatedness between isolates from different geographic origins, a selected region of the fusion (F) protein gene of the viruses was amplified using RT/PCR and the resulting DNA product was sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Viruses from 27 outbreaks in Asian and Middle Eastern countries reported between 1993 and 2000 and two recent outbreaks on the African continent were compared to the prototype African strain. Of the four known lineages of PPR virus, lineages 1 and 2 have been found exclusively in West Africa. Virus from an outbreak in Burkina Faso in 1999 fell into the lineage 1 group. Lineage 3 viruses have been found in East Africa, where such an outbreak occurred in Ethiopia in 1996, and in Arabia and southern India. However, since lineage 3 virus was reported from Tamil Nadu in 1992, there have been no further isolations of lineage 3 virus from India. A virus of this lineage was found circulating in Yemen in 2001. In the last 8 years, only the fourth lineage virus has spread across the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent, reaching east to Nepal and Bangladesh. This virus line was also reported from Kuwait in 1999. The geographic source of the new lineage 4 virus is unknown, although it is most closely related to African lineage 1.

The remaining four isolates may represent some new phylogenetic types. Phage recovered from the lysogenic strains of E. coli were all found to be related to P2, whereas a majority of the phage recovered as cell-free plaque-forming units belonged to the lambda family.

497,Evidence of recombination in neboviruses,"Neboviruses are bovine enteric caliciviruses (genus Nebovirus) associated with enteric disease in calves. When calf faeces from Italian herds were screened using primers targeting a conserved region in the calicivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), nebovirus RNA was detected in calves with enteritis (13.1%), but not in apparently healthy animals. Upon sequence analysis of the RdRP fragment, the Italian viruses formed a tightly conserved group and closely resembled the Nebraska/80/US nebovirus prototype. The process of a 2.2. kb ORF1 fragment encompassing the 3' end of the RdRp and the full-length capsid coding region from two nebovirus strains was determined, revealing marked genetic heterogeneity in the capsid protein as the two Italian viruses divided into two distinct Capsid lines have been classified and proposing a recombination event downstream of the highly conserved shell (S) domain. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Di Martino, B.;Di Profio, F.;Martella, V.;Ceci, C.;Marsilio, F.",2011.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.05.034,0
498,Genome plasticity of triple reassorted H1N1 influenza A virus during infection of vaccinated pigs,"To gain insight into the evolution of influenza A viruses (IAVs) during infection of vaccinated pigs, we experimentally infected a 3-week-old naïve pig with a triple reassortant H1N1 IAV and placed the seed pig in direct contact with an age - matched vaccinated pigs (n510), We indexed the genetic diversity and evolution of the virus at the intra-host level by deep sequencing of the whole genome directly from nasal swabs collected on two separate samples during infection. We obtained 13 IAV metagenomes from 13 specimens containing the virus inoculum and two specimens from each of the six pigs that tested positive for IAV during the study. Infection generated a population of heterogeneous alleles (sequence variants) that was dynamic over time. Overall, among all 794 polymorphisms, samples were identified that gave rise to 327 alleles, 214 of which were unique sequences. A total of 43 different hemagglutinin proteins were translated, two of which were observed in several pigs, with neuraminidase (NA) conserved and only one dominant NA found throughout the study. The genetic diversity of IAVs changed dynamically within and between pigs. However, most of the substitutions observed in the internal gene segments were synonymous. Our results demonstrated remarkable IAV diversity and the complex, rapid, and dynamic evolution of IAV during infection of vaccinated pigs, which can only be appreciated by repeated sampling of individual animals and deep sequence analysis.",,"Diaz, A.;Enomoto, S.;Romagosa, A.;Sreevatsan, S.;Nelson, M.;Culhane, M.;Torremorell, M.",2015.0,,10.1099/jgv.0.000258,0
499,Molecular properties of Nipah virus glycoproteins,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that emerged from fruit bats in Malaysia in 1998 and has caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in swine and fatal encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates. Unlike most paramyxoviruses, NiV can infect a wide variety of mammalian species. Because of this broad host range, its zoonotic potential, its high human pathogenicity, and the lack of effective vaccines or therapeutics, NiV has been classified as a Biosafety Level 4 pathogen. This article provides an overview of the molecular properties of NiV, focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of the two NiV surface glycoproteins, receptor-binding G protein and fusion protein F. Since viral glycoproteins are important determinants for cell tropism and Virus distribution, a detailed knowledge of these proteins can help to understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.",,"Diederich, S.;Maisner, A.",2007.0,,10.1196/annals.1408.003,0
500,Genetic analysis of avian paramyxovirus-1 (Newcastle disease virus) isolates obtained from swine populations in China relative to commonly used commercial vaccine strains,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was thought to infect only bird species. However, at least eight NDV strains were isolated from pig populations in China between 1999 and 2006, four of which have been genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Genetic analysis revealed that JL106 and SP13 possessed a 112G-RQGR-L117 motif at the F protein cleavage site, while JL01 and MP01 possessed a 112G-KQGR-L117 motif, indicating that they are all virus-typical were of low virulence. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length F gene sequences showed that JL106 and SP13 belonged to genotype II, similar to the commonly used commercial La Sota vaccine strain in China. While JL01 and MP01 are grouped within genotype I, they are genetically identical to the V4 vaccine strain. The animal experiments showed that JL106 can effectively infect chickens. The present results indicate that the use of La Sota and V4 live vaccines and close contact between birds and pigs may have led to cross-species infection. Therefore, it is necessary to continue epidemiological surveillance of swine NDV. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Ding, Z.;Cong, Y. L.;Chang, S.;Wang, G. M.;Wang, Z.;Zhang, Q.

501,Modulation of microRNAs in two genetically distinct chicken lines with different susceptibility to necrotic enteritis,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation by affecting the 3'-UTR of target genes. Using two inbred White Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2, that display Marek's disease-resistant and disease-susceptible phenotypes, respectively, we used high-throughput small RNA sequencing (HTS) to examine whether miRNAs differ in these two chicken lines after induction are expressed necrotic enteritis (NE). The 12 miRNAs selected from the most down-regulated or up-regulated miRNAs after NE induction were confirmed by their expression in real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, miR-215, miR-217, miR-194, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-216a, miR-216b, and miR-429 were highly expressed in gut derived from lineage 7.2, while miR-1782 and miR-499 were downregulated. In the spleen, miR-34b and miR-1684 were the most upregulated miRNAs in lineage 6.3. Notably, five out of six target genes, CXCR5, BCL2, GJA1, TCF12 and TAB3, were differentially expressed between lineage 6.3 and lineage 7.2 and showed repression in the MD-sensitive chicken line. Their expression levels were inversely correlated with those of miRNA obtained from both HTS and real-time quantitative PCR. These results suggest that some miRNAs are differentially altered in response to NE and they modulate the expression of their target genes in the two inbred lines. Overall, HTS analysis of intestinal miRNAs from NE-affected inbred chickens displaying distinct disease phenotypes led to the identification of host immunity genes regulated by miRNA. Future investigations into the function of these miRNAs and their target genes in the host will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the host-pathogen interaction in NE. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Dinh, H.;Hong, Y.

504,Metagenomic analysis of RNA viruses in a freshwater lake,"Freshwater lakes and ponds provide an ecological interface between humans and a variety of host organisms. They are a habitat for the larval stage of many insects and can serve as a medium for the transmission of viruses within and between species such as avian influenza A virus. In addition, freshwater bodies are already known repositories for disease-causing viruses such as Norwalk virus, Coxsackie virus, Echovirus, and Adenovirus. While RNA virus populations have been studied in marine environments, there has been very limited analysis of the virus community in freshwater. Here we present a study of RNA viruses in Lake Needwood, a freshwater lake in Maryland, USA. Our results indicate that, as in studies of other aquatic environments, the majority of the recovered nucleic acid sequences did not show significant similarity to known sequences. The remaining sequences are mainly from viral types with significant similarity to approximately 30 viral families. We speculate that these novel viruses can infect a variety of hosts, including plants, insects, fish, pets, and humans. Among these viruses, we have discovered a previously unknown dsRNA virus closely related to Banna virus, which is responsible for a febrile illness and is endemic to Southeast Asia. In addition, we found several viral sequences distantly related to the Israeli acute paralysis virus, which has been linked to honey bee colony collapse. Our data suggest that freshwater ecosystems serve as storehouses for a variety of viruses (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) due to their direct contact with humans, domestic and wild animals, and could potentially be involved in the spread of emerging and pandemic diseases. © 2009 Djikeng et al.",,"Djikeng, A.;Kuzmickas, R.;Anderson, N.

505,Genetic Analysis of Human Rotavirus C: The Appearance of the Indo-Bangladesh Strain in Far East Asian Countries,"Rotavirus C (RVCs) circulate worldwide as enteric pathogens in both humans and animals. Most studies of their genetic diversity focus on the VP7 and VP4 genes, but the complete genomes of 18 human RVCs have been described in independent studies. The genetic background of Far East Asian RVCs differs from other human RVCs found in India and Bangladesh. Recently, an RVC discovered in South Korea in 2010 had a similar genetic background to the Indo-Bangladeshi RVC. This study was conducted to determine the entire genome of eight Japanese RVCs discovered between 2005 and 2012 and to compare them to other human and animal RVCs worldwide to better understand the genetic background of contemporary Far East Asian RVCs. By phylogenetic analysis, the human RVCs appeared to be distinct from animal RVCs. Among the human RVCs, three lineage constellations had prolonged circulation. The genetic background of the Far East Asian RVC has been distinguished from the Indo-Bangladeshi RVC, as previously reported. However, we found one Japanese RVC in 2012 that carried the Indo-Bangladeshi RVC genetic background, while the remaining seven Japanese RVC carried the typical Far East Asian RVC genetic background. This is the first report of the Indo-Bangladeshi RVC in Japan. With this observation and the reassortment event of human RVCs in Hungary, our study shows that the RVCs spread from one region to another.",,"Doan, Y.

The genome was found to contain a large open reading frame encoding a leader protein in front of the capsid protein region. This showed no sequence identity with other picornavirus leader regions and the sequence data suggested that it lacked proteolytic activity. The 2A protease was small and showed considerable sequence identity with the aphthoviruses and with equine rhinovirus serotype 2. The 2A/2B junction possessed the typical cleavage site (NPG/P) exhibited by these viruses. The other proteins shared less than 40% sequence identity with equivalent proteins from other picornavirus genera. Phylogenetic analyzes of the P1 and 3D sequences showed that this virus forms a distinct branch of the Picornaviridae family. Based on the results presented in this paper, PEV-1 has been assigned to a new picornavirus genus.

508,Functional characterization of a monoclonal antibody epitope using a lambda phage display deep sequencing platform,"We have recently described a method called PROFILER for identifying antigenic regions that are preferentially targeted by polyclonal antibody responses after vaccination. Here, to test the ability of the technique to provide insight into the functional properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) epitopes, we used a well-characterized meningococcal factor H-binding protein (fHbp) epitope recognized by mAb 12C1. An fHbp library constructed on a lambda phage vector, which allows surface expression of polypeptides of widely variable length, was subjected to massive parallel sequencing of the phage inserts after affinity selection with the 12C1 mAb. We discovered dozens of unique antibody-selected sequences, of which the most enriched (termed FrC) could largely recapitulate the ability of fHbp to bind mAb 12C1. Computational analysis of the cumulative accumulation of single amino acids in the antibody-selected fragments identified two over-represented residue stretches (H248-K254 and S140-G154), the presence of which was subsequently found to be required for FrC binding to mAb 12C1. Taken together, these results suggest that the PROFILER technology can rapidly and reliably identify discrete ""hot spots"" associated with complex conformational epitopes with a crucial role in antigen-antibody interactions, providing useful clues for the functional characterization of the epitope.",,"Domina, M.;Lanza Cariccio, V.;Benfatto, S.;Venza, M.;Venza, I.;Borgogni, E.;Castellino, F.;Midiri, A.;Galbo, R.;Romeo, L.;Biondo, C.;Masignani, V.;Teti, G.;Felici, F.;Beninati, C.",2016.0,,10.1038/srep31458,0

512,Phylogenetic diversity and genotypic complexity of H9N2 influenza A viruses revealed by genomic sequence analysis,"H9N2 influenza A virus has become established in terrestrial and wild birds worldwide and is occasionally transmitted to mammals including humans and pigs. To fully elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the NCBI influenza virus resource database, representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. Our study provides a panoramic framework to better understand the genesis and development of H9N2 influenza viruses and to describe the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in different hosts. The phylogenetic panorama analysis of the eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of the H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 virus genomes were divided into 74 separate lineages that exhibited marked host and geographic differences in phylogeny. The panoramic genotypic analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses comprise at least 98 genotypes, which were further subdivided into seven series (AG) according to their HA lineages. The phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes showed that the H9N2 viruses are closely related to the influenza viruses of the H3, H4, H5, H7, H10 and H14 subtypes. Our results show that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortments to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes, suggesting that continued circulation of multiple genotypic H9N2 viruses around the world in different hosts has the potential to contribute to future influenza outbreaks causing poultry and human epidemics. We propose a nomenclature system to identify and unify all lineages and genotypes of H9N2 influenza viruses to facilitate international communication on the evolution, ecology, and epidemiology of H9N2 influenza viruses. © 2011 Dong et al.",,"Dong, G.;Luo, J.;Zhang, H.;Wang, C.;Duan, M.;Deliberto, T.

513,Reassortant H9N2 influenza viruses containing H5N1-like PB1 genes isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China,"H9N2 influenza A virus has become endemic in various species of terrestrial and wild birds in Asia and is occasionally transmitted to humans and pigs. To assess the role of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) in the development of influenza A virus, we conducted two avian influenza virus epidemic surveys in wild black-billed magpies in Guangxi, China, in 2005 and characterized three isolated black-billed magpies H9N2 viruses (BbM viruses ). Phylogenetic analysis showed that three BbM viruses were nearly identical with 99.7 to 100% nucleotide homology throughout their genome and were reassortants expressing BJ94-like (Ck/BJ/1/94) HA, NA, M and NS genes, SH/F/98-like (Ck/SH/F/98) PB2, PA and NP genes, and H5N1-like (Ck/YN/1252/03, clade 1) PB1 genes. Genetic analysis showed that BbM viruses were most likely the result of multiple reassortments between co-circulating H9N2-like and H5N1-like viruses and were genetically distinct from other H9N2 viruses due to the presence of H5N1-like PB1 genes. Genotypic analysis revealed that BbM viruses evolved from different sources and belonged to a new genotype (B46) discovered in our recent study. Molecular analysis indicated that BbM viruses were likely weakly pathogenic reassortants. However, the results of our pathogenicity study showed that BbM viruses replicated efficiently in chickens and a mammalian mouse model, but were not lethal to infected chickens and mice. Antigenic analysis showed that BbM viruses were antigenically heterologous with the H9N2 vaccine strain. Our study is probably the first report to document and characterize H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China. Our results suggest that black-billed magpies were susceptible to H9N2 influenza virus, raising concerns about possible transmission of reassortant H9N2 viruses among poultry and wild birds. © 2011 Dong et al.",,"Dong, G.;Xu, C.;Wang, C.;Wu, B.;Luo, J.;Zhang, H.;Nolte, D.

514,"Characteristics of H13N8 subtype influenza virus first isolated from Qinghai Lake region, China","Background: Since the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza caused thousands of wild bird deaths in the area in 2005, China's Qinghai Lake has become a hotspot for studying the impact of avian influenza on migratory wild birds. However, the ecology and evolution of the low pathogenic avian influenza virus is limited in this region. This project-based surveillance of bird flu in Qinghai Lake Region was initiated in 2012. Method: In 2012, samples of wild bird droppings and lake surface water were collected in Qinghai Lake. Virus isolation was performed on embryonated chicken eggs. The influenza A virus was determined by rRT-PCR. Virus sequences were acquired by deep sequencing. The phylogenetic correlation and the molecular properties of the viruses were analyzed. Virus growth and infection characteristics, receptor binding preference and pathogenicity were examined both in vitro and. Results: Two influenza viruses of subtype H13N8 were isolated. The viruses belong phylogenetically to the Eurasian lineage. Most genes are associated with gull influenza virus, except for the PB1 gene, which is most likely derived from Anseriformes virus. Evidence of rearrangement between species has been presented. The two viruses have limited growth capacity on MDCK and A549 cells while growing well in embryonated eggs. The dual receptor binding characteristics of the two viruses have been demonstrated. The low pathogenic characteristics were determined by a trypsin-dependency plaque formation assay. Conclusions: The two influenza viruses of the H13N8 subtype are strongly associated with gull origin. The interspecies reassortment of the H13 subtype virus among wild birds Anseriformes and Charadriiformes underscores the importance of increased surveillance for avian influenza in this region.

In this study, ZJ01 caused fatal diseases, while the Chinese prototypical PRV strain LA caused mild respiratory diseases. Full genome sequencing results show that the two viruses can be divided into two subgroups, distinct from traditional European and US strains. To investigate the potential role of the gE and gI proteins in ZJ01 virulence, we generated several recombinant viruses. Two chimeric viruses (rZJ01-LA/gEI and rLA-ZJ01/gEI) had their gE and gI genes swapped using corresponding genes from ZJ01 and LA. rZJ01-LA/gEI and the parental virus rZJ01 maintained high virulence in piglets, although survival time for rZJ01-LA/gEI infected piglets was apparently prolonged. In contrast, rLA-ZJ01/gEI showed higher virulence than its parental virus rLA. We conclude that changes in the gE and gI proteins contribute in part to the increased virulence of the ZJ01 strain.",,"Dong, J.;Gu, Z.;Jin, L.;Lv, L.;Wang, J.;Sun, T.;Bai, J.;Sun, H.;Wang, X.;Jiang, P.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2018.03.024,0

The genome of this new strain was 15,413 nucleotides (nt) long and a comparative analysis showed that GDsg was 82.4% to 94% co-located with PRRSV type 2 strains, but only 61.5% with the PRRSV Lelystad virus strain of type 1 was identical. Phylogenetic analysis showed that type 2 PRRSV isolates comprise five subgenotypes (I, II, III, IV and V) represented by NADC30, VR-2332, GM2, CH-1a and HuN4, respectively. In addition, GDsg belongs to an emerging type 2 PRRSV subgenotype III. Interestingly, the newly isolated GDsg strain has several discontinuous nt deletions, 131 (19+18+94) at position 1404-1540 and a 107 nt insertion in the NSP2 region. Most importantly, the GDsg strain was identified as a virus recombined between the low pathogenic field strain QYYZ and the vaccine strain JXA1-P80.

Previous studies describing the evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J genetic variants have mainly focused on the early infection period or a few randomly selected clones. Here we inoculated 30 specific pathogen-free chickens with the same founder ALV-J strain of known genetic background. Six (three antibody positive and three antibody negative) chickens were selected from 15 chickens with viraemia. Viruses were serially isolated over 36 weeks and then sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing platform MiSeq. This resulted in the largest ALV-J data set to date, consisting of more than three million clean reads. Our results indicated that host humoral immunity could significantly enhance the genetic diversity of ALV-J genetic variants. In particular, selection pressure promoted dynamic proportional changes in the frequency of ALV-J genetic variants. The cross-neutralization experiment showed that along with the change in the dominant variant, the antibody titers specific to infectious clones corresponding to the most dominant variants at weeks 12 and 28 also changed significantly in the sera obtained at weeks 16 and 32 A shift in the dominant variant was observed in antibody-negative chickens.

This protein has several essential roles in the replication cycle including RNA binding, viroplasma formation, helicase and can hydrolyze the β-phosphate of RNA and NTPs acting as RTPase and NTPase. When examining sequences from rotavirus strains isolated between 1984 and 2009 in Australia, the NSP2 gene was found to be highly conserved and clustered with the defined NSP2 genotypes N1 and N2 according to the complete genome-based rotavirus classification system. Phylogenetic analysis showed that NSP2 gene sequences isolated from Australian rotavirus strains formed four distinct lineages. Temporal variation was observed in several clusters during the 26-year period, with lineage D being identified throughout the study period and lineage A being detected only since 1999. This sequence from a human strain closely clustered with the NSP2 genes of bovine rotavirus strains. This study also identified a sequence that lay between the lineages and showed evidence of recombination, the first time that intergenetic recombination has been demonstrated in an NSP2 gene sequence.

Most studies have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify bacteria. However, the falling cost of sequencing has led to a gradual shift away from amplicon analysis and toward shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Shotgun metagenome data can be used to identify a wide range of species, but has rarely been used to identify fungi. Here we develop a sequence classification pipeline, FindFungi, and use it to identify fungal sequences in public metagenome datasets. We mainly focus on animal metagenomes, particularly those from porcine and mouse microbiomes. We identified fungi in 39 out of 70 datasets covering 71 fungal species. At least 11 pathogenic species with zoonotic potential have been identified, including Candida tropicalis. We identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples originally analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel oil. We also show that Candida tropicalis and Candida loboi are probably the same species.

They provide vital ecosystem services, some species are useful models in biomedical research, and some are kept as pets. However, many rodent species can have adverse effects such as: B. damage to crops and stored products, and they are health concerns due to the transmission of pathogens to humans and livestock. The first rodent viruses were discovered through isolation approaches and led to breakthroughs in immunology, molecular and cell biology, and cancer research. In addition to rodent-specific viruses, rodent-borne viruses cause a variety of zoonoses. The most prominent examples are recurrent outbreaks of human hemorrhagic febrile illnesses caused by arenaviruses and hantaviruses. In addition, rodents are reservoirs for vector-borne pathogens such as B. tick-borne encephalitis virus and Borrelia spp., and may carry human pathogens but are unlikely to be involved in their transmission to humans. Today, next-generation sequencing, or high-throughput sequencing (HTS), is revolutionizing the speed of new virus discovery, but other molecular approaches, such as generic RT-PCR/PCR and rolling circle amplification techniques also contribute significantly to the rapidly advancing process. However, the current state of knowledge is still only the tip of the iceberg when comparing the known human viruses to those known in rodents, the mammalian taxon with the largest species diversity. The diagnostic potential of HTS-based metagenomic approaches is illustrated by their use in the discovery and full genome characterization of novel bornaviruses and adenoviruses as causative pathogens in squirrels. In summary, HTS in combination with conventional RT-PCR/PCR-based approaches led to a drastically increased knowledge of rodent virus diversity. Future improvements in the workflows used, including bioinformatic analysis, will further enhance our knowledge and preparedness in the event of new virus emergence. Classical virological and additional molecular approaches are needed for genome annotation and functional characterization of new viruses discovered by these technologies and assessment of their zoonotic potential.",,"Drewes, S.;StrakovÃ¡, P.;Drexler, J.

523,Bats harbor the most important mammalian paramyxoviruses,"The large Paramyxoviridae virus family includes some of the most important human and livestock viruses, such as measles, distemper, mumps, parainfluenza, Newcastle disease, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses. Here we identify an estimated 66 new paramyxoviruses in a global sample of 119 bat and rodent species (9,278 individuals). Key discoveries include proof of an African origin for Hendra and Nipah viruses, identification of a bat virus similar to human mumps virus, proof of close relatives in bats of respiratory syncytial virus, mouse pneumonia virus and canine distemper virus, and more direct ones Detection of Sendai virus in rodents. The phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations indicates a dominance of host switching from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis testing in a maximum likelihood framework allows the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes of both major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae).

524,"Bats worldwide carry hepatitis E virus-related viruses, forming a putative new genus within the family Hepeviridae","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which are found in temperate climates. Given the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat samples from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs have been identified in African, Central American, and European bats and form a new phylogenetic clade in the Hepeviridae family. Bat hepeviruses were highly diverse and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence of transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Complete genome analysis of a representative virus confirmed the formal classification within the Hepeviridae family. Sequence and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family Hepeviridae, and that at least three other genera encompassing human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be identified. This may indicate that hepeviruses have not recently entered mammalian hosts and undergone speciation according to their host limitations.

525,Next-generation sequencing reveals diversification of the West Nile virus quasispecies after a single passage in a carrion crow (Corvus corone) in vivo infection model.,"West Nile virus (WNV) occurs as a population of genetic variants (quasispecies) that infect a single animal. Previous estimates of low-resolution viral genetic diversity in wild bird and mosquito samples and in multi-passage adaptation studies in vivo or in cell culture suggest that WNV genetic diversification is mainly restricted to the mosquito vector. This study examined the genetic diversification of WNV in avian hosts during a single passage using next-generation sequencing. Wild-caught carrion crows were infected subcutaneously with a clonal Middle Eastern WNV. Blood samples were taken 2 and 4 days after infection. A reverse transcription (RT)-PCR approach was used to directly amplify the WNV genome from serum samples prior to next-generation sequencing, resulting in an average depth of at least 700x in each sample. Appropriate controls were sequenced to distinguish biologically relevant low-frequency variants from experimentally introduced errors. The WNV populations in the wild crows showed significant diversification away from the quasispecies structure of the inoculum virus. In contrast, WNV populations in intracerebrally infected day-old chicks did not differ from those in the inoculum. While previous studies concluded that WNV genetic diversification was only experimentally demonstrated in its permissive insect vector species, we experimentally demonstrated significant diversification of WNV populations in a wild bird reservoir species.",,"Dridi, M.;Rosseel, T.;Orton, R.;Johnson, P.;Lecollinet, S.;Muylkens, B.;Lambrecht, B.;Van Borm, S.",2015.0,Oct,,0
526,Full nucleotide sequence of a Chinese serotype Asia1 vaccine strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the Chinese vaccine strain Asia1/YNBS/58 of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) has been determined. The results showed that the full genome of YNBS/58 is 8,164 nucleotides (nt) in length, including a 1,061 nt 5″ untranslated region (UTR), a 6,990 nt open reading frame (ORF), and a 113 nt 3″ -Region €² UTR. Genomic sequences of Asia1/YNBS/58 and other known FMDV strains were compared. Homology analysis showed that non-structural proteins are more conserved than structural proteins in FMDV and that the 5 inch UTR is more conserved than the 3 inch UTR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Asia1/YNBS/58 is clustered in the Asia1 serotype and associated with three other isolates, Asia1/IND/63/72, Asia1/3kimron/63 and Asia1/2ISRL/63, suggesting that they have a close connection genetic relationship. The VP1-, VP2- and VP3-based phylogenetic trees were divided into different clusters according to the different serotypes, while other gene-based phylogenetic trees showed some level of crossing between the serotypes. According to the nucleotide similarities between Asia1/YNBS/58 and two recent Chinese Asia1 isolates, Asia1/HKN/05 and Asia1/JS/05, each forms a different genotype.

527,MicroRNA expression profiling of sheep primary testicular cells in response to bluetongue virus infection,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a member of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae and causes a non-contagious, insect-borne disease in domestic and wild ruminants, mainly sheep and occasionally cattle and some deer species. Viral infection can trigger the changes in cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which play an important post-transcriptional regulatory role in gene expression and can profoundly affect viral replication and pathogenesis. Here we used deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular miRNAs were differentially expressed in BTV-infected primary testis (ST) cells. A total of 25 known miRNAs and 240 novel miRNA candidates differentially expressed in BTV-infected and uninfected ST cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes, respectively, were annotated. Nine differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Target prediction and functional analysis of these regulated miRNAs revealed significant enrichment for multiple signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, Hippo, NF-kB, viral carcinogenesis, FoxO, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. This study provides a valuable basis for further investigations into the role of miRNAs in BTV replication and pathogenesis.",,"Du, J.;Gao, S.;Tian, Z.;Xing, S.;Huang, D.;Zhang, G.;Zheng, Y.;Liu, G.;Luo, J.;Chang, H.;Yin, H.",2017.0,4,,0

The Picornaviridae family contains clinically important pathogens that infect humans and animals, and an increasing number of rodent picornaviruses have recently been implicated in zoonoses. We collected 574 throat and anal swab samples from 287 rodents of 10 different species from October 2013 to July 2015 from eight representative regions of China. Seven representative sequences identified from six rodent species were amplified as complete genomes and divided into four lineages. Three lineage 1 viruses belonged to a new genus of picornaviruses and were more closely related to hepatovirus than to other genera of picornaviruses based on aa homology. Lineage 2, lineage 3, and lineage 4 viruses belonged to the genera Rosavirus, Hunnivirus, and Enterovirus, respectively, and represented new species. According to both phylogenetic and identity analyses, lineage 2 viruses were closely related to rosavirus 2, recovered from the feces of a child in The Gambia, and lineage 3 viruses were closely related to domestic animal hunnivirus.

529,Molecular evolution and emergence of the H5N6 avian influenza virus in central China,"Avian influenza virus H5N6 (AIV) has posed a potential public health threat since its emergence in China in 2013. To understand the development and emergence of H5N6 AIV in the avian population, we performed molecular surveillance of live poultry markets ( LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, in central China, in 2014 and 2015. Wugang Prefecture lies on the East Asia-Australia migratory bird route and on November 21, 2016, a human death due to H5N6 virus was reported in the prefecture . Overall We collected and sequenced the complete genomes of 175 H5N6 AIVs. In particular, our analysis revealed that H5N6 AIVs contain at least six genotypes arising from the segment rearrangement, including a rare variant possessing an HA gene derived from H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene , which has its origins in H7N3 viruses. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis revealed that genetically similar H5N6 AIVs tend to cluster according to their geographic region of origin.

530,"Identification, phylogenetic evolution analysis of GDQY orf virus isolated from Qingyuan city, Guangdong province, southern China","Orf virus (ORFV) infection results in contagious ecthyma, also called contagious pustular dermatitis, which usually affects sheep, goats, and other small ruminants. It has a wide spread across the world and has also been reported to infect humans. Although many tribes from different parts of mainland China have been isolated, rarely has a tribe been reported from the southern provinces of China. We studied a case of orf virus infection that occurred in the city of Qingyuan, Guangdong Province, southern China. An orf virus strain, GDQY, was successfully isolated and identified by cell culture techniques and transmission electron microscopy. Whole genes from ORFV011, ORFV059, ORFV106 and ORFV107 were amplified for sequence analysis based on their nucleotide or amino acid level. To discuss the genetic variation, precise sequences were used to compare with other reference strains isolated from different districts or countries. Phylogenetic trees based on these strains were constructed and evolutionary distances were calculated based on the alignment of their full sequences. The typical structure of the orf virus was observed in cell culture suspensions inoculated with GDQY, and the full length of four genes were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GDQY is homologous to FJ-DS and CQ/WZ on ORFV011 nucleotides. Based on the comparison between GDQY and other isolates, ORFV059 may be more variable than ORFV011. Genetic studies of ORFV106 and 107 are reported for the first time in the presented study.",,"Duan, C.;Liao, M.;Wang, H.;Luo, X.;Shao, J.;Xu, Y.;Li, W.;Hao, W.;Luo, S.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.016,0
531,Isolation and characterization of the influenza A virus (subtype H5N1) that caused the first highly pathogenic outbreak of avian influenza in chickens in Bhutan,"We characterized the influenza A/H5N1 virus that caused the first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in chickens in Bhutan in 2010. The virus was highly virulent for chickens, killing them within two days of experimental vaccination with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.88. Complete genome sequencing of 4 virus isolates was performed for genetic and phylogenetic analysis. The isolates displayed multiple basic amino acids at their hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, similar to other ""Qinghai-like"" H5N1 isolates. The receptor binding site of the HA molecule contained avian-like amino acids (222Q and 224G). The isolates also contained the amino acid residue K at position 627 of the PB2 protein and other markers in the NS1 and PB1 proteins, highlighting the mammalian risk. However, the isolates were sensitive to influenza drugs currently on the market. Sequence analysis showed that the Bhutanese viruses shared 99.1-100% nucleotide homology in all eight genes among themselves and in the Bangladesh 2010 chicken isolate (A/chicken/Bangladesh/1151-11/2010), indicating a common progenitor virus . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Bhutanese isolates belonged to subclass 2.2.3 (EMA 3) and shared a common progenitor virus with the 2010 Bangladesh virus. Based on evidence of phylogeny and molecular markers, it was concluded that the outbreaks in Bhutan and Bangladesh in 2010 were due to independent introductions of the virus, probably by migratory birds. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Dubey, S.

533,Characterization of a new genotype and serotype of infectious bronchitis virus in West Africa,"Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1000 chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete sequences of the Spike 1 (S1) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV which we refer to as ""IBADAN"". The minimum genetic distance to the closest ""non-IBADAN"" strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The complete genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4% at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. Since IBV S1 plays an important role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared to strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005, but at a low level (33% antigen relatedness), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a novel serotype. A comparison of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity.

536,Effects of poultry house environment on bacterial community composition in poultry litter,"Viral and bacterial pathogens are a significant economic concern for the US broiler industry, and the ecological epicenter for poultry pathogens is the mixture of bedding material, chicken droppings and feathers that make up the bedding of a poultry house. This study used high-throughput sequencing to assess the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in poultry litter and to look for associations between these communities and a poultry house's environmental characteristics, including its history of gangrenous dermatitis (GD). Cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed differences in the distribution of bacterial phylotypes between wet and dry litter samples and between houses. Wet litter contained greater diversity, with 90% of the total bacterial abundance occurring in the top 214 OTU clusters. In contrast, only 50 clusters accounted for 90% of the bacterial abundance in dry litter. The sixth largest OTU cluster of all samples, classified as Arcobacter sp., an emerging human pathogen found only in the wet litter samples from a barn with a modern evaporative cooling system. Ironically, the primary pathogenic clostridial and staphylococcal species associated with GD have not been found in any homes; However, there were thirteen 16S rRNA gene phylotypes from mainly Gram-positive strains that were found only in GD-affected pens and were found mainly in wet litter samples. Overall, the environment in the poultry house appeared to significantly affect the composition of bacterial communities in the litter and may play a key role in the emergence of foodborne pathogens. © 2011 Dumas et al.",,"Dumas, M.

537,Molecular and microscopic detection of viruses in marine copepods,"As dominant members of marine mesozooplankton communities, copepods play critical roles in oceanic food webs and biogeochemical cycles. Despite the ecological importance of copepods, little is known about the causes of copepod mortality, and up to 35% of total copepod mortality cannot be attributed to predation alone. Viruses have established themselves as ecologically important infectious agents in the oceans; However, viral infections have not been studied in mesozooplankton communities. Here we used molecular and microscopic techniques to document viral infections in natural populations of the calanoid copepods Acartia tonsa (Dana) and Labidocera aestiva (Wheeler) in Tampa Bay, FL. Viral metagenomics revealed previously undocumented viruses in each species, termed Acartia tonsa copepod circo-like virus (AtCopCV) and Labidocera aestiva copepod circo-like virus (LaCopCV). LaCopCV has been found to be extremely widespread and abundant in L. aestiva populations, with a prevalence as high as 100% in some samples and an average viral load of 1.13 x 10(5) copies per individual. LaCopCV transcription was also detected in most L. aestiva individuals, indicating viral activity. AtCopCV was sporadically detected in A. tonsa populations throughout the year, suggesting temporal variability in viral infection dynamics. Finally, virus-like particles of unknown identity were observed by transmission electron microscopy in the connective tissues of A. tonsa and L. aestiva, indicating that viruses are actively replicating in the copepod connective tissues rather than infecting gut contents, parasites, or symbionts. Taken together, these results provide strong independent evidence for active viral infection in dominant copepod species, suggesting that viruses can significantly affect mesozooplankton ecology.",,"Dunlap, D.

Oral and subcutaneous inoculation of the virus in 1 day to 8 week old calves generally resulted in leukopenia and fever. Of 6 calves without colostrum that were vaccinated before receiving their first milk, 3 died; however, a comparable proportion (9/17) of unvaccinated calves without colostrum also died. Fever and leukopenia developed in 4- to 8-week-old calves exposed to the virus, but less than half of the calves developed diarrhea and few died. None of the colostrum-fed, unvaccinated calves died. Fetal infection in utero appeared to be common, as judged by the detection of antibodies to one or more bovine enteroviruses in fetuses aborted at or beyond 4 months of gestation. The antibodies were assumed to be of fetal origin. It has been postulated that in utero infection may contribute to early death or lack of resistance of the newborn calf to bacterial infection.",,"Dunne, H. W.;Huang, C. M.;Lin, W. J.",1974.0,,,0
539,Characterization of novel bovine leukemia virus (BLV) antisense transcripts by deep sequencing reveals constitutive expression in tumors and transcriptional interaction with viral microRNAs,"Background: Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a delta retrovirus closely related to human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). Cattle are the natural host of BLV, where it integrates into B cells and causes lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic, but after a prolonged latency period, approximately 5% develop aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, reflecting the disease course of HTLV-1. The mechanisms by which these viruses bring about cellular transformation remain obscure. With both viruses, little or no transcription from the 5'LTR is observed in tumors, however, the proviruses are not transcriptionally silent. In the case of BLV, a cluster of RNA polymerase III transcribed microRNAs is highly expressed, while the HTLV-1 antisense transcript HBZ is consistently found in all tumors examined. Results: Here, using RNA-seq, we show that the BLV provirus also constitutively expresses antisense transcripts in all leukemic and asymptomatic samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) can be alternately polyadenylated, generating a ~600 bp transcript (AS1-S) and a less abundant ~2200 bp transcript (AS1-L). Alternative splicing generates a second transcript of ~400 bp (AS2). The coding potential of AS1-S/L is ambiguous with a small open reading frame of 264 bp, however, the transcripts are mainly retained in the nucleus, suggesting an lncRNA-like role. The AS1-L transcript overlaps the BLV microRNAs and using high-throughput sequencing of RNA ligase-mediated (RLM) 5'RACE we show that the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments with engineered BLV proviruses, in which the microRNAs are either deleted or inverted, indicate additional transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species. Conclusions: The identification of new viral antisense transcripts shows that the BLV provirus is far from silent in tumors. Furthermore, the consistent expression of these transcripts in both leukemic and non-malignant clones indicates a crucial role in the virus life cycle and its tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, cleavage of the AS1-L transcript by the BLV-encoded microRNAs and transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species suggest a shared role in the regulation of BLV.",,"Durkin, K.;Rosewick, N.;Artesi, M.;Hahaut, V.;Griebel, P.;Arsic, N.;Burny, A.;Georges, M.;Van den Broeke, A.",2016.0,,10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8,0
540,Phylogenetic analysis of beak and feather disease virus across a host ring-species complex,"Pathogens have been hypothesized to play an important role in host diversity and speciation. The susceptibility of hybrid hosts to pathogens is believed to be a common phenomenon that could promote host population divergence and subsequent speciation. However, few studies have tested for pathogen infection across animal hybrid zones while simultaneously testing for pathogen codivergence in the hybridizing host complex. For 8 years we studied natural infection by a rapidly evolving single-stranded DNA virus, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), infecting parrots by exploiting a host ring species complex (Platycercus elegans) in Australia. We found that the host subspecies and their hybrids differed strikingly in both BFDV prevalence and burden: both hybrid and phenotypically intermediate subspecies had lower prevalence and burden compared to parental subspecies, while host age, sex, lengths - and latitude as well as temporal effects were controlled . We have sequenced viral isolates throughout the range, which, to our knowledge, revealed for the first time in a host-pathogen system patterns of genomic variation analogous to Mayr's ring species hypothesis. Viral phylogeny, geographical location, intraspecific host densities, and parrot community diversity and composition did not explain the differences in BFDV prevalence or burden between subpopulations. Overall, our analyzes suggest that host functional responses to infection, or infective power, differ between subspecies and hybrids. Our results highlight the role of host hybridization and cline in altering host-pathogen interactions, dynamics that can have important implications for speciation models involving gene flow, and provide insights into how pathogens can adapt to different host populations.",,"Eastwood, J.

541,Novel Atlantic bottlenose dolphin parainfluenza virus TtPIV-1 clusters with bovine PIV-3 genotype B strains,"Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) is a common viral infection not only in humans but also in many other species. Serologic evidence suggests that nearly 100% of children in the United States by age 5 were infected with PIV-3. Similarly, in cattle, PIV-3 is commonly associated with bovine respiratory disease complex. A novel dolphin PIV-3 (TtPIV-1) was reported by Nollens et al. in 2008 by a dolphin diagnosed with an unknown respiratory disease. At that time, TtPIV-1 was found to be most similar to, but distinct from, bovine PIV-3 (BPIV-3). In the present study, similar viral growth kinetics and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6 and CXCL8) production were seen between BPIV-3 and TtPIV-1 in BEAS-2B, MDBK and Vero cell lines. The initial nomenclature of TtPIV-1 was based on a partial sequence of the fusion and RNA polymerase genes. Because of the similarities we saw with the in vitro work, it was important to take a closer look at the TtPIV-1 genome. Full genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six TtPIV-1 viral genes are clustered in the recently described BPIV-3 genotype B strains, and it is proposed to link TtPIV-1 to BPIV-3 genotype reclassify B strains.",,"Eberle, K.

542,Characterization of the structural proteins of Porcine Epizootic Diarrhea Virus strain CV777,"Swine epizootic diarrheal virus cannot be grown in cell culture; to characterize it, intestinal perfusate material from a pig infected with strain CV777 had to be used. A peak of virus-specific ELISA activity was detected at a density of 1.17 g/ml in isopycnic sucrose gradients. Using immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated purified virus material followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 3 low molecular weight proteins (20,000 to 32,000 daltons [D]) were found; after blotting of nitrocellulose and glycoprotein identification with concanavalin A and horseradish peroxidase, 1 of the proteins (23,000 D) gave a signal. Another protein of 58,000 D was encountered, which was the only protein that binds an RNA probe. Finally, a protein of 85,000 D was visible, associated with smaller bands of around 110,000 and 135,000 D in most experiments. The same bands were visualized using the concanavalin A blotting technique. The detection of a polydisperse cluster of proteins from 20,000 to 32,000 D (at least 1 of which is glycosylated), of glycosylated proteins from 85,000 to 135,000 D and an RNA-binding protein of 58,000 D is taken as structural evidence that pigs should be infested with diarrheal virus be assigned to the Coronaviridae, notwithstanding the apparent lack of an antigenic relationship with other members of this family.",,"Egberink, H.

543,Detection and molecular characterization of foot-and-mouth disease viruses from outbreaks in some states of northern Nigeria in 2013-2015,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) control measures in Nigeria have not been implemented due to the lack of locally produced vaccines and risk-based analysis due to insufficient data on circulating FMD virus (FMD) serotypes/strains. In 2013-2015, blood and epithelial samples were collected from reported FMD outbreaks in four states (Kaduna, Kwara, Plateau and Bauchi) in northern Nigeria. The seroprevalence of FMDV nonstructural proteins (NSP) for the outbreaks was estimated at 80% (72 out of 90) and 70% (131 out of 188) after the outbreak. Antibodies against the FMD serotypes O, A, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 were detected nationwide using competitive solid-phase ELISA. The FMD genome was detected in 99% (73 out of 74) of samples from FMD affected animals by rRT-PCR and 59% (44 out of 74) of these samples were found to be cytopathic in cell culture. Three FMDV serotypes O, A and SAT2 have been isolated and characterized. Phylogenetic assessments of the virus isolates showed that two topotypes of FMD serotype O, East African-3 (EA-3) and West African (WA) topotypes, and African genotype (G-IV) FMD strains circulated. of serotype A and FMDV SAT2 topotype VII strains. While the Nigerian serotype O (EA-3) strains were most closely related to a 1999 virus strain from Sudan, the WA strain in Nigeria shares a genetic relationship with three 1988 viruses in Niger. The FMDV serotype A strains were closely related to a known virus from Cameroon, and the SAT2 strains were most closely related to virus subtypes in Libya. This study provides evidence for the co-occurrence of FMD serotypes and topotypes in West, Central, East and North Africa and this has implications for control. Findings help fill the knowledge gap on FMD dynamics in Nigeria and the West African subregion to support local and regional development of vaccination-based control plans and international risk assessment.",,"Ehizibolo, D.

544,Bovine herpesvirus type 2 is closely related to primate alphaherpesviruses,"Bovine herpesvirus type 2 (BoHV-2), also known as bovine mammillititis virus, is classified along with herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) in the family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and the genus simplexvirus and ranked other primate simplexviruses on the basis of similarities in 4 genes within the 15 kb U(L) 23-29 cluster. This could be explained by either global similarity or a recombination event that brought primate herpesviral sequences into a bovine virus. Our sequences for DNA polymerase (U(L)30), a large gene adjacent to the previously identified conserved cluster, and glycoprotein G (U(S)4), a gene located as far from the cluster as possible on the circularized genome confirm the close relationship between BoHV-2 and the primate simplexviruses and argue for global similarity and probably a close evolutionary relationship. Therefore, one can speculate that BoHV-2 could pose a greater threat to humans than previously thought.",,"Ehlers, B.;Goltz, M.;Ejercito, M. P.;Dasika, G. K.;Letchworth, G.

545,First outbreaks and phylogenetic analyzes of avian influenza H9N2 viruses isolated from poultry flocks in Morocco,"Background: H9N2 avian influenza viruses continue to spread worldwide in poultry and wild birds. Morocco faced its first outbreaks of the H9N2 influenza virus in early 2016, affecting various types of poultry production. After its introduction, the virus spread very quickly across the country. Methods: Samples were collected from 11 chicken flocks with high morbidity and mortality rates. Four viruses were successfully isolated from broilers and one from broilers and fully sequenced. Results: Phylogenetic and molecular marker analyzes showed that the Moroccan viruses belonged to the G1 lineage and probably originated in the Middle East. As is known for H9N2 viruses, the Moroccan isolates possess several genetic markers that increase virulence in poultry and transmission to humans. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that H9N2 could have devastating effects on egg production and mortality under field conditions and highlighted a lack of surveillance data on the pathogen in the region.",,"El Houadfi, M.;Fellahi, S.;Nassik, S.;GuÃ©rin, J.

547,Detection of the first human G6P[14] rotavirus strain in a child with diarrhea in Egypt,"We report the first detection of a G6P[14] rotavirus strain in the stool of a child participating in a 2004 hospital diarrhea surveillance study in Egypt. the P (VP4) and G (VP7) genotypes of the strain were identified by RT-PCR. We sequenced the VP7 gene and the VP8* portion of the VP4 gene and the strain showed the strongest identity to VP7 [>94% nucleotides (nt), >97% amino acids (aa)] and VP4 (>93% nt, >98 % aa) Sequences of PA169, a new G6P[14] strain first isolated from a child in Italy in the winter of 1987. Additional sequencing and analysis of the other remaining structural (VP1-VP3, VP6) and non-structural (NSP1-NSP5) proteins support this animal-to-human reassortment theory. According to the complete genome classification system, strain G6P[14] (EGY3399) has been assigned to genotypes G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3. The NSP4 and NSP5 gene sequences of EGY3399 were most similar to those of sheep and monkeys, respectively. Coupled with other observations, our results suggest that G6P[14] isolates rarely cause severe diarrhea in Egyptian children and support other studies suggesting that animal rotavirus contributes to the genetic diversity of rotavirus that is transmitted to humans by transmission between species and rearrangement of single or multiple segments has been demonstrated. © 2011.",,"El Sherif, M.;Esona, M.

548,"Avian flu: virology, diagnosis and surveillance","Avian influenza virus (AIV) is the causative agent of a zoonosis that affects populations worldwide with often devastating economic and public health consequences. Most AIV subtypes cause little or no disease in waterfowl, but outbreaks in poultry can be associated with high mortality. Although transmission of AIV to humans is rare and strain-dependent, the virus has the ability to mutate or convert into a form that causes a life-threatening infection. The constant emergence of new influenza strains makes it particularly difficult to predict behavior, spread, virulence, or the potential for human-to-human transmission. Since it is difficult to predict which virus strain or which location will trigger the next pandemic, it is difficult to prepare for this event. However, consistent implementation of biosecurity, immunization and education programs can minimize the risk of AIV. Global surveillance programs aid in the collection and identification of emerging and potentially pandemic strains harbored by the reservoir host. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",,"El Zowalaty, M.

549,The ovine respiratory syncytial virus F gene sequence and its diagnostic application,"Ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) are divided into 2 subgroups, ovine RSV and bovine RSV. Although ovine RSV infects cattle, its contribution to bovine respiratory disease has not been demonstrated, an important issue for cattle vaccine development. Diagnosis by virus isolation or serology has low or variable sensitivity and/or specificity, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been recommended as a rapid and sensitive technique for RSV detection. A simple method has been developed to detect and identify bovine and ovine RSVs. First, the nucleotide sequence of the ovine RSV fusion gene (F) was determined and compared to representative strains of bovine RSV and human RSV subgroups A and B. The ovine RSV F gene shares 85 and 72-73% nucleotide identity with bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the ovine RSV F gene has 94 and 83-84% amino acid identity to that of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. Then, PCR primers were designed that targeted a specific F gene fragment from bovine and ovine RSV. The primers represented bases 85-103 and the complementary sequence to bases 510-493 of the ovine RSV F gene. A similar PCR product (426 bp) was obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis of bovine RSV and ovine RSV. However, the products were unique to the parent virus and could be distinguished by EcoRI or MspI restriction endonuclease digestion. EcoRI cleaved the sheep product into 2 bands (285 and 141 bp) but failed to affect the bovine RSV PCR product. However, MspI cleaved the bovine product into 2 bands (229 and 197 bp) but had no effect on the ovine product. Again, this assay did not amplify any human RSV PCR product. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion is a useful and practical approach for the detection and differentiation of ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses.",,"Eleraky, N.

550,Accurate classification and hemagglutinin amino acid signatures for association and subtyping of influenza A virus host origin,"Host origin classification and influenza A virus signatures were examined using the HA protein to trace the host of origin of the HA. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), decision trees, and associative classifications were generated for each influenza A virus subtype and its major hosts (human, avian, swine). Host- and subtype-specific features of the HA protein signatures were sought. Host-associated signatures that appeared in different subtypes of the virus were identified. An evaluation of the classification models based on ROC curves and support and confidence assessments for the amino acid class association rules was performed. Host classification based on HA subtype achieved accuracies between 91.2% and 100% using decision trees after feature selection. Host-specific class association rules for avian host ancestry yielded better support and confidence scores, followed by human ancestry, and finally porcine ancestry. This finding indicates the lower specificity of the pig host, possibly reflecting its ability to mix different strains.Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"ElHefnawi, M.;Sherif, F.

Subgroup A and B receptors are molecularly identified and their genomic positions TVA and TVB are mapped. The subgroup C receptor is unknown, its genomic locus TVC is thought to be genetically linked to TVA located on chicken chromosome 28. In this study, we used two chicken inbred lines carrying different alleles encoding resistance (TVCR) and susceptibility (TFCS) to infection by subgroup C virus. A back ross population of these lines was tested for susceptibility to subgroup C infection and genotyped for chicken chromosome 28 markers. We confirmed the close association between TVA and TVC loci.

552,Identification and genetic characterization of rabies virus from Egyptian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) bitten by a fox,"Rabies is caused by negative-strand RNA viruses classified in the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The aim of the present study was to identify and analyze the nucleotide sequence of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus (RABV) from two cases of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) bitten by a fox in Egypt in 2013. The diseased buffalo showed nervous manifestations with fever. Brain samples from the buffalo suspected of having rabies were collected. RABV in pooled specimens was identified using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) technique, histopathological examination, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the partially amplified nucleoprotein (N) gene was compared to the other street strains of RABV available on GenBank. The results showed that the RABV antigen in the brains of diseased buffalo was identified by the dFA technique and the characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions (Negri bodies) and the RABV nucleic acid were detected by histopathology and RT-PCR, respectively. The identified virus showed close genetic relatedness to street strains previously identified from dogs in different governorates in Egypt and to strains identified in Israel and Jordan, suggesting transmission of the virus between Egyptian governorates with possible transmission of and /or points to our neighboring countries.",,"El-Tholoth, M.;El-Beskawy, M.;Hamed, M.

Based on the nucleotide sequences of their 5″ untranslated region, isolates were phylogenetically classified as either subgenotype 2.1b or 2.2, and the 2014 and 2015 isolates classified as 2.1b were closely related to isolates from China and Korea. In addition, at least three different class 2.1b viruses have been circulating in Mongolia.

558,Viral detection as a tool for pandemic preparedness,"Emerging diseases are often caused by novel or previously unrecognized zoonotic viral agents, typically of and originating from wild animals. When human or animal cases are first detected, molecular or serological diagnostic assays specific to them do not yet exist, resulting in a delay in identifying the causative agent of an outbreak, as well as its source. Preparing for the emergence of the next virus is a major public health challenge, hampered by an inadequate understanding of the diversity of potential candidates in wildlife reservoirs. Characterizing the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help reduce the time between detection and response in an outbreak situation and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of transmission from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to identify known and new viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely adopted in surveillance programs. Metagenomic studies have identified new viruses and new strains of known viruses, and characterized host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to detecting viral sequences, it is limited by lower sensitivity than traditional PCR, requires significant bioinformatics skills, and is prohibitively expensive, and thus not widely used in regions of the world most prone to zoonoses occurring . In contrast, consensus PCR uses standard and widely used technologies, is more sensitive than NGS, and has also been used to identify new viruses in wildlife, livestock, and humans, although it is limited to detecting genetic target sequences that are conserved in known virus groups. The use of cPCR, when possible in combination with NGS and serology, can provide a powerful approach to rapidly identify etiologic agents in an outbreak and to characterize the virome of key wildlife animals known to transmit zoonotic viruses. Here the authors discuss pathogen discovery techniques currently used in human and animal surveillance programs and the challenges of using virus discovery to identify new zoonotic pathogens.",,"Epstein, J.

559,Key Transitions in Human Evolution Revisited: A Tribute to Ancient DNA,"The origin and diversification of modern humans have been shaped by major evolutionary transitions and demographic shifts. Patterns of genetic variation within modern populations can help reconstruct this similar 200,000-year population history. However, by combining this information with genomic data from ancient remains, one can now directly access our evolutionary past and reveal our population history in much greater detail. This Review outlines the major recent achievements in the study of ancient DNA, and illustrates how the field has recently moved from the amplification of short mitochondrial fragments by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to whole-genome sequencing, thus revisiting our own history. Ancient DNA research has revealed the routes our ancestors took to colonize the planet, with whom they interbred, how they domesticated plant and animal species, how they genetically responded to lifestyle changes, and also what pathogens decimated their populations. These approaches promise to soon resolve many pending controversies about our own origins that cannot be deciphered from modern patterns of genetic variation alone, and therefore offer an extremely powerful toolbox for a new generation of molecular anthropologists.

A deletion of 43 nucleotides is present in the European isolates compared to most American isolates. A larger deletion of 86 nucleotides is present in some viruses from South America and the Philippines. These deletions include the loss of one or two pseudoknot structures predicted in this region of the 5' UTR. In addition, multiple point mutations have allowed the derivation of a phylogenetic tree that defines a grouping of isolates very similar to that derived from the capsid gene sequences of the same viruses. The study provides evidence that deletion (or addition) events must occur very frequently during the evolution of FMD type C, since viruses that are phylogenetically very closely related (they belong to the same tree branch) evolve in the presence or absence of them distinguish deletions. Implications for the development of FMDV are discussed.",,"Escarmis, C.;Dopazo, J.;Davila, M.;Palma, E. L.;Domingo, E.",1995.0,,10.1016/0168-1702(94)00091-p,0
562,Effects of antigenic and genetic drift on serological surveillance of H5N2 avian influenza viruses,"Serological surveillance of avian influenza (AI) viruses is performed by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using reference reagents. This method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test to detect antigenic differences (subtypes) between circulating influenza viruses, vaccine and/or reference strains. However, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed in serosurveillance of influenza A virus in pig and poultry farms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of influenza virus genetic and antigenic drift on serological tests using standard HI assays and reference reagents. Low pathogenic AI-H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serological tests using antisera prepared with year-specific AI virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence between early LPAI-H5N2 viruses (1994–1998) and more recent virus field isolates (2002–2008). The results of the HI test were significantly affected by the selection of the AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as the reference antigen for the assay. These analyzes indicate that LPAI-H5N2 viruses are subject to ongoing genetic drift in Mexico and that serosurveillance of AI viruses is significantly affected by the antigen or antiserum used for HI testing. Viral reference antigens and/or antisera need to be constantly replaced during AI virus surveillance to keep up with AI antigen drift. This strategy aims to improve the estimation of antigenic differences between circulating AI viruses and the selection of appropriate vaccine strains.",,"Escorcia, M.;Carrillo-SÃ¡nchez, K.;March-Mifsut, S.;Chapa, J.;Lucio, E.;Nava, G.

In this study, we determined the full coding sequence of the F gene in new velogenic NDV isolates with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 1.8 and a mean time of death (MDT) of 72 or 48 h. Complete sequences of the F genes of new Iranian isolates were amplified and sequenced in both directions. These isolates were compared with 195 nucleotide sequences from GenBank (available from July 17, 2016). A pedigree was constructed for the F gene using MEGA6 software with statistical analysis based on 500 bootstrap replicates. Evolutionary distances showed that the new virulent isolates from Iran belonged to genotype VII in a new, distinct subgenotype called VII-(j). This new subgenotype showed 3% deviation from genotype VIId.

564,Equination (Inoculation of Horsepox): An Early Alternative to Vaccination (Inoculation of Cowpox) and the Possible Role of the Horsepox Virus in the Origin of the Smallpox Vaccine Review,"For nearly 150 years after Edward Jenner published The Inquiry in 1798, the cowpox virus was widely believed to be the vaccine against smallpox. It was not until 1939 that vaccinia, the smallpox vaccine virus, was shown to be serologically related but distinct from the cowpox virus. In the absence of a known natural host, vaccinia has been considered a laboratory virus, possibly derived from mutational or recombination events with vaccinia virus, variolaviruses, or some unknown ancestral orthopoxviruses. A preferred candidate for a vaccinia ancestor was the horsepox virus. Edward Jenner himself hypothesized that cowpox descended from horsepox, and he also believed that ""matter"" derived from both diseases could be used to prevent smallpox. During the 19th century in Europe, cowpox vaccination (vaccination) was used together with horsepox vaccination (equination) to prevent smallpox. Vaccine manufacturing practices during the 19th century may have led to the use of mixtures of viruses, resulting in various genetic modifications that have led to the vaccinia strains of today. Horsepox, a disease previously only reported in Europe, has been absent from that continent since the early 20th century and now appears to be extinct, although the virus may still be circulating in an unknown reservoir. Genomic sequencing of a horsepox virus isolated in Mongolia in 1976 showed that this horsepox virus, although closely related to vaccinia, contained additional, possibly ancestral, sequences absent in vaccinia. Recent genetic analyzes of existing vaccinia viruses have revealed that some strains contain ancestral horsepox virus genes or are phylogenetically related to the horsepox virus. We recently reported that a commercially manufactured smallpox vaccine, made in the United States in 1902, is genetically very similar to the horsepox virus, providing a missing link in this 200-year-old puzzle.",,"Esparza, J.;Schrick, L.;Damaso, C.

565,Orthopoxvirus DNA: strain differentiation by electrophoresis of restriction endonuclease-fragmented virion DNA,"Methods have been developed to purify intact intracytoplasmic poxvirus particles from infected cells and to isolate DNA from virions by equilibrium centrifugation in sodium diatrizoate density gradients. The buoyant density of twelve closely related orthopoxviruses purified in these gradients was determined to be 1.25 g/ml and that of the isolated virion DNAs to be 1.1 g/ml. Virion DNA from each of the 12 selected prototype and wild-type viruses was digested with three separate site-specific restriction endonucleases, Hind III, Sal I and Bam HI, and the fragments (molecular weights 0.5 x 10 6 to 20 x 10 6 ) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis separated. Characteristic DNA fragment migration patterns observed in the gels enabled the viruses to be classified. By comparing profiles of HindIII digested DNAs, we were able to group the viruses into 4 species: cowpox, vaccinia, monkeypox (2 isolates) and variola (8 isolates). Viruses of a variola major infection could be distinguished from viruses of a variola minor infection. Isolates within species (strains) were also distinguished, primarily by comparing the gel electrophoresis profiles of SalI-digested DNA from the viruses.",,"Esposito, J. J.;Obijeski, J. F.;Nakano, J.

566,Zoonotic poxviruses,"Smallpoxviruses threaten a group of long-known important pathogens, including some zoonotic members, affecting livestock and humans. While analysis of the entire genome sequence began to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell infection, viral replication, and virulence, our understanding of the maintenance of smallpoxviruses in nature and their transmission to humans is still poor. Over the last two decades, reports of emerging human monkeypox outbreaks in Africa and North America, the increasing number of cowpox virus infections in cats, exotic animals and humans, and cases of vaccinia virus infections in humans in South America and India have reminded us - the eradicated smallpox virus aside - there are nor other smallpox viruses that can harm men. We are beginning to learn that the host range of some smallpoxviruses is much broader than first thought, and that rodents appear to be the main virus reservoirs. The following overview is intended to provide an up-to-date overview of the epidemiology of zoonotic smallpoxviruses, with a focus on orthopoxviruses. By outlining the current state of knowledge about smallpoxvirus transmission, we hope to raise awareness of how infections are acquired and how to properly diagnose them. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Essbauer, S.;Pfeffer, M.;Meyer, H.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.026,0
567,Antigenic and genetic relationships between European highly virulent infectious bursal disease viruses and an early West African isolate,"The antigenic and genetic relationships between very virulent (vv) infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) from different countries were investigated. Antigenic characterization was performed using an antigen capture ELISA based on a panel of seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that probe at least three VP2-located antigenic domains. All of these domains are reactive in the reference strain Faragher 52/70 (F52/70) for the European classic serotype 1 IBDV. Genomic characterization was achieved by reverse transcription, amplification and direct sequencing of a genomic fragment encoding the VP2 variable domain. Eleven vv isolates from France were compared to the British, Dutch and Belgian UK661, DV86 and 849VB viruses and to an early vv isolate obtained in 1988 from Ivory Coast. All viruses displayed antigenic profiles characterized by no binding of Mabs 3 and 4. The lack of binding of Mabs 3 and 4 could therefore be helpful in distinguishing between classic and vvIBDVs. None of the non-French strains resembled French isolates 91168 and 94432, which do not bind Mabs 6, 7 or 8. Genetic analysis revealed a close relationship between all European viruses, differing from each other by no more than 12 nucleotides and 3 amino acids. The African isolate differed significantly from all European viruses, including the F52/70 virus, by at least 22 nucleotides and six amino acids. Phylogenetic analyzes based on the neighbor joining and parsimony methods suggest that the African virus may belong to a genetically distinct lineage of highly pathogenic IBDVs.",,"Eterradossi, N.;Arnauld, C.;Tekaia, F.;Toquin, D.;Le Coq, H.;Rivallan, G.;Guittet, M.;Domenech, J.;van den Berg, T.

Using publicly available sequence data and phylogenetic analysis tools, the origins and virus-host co-phylogeny of these viruses have been studied. Evidence is presented here in support of host switching by caliciviruses, but showing that zoonotic transmission does not appear to have occurred in the history of these viruses. The age or demographics of the caliciviruses cannot yet be estimated with any degree of support, but further study of this family as new dated sequences become available could provide key information of relevance to human health and to understanding the origin of foodborne viruses deliver disease.",,"Etherington, G.

569,Antigenic characterization of inclusion body hepatitis virus,"Evidence that chicken inclusion body hepatitis (IBHC) is caused by a virus (IBHV) was provided in 1973. Characterization of IBHV was performed using standard virus classification criteria. The results showed that IBHV is a member of the avian adenovirus group. However, no antigenic relationship was found between IBHV and two other avian adenovirus isolates (CELO and Indiana C) as observed by hemagglutination (HA) and virus-serum neutralization tests. Another adenovirus isolate proved to be serologically distinct from IBHV (Tipton strain) but elicited typical IBHV. This antigen was able to elicit a specific precipitation reaction with sera from chickens previously exposed to IBHV. Repeated embryo passage of IBHV reduced its pathogenicity to susceptible chickens. Protection of chickens against IBHV challenge was achieved by vaccination with high embryo passage IBHV (Tipton strain). It was also found that the subcutaneous administration of the vaccine virus induced a better immune response than the eye drop route, as observed by the virus-serum neutralization index obtained.",,"Fadly, A.

570,Reemergence of Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus in 2015 in Morocco: Molecular Characterization and Experimental Infection in Alpine Goats,"Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a transboundary viral disease of small ruminants causing enormous economic losses in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In Morocco, the first PPR outbreak was reported in 2008. Since then, no cases have been reported for seven years, likely due to three consecutive vaccination campaigns between 2008 and 2011 and close surveillance of border areas. In June 2015, the disease resurfaced in Morocco, raising questions about the origin of the virus. The PPR virus was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the virus was isolated from clinical specimens on VeroNectin-4 cells. The disease has been experimentally reproduced in Alpine goats using both ovine and caprine outbreak isolates. Molecular characterization of the 2015 Moroccan PPR isolate confirmed the identity of the virus as lineage IV, closely related to the 2012 isolates from Algeria (KP793696) and 2012 from Tunisia (KM068121), and distinct from the previous PPRV Morocco strain from 2008 (HQ131927). Therefore, this study confirms a new PPR virus outbreak in Morocco in 2015 and underlines the urgency of implementing a joint control strategy to combat PPR in the Maghreb region of North Africa.",,"Fakri, F.;Embarki, T.;Parida, S.;Bamouh, Z.;Jazouli, M.;Mahapatra, M.;Tadlaoui, K.;Fassi-Fihri, O.;Richardson, C.

571,Genetic heterogeneity of bovine viral diarrheal virus in Italy,"The genetic properties of 38 field isolates of bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV) collected in 1999 from diseased or healthy and persistently infected cattle from dairy farms in northern Italy were investigated. A partial 5"" untranslated region (5"" UTR) sequence of each isolate was determined and phylogenetic analysis performed. All isolates were assigned to the BVDV-1 genotype and could be assigned to different BVDV-1 groups, namely BVDV-1b (n=20), BVDV-1d (n=6) and BVDV-1e (n=10). ). Two remaining isolates could be classified as BVDV-1f and BVDV-1h, respectively.

572,Incidence of bovine viral diarrhea virus detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subpopulations in persistently infected animals and health outcomes,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) cause acute and persistent infections. Acute infection results in generalized immunosuppression characterized by a decrease in circulating lymphocytes as a result of depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Persistent infection with BVDV is the result of immune tolerance and is not generally associated with lymphocytopenia. The health outcome of persistently infected (PI) calves varies widely; some die from mucosal disease, some succumb to thrift, and others appear normal and survive into adulthood. Detection of BVDV at the single lymphoid cell level is important for studying subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during BVDV infections, however, few methods are available to detect and quantify BVDV at this level. To circumvent this difficulty, a novel flow cytometry-based PrimeFlow RNA assay with in situ detection of BVDV was developed. This assay was used to assess differences in viral distribution within subpopulations of PBMC over time in PI calves carrying either of two different types of BVDV (type 1 and type 2). The calves were sampled at 3 different times approximately one month apart. During the course of the study, a subset of calves died from thrift. No mucosal disease was reported in any of the deaths. Using RNA probes specific to the BVDV N<sup>-E<sup>-E<sup>rns</sup> coding regions for the respective virus, BVDV RNA was isolated in all PBMC from PI detected who appeared clinically healthy. It was found that calves that succumbed to thrift had little or no virus in T cells. Clearance of the virus from T cells suggests a breakdown in immune tolerance in these calves. This is the first report of a pattern observed in viral load in the T cell subpopulations and survival in PI calves.",,"Falkenberg, S. M.;Dassanayake, R. P.;Walz, P.;Casas, E.;Neill, J.

573,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of pseudorabies virus variants isolated from southern China's Guangdong Province between 2013 and 2014,"Pseudorabies (PR) outbreaks have occurred in southern China since late 2011, resulting in significant economic impacts on the swine industry. To identify the cause of PR outbreaks, particularly in vaccinated pigs, 11 field strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV) were isolated in Guangdong province between 2013 and 2014. Their major viral genes (gE, TK, gI, PK, gD, 11K, and 28K) were analyzed in this study. Insertions or deletions were observed in gD, gE, gI and PK genes compared to other PRV isolates from around the world. In addition, sequence alignment revealed that insertions in gD and gE were unique molecular features of the new predominant PRV strains in China. The phylogenetic analysis showed that our isolates were clustered in an independent branch together with other strains isolated from China in recent years and that they showed a closer genetic relationship to earlier isolates from Asia. Our results suggest that these isolates are novel PRV variants with unique molecular signatures.",,"Fan, J.;Zeng, X.;Zhang, G.;Wu, Q.;Niu, J.;Sun, B.;Xie, Q.;Ma, J.",2016.0,,10.4142/jvs.2016.17.3.369,0

Analyzes included examination of phylogenetic tree, evolution rates, amino acid substitutions, egg-adapted mutation and homology modelling. We found differences between the egg-adapted viruses and the MDCK cell-derived viruses based on phylogenetic trees and evolutionary rates; the viruses showed a trend of ""NA>HA>MP"". Four amino acid substitutions (Q223R, V527I, M19I and H275Y) were found in three egg-adapted viruses. Q223 border V527I were present in hemagglutinin protein while M19I and H275Y were detected in neuraminidase. The Q223R mutation altered the structure of the antigenic sites between Sb and Ca2. H275Y is a classic neuraminidase resistance mutation. The results suggest that the egg-adapted mutations were introduced when influenza viruses were isolated in chick embryos from the Hubei influenza surveillance network. These mutations can affect vaccine candidate selection and vaccine efficacy; Therefore, surveillance of egg-adapted mutations in the influenza surveillance network should be strengthened.",,"Fang, B.;Liu, L.;Ye, G.;Li, X.;Yu, X.;Jiang, Y.",2016.0,,,0

Neuraminidase evolves lineage-specifically when the virus adapts to a new host or changes to evade the host's immune system. Therefore, many PIPs undoubtedly identify positions involved in virus-host interactions. Phylogenetically important regions (PIRs) are defined as multiple PIPs close together. There are 15 PIRs on N1 and 12 on N2, seven of which are shared by the two subtypes. Many PIRs coincide with antigenic or glycosylation sites. Other PIRs may represent additional antigenic sites or may be involved in other aspects of virus-host biology.",,"Fanning, T. G.;Reid, A. H.;Taubenberger, J. K.",2000.0,2025-10-01 00:00:00,,0
577,Selection of vaccine strains of foot-and-mouth disease virus for use in southern Africa,"In the countries of southern Africa, the types SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 (SAT: Southern African Territories) of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus are most widespread, especially the virus SAT 2. Since 1982, studies have been carried out on 139 isolates of these virus types. In the north of this area, other viruses of type O and A were detected. Viral typing and subtyping with the complement fixation (CF) test can be improved through the use of panels of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which provide an accurate antigenic profile of a new strain. A total of 33 SAT 2 strains were tested with MAbs and the results allow the viruses to be classified into groups with the same profile. The author presents comparisons of isolates and vaccine viruses using conventional methods of serotyping - CF and virus neutralization (VN) tests - and profiling of the isolates using MAbs. Both types of analysis provide information about the relationships between the viruses. The CF and VN tests provide details of how animals responded to a particular isolate and how that antibody response would recognize a different isolate; from this, the serological relationships can be proposed in terms of how different isolates might induce a humoral immune response. With MAb profiling, details of the antigenic relationships between isolates are obtained, allowing for the identification of individual epitope variations. These analyzes can offer the possibility of classifying different isolates into ""antigenic"" groups. When comparing to vaccine viruses, one can try to identify the vaccine virus with the most similar profile to the isolate group. Immunological analysis (e.g. using the CF tests used in this document) can provide further information on the relationship between a given vaccine and an antigenic group identified by MAb profiling. Of course, this MAb profiling can provide essential information in a very short time, which is particularly beneficial in an emergency situation. The conclusions from the profiling would then be confirmed by the serological analyses. Such combined analyzes provide a more comprehensive identification of antigenic and immunogenic relationships between FMD virus isolates and between isolates and vaccine viruses.",,"Fargeaud, D.",1995.0,,,0
578,Intra-epidemic genome variation in highly pathogenic African swine fever virus (ASFV) from the country of Georgia,"BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes acute hemorrhagic infection in pigs with a mortality rate of up to 100%. No vaccine is available and the potential for catastrophic diseases in Europe remains elevated due to the ongoing ASF epidemic in Russia and the Baltic countries. To date, no whole genome intraepidemic variation has been reported for ASFV. To provide a more comprehensive basis for genetic variation at the onset of the ASF outbreak, we sequenced two Georgian ASFV samples, G-2008/1 and G-2008/2, derived from domestic pig blood collected in 2008. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted directly from low-volume ASFV-PCR-positive porcine blood samples and subjected to next-generation sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform. De novo and mapped sequence assemblies were performed using CLCBio software. Genomic illustrations, sequence alignments and assembler mappings were generated with Geneious v10.2.4. The sequence repeat architecture was analyzed with DNASTAR GeneQuest 14.1.0. RESULTS: The G-2008/1 and G-2008/2 genomes were distinguished from each other by coding changes in seven additional genes including MGF 110-1L, X69R, MGF 505-10R, EP364R, H233R, E199L and MGF 360 -21R to eight homopolymer tract variations. Genome 2008/2 possessed a new allelic state at a previously undescribed intergenic repeat locus between genes C315R and C147L. The C315R/C147L locus represents the earliest observed variable repeat sequence polymorphism reported in isolates of this epidemic. No sequence variation was observed in conventional ASFV subtyping markers. The two genomes showed complete collinearity and identical gene content to the Georgia 2007/1 reference genome. Approximately 56 unique homopolymeric A/T tract variations were identified that were unique to the Georgia 2007/1 genome. In both 2008 genomes, heterogeneity in reading sequences within the sample was evident at six homopolymeric G/C stretches restricted to the known ~7 kb hypervariable region in the left terminal region of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first intra-epidemic comparative genomic analysis reported for ASFV and provides insight into the intra-epidemic microevolution of ASFV. The genomes reported here, in addition to the G-2007/1 genome, provide an early basis for future genome-level comparisons and epidemiological tracing efforts.",,"Farlow, J.;Donduashvili, M.;Kokhreidze, M.;Kotorashvili, A.;Vepkhvadze, N.

579,Detection of foreign substances in vaccines - an overview of technical aspects,"The quality and safety of commercial vaccines are of fundamental importance. Despite all precautions and efforts, the use of biological material in vaccine development and manufacture can lead to possible contamination of vaccines with known and unknown foreign substances (EAs), potential active substances that need to be tested in vaccine manufacture. Nevertheless, the detection of known and unknown contaminants in vaccines is a common obligation for manufacturers and authorities in both the veterinary and human fields, who have similar requirements for specific technical approaches. State-of-the-art molecular methods such as randomly primed PCR in combination with massive parallel sequencing (MPS) or microarrays can open up new perspectives in foreign substance testing. The robustness and effectiveness of this technical approach to vaccine control was demonstrated in a human vaccine example when porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) contamination was revealed in Rotarix, a human rotavirus vaccine.

580,Xenosurveillance reflects traditional sampling techniques for identifying human pathogens: A comparative study in West Africa,"Background New surveillance strategies are needed to detect the rapid and continuous emergence of infectious disease agents. Ideally, new sampling strategies should be easy to implement, technologically straightforward, and applicable to areas where flood events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that uses blood collected from hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals, often found in sizeable populations. Additionally, many native or peridomestic mosquito species preferentially ingest blood meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir for collecting human blood. Methodology/Main results We attempted to exploit this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trial in northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood-fed mosquitoes accurately reflect those obtained directly from humans. In particular, blood has been collected from humans by finger pricks and by aspiration of blood-feeding mosquitoes from inside houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these samples was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from stranger surveillance and fingerstick blood collection yielded a similar number and quality of reads that align with two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus. Conclusions/Significance This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methods, while demonstrating the viability of xenosurveillance as a tool to sample human blood for circulating pathogens.",,"Fauver, J.

581,Duck gut viral metagenomic analysis captures a snapshot of viral diversity,"BACKGROUND: Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) are economically important waterfowl for meat, eggs, and feathers; is also a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. The emergence of new viruses is attributed to the status of coexistence of multiple types and subtypes of viruses in the reservoir hosts. For effective prediction of future viral epidemics or pandemics, an in-depth understanding of virome status in key reservoir species is critical. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the intestinal tract of ducks by a viral metagenomic approach, we deeply sequenced the viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks sharing the waters with wild ones migratory birds shared. RESULT: A total of 7,455,180 reads with an average length of 146 bases were generated, of which 7,354,300 reads were de novo assembled into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100,880 reads were singletons. The duck vioma was identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E-Score, <10(-3)) to a viral reference database. Numerous duck vioma sequences were homologous to the animal virus of the Papillomaviridae family; and phages from the families Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae and unclassified phages. In addition, several duck virome sequences were homologous with the insect viruses of the families Poxviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Baculoviridae, Densovirinae, Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae; and plant viruses of the families Secoviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Partitiviridae, reflecting the diet and colonization of ducks.

583,"Role of the mosquitoes Culex pipienis f. Pipiens and Cx. Pipiens f. molestus (Diptera, Culicidae) during the spread of West Nile virus in southern Russia","Cx. Pipiens is one of the main vectors of West Nile virus in southern Russia and is represented by the autogenous form, molestus, and the non-autogenous form, pipiens. The spatial distribution of its larvae and the food preferences of the females were studied to estimate the potential role of each form in the spread of the virus. The taxonomic status of the mosquitoes was determined based on their ability to be autogenic (543 specimens) and the type of mitochondrial DNA (348 specimens). The Pipiens form mosquitoes were shown to develop in the open urban and rural reservoirs and the females were non-autogenous. Cx. pipiens form molestus was only found in urban biotopes, mainly in flooded basements and in some years also in open reservoirs, where it formed a mixed population with Cx. Pipiens form pipiens. Both autogenous (85-95.2%) and non-autogenous specimens have been identified among females with the molestus mitotype. Genetic analysis of Cx. Pipiens females collected under the Berezantsev bell and in the trap with a bird showed that both forms were attracted to humans and birds. The results suggest that Cx.

VP2 sequence analysis showed that strains of the ITA genotype clustered separately from vaccine strains and other IBDV reference strains, either classical or very virulent. In order to obtain a more comprehensive molecular characterization of the IBDV ITA genotype and to speculate on its origin, genome sequencing of the previously assigned ITA genotype field isolate IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 was performed and the obtained sequences compared to the currently available corresponding sequences . In addition, phylogenetic and recombination analyzes were performed. Interestingly, multiple amino acid (AA) sequence alignments revealed that the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain shared several AA residues with highly virulent IBDV strains as well as some virulence markers, particularly in the VP1 protein. Nevertheless, sequence analysis revealed the presence of several residues typical of IBDV strains at a low level of virulence in the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain.

586,First evaluation of classical swine fever marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf for oral immunization of wild boar under field conditions,"Oral vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) is an effective tool to control disease outbreaks in wild boar. So far, vaccination campaigns have been carried out with live attenuated vaccines that do not allow any serological differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although this disadvantage is acceptable for wild boar, the use of marker vaccines would facilitate disease and vaccination dynamic studies. Recently, the CSF marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf was evaluated for oral immunization under laboratory conditions. Promising results led to efforts to study the vaccine candidate under field conditions and in bait formulation. In this context, two oral vaccination campaigns using CP7_E2alf decoy vaccines were carried out in two areas designated as “faunistic hunting farms” in the Umbria region, Italy. One campaign was carried out with single vaccination, the second with the routinely used double vaccination strategy. Both campaigns were carried out before concerted hunting actions were undertaken. Bait intake, vaccine virus detection and antibody responses were assessed along with post-evisceration inspections. As a comparison, seven wild boar were hand-fed with bait under laboratory conditions. In the field, bait uptake ranged from 63.7% to 98.7%, while antibody prevalence reached only 33.3–35.1%. The marker serology showed a strong influence of the sample quality on the test result, altogether 85% of the samples were correctly classified. Vaccination virus was not detectable. Under hand-feeding conditions, six out of seven wild boar ingested at least one bait, and five of them had detectable levels of antibodies seven weeks after vaccination. These results were supplemented by stability tests. Adequate stability of the vaccine virus has been demonstrated under both field and laboratory conditions. Overall, most of the results were in line with our expectations. However, attempts must be made in the future to optimize the DIVA assay. © 2014.",,"Feliziani, F.;Blome, S.;Petrini, S.;Giammarioli, M.;Iscaro, C.;Severi, G.;Convito, L.;Pietschmann, J.;Beer, M.;De Mia, G.

587,Co-localization of and interaction between duck enteritis virus glycoproteins H and L,"Background: Duck enteritis virus (DEV), which belongs to the α-herpesvirus subfamily, is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. Glycoprotein H and L (gH and gL) encoded by UL22 and UL1 are conserved in the herpesvirus family. They play an important role as gH/gL dimers during viral entry into host cells through cell-cell fusion. The interaction between gH and gL has been confirmed in several human herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this paper, we investigated the interaction between DEV gH and gL. Results: The recombinant plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL were successfully constructed. Expressions of both DEV gH and gL were observed after 12 h incubation of COS-7 cells transfected with pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL plasmids, respectively. Also the colocalization of part of gH and gL was detected in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells after cotransfection for 24 h. Then the recombinant plasmids pCMV-Flag-gL and pCMV-Myc-gH were constructed and co-transfected into COS-7 cells. Both gH and gL have been shown to be tested by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with positive results. Conclusions: Our results showed not only the co-localization of DEV gH and gL in COS-7 cells, but also the interaction between them. It will provide insight for further studies related to protein-protein interaction in DEV.",,"Feng, D.;Cui, M.;Jia, R.;Liu, S.;Wang, M.;Zhu, D.;Chen, S.;Liu, M.;Zhao, X.;Wu, Y.;Yang, Q.;Yin, Z.;Cheng, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1553-6,0

Analysis of the S1 gene sequences amplified from the 62 isolated strains along with 40 reference strains published in Genbank revealed nucleotide homologies ranging from 63.5 to 99.9% and amino acid homologies ranging from 57.9 to 100%. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Chinese IBV strains were classified into six distinct genetic groups (I-VI). Most of the isolated strains belonged to group I and the isolation of group V strains was increased compared to a previous monitoring period. The vaccine strains currently used in China (H120, H52, W93, and Ma5) formed the Mass group, which is evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates. Alignment of the S1 amino acid sequences revealed polymorphic and diverse substitutions, insertions and deletions, and the S1 protein of the major pandemic strains contained 540 amino acids with a cleavage site sequence of HRRRR or RRF(L/S)RR. Further analysis showed that recombination events formed a new subset. Taken together, these results suggest that different IBV variants co-circulated and underwent genetic evolution in southern China during the observation period. Therefore, long-term continuous surveillance is of great importance for the prevention and control of IBV infection. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Feng, K.;Xue, Y.;Wang, F.;Chen, F.;Shu, D.;Xie, Q.",2014.0,,10.1007/s11262-014-1097-1,0
589,Induction and suppression of innate antiviral responses by picornaviruses,"The Picornaviridae family consists of small, non-enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses and contains many human and animal pathogens, including enteroviruses (eg, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, and rhinovirus), cardioviruses (eg, encephalomyocarditis virus), hepatitis A virus and foot and mouth disease virus. Picornavirus infections activate a cytosolic RNA sensor, MDA5, which in turn induces a type I interferon response, a critical component of antiviral immunity. In addition, picornaviruses activate the formation of stress granules (SGs), large aggregates of ready-made mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles) to temporarily store these molecules during cellular stress. Meanwhile, picornaviruses actively suppress these antiviral responses to ensure efficient replication. In this review, we provide an overview of the induction and suppression of the MDA5-mediated IFN-α/β response and the cellular stress pathway by picornaviruses.",,"Feng, Q.;Langereis, M.

A total of 626 patients diagnosed with HFMD between January 2012 and September 2013 in Shanghai, China were enrolled in this study. Of these, 292 CVA6-infected cases were analyzed clinically. Whole genome sequencing, recombination and phylogenetic analyzes were also performed. A recombinant monophyletic CVA6 lineage was found during an outbreak of CVA6-associated HFMDs in Shanghai, China in November 2012 and accounted for 21.9% (64/292) of the CVA6 strains during the study period. Recombination analyzes indicated that the 2C gene of the novel CVA6 virus is likely derived from a community-circulating coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4) strain. Clinical observations showed that this recombinant CVA6 virus produced a more generalized skin rash than non-recombinant CVA6 virus. This newly emerged CVA6 lineage was associated with a significant proportion of HFMD cases in Shanghai in 2012-2013 and poses a potential public health threat.",,"Feng, X.;Guan, W.;Guo, Y.;Yu, H.;Zhang, X.;Cheng, R.;Wang, Z.;Zhang, Z.;Zhang, J.;Li, H.;Zhuang, Y.;Zhang, H.;Lu, Z.;Li, M.;Yu, H.;Bao, Y.;Hu, Y.;Yao, Z.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep11700,0

593,Pathogenesis of influenza D virus in cattle,"UNLABELING: Cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir of a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae virus family, tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Although IDV has been isolated from diseased animals, it is unclear whether IDV causes clinical disease in cattle. To address this aspect of Koch's postulates, three dairy calves (treatment animals) housed in individual pens were inoculated intranasally with the IDV strain D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014. One day after inoculation, one seronegative calf (contact animal) was added to each of the treatment animal pens. Cattle in both the treatment and contact groups seroconverted and virus was detected in their airways. Histologically, there was a significant increase in neutrophil tracking in tracheal epithelia of treated calves compared to controls. While infected animals and contact animals showed various symptoms of respiratory infection, they were mild, and calves in the treatment group did not differ from controls in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, or rectal temperature. To mimic zoonotic transmission, two ferrets were exposed to a plastic toy carrier soaked with infected nasal discharge from the treated calves. These ferrets did not shed or seroconvert the virus. In summary, this study demonstrates that when experimentally infected in cattle, IDV causes mild respiratory disease and can be effectively transmitted between cattle by contact in the barn, but not from cattle to ferrets by carrier exposure. These results support the hypothesis that cattle are a natural reservoir for the virus. IMPORTANT: A novel influenza virus, tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV), has been identified in pigs, cattle, sheep and goats. Among these hosts, cattle have been suggested as a natural reservoir. In this study we show that cattle experimentally infected with IDV can shed virus and transmit it to other cattle through direct contact, but not to ferrets via routes of infection. IDV caused minor clinical symptoms in the infected cattle, fulfilling another of Koch's postulates for this new agent, although other objective clinical endpoints did not differ from those of the control animals. Although the observed disease was mild, IDV induced neutrophil tracking and epithelial attenuation in bovine trachea, which could facilitate co-infection with other pathogens and thereby predispose animals to bovine respiratory disease.",,"Ferguson, L.;Olivier, A.

594,Molecular and phylogenetic characterization based on the complete genome of a virulent pathotype of Newcastle disease virus isolated in Brazil in the 1970s,"Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which comprises a diverse group of viruses with a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome. ND is one of the most important chicken diseases as it severely affects poultry production worldwide. Outbreaks of virulent ND were recorded in Brazil in the 1970s and the APMV-1/Chicken/Brazil/SJM/75 (SJM) strain of NDV was isolated. This strain has been characterized as being highly pathogenic to chickens but not pathogenic to other bird species. Here we present the complete genome of the NDV strain SJM and examine the phylogenetic relationship of this virus to other NDV strains in terms of genome and protein composition, and characterization of its evolutionary process. The NDV strain SJM is categorized as a velogenous virus and the complete genome is 15,192 nucleotides long and consists of six genes in the order 3'-NP-PMF-HN-L-5'. The presence of the major pathogenic determinant of NDV strains (112R-RQK-Râ†“F117) was identified in the fusion protein of NDV strain SJM. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis classified the NDV strain SJM as a member of class II, genotype V, showing that this virus helps us in understanding the evolutionary process of strains belonging to this genotype. This study contributes to the growing interest in characterizing NDV isolates to improve our current understanding of the epidemiology, surveillance and evolution of the pathogenic strains. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Fernandes, C.

595,Molecular detection of bovine noroviruses in Argentine dairy calves: circulation of a tentative new genotype,"Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens that are detected in fecal samples from both diarrheal and non-diarrheal calves from several countries around the world. However, epidemiological information on bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle-producing countries in South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in the faeces of diarrheal dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848 and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2), while the third (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. The capsid region of two of these strains could be determined by deep sequencing. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) along with the presence of another sequence (B4881) that shares its closest genetic relationship with genotype 1 but is sufficiently distant to form a new genotype. This latter strain was shown to be recombinant in silico: phylogenetic divergence was demonstrated between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a putative norovirus genotype). According to these data, this strain could be the second recombinant bovine norovirus of genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 to be described in the literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain might even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provide important epidemiological and evolutionary information about the bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.",,"Ferragut, F.;Vega, C.

596,Oligonucleotide microchip for influenza A virus subtyping,"BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes depending on the antigenic properties of their two outer glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen subtypes of HA and nine of NA are known. Recently, the distribution of some subtypes (H7N7, H5N1) has been closely monitored due to the epidemiological threat they pose. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the potential of gel-based microchip technology for rapid and sensitive molecular subtyping of influenza A virus. METHODS: The method uses a microchip composed of gel-based 3D elements containing immobilized probes. Segments of the HA and NA genes are amplified using multiplex RT-PCR and then hybridized to the microchip. RESULTS: The developed microchip was validated against a panel of 21 known reference strains of influenza virus. Selected strains represented different HA and NA subtypes derived from avian, porcine and human hosts. The entire procedure takes 10 hours and allows the identification of 15 subtypes of HA and two subtypes of NA. Forty-one clinical specimens isolated during the Novosibirsk poultry fall (Russia, 2005) were successfully identified using the proposed technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 76% and 100%, respectively, compared to the ""gold standard"" techniques (virus isolation followed by characterization by immunoassay). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the gel-based microchip subtyping method is a promising approach for the rapid detection and identification of influenza A, which could significantly improve surveillance.",,"Fesenko, E.

597,"Epidemiological study and analysis of non-primate hepacivirus NS5B gene and protein variability in several equine cohorts in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil","Among the recently described hepacivirus species, non-primate hepacivirus/hepacivirus A, found in horses and donkeys, is closely related to human hepatitis C virus (HCV). Therefore, the horse is an attractive surrogate large animal model for the study of HCV therapy, pathogenesis, and prophylaxis. Despite worldwide efforts, epidemiological and genetic studies have not elucidated the risk factors, virus distribution or genetic variability of hepacivirus A, which are also important for equine welfare. In Brazil, little information is available about this backdrop. The aim of this study was to investigate potential risk factors associated with hepacivirus A infection in different equine cohorts across Rio de Janeiro State and to assess the diversity of the viral NS5B gene and protein. Hepacivirus A RNA was detected in equine cohorts from all geographic mesoregions, regardless of equine activity or breed studied. The national prevalence ranged from 4.0% to 27.5%. Potential risk factors such as geographic location and age of female horses were significantly associated with the presence of viral RNA. The phylogenetic analysis showed the circulation of subtype 2 in all mesoregions. NS5B gene sequences grouped by geographic origin, while the NS5B fragments did not allow for discriminatory analysis. The predicted NS5B protein showed pronounced conservation, particularly in the thumb domain. In conclusion, the higher frequency of detection of hepacivirus A RNA in horses bred for reproduction and in young bitches suggests a direct link between reproductive practices and the spread of the virus.

Environmental changes and deforestation have greatly impacted many ecosystems and increased contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a large variety of astroviruses for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unresolved to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as causative agents of diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. Astroviruses have long been considered strictly species-specific. Recently, however, a large genetic diversity has been discovered among animal and human astroviruses, which may indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. In addition, our knowledge of the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been extended to some neurotrophic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock. This review provides an overview of what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans, and livestock, particularly cattle and pigs.

609,Genome analysis of the multihost pathogen Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae reveals extensive recombination and the existence of three generalized clades with wide geographic distribution,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of how bacterial populations are structured is an important prerequisite for studying their ecology and evolutionary history, and facilitates the study of host specificity, pathogenicity, geographic distribution, and molecular epidemiology. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is an opportunistic pathogen currently re-emerging in both the swine and poultry industries worldwide. This bacterium causes sporadic deaths in captive marine mammals and has recently been linked to large-scale wildlife extinctions. However, despite its economic importance and wide geographic and host distribution, including zoonotic potential, the global diversity, recombination rates and population structure of this bacterium remain poorly characterized. In this study, we performed a broad genomic comparison of E. rhusiopathiae based on a diverse collection of isolates to fill these knowledge gaps. RESULTS: Eighty-three E. rhusiopathiae isolates from a range of host species and geographic origins, isolated between 1958 and 2014, were sequenced and assembled using reference-based mapping and de novo assembly. We found that a high proportion of the nuclear genome (58%) underwent recombination. Therefore, we used three independent methods robust to the presence of recombination to define the population structure of this species: a phylogenetic tree based on a set of conserved protein sequences, in silico chromosome painting, and network analysis. All three methods showed broad agreement and supported the existence of three distinct clades within the species E. rhusiopathiae. Although we found some evidence of host and geographic aggregation, each clade contained isolates from different host species and from multiple continents. CONCLUSIONS: Using whole genome sequence data, we confirm recent suggestions that E. rhusiopathiae is a weakly clonal species formed largely by homologous recombination. Despite frequent recombination, we can reliably identify three distinct clades that do not clearly separate by host species or geographic origin. Our results provide an essential basis for future molecular-epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of E. rhusiopathiae and facilitate comparisons with other recombinogenic multi-host bacteria.",,"Forde, T.;Biek, R.;Zadoks, R.;Workentine, M.

610,Genetic diversity among 2009 pandemic influenza viruses isolated from a transmission chain,"BACKGROUND: Influenza viruses such as porcine influenza A(H1N1) virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) generate genetic diversity due to the high error rate of their RNA polymerase, often resulting in mixed genotype populations (intra-host variants) within one single infection. This variation helps influenza respond rapidly to selection pressures such as those imposed by the host immunological response and antiviral therapy. We applied deep sequencing to characterize influenza variation within the host in a chain of transmission consisting of three cases due to oseltamivir-susceptible viruses and one derived oseltamivir-resistant case. METHODS: After detecting the A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, we deeply sequenced the complete NA gene from two of the oseltamivir-sensitive virus-infected cases and all eight gene segments of the viruses causing the remaining two cases. RESULTS: No evidence of the resistance-causing mutation (resulting in a NA H275Y substitution) was observed in the oseltamivir-sensitive cases. In addition, deep sequencing revealed a subpopulation of oseltamivir-sensitive virus in the case carrying resistant virus. We found a higher level of intra-host variation in patients harboring oseltamivir-resistant virus than in patients infected with oseltamivir-susceptible virus. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir resistance was only detected after prophylaxis with oseltamivir, suggesting that the mutation was selected as a result of antiviral intervention. The persistence of the oseltamivir-susceptible virus population in the case where resistant virus was transmitted indicates either that a small proportion survives treatment or that the oseltamivir-susceptible virus is rapidly re-establishing itself in the viral population after the bottleneck. Furthermore, the increased intra-host variation in the oseltamivir-resistant case is consistent with the hypothesis that the population diversity of an RNA virus can increase rapidly after a population bottleneck.",,"Fordyce, S.

611,Detection of hepatitis E virus in samples of animal origin collected in Hungary,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human pathogenic enterally transmitted virus. HEV infections are mainly associated with acute, self-limited, icteric hepatitis with a median mortality rate of 1%. Animal reservoirs are believed to play an important role in virus maintenance and transmission of HEV to humans. HEV-induced seroconversion has been described in several species, but clinical hepatitis in animals has not been observed to date. Animal HEV strains are genetically closely related to human HEV isolates, supporting opinions on zoonotic transmission of the virus. In this extensive study, the occurrence of HEV in Hungarian wild and domestic animal samples was investigated. HEV RNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in liver samples from wild boar, roe deer and deer. The investigations of domestic pig samples detected HEV in 39% of the investigated Hungarian pig farms. A simultaneous examination revealed no clear difference between liver and faecal samples from domestic pigs in the frequency of HEV positivity. The highest incidence (36%) of HEV infection was found in the 11-16 week old pigs. Domestic cattle and rodent samples collected from pig farms, forests and meadows tested negative for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences amplified within the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of selected strains revealed that the viruses detected belong to three subgroups of the third genogroup of HEV and are closely related to human and porcine HEV strains found in different countries have been demonstrated. The investigations revealed a wide distribution of HEV in Hungarian wild ungulate and domesticated pig populations with considerable genetic diversity among strains. © 2009 Elsevier BV",,"ForgÃ¡ch, P.;Nowotny, N.;ErdÃ©lyi, K.;Boncz, A.;Zentai, J.;Szucs, G.;Reuter, G.;Bakonyi, T.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.004,0
612,A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to differentiate Massachusetts vaccine and Brazilian field genotypes of infectious avian bronchitis virus,"The infectious avian bronchitis virus is classified into serotypes or genotypes (or both) in different poultry producing countries of the world. In Brazil, the Massachusetts type (Mass), used as a live vaccine, and local Brazilian field variants (genotypes; BR) predominate in commercial poultry flocks. This study describes the development and validation of two real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluid and clinical specimens. Genotype-specific primers combined with a generic probe targeting the S1 gene were created in Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR specific assays. Analytical sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison to a generic IBV real-time RT-PCR based on the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five mass field isolates, three vaccine samples and one co-infected sample (BR and Mass), while BR-RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible and as sensitive as the classic 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 clinical IBV specimens, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR and 2 for both assays. Of the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive for 5'UTR RT-qPCR only and 30 were negative for the three assays. In conclusion, both assays were able to detect Mass and BR genotypes, allowing for fast and easy molecular typing of IBV from allantoic fluids and clinical specimens.",,"Fraga, A.

613,Discovery of parvovirus-related sequences in an unexpectedly broad range of animals,"Our understanding of the genetic diversity and host range of viruses is patchy. This is particularly true for the Parvoviridae family. Genetic diversity studies of single-stranded DNA viruses within this family have largely focused on arthropod and vertebrate infecting species that cause disease in humans and our domestic animals: a focus that has skewed our perception of parvovirus diversity. While metagenomics approaches could help correct this bias, so could transcriptomics studies. Large amounts of transcriptome data are available for a variety of animal species, and when these data have been inadvertently collected from virus-infected individuals, they may contain detectable viral transcripts. We therefore performed a systematic search for parvovirus-related sequences (PRSs) in publicly available transcript, genomic, and protein databases and eleven new transcriptome datasets. This revealed 463 PRSs in the transcript databases from 118 animals. At least 41 of these PRSs are likely integrated into animal genomes as they have also been found in genome sequence databases. The number of parvoviral sequences discovered in public databases not only sheds light on the ubiquity of parvoviruses, but also reveals numerous previously unknown parvovirus-host combinations; especially in invertebrates. Our results suggest that the host ranges of existing parvoviruses may span the entire animal kingdom.",,"FranÃ§ois, S.;Filloux, D.;Roumagnac, P.;Bigot, D.;Gayral, P.;Martin, D.

614,Classification of vaccinia viruses into several distinct clades and identification of a new lineage,"Cowpox virus (CPXV) has been considered a uniform species within the Orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus. Previous phylogenetic analyzes indicated that CPXV is polyphyletic and isolates can group into different clades, with two of these clades sharing genetic similarities with either variola (VARV) or vaccinia viruses (VACV). Further analyzes were initiated to assess both the genetic diversity and evolutionary background of circulating CPXVs. Here we report the complete sequences of 20 CPXV strains isolated from different animal species and humans in Germany. A phylogenetic analysis of a total of 83 full-length OPV genomes confirmed the polyphyletic character of the species CPXV and suggested at least four distinct clades. The German isolates from this study mainly clustered into two CPXV-like clades, and VARV- and VACV-like strains were not observed. A single strain isolated from a cotton-tipped tamarin clustered far from any other CPXVs and may represent a new and unique evolutionary lineage. The classification of the CPXV strains into clades roughly followed their geographic origin, with the highest clade diversity observed so far for Germany. Furthermore, we found evidence for recombination between OPV clades without significant disruption to the observed cluster formation. In conclusion, this analysis significantly expands the number of available full-length CPXV sequences and confirms the co-circulation of multiple CPXV clades in Germany and provides the first data on a new evolutionary CPXV lineage.",,"Franke, A.;Pfaff, F.;Jenckel, M.;Hoffmann, B.;HÃ¶per, D.;Antwerpen, M.;Meyer, H.;Beer, M.;Hoffmann, D.",2017.0,,10.3390/v9060142,0
615,Exploratory metagenomic analyzes of pigs affected by failure to thrive syndrome,"Modern pig farming is characterized by the occurrence of several syndromes of unclear etiology or multifactorial origin, including periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome (PFTS). In fact, its specific etiology remains elusive, although multiple causes have been studied over time. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of viral pathogens in PFTS-affected and healthy animals by assessing the viroma composition of different organs using a metagenomic approach. This analysis enabled detection of a higher frequency of porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) in healthy subjects, while ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (BoPV2), ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (PPV), and porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) were elevated in pigs with PFTS . No difference in frequency of RNA viruses was found between PFTS-affected and control pigs. Remarkably, this is the first molecular characterization of PPV6 and BoPV2 in Spain and one of the few worldwide, supporting their apparent widespread distribution. Interestingly, PCV-3 has recently been identified in several clinicopathological conditions as well as in healthy pigs, while the pathogenic potential of BoPV2 is unknown. Although the results obtained must be considered preliminary, they open the door to further studies on the possible role of these viruses or their combination as predisposing factors for the occurrence of PFTS.",,"Franzo, G.;Kekarainen, T.;Llorens, A.;Correa-Fiz, F.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2019.0,,10.1136/vr.105125,0
616,Subpopulations in aMPV vaccines are unlikely to be the sole cause of reversion to virulence,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infects the respiratory and reproductive tracts of domestic poultry, often with secondary infections, causing serious economic losses in most parts of the world. While the disease is generally effectively controlled by live vaccines, reversal of the virulence of these vaccines has been demonstrated on several occasions. Consensus sequence mutations involved in the process have been identified in more than one case. In a previous subtype A aMPV candidate vaccine study, small subpopulations were involved. In the current study, the presence of subpopulations in a subtype B vaccine was examined by deep sequencing. Of the 19 positions at which the consensus sequences of the vaccine (strain VCO3/50) and progenitor (strain VCO3/60616) differed, subpopulations at 4 positions were found to have a sequence consistent with the progenitor sequence. However, none of these mutations occurred in a virulent revertant of this vaccine, showing that the majority of the progenitor virus population had not survived the attenuation process and therefore was apparently not involved in a return to virulence. However, a single nucleotide variation was found within the vaccine that matched the consensus sequence of a derived virulent revertant virus, therefore these and other undiscovered, potentially virulent subpopulations may be involved in reversion. Much deeper sequencing of the precursor, vaccine and revertant can clarify whether problematic virulent subpopulations are present and therefore need to be routinely removed during aMPV vaccine preparation prior to registration and release.",,"Franzo, G.;Naylor, C.

618,quack leptin,"Background: A LEP transcript that is upregulated in the lungs of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with avian influenza A virus was recently described in the Nature Genetics manuscript reporting the duck genome. In vertebrates, the LEP gene symbol is reserved for leptin, the key regulator of mammalian energy balance. Results: Beginning a comprehensive search for this gene in the genome data submitted with the duck genome manuscript to the public databases and expanding this search to include all bird genomes in the Whole-Genome Shotgun-Sequencing Database, we were able to start with the first identification of report coding sequences capable of encoding the complete leptin protein precursor in wild birds. Gene structure, synteny and sequence similarity (up to 54% identity and 68% similarity) to reptile leptin evident in hawks (Falco peregrinus and cherrug), tits (Pseudopodoces humilis), finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and pigeons (Columba livia), confirms that the avian leptin was a true ortholog of its mammalian form. However, like other domestic chickens, the LEP gene was not identifiable in ducks. Conclusion: The absence of the LEP gene in poultry suggests that birds that have lost it are particularly suitable for domestication. The identification of an intact avian gene for leptin in wild birds may partially explain the evolutionary conservation of its receptor in leptin-deficient chickens. © 2014 Friedman-Einat and Seroussi; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Friedman-Einat, M.;Seroussi, E.",2014.0,,10.1186/1471-2164-15-551,0
619,Crystal structure of swine vesicular disease virus and implications for host adaptation,"Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is an enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae that causes symptoms indistinguishable from those of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Phylogenetic studies indicate that it is a recently evolved genetic sublineage of the important human pathogenic coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5), and consistent with this, it has been shown to utilize the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for cell entry. The 3.0 Å crystal structure of strain UK/27/72 SVDV (highly virulent) shows the expected similarity in core structure to those of other picornaviruses and shows the closest similarity to the closest available structure to CBV5, that of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3) . . Features that help glue together and stiffen the protein subunits are enhanced in this virus, possibly explaining its extreme tolerance to environmental factors. Using the large number of capsid sequences available for both SVDV and CBV5, we mapped the amino acid substitutions that may have occurred during the putative adaptation of SVDV to a new host to the structure of SVDV and created a model of the SVDV /CAR complex constructed with reference to the complex of CBV3 and CAR visualized by cryoelectron microscopy. The changes fall into three clusters as follows: one lines the five-fold pore, a second maps the CAR-binding site and partially overlaps the site where decay-accelerating factor (DAF) binds to echovirus 7 (ECHO7), and the third lies in the Proximity to the five-fold axis where the low-density lipoprotein receptor binds to the smaller group of rhinoviruses. Subsequent changes in SVDV (after 1971) belong to the first two clusters and may have improved the virus' adaptation to pigs by optimizing recognition of a porcine CAR and/or DAF homologue.",,"Fry, E.

620,Molecular detection and typing of duck hepatitis A virus directly from clinical specimens,"To develop a new approach for duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) detection and typing, a pair of non-degenerate primers were designed to amplify a 250 bp genomic region in the 5-UTR. 3 reference strains and 6 duck embryo isolates from different regions of China with 2 serotypes were successfully amplified with the primer set. A molecular typing method was developed by determining the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon. When isolated sequences were compared to DHAV-5 UTR sequences available in public databases, nucleotide identity was ≥ 94% with homologous serotypes and ≥ 73% with heterologous serotypes. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a monophyletic cluster of 5-UTR sequences of a homologous serotype, leading to the new classification of DHAV (serotype 1 and the two new serotypes recently described in Taiwan and South Korea respectively) into three defined genotypes (A, B and C) confirmed by the capsid coding region. Analysis of the results showed that the primer pair should help in the detection of DHAV and that the amplicon sequence contains type-specific information and can be used for effective and rapid molecular typing. The molecular methods proved their utility by detecting and typing DHAV directly from 28 liver samples collected from dead ducklings during viral hepatitis outbreaks in ducks in different regions of China between 2001 and 2007. The results confirmed the presence of DHAV in all 28 samples and showed that genotypes A (13/28) and C (15/28) of DHAV co-circulate in China. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Fu, Y.;Pan, M.;Wang, X.;Xu, Y.;Yang, H.;Zhang, D.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.011,0
621,Comparative transcriptome analyzes indicate an improved cellular protection against FMD in PK15 cells pretreated with IFN-γ,"Gamma-interferon (IFN-γ) can induce a host antiviral response to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of IFN-γ anti-FMD infection in host cells, high-throughput RNA sequencing was analyzed for systemic changes in gene expression profiles in PK15 cells infected with or without IFN-γ pretreatment of FMD. More than 25 million reads covering 1.2 to 1.5 GB were analyzed from each experimental panel. FMDV challenge altered transcription of genes involved in positive and negative regulation of cell death or apoptosis; however, the expected immunosuppressive response was not evident. IFN-γ pretreatment in combination with FMD infection normalized the increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, the transcription factors required for IFN-γ to function, STAT1 and IRF1, were upregulated by IFN-γ pretreatment and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) stimulated. These induced ISGs are mainly responsible for antigen processing, antigen presentation or antiviral defense. Interestingly, a synergistic effect on some ISGs including OAS1, OAS2, MX1, MX2, RIG-I and IFIT1 was observed in the combined treatment compared to treatment with IFN-γ alone. The proposed effects identified by RNA sequencing were consistent with changes in cell morphology and were confirmed by related protein markers. This is the first report examining transcriptome changes induced by FMD infection with or without IFN-γ pretreatment. The identified key host genes that control cell survival in vitro add to our comprehensive understanding of how IFN-γ inhibits FMD infection and may shed light on the development of improved FMD control approaches.",,"Fu, Y.;Zhu, Z.;Chang, H.;Liu, Z.;Liu, J.;Chen, H.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2016.03.027,0

623,Bovine herpesvirus-1: comparison and differentiation of vaccine and field strains based on genomic sequence variation,"Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) causes significant disease in cattle, including respiratory, fetal, and reproductive tract infections. Control programs usually include vaccination with a modified live viral vaccine (MLV). Occasionally, BoHV-1 strains are isolated from diseased animals or fetuses after vaccination. There are currently no markers to distinguish MLV strains from field strains of BoHV-1. In this study, multiple BoHV-1 strains were sequenced using whole genome sequencing technologies and the data analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strains sequenced included reference strain BoHV-1 Cooper (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial MLV vaccine strains and 14 field strains from cases presented for diagnosis. Based on SNP analysis, the viruses could be divided into groups with similar SNP patterns. The eight MLV strains could be distinguished from one another, although some were closely related. A number of field strains isolated from animals previously vaccinated exhibited SNP patterns similar to those of specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates differed markedly from all vaccine strains. The results indicate that some BoHV-1 isolates from clinically ill cattle/fetuses may be associated with prior MLV vaccination, but more information on the rate of change in the BoHV-1 genomic sequence is needed before irrefutable associations can be made can be drawn. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Fulton, R.

624,Evolutionary analyzes of the HA gene of the H1N1/09 pandemic: early insights,"The HA protein is responsible for the attachment of the influenza virus and the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Antigenic drift is driven by an accumulation of point mutations in HA. And the receptor binding specificity of HA is responsible for the restriction of the host range of the virus. In April 2009, large outbreaks of novel H1N1 influenza in the human population were reported in North America. The pandemic H1N1 virus evolved from the swine flu virus. The evolutionary process of the pandemic virus after its introduction into the human population has yet to be elucidated. We performed phylogenetic analyzes by constructing a phylogenetic tree for the HA gene and calculating site-by-site selection pressures. The phylogenetic tree showed that pandemic viruses were not clearly clustered in the phylogenetic tree according to their geographic location or isolation time. The virus has spread worldwide and has been introduced multiple times to most geographic areas. We found 3 positively selected sites in the HA gene for the pandemic H1N1 virus. Below this is position 206 at an antigenic site. We found no significant negative selection at any of the receptor binding sites.

627,Unexpected transmission dynamics between farms during a highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic,"UNMARKED: Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly used to study virus population dynamics within and between hosts. However, information on the development and transmission of the avian influenza virus during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here we use deep sequencing data from clinical samples from five industrial farms and one backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to (i) reveal the diversity of the epidemic virus population, (ii) the development of virus pathogenicity and (iii) the routes of virus transmission between different farms and houses. We demonstrate a high level of genetic diversity of HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a result of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. Specifically, we identified cocirculation in the index case of two virus strains that displayed a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess transmission between farms, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the main source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial farms, probably at different times. Our results revealed transmission dynamics between farms that the epidemiological data alone could not decipher, and showed that delays in detection and control of the disease were the main cause of the emergence and spread of the HPAI strain. IMPORTANT: The evolutionary dynamics within and between hosts of a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI) during a naturally occurring epidemic are currently poorly understood. Here, for the first time, we perform an in-depth sequence analysis of all samples collected during an HPAI epidemic and demonstrate the importance of supplementing outbreak investigations with genetic data to reconstruct viral transmission dynamics and assess in-and-between-farm genetic diversity the virus population. We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenic form to the highly pathogenic form occurred within the first infected flocks, where we identified haplotypes with different lengths of hemagglutinin cleavage sites. We also identify the index case as the main source of the virus, indicating that the immediate application of destocking measures is essential to limit the spread of the virus to other farms.",,"Fusaro, A.;Tassoni, L.;Milani, A.;Hughes, J.;Salviato, A.;Murcia, P.

628,Development of a pyrosequencing assay for the typing of alphaherpesviruses,"The detection of herpes viruses in biological material is usually done by real-time PCR. With the aim of classifying the identified virus strain, real-time PCR often has to be supported by time-consuming capillary electrophoretic sequence analysis. Here we provide a protocol for the rapid and reliable identification of 5 closely related herpesviruses using the PyroMark Q24 sequencing system. PyroMark performs DNA sequencing analysis using pyrosequencing, a technology based on the detection of released pyrophosphate during DNA elongation [1]. PyroMark is designed to detect changes at specific variable positions in DNA. It can efficiently detect single nucleotide differences in sequences [2]. In the present work we describe a protocol for pyrosequencing of a small polymorphic segment of the US8 gene. Based on the differences identified in the nucleotide sequence, we were able to easily classify the herpesvirus as bovine herpesvirus 1.1, bovine herpesvirus 1.2, bovine herpesvirus 5, bubaline herpesvirus 1, or caprine herpesvirus. The protocol created offers several advantages compared to the commonly used techniques: it requires less than a working day to be worn; it provides the ability to analyze up to 24 samples simultaneously at a reasonable cost; and it allows to detect with great reliability and specificity highly genetically correlated organisms such as the herpesviruses mentioned above. The method can easily be applied to other virus families with appropriate modifications.",,"Fusco, G.;Amoroso, M. G.;Gesualdi Montesano, N.;Viscardi, M.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.mex.2015.01.001,0

Phenotypic characteristics of the six complementation groups,"Fifty temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of rhabdovirus chandipura virus have been classified into six complementation groups, designated ChI through ChVI. Group ChI contains 44 mutants, group ChII contains 2 mutants and the remaining groups each have 1 mutant. Mutants in groups ChI, ChIII, ChIV and ChVI had RNA negative phenotypes in experiments measuring the amplification of RNA synthesis at restrictive temperature. The two mutants in group ChII had RNA-positive phenotypes and the virions were thermolabile. The group ChV mutant ts Ch851 was also RNA positive and the M polypeptide of this mutant appeared to be unstable in cells incubated at restrictive temperature. It is therefore likely that the complementation groups ChII and ChV represent the genes encoding the two viral proteins of the virion envelope. No precise assignment can be made for the four RNA-negative groups, since all mutants examined showed a certain polymerase activity in vitro at a restrictive temperature. An attempt to obtain polymerase mutants by screening for susceptibility to rifampin was unsuccessful. Six temperature-dependent host-range mutants (the tdCE phenotype) of Chandipura virus failed to proliferate in chick embryo cells at restrictive temperature, but otherwise differed in their host-range characteristics from similar vesicular stomatitis virus mutants.",,"Gadkari, D.

Pathogenicity experiment on chickens showed that it is a lentogenic virus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion protein (F) confirmed that the isolate contained the avirulent motif 112GKQGRL117 at the cleavage site and did not cause overt disease in chickens and ducks.

The genetic information of the mycobacteriophage DNAIII genome was further investigated by colinearity analysis and phylogenetic tree construction. The ability of DNAIII to lyse M. tuberculosis was examined in vitro, and the effects of temperature, alcohol and pH on DNAIII survival were determined. Results: The genome of DNAIII was 39,520 bp in size and linear double-stranded DNA with a G+C content of 66.83%. DNAIII contained 60 predicted protein-encoding genes and did not encode any tRNAs. There was no tandem repeat sequence in the genome of DNAIII. The DNAIII gene 32 encoded integrase, and there was also no gene encoding a repressor. DNAIII was very similar at the nucleotide acid level and colinear to Angel and BPs. At three different time points (Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3), the number of M. tuberculosis in the DNAIII group was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). DNAIII was unstable to temperature, alcohol, and pH values. Conclusion: DNAIII belonging to Cluster G is a mycobacteriophage capable of lysing M. tuberculosis.",,"Gan, Y. L.;Liu, P.;Wu, T. T.;Guo, S.

637,Newcastle disease virus: current status and our understanding,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the highly pathogenic viral diseases of bird species. ND is economically important due to the enormous mortality and morbidity associated with it. The disease is endemic in many third world countries where agriculture serves as the primary source of income. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and is a well-characterized member among the avian Paramyxovirus serotypes. In recent years, NDV has attracted virologists not only for its pathogenic potential, but also for its oncolytic activity and its use as a human and animal vaccine vector. The NDV-based recombinant vaccine offers a suitable choice for the construction of a live attenuated vaccine due to its modular nature of transcription, minimal frequency of recombination and the lack of a DNA phase during replication. Our current understanding of NDV biology is expanding rapidly due to the availability of modern molecular biology tools and high-throughput whole genome sequencing.",,"Ganar, K.;Das, M.;Sinha, S.;Kumar, S.",2014.0,2012-05-01 00:00:00,,0

639,Analysis of alternative splicing in chick embryo fibroblasts in response to reticuloendothelosis virus infection,"Alternative splicing (AS) plays an important role in regulating genomic expression at the transcriptional level and is involved in many important biological functions of cells, such that a gene can be spliced into different transcript variants and then translated into many different types of proteins. Reticuloendothelosis virus (REV) is a type of retrovirus that can infect several species of birds, resulting in Runting syndrome, immunosuppression, and oncogenesis. In this present study, we analyzed AS in REV-infected chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) vaccinated with second generation REV (group VB) and compared to normal CEFs (group C) by high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. A total of 6,939 genes that were alternatively spliced were detected, with Skipped Exon (SE) being the most common pattern. In addition, 5,607 AS genes have been identified as differentially expressed; compared to group C, group VB has 2,825 significantly upregulated genes and 2,782 significantly downregulated genes. These 5,607 differentially expressed AS genes are involved in many important biological processes. Many of them are involved in apoptosis and tumorigenesis. We also proved by agarose gel electrophoresis that AS events predicted by our study are authentic and AS is closely associated with apoptosis and tumorigenesis in REV-infected CEFs. Our study provides the best analysis to date of the potential association between AS and CEFs in response to REV infection. Research Highlights Transcriptomics analysis of REV-infected CEFs using high-throughput sequencing. Possible association between alternative splicing and CEFs in response to REV infection. Skipped exon is the most common spliced pattern in REV-infected CEFs.

640,"Classification of a new member of the TBE flavivirus subgroup according to its immunological, pathogenetic and molecular properties: identification of subgroup-specific pentapeptides","The antigenic, pathogenic and molecular properties of Turkish Sheep Encephalitis (TSE) virus strain TTE80 were compared to other members of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus complex. Monoclonal antibodies with a defined specificity for the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein differentiated the TSE virus from Luping III (LI), Western or Far Eastern TBE, Langat and Powassan virus in indirect immunofluorescence, haemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests. On the other hand, TSE virus, which causes LI-like disease in sheep, resembled LI virus in mouse neurovirulence tests. Molecular homology data of all structural genes of the TSE virus compared to other tick-borne flaviviruses showed that the TSE virus is a distinct member of the TBE virus subgroup. The data are consistent with the conclusion that the TSE virus evolved along a separate evolutionary path compared to its close antigenic relatives, the Western European, Far Eastern TBE viruses and the LI virus. By aligning the encoded amino acids in the glycoprotein of the viral envelope of flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, we have also identified subgroup-specific pentapeptide motifs for subgroups of tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue viruses of the genus Flavivirus. These pentapeptides have important implications for the evolution, classification, and diagnosis of flaviviruses.",,"Gao, G. F.;Hussain, M. H.;Reid, H. W.;Gould, E.

641,"Analysis of viral genome and antiviral drug sensitivity of two patients from a familial cluster caused by influenza A(H7N9) virus in Zhejiang, China, 2013","Objectives: During the winter of 2013, people were at risk of human-to-human transmission of the reemerging influenza A(H7N9) virus. We report herein the clinical features of two patients from the same family infected with this virus, the genomic sequences of the harboring viruses, and susceptibility to antiviral drugs. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological data from two patients from the same family were collected and analyzed. The viruses isolated from these two patients and an epidemiologically related chicken were sequenced and the sequences of the eight gene segments of the viruses analyzed phylogenetically. The susceptibility of the viruses to antiviral drug treatment was determined by a neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility test. Results: The two patients from a family cluster had the same symptoms but different outcomes and a strong epidemiological link. Three strains, two from these two patients and one from the chicken, were isolated. Genome sequencing and analysis of phylogenetic trees showed that the two viruses were almost identical. We identified the presence of the PB2 E627K amino acid substitution that was not present in the first wave isolates, as well as two new mutations in the NA gene and six in the PB2 gene. Drug susceptibility testing showed that the new isolates were resistant to oseltamivir but susceptible to peramivir. Conclusions: The two patients from a family cluster were probably cases of human-to-human transmission. The new isolates were susceptible to peramivir but showed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir.",,"Gao, H. N.;Yao, H. P.;Liang, W. F.;Wu, X. X.;Wu, H. B.;Wu, N. P.;Yang, S. G.;Zhang, Q.;Su, K.

642,Integrated analysis of microRNA-mRNA expression in A549 cells infected with influenza A viruses (IAVs) from different host species,"Although multiple miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the influenza virus replication cycle, the identification of miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in A549 cells infected with influenza A viruses (IAVs) from different host species has been poorly explored. To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the differential expression of miRNAs during influenza A virus infection, we performed a global miRNA and mRNA expression profile in A549 cells infected with the seasonal influenza A virus H3N2 (Human_Br07 ) of human origin and infected with influenza A virus H1N1 of porcine origin (SW_3861) or influenza A virus H3N2 (AVI_9990) of avian origin. The miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were obtained by microarray and high-throughput sequencing analysis, respectively. Integrated analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using bioinformatics tools, and expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We identified 20 miRNAs (6 upregulated and 14 downregulated) and 1286 mRNAs (935 upregulated and 351 downregulated) that show the same differential expression trends in three infected cell groups compared to an uninfected control. An integrated analysis of these expression profiles identified 79 miRNA-mRNA pairs associated with the influenza A reference pathway and 107 miRNA-mRNA interactions were correlated with defense against the virus. In addition, the obtained results were verified by RT-qPCR analysis of 8 differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-210-3p, hsa-miR-296-5p, hsa-miR-371a-5p, hsa-miR-762, hsa - miR-937-5p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, hsa-miR-3665 and hsa-miR-1290) and 13 differentially expressed mRNAs (IFNL1, CXCL10, RSAD2, MX1, OAS2, IFIT2, IFI44 L, MX2). , XAF1, NDRG1, FGA, EGLN3 and TFRC).

643,De novo assembly and functional annotations of the transcriptome of Metorchis orientalis (Trematoda: Opisthorchiidae),"Metorchis orientalis is a neglected zoonotic parasite that lives in the gallbladder and bile ducts of poultry and some mammals and humans. Despite its economic and medical importance, information on the M. orientalis transcriptome and genome is limited. In this study, we performed de novo sequencing, transcriptome assembly, and functional annotations of adult M. orientalis and obtained approximately 77.4 million high-quality clean reads, among which transcript contig lengths ranged from 100 to 11,249 nt lay, with a mean length of 373 nt and N50 length of 919 nt. We then assembled 31,943 unigenes, of which 20,009 (62.6%) were annotated by BLASTn and BLASTx searches against the available database. Of these unigens, 19,795 (62.0%), 3,407 (10.7%), and 10,620 (33.2%) had significant similarity in the NR, NT, and Swiss-Prot databases, respectively; 5744 (18.0%) and 4678 (14.6%) unigenes were assigned to GO and COG, respectively; and 9099 (28.5%) unigenes were identified and mapped to 256 pathways in the KEGG Pathway database. In addition, we found that 98 (1.08%) unigenes were associated with bile secretion and 5 (0.05%) with the category of primary bile acid biosynthetic pathways.

644,"Biological heterogeneity, including systemic replication in mice, of human H5N1 influenza A virus isolates in Hong Kong","An H5N1 avian influenza A virus was transmitted to humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Although the virus causes systemic infection due to the sensitivity of the hemagglutinin to furin and PC6 proteases and is highly lethal in chickens, it is not known whether it also causes systemic infection in humans. Clinical outcomes of the infection in Hong Kong residents ranged from mild respiratory illness to multiple organ failure leading to death. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of influenza due to these H5N1 isolates, we examined their virulence in mice. The results identified two distinct groups of viruses: Group 1, where the 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) ranged from 0.3 to 11 PFU, and Group 2, where the MLD50 was greater than 103 PFU. One day after intranasal inoculation of mice with 100 PFU of group 1 virus, the titer of virus in the lungs was 107 PFU/g or 3 log units higher than that for group 2 virus. Both virus types had resided in the lungs by day 3 replicated to high titers (>106 PFU/g) and maintained these titers through day 6. More importantly, only the group 1 viruses caused systemic infection and replicated in non-respiratory organs, including the brain. Immunohistochemical analyzes showed replication of a group 1 virus in brain neurons and glial cells as well as in myocardial fibers. Phylogenetic analysis of all viral genes showed that both groups of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses formed a lineage distinct from those of other viruses and that no genetic rearrangement between H5N1 and H1 or H3 human viruses had occurred. Because mice and humans harbor both the furin and PC6 proteases, we propose that the virulence mechanism responsible for avian influenza virus lethality also functions in mammalian hosts. The failure of some H5N1 viruses to elicit systemic infection in our model indicates that several yet-to-be-identified factors contribute to the severity of H5N1 infection in mammals. Furthermore, the ability of these viruses to induce systemic infection in mice and the marked differences in pathogenicity between the isolates examined here indicate that this system represents a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infection in mammals.",,"Gao, P.;Watanabe, S.;Ito, T.;Goto, H.;Wells, K.;McGregor, M.;James Cooley, A.;Kawaoka, Y.",1999.0,,,0
645,Deep sequencing analysis of the DF-1 cell transcriptome response to duck Newcastle disease virus infection,"Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosal bleeding with typical symptoms. It is an acute, highly sociable disease. NDV was able to proliferate in DF-1 cells. NDV of waterfowl differs from previous NDV of chickens, it causes death of waterfowl. But the molecular mechanisms of waterfowl infected with NDV are still poorly understood. In this study, researchers used the Illumina genomic analysis platform to perform genome-wide digital gene expression (DGE), a tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method to analyze DF-1 cells infected with NDV-YC. Researchers were able to reach a sequencing depth of 5.0-6.1 million tags per library and found more than 8000 genes differentially expressed during NDV-YC infection processes. Specifically, NDV-YC identified genes involved in I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB and TGF-beta signaling. Further analysis used Gene Ontology (GO) analyzes of cell parts, binding and biological regulation terms are main points respectively.

646,Whole genome shotgun sequencing revealed highly polymorphic genomic regions and genes in Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolates collected from a single feedlot,"Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 continues to pose a serious threat to human health. Cattle, a major reservoir of the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 in their gastrointestinal tract and express varying levels of E. coli O157:H7 to the environment. The genetic characterization of E. coli O157 strains from cattle stalls is of interest to the livestock, food processing and public health communities. In the present study, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling were used to characterize 279 E. coli O157:H7 strains from cattle stalls isolated from a single feedlot in the Southwestern United States. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the phyla and the resulting pedigree showed three main groups. Using the Sakai tribe genome as a reference, more than 2,000 SNVs were annotated and a detailed SNV map was created. The results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci along the E. coli O157:H7 genome that align with the prophage regions and highly variant genes involved in processing bacterial genetic information. The WGS data were further profiled using a comprehensive virulence factor database (VFDB) to identify virulence genes. Of the 285 virulence genes identified, only 132 were present in all strains. There were six virulence genes unique to individual isolates. Our results suggest that the genome variations of E. coli O157:H7 are mainly due to the dynamics of certain phages and the bacterial strains exhibit different virulence gene profiles despite originating from a single bovine population, which could explain the differences in pathogenicity, host prevalence and transmissibility E. coli O157:H7.",,"Gao, X.;Yang, X.;Noll, L.;Shi, X.;Worley, J.;Allard, M.;Brown, E.;Nagaraja, T.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 10, 11, 13, and 17 are found throughout much of the United States, while serotype 2 (BTV-2) has previously only been detected in the southeastern United States. Since 1998, 10 other BTV serotypes have also been isolated from ruminants in the southeastern United States. In 2010, BTV-2 was first identified in California, and preliminary sequence analysis showed that the virus isolate was closely related to BTV strains circulating in the southeastern United States. In the current study, the entire genome sequence of the Californian BTV-2 strain was compared to that of other BTV-2 strains in America. The results of the analysis indicate a co-circulation of genetically distinct viruses in the southeastern United States and further suggest that the western 2010 isolate is closely related to southeastern BTV strains.

The bovine strain B:USA:78:1A and the canine strain C:USA:81:2 were adapted to cell culture and cloned in this study. The other viruses, ie, the simian strain S:USA:79:2, the Ohio State University porcine strain P:USA:77:1, and the human strain WA, were already cell culture-adapted, although they were further cloned for this work. The serum neutralization test was used to classify the viruses into serotype groups. Viruses showing a 20-fold or greater difference in neutralization titer were separated into different serotype groups. Four main groups of serotypes were found in this study and these groups were represented by bovine, human, porcine and canine simian strains. In cross-protection studies, these serotype groups were found to differ significantly. With the exception of the porcine strain, none of the viruses used as vaccines protected gnotobiotic piglets from challenge with the Ohio State University virulent porcine rotavirus strain. In addition, the canine virus protected the piglets from infection with the monkey virus. RNA electropherotype confirmed that the dog and monkey strains differed in eight RNA segments, ruling out the possibility that they were the same virus. From these results it was concluded that only viruses belonging to the same serotype group can confer cross-protection and therefore vaccines should be made with the serotypes to which the animal is likely to be exposed.",,"Gaul, A.

In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat fecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences based on circovirus-related sequences derived from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a genomic organization similar to that of the circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the Circoviridae family. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1.741 to 21.77 bp and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem-loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved cycloviral nonanucleotide motif. A series of primers targeting the conserved Rep region were designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Of 199 specimens tested, 47 were positive (23.6%) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. A total of 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis showed that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and potentially represent 22 new species belonging to the Circoviridae family.",,"Ge, X.

654,"Epidemic of wild-origin H1NX avian influenza virus in Anhui, China","Background: As natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), aquatic and migratory birds provide a gene pool for interspecies and interspecies genetic transfer, forming transient 'genome constellations'. This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H1NX based on the full molecular characterization of eight genes from viruses collected in 2014-2015 in Anhui Province, China. Methods: Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays were used to determine the hemagglutination (HA) activity of the HA subtypes. The entire genomes of the viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA Analyzer. The sequences were genetically analyzed to examine their genetic evolution with DNASTAR and MEGA 6. The pathogenic effects of the viruses were assessed using mouse infection models. Results: Seven strains of H1 subtype avian influenza virus were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis showed natural recombination of H1 influenza viruses between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. Some genes had high sequence identity with A/Boan Goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2), which is a case in point involving a viral rearrangement between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. The results of infection experiments on mice showed that the viruses could acquire the ability to multiply in the respiratory organs of mice without adaptation. Conclusions: These results suggest that continuous surveillance of wild birds, especially migratory birds, is important to provide early warning of potential H1 influenza epidemics and to understand the ecology of the virus.",,"Ge, Y.;Yao, Q.

We analyzed 506 bird samples collected from poultry at live bird markets and backyard flocks to identify influenza A virus. Virus isolation-positive specimens (n=50) were subtyped and their coding complete genomes were sequenced. The most commonly identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were H9N2, H11N3, H4N6 and H1N1. Less frequently detected subtypes were H1N3, H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7 and H7N9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, the majority of viral gene segments were most closely related to avian or wild bird viruses, which are commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe and/or North Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed across multiple geographic locations in Bangladesh, and surface and internal protein gene segments phylogenetically congested with a variety of viral subtypes, suggesting an extensive rearrangement of these LPAI viruses. Viruses of the H9N2 subtype differed from other LPAI subtypes as genes from these viruses were consistently clustered, suggesting that this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to previous human-derived H9N2 viruses discovered in Bangladesh and a potential source of human infection. In contrast, the circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses were unrelated, both phylogenetically and antigenically, to H5 viruses previously identified in humans in Bangladesh and to H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, domestic fowl sold in live bird markets contained a variety of LPAI virus subtypes and a wide variety of genotypes.

They have been used for various purposes, e.g. B. for transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, study of DNA-protein interaction and detection of genome methylation. Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research in the chicken, which is an important model organism for the study of embryology, immunology, oncology, virology, evolution, genetics and genomics, as well as other avian species. Despite their tremendous contribution to life science research, the future of microarrays is now being questioned with the advent of Massively Parallel Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies that promise to overcome some of the limitations of microarray platforms. In this article, we discuss the various microarray resources that have been developed for chickens and their past and potential future applications. We also discuss the future of microarrays in the NGS era, especially in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that although NGS promises some major benefits - notably the possibility of discovering new elements in the genome - microarrays will continue to be important tools for research and practice in the field of livestock genetics/genomics due to their high affordability, throughput nature, mature mainstream technologies and easy application. Furthermore, NGS and microarrays are expected to complement each other in future life sciences research with the emergence of new microarray technologies such as capture arrays. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Gheyas, A.

The continued upward trend in sequencing technologies will enhance livestock research and accelerate the development of various new livestock genomic and technological studies. The use of high-throughput technologies in livestock research has increased interest in metagenomics, epigenetics, genome-wide association studies, and the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations. Such studies are beginning to provide revolutionary insights into biological and evolutionary processes. Livestock such as cattle, pigs, and horses have served dual roles as economically and agriculturally important animals and as biomedical research models. The first part of this study examines the current state of sequencing methods, many of which are already used in animal genomic studies, and the second part summarizes the state of the art in bovine, porcine, equine and chicken genome sequencing and illustrates its achievements during the last few Years. Finally, we describe several high-throughput sequencing approaches for improved detection of known, unknown, and emerging infectious agents, leading to better diagnosis of infectious diseases. Insights from viral metagenomics and advances in next-generation sequencing will strongly support specific and efficient vaccine development and provide strategies to control transmission of infectious diseases between animal populations and/or between animals and humans. However, future sequencing technologies will require further research and field trials before commercialization.",,"Ghosh, M.;Sharma, N.;Singh, A. K.;Gera, M.;Pulicherla, K. K.;Jeong, D.

658,Genetic Detection and Characterization of Emerging HoBi-Like Viruses in Archived Fetal Bovine Serum Lots,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) are members of the pestivirus genus within the family Flaviviridae. Based on antigen and nucleotide differences, BVDV is divided into two recognized species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. More recently, a new putative pestivirus species tentatively named ""HoBi-like"" has been associated with viral bovine diarrhea. HoBi-like viruses were first identified in fetal bovine serum (FBS) imported from Brazil. Subsequently, a number of HoBi-like viruses were detected as contaminants in FBS or cell cultures and in live ruminants. In order to further investigate the possible pestivirus contamination in commercial FBS batches, 26 FBS batches with different countries of origin were tested for the presence of bovine pestiviruses in this study. All 26 batches were positive by RT-PCR for at least one bovine pestivirus species. HoBi-like viruses were detected in 15 batches. Analysis of the 5'UTR and Npro sequences of 15 newly identified HoBi-like viruses combined with analysis of additional sequences from GenBank identified 4 genetic groups tentatively named 3a-3d. The current study confirmed the presence of the emerging HoBi-like viruses in FBS products labeled with different geographic origins. This finding has obvious implications for the safety of biological products such as cell lines and vaccines.",,"Giammarioli, M.;Ridpath, J. F.;Rossi, E.;Bazzucchi, M.;Casciari, C.;De Mia, G.

Understanding genomic features and virus taxonomy is fundamental to maintaining control and prophylaxis programs. In view of the recent various studies reporting a relatively high number of new strains, especially from Asian countries, four hundred and eighty-two genomic sequences were evaluated in the present study using the palindromic nucleotide substitution method for genotyping. Based on secondary structure orientation and calculation of the genetic distance between strains in the 5 inch untranslated region of pestivirus RNA, the current taxonomy of the species was reviewed.

The biological and physico-chemical properties of the virus indicate a close relationship with measles, rinderpest and canine distemper viruses.

The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in outbreak analysis facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of pathogen virulence factors and can be used to identify the route of transmission of the disease within a population and provide information on the likely source. Molecular tools like WGS are being refined and advanced at a rapid pace to provide robust and high-resolution methods for identifying, comparing, and classifying pathogenic organisms. When properly applied, these methods of characterizing pathogens enable an improved public health response, whether an outbreak is triggered by natural events or by accidental or deliberate human activities. The current application of next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) to microbial WGS and microbial forensics will be reviewed.",,"Gilchrist, C. A.;Turner, S. D.;Riley, M. F.;Petri, W.

664,Massive depletion of bovine leukemia virus proviral clones residing in genomically transcriptionally active sites during primary infection,"Deltaretroviruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) induce persistent infection that is generally asymptomatic but can also lead to leukemia or lymphoma. These viruses replicate by infecting new lymphocytes (ie, infection cycle) or by clonal expansion of infected cells (mitotic cycle). The relative importance of these two cycles in viral replication varies during infection. The majority of infected clones are generated early before the onset of an efficient immune response. Later, the main replication pathway is mitotic expansion of pre-existing infected clones. Few data are available on early infection by HTLV-1 due to the lack of available samples and for ethical reasons. We have therefore pursued this question in a comparative BLV model. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify the provirus insertion sites to monitor the clonality of the BLV-infected cell population (i.e. the number of distinct clones and frequency of each clone). We found that BLV proliferation shifts from cellular neoinfection to clonal proliferation within approximately 2 months post-inoculation. Initially, proviral BLV integration favors significantly transcribed regions of the genome. Negative selection then eliminates 97% of the clones detected in seroconversion and discriminates against BLV-infected cells carrying a provirus located near a promoter or gene. Nevertheless, among the surviving proviruses, cloning frequency is positively correlated with the proximity of the provirus to a transcribed region. Two opposing forces are thus at work during primary infection and dictate the fate of long-term clonal composition: (1) initial integration into genes or promoters, and (2) negative host selection that discriminates against proviruses located adjacent to transcribed regions. The outcome of this initial response contributes to the proviral load set point, as clone frequency benefits from carrying a provirus in transcribed regions. © 2013 Gillet et al.",,"Gillet, N.

665,Small noncoding RNAs of bovine leukemia virus are functional elements that regulate replication and contribute to oncogenesis in vivo,"Retroviruses are not expected to encode miRNAs due to the potential problem of self-cleavage of their genomic RNAs. This assumption has recently been challenged by experiments showing that bovine leukemia virus (BLV) encodes miRNAs from intragenomic Pol III promoters. The BLV miRNAs are abundantly expressed in B-cell tumors in the absence of significant levels of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA. Using deep RNA sequencing and functional reporter assays, we show that miRNAs mediate expression of genes involved in cell signaling, cancer, and immunity. We further show that BLV miRNAs are essential to induce B cell tumors in an experimental model and to promote efficient viral replication in the natural host.",,"Gillet, N.

666,Sequence analysis of bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5) alpha-trans-inducing factor,"Bovine herpesvirus (BHV), a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is divided into neurovirulent and non-neurovirulent subtypes based on different neuropathicities. Transcription of viral immediate-early (IE) genes during alphaherpesvirus gene expression is mediated by a multicomponent immediate-early complex (IEC) mediated by the viral tegument protein alpha-trans-inducing factor (α-tif ), a host cell protein (HCF), and an octamer host protein (Oct). In this paper, we present a sequence analysis of the α-tif of the BHV encephalitic subtype, bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5). Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) and BHV-5 α-tifs share 98% amino acid sequence homology. However, BHV-5 α-tif is 23 residues shorter at the amino terminus than BHV-1 α-tif. The amino acid alignment of the α-tifs of BHV-1 and BHV-5 with other alphaherpesviruses indicates areas of conserved motifs, but also important differences located mainly at the amino and carboxyl termini.",,"Gillette, K.;Misra, V.;Bratanich, A.",2002.0,,10.1023/a:1014520616362,0
667,Neuropathotyping: a new system for classifying Marek's disease virus,"statistical approach was used to establish a new classification system of Marek's disease virus (MDV) based on neurological responses. To develop the system, neurological response data from 15 x 7 chickens vaccinated with 30 strains of serotype 1 MDV were statistically analyzed by cluster analysis. The aim was to identify a statistical system that checks whether three neurovirulence groups correlate with the three pathotypes described above. The system was also validated in two other strains of specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, SPAFAS and line SC (Hy-Vac). The proposed system is based on the analysis of three variables: 1) frequency of birds showing transient paralysis between 9 and 11 days post-inoculation (dpi), (2) mortality before 15 dpi, and (3) frequency of birds that between the 21 and 23 dpi. Using this system, an MDV can be classified into one of three groups, referred to as neuropathotypes A, B and C, which roughly correspond to virulent, very virulent and very virulent plus pathotypes, respectively. However, the correlation between neuropathotype and pathotype was not absolute, and neuropathotyping is an adjunct to the current pathotyping system rather than a replacement for it. Our results indicated that neuropathotyping studies can be performed in two types of commercial SPF chickens using the same variables, although the system would first have to be standardized using prototype viruses. Neuropathotypes can also be estimated with reasonable accuracy using our statistical analysis. Using this analysis, we found that MDV strains can be subdivided into neuropathotypes B and C within the highly virulent pathotype, creating a previously unrecognized pathotypic classification. This finding illustrates how neuropathotyping can augment important information not identified by traditional pathotyping.",,"Gimeno, I. M.;Witter, R. L.;Neumann, U.",2002.0,Oct-Dec,,0
668,Natural transmission and comparative analysis of small ruminant lentiviruses in the Norwegian sheep and goat populations,"Serological testing for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection has revealed seropositive sheep in several mixed flocks in which sheep are housed with seropositive goats. Here we examined the genetic relationships in LTR, pol, and env surface units (SU) and growth patterns in goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures of SRLV isolates derived from both mixed and single herds of species have been preserved. Phylogenetic analyzes of pol and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs derived from both goats and sheep in mixed flocks are distributed in group C, while isolates derived from unmixed flocks of sheep are distributed in group A along with maedi-visna- similar representatives of the A1 subtype are grouped. In this study it is proposed that transmission of group C virus occurs from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by the SRLV isolates did not indicate species-specific traits. No specific nucleotide sequences of the LTR-U3 region or env-SU that could be associated with the cytopathic phenotype were identified. This study shows that sheep in Norway harbor SRLVs belonging to phylogenetic groups A and C, and this provides further evidence that cross-species infection is a regular feature of SRLVs, which can be an important source of virus persistence. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Gjerset, B.;Jonassen, C.

669,Characterization of microRNAs encoded by the bovine herpesvirus 1 genome,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a ubiquitous and important pathogen of cattle worldwide. This study reports the identification of 10 microRNA (miRNA) genes, Bhv1-mir-B1-Bhv1-mir-B10, encoded by the BoHV-1 genome, which were processed into 12 detectable mature miRNAs, as determined by ultra-high throughput sequencing -Bioinformatic analysis was determined from small RNA libraries and expression studies. We found that four of the miRNA genes were present as two copies in the BoHV-1 genome, resulting in a total of 14 miRNA-encoding loci. Unique features of the BoHV-1 miRNAs include evidence of bidirectional transcription and a tight association of two miRNA genes with the origin of replication, including one miRNA encoded within the origin of replication. The miRNA gene Bhv1-mir-B5 was encoded on the opposite DNA strand of the latency-associated transcript, possibly resulting in antisense transcripts derived from this locus. The association of herpesvirus miRNAs with latency appears to be a common feature of alphaherpesviruses. Analyzes of the BoHV-5 genome for putative miRNA gene orthologs identified a high degree of evolutionary conservation for nine of the BoHV-1 miRNA genes. The possible roles for BoHV-1 miRNAs in the regulation of known BoHV-1 transcription units and the genetics of BoHV-1 genotypes are also discussed. © 2010 The State of Queensland acts through the Department for Employment, Economic Development and Innovation.",,"Glazov, E.

670,Epidemiological and molecular analysis of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 class 2.3.4.4 in a German zoo: effective disease control with minimal cull,"Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N8 strain 2.3.4.4 were first reported in South Korea in January 2014. These viruses spread rapidly to Europe and the North American continent in autumn 2014 and caused five outbreaks in poultry farms in Germany up to February 2015. Birds kept in a zoo in north-eastern Germany were also affected. Few individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia) showed clinical symptoms and eventually died in the course of infection, although later detailed diagnostic investigations showed that other birds kept in the same white stork enclosure were acutely positive or had undergone asymptomatic infection with HPAIV H5N8 . An exemption from culling all 500 remaining zoo birds was granted by the competent authority. The containment measures included grouping the zoo birds into eight epidemiological units, in which 60 birds from each unit tested repeatedly negative for H5N8. Epidemiological and phylogenetic investigations indicated that the most likely source of introduction was direct or indirect contact with infected wild birds, as white storks had access to a small pond frequented by wild mallards and other aquatic wild birds over a 10-day period in December 2014. Median network analysis showed that the zoobird viruses segregated into a distinct clade 2.3.4.4 cluster with closest associations to H5N8 isolates recovered from mute swans (Cygnus olor) in Sweden in April 2015. This case shows that there are alternatives to culling to save valuable animals in avifaunistic collections after HPAIV incursions.",,"Globig, A.;Starick, E.;Homeier, T.;Pohlmann, A.;Grund, C.;Wolf, P.;Zimmermann, A.;Wolf, C.;Heim, D.;SchlÃ¶ÃŸer, H.;Zander, S.;Beer, M.;Conraths, F.

671,Subtyping swine influenza viruses using a high-throughput real-time PCR platform,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important human and animal pathogens with significant impacts on human and animal health. In Denmark, a passive surveillance program for IAV in pigs has been in place since 2011, using screening testing and subsequent subtyping by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with reverse transcription. A disadvantage of the current subtyping system is that multiple assays are required to cover the wide range of circulating subtypes, making the system expensive and time consuming. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a high-throughput method that could improve the surveillance of swine influenza viruses (swIAVs) and reduce the cost of virus subtyping. Twelve qPCR assays specific for different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene lines relevant to swIAV and six assays specific for the internal genes of IAV were developed and applied to the high-throughput qPCR platform BioMark (Fluidigm ) optimized. The qPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same reaction conditions using a 48.48 dynamic array (48.48 DA). Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by testing virus isolates and field samples with known subtypes. The results showed swIAV 48.48DA performance similar to conventional real-time analysis and, moreover, the specificity of swIAV 48.48DA was very high with no cross-reactions between assays.

672,"Potential for co-infection with a mosquito-specific flavivirus, Nhumirim virus, to block transmission of West Nile virus in mosquitoes","Nhumirim virus (NHUV) is an insect-specific virus phylogenetically related to mosquito-borne two-host flaviviruses. Previous in vitro coinfection experiments showed that prior or simultaneous infection of Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in West Nile virus (WNV) virus production. This interference between WNV and NHUV was observed herein in an additional Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A mutant of the WNV 2K peptide (V9M) capable of superinfection with a previously established WNV infection showed a comparable level of interference by NHUV as the parental WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells . Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes inoculated intrathoracically with NHUV and WNV or with WNV alone as a control were allowed to extrinsically incubate the viruses for up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and transmissibility and replication of WNV was determined. The proportion of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, which can transmit WNV, was significantly lower at seven and nine days post-inoculation (dpi) for the WNV/NHUV group than the WNV control, while no differences in Cx were observed. Pipien's Vaccination Group. By dpi nine, a 40% reduction in transmissibility was observed in mosquitoes from the double vaccination group compared to the WNV-only control group.

673,The interplay between MDV and HVT affects viral miRNA expression,"It is well known that herpesviruses encode numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) and that these virally encoded small RNAs play multiple roles in infection. The present study was performed to determine how co-infection of a pathogenic MDV serotype 1 (MDV1) (MD5) strain and a vaccine strain (turkey herpesvirus [HVT]) alters viral miRNA expression in vivo. We first used small RNA depth sequencing to identify MDV1-encoded miRNAs expressed in tumorigenic spleens of MDV1-infected birds. The expression patterns of these miRNAs were then further examined at an early time point (7 days post-infection [dpi]) and a late time point (42 dpi) in birds with and without HVT vaccination using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). In addition, the effect of MDV1 co-infection on HVT-encoded miRNAs was determined using RT-PCR. A diverse population of miRNAs was expressed in MDV-induced tumorigenic spleens at 42 dpi, representing 18 of the 26 known mature miRNAs. Of these, both mdv1-miR-M4-5p and mdv1-miR-M2-3p were the most highly expressed miRNAs. RT-PCR analysis further revealed that nine MDV miRNAs between 7 dpi and 42 dpi were differentially expressed in infected spleens. At 7 dpi, three miRNAs were differentially expressed between the spleens of birds co-infected with HVT and MD5 compared to birds individually infected with MD5, while at 42 dpi nine miRNAs were differentially expressed. At 7 dpi, expression of seven HVT-encoding miRNAs was impaired in the spleens of co-infected birds compared to birds receiving the HVT vaccine alone. At 42 dpi, six HVT-encoded miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups. Target prediction analyzes indicate that these differentially expressed viral miRNAs are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation and the adaptive immune response. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Goher, M.;Hicks, J.

674,Application of phylogeny reconstruction and character development analysis to derive patterns of directed microbial transmission,"used phylogenetic analyzes to reconstruct patterns of directed interspecific transmission during a 1989 outbreak of pseudorabies virus in Illinois, USA. Isolates were obtained from five species: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and raccoons (Procyon lotor). I generated DNA sequences for 16 isolates of pseudorabies virus at the glycoprotein C gene, from which I constructed pedigrees. I then used these trees in combination with sparse character development analyzes to infer the frequency and direction of interspecific transference events. Comparison of the derived frequencies and transmission directions with null expectations based on 10,000 random trees showed a significant excess of transmission events from pigs to pigs and a corresponding lack of transmission events from non-pig species. These results are consistent with the known biology and natural history of the pseudorabies virus, and they demonstrate that retrospective phylogeny reconstruction and character evolution analyzes can be used to study the transmission ecology of pathogens. © 2003 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Goldberg, T.

The high degree of genetic identity (>99.6%) between Seg2, Seg4 and Seg5 in all 8 BTV-24 isolates indicated that these segments shared the same viral ancestor. The phylogenetic analysis of Seg1, Seg3, Seg5, Seg8, Seg9 and Seg10 revealed that the Israeli BTV-24 strains comprised 4 variants. Five of the viruses showed high identity in all 9 segments and represented variant 1.

681,"Molecular study of bovine viral diarrhea virus infection in yaks (Bos gruniens) from Qinghai, China","Background: Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus that infects both domestic and wild animal species worldwide. In China, cattle are often infected with BVDV of different genotypes, but there is very limited knowledge about BVDV infection in Chinese yaks and the genetic diversity of the virus. The aims of this study were to detect viral infection in yaks in Qinghai, China and to determine the genotypes of BVDV based on 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) and N-terminal protease (N <sup>pro </sup>) region. Results: Between 2010 and 2012, 407 blood samples were collected from yaks with or without clinical symptoms in six counties of Qinghai Province. Ninety-eight samples (24%) were positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting a conserved region of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. The nucleotide sequences of the 5-UTR and the complete N<sup>pro</sup> region were determined for 16 positive samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that all 16 samples belong to the subgenotypes BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1q. Conclusions: This study provides for the first time molecular evidence for BVDV infection in Qinghai yaks involving multiple subgenotypes of BVDV-1. This may have happened under three possible scenarios: transmission between species, natural infection, and use of vaccines contaminated with BVDV. The findings have important implications for yak production and management in China, notably suggesting that unscientific vaccination practices should be stopped and biosecurity increased. © 2014 Gong et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Gong, X.;Liu, L.;Zheng, F.;Chen, Q.;Li, Z.;Cao, X.;Yin, H.;Zhou, J.;Cai, X.",2014.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-11-29,0
682,Insect retros provide new insight into the origin of hepatitis B virus,"The origin of the hepadnaviruses (Hepadnaviridae), a group of reverse-transcribing DNA viruses that infect vertebrates, remains mysterious. All known retrotransposons are only distantly related to hepadnaviruses. Here we report the discovery of two new lineages of retroelements, which we term the hepadnavirus-like retroelement (HEART1 and HEART2), within insect genomes by screening 1,095 eukaryotic genomes. Both phylogenetic and similarity analyzes indicate that the HEART retroelements represent the closest nonviral relatives of the hepadnaviruses to date. The discovery of HEART retroelements bridges the evolutionary gap between hepadnaviruses and retrotransposons and may thus provide unique insights into the origin and evolution of hepadnaviruses.",,"Gong, Z.;Han, G.

683,Global spread of hemorrhagic fever viruses: predicting pandemics,"As successive epidemics have swept the world, the scientific community has quickly learned from them about the emergence and transmission of communicable diseases. Epidemics usually occur when health systems are unprepared. During an unexpected epidemic, health officials engage in damage control, fear drives action, and the desire to understand the threat is greatest. As humanity recovers, policymakers seek scientific expertise to improve their ""preparation"" for future events. Examples of the global spread of disease include the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, the spread of dengue fever by the transcontinental migration of mosquitoes, the relentless influenza virus pandemics, and most recently, the unexpected emergence of the Ebola virus. Spread by motorcycle and long-distance transporters. Other pathogens notable for their epidemic spread are hemorrhagic arenavirus and hantavirus diseases transmitted by rodents over large geographic distances, and arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, Chikungunya, and Zika) transmitted by ecology and Vector adjustments are made possible. Have we learned from past epidemics? Are we prepared for the worst? The ultimate goal is the development of a resilient global health infrastructure. Along with acquiring treatments, vaccines, and other preventative medicines, biosurveillance is critical to preventing the onset of disease and counteracting its spread. So far, only the western hemisphere has a large and well-established surveillance system; However, diseases continue to occur sporadically, particularly in Southeast Asia and South America, highlighting the inadequacies of our surveillance. Epidemics destabilize fragile governments, devastate the most vulnerable populations and threaten the global community. Pandemic risk calculations use emerging technologies such as computational maintenance of geographic and historical datasets, geographic information systems (GIS), next-generation sequencing and metagenomics to trace the molecular changes in pathogens as they emerge, and mathematical models for risk assessment. Predictions help pinpoint emergence hotspots, populations at risk, and pathogens in genetic evolution. Preparedness anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the infrastructure capacities, the sources of emergency financing and finally the international partnerships needed to manage a disaster before it occurs. Currently, the world is in an intermediate phase of attempting to narrow health disparities despite exponential population growth, political conflict, migration, world trade, urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming. In the interests of humanity, we must focus on developing the necessary capacities for health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response.",,"Gonzalez, J.

684,"Origin, spread and potential risk factors associated with influenza A virus in pigs in two production systems in Guatemala","Background: Guatemala is the country with the largest pig production in Central America; However, the detection of influenza A virus (IAV) in pigs has not been clearly defined. Aims: In this study, we analyzed the presence and spatial distribution of IAV in livestock and backyard pig populations. Methods: Samples from two nationwide surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 were tested with virological (rRT-PCR and virus isolation) and serological (ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition) assays for the detection of IAV. Results: Influenza A virus was detected in 15.7% of the sampled pigs in 2010 (30.6% of the herds) and in 2011 in 11.7% (24.2% of the herds). The proportion of seropositive pigs was 10.6% (16.1% of herds) and 1.4% (3.1% of herds) for each year. Three pandemic H1N1 and one seasonal humanoid H3N2 virus have been isolated. Antibodies against viruses from different genetic clusters have been detected. No reassortant strains with swine viruses were detected. The H3N2 virus was closely related to human viruses circulating in Central America in 2010 and differed from recent human seasonal vaccine lines. Spatial clusters of rRT-PCR positive foci were detected by scan statistics each year. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the spread of IAV throughout Guatemala and identify commercial farms, animal health status, and age as potential risk factors associated with IAV infection and exposure. The detection of viruses of human origin in pigs suggests a human role in the molecular epidemiology of pig IAV in Guatemala and indicates gaps in local animal and human surveillance.",,"Gonzalez-Reiche, A.

The amino acid homology of porcine rotavirus VP4 with the corresponding protein of asymptomatic or symptomatic human rotaviruses representing serotypes 1 to 4 ranged from 87.1 to 88.1% for asymptomatic strains and from 77.5 to 77.8% for symptomatic tribes. The amino acid homology of the Gottfried strain to simian rhesus rotavirus, simian SA11 virus, bovine Nebraska calf diarrhea virus and porcine OSU strains ranged from 71.5 to 74.3%. Antigenic similarities of VP4 epitopes between Gottfried strain and human rotavirus were detected by plaque reduction neutralization assay with hyperimmune antisera raised against Gottfried strain or a reassortant Gottfried (10 genes) x human DS-1 rotavirus (VP7 gene) were produced that exhibited serotype 2 neutralization specificity. In addition, a panel of six anti-VP4 monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing human rotavirus belonging to serotypes 1, 3 or 4 were able to neutralize the Gottfried strain. These observations suggest that the Gottfried rotavirus outer capsid protein VP4 is more closely related to human rotaviruses than to animal rotaviruses.",,"Gorziglia, M.;Nishikawa, K.;Hoshino, Y.;Taniguchi, K.",1990.0,,,0
687,Molecular phylogenetics of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from vaccinated flocks during outbreaks in southern India reveal the circulation of a new subgenotype,"Newcastle disease (ND) is an economically important, contagious viral disease in poultry that is reported worldwide. In India, ND is endemic and episodes of ND outbreaks despite strict vaccination are not uncommon. We isolated and characterized seven NDviruses from vaccinated commercial poultry farms during major disease outbreaks in Tamil Nadu, southern India between April 2015 and June 2016. All seven isolates were classified as virulent based on mean time of death (48-54 h). in embryonated chicken eggs. In addition, their sequences carried the virulence signature of multibasic amino acid residues in their fusion protein cleavage site (RRQ/RR/KRF). Phylogenetic and evolutionary distance analyzes revealed the circulation of a new subgenotype of genotype XIII, class II ND viruses, proposed here as subgenotype XIIIe. The genetic divergence between the circulating virulent strains and the vaccine strains could possibly explain the disease outbreak in the vaccinated flocks. In addition, our study points to the need to conduct routine epidemiological surveillance and to reconsider the current vaccination program.",,"Gowthaman, V.;Ganesan, V.;Gopala Krishna Murthy, T.

The prevalence of hepatitis E is higher in areas with poor sanitation. The use of molecular techniques has helped to obtain valuable information on the epidemiology of hepatitis E in developed countries. In these areas, hepatitis E virus infection shows a different pattern and has been associated with contact with domestic animals, particularly pigs. The role of hepatitis E in industrialized countries as a possible zoonosis implies a new and interesting approach to this disease. This overview summarizes the current state of knowledge on the biology, structure and transmission of the virus and on the diagnosis of the infection.

689,Detection and genome characterization of bovine polyomaviruses in beef muscle and minced beef samples from Germany,"Polyomaviruses are small, non-enveloped, circular, double-stranded DNA viruses. Some polyomaviruses can cause tumors and cancer under certain circumstances. The bovine polyomaviruses (BPyV) 1-3 have only been studied to a limited extent. It has been hypothesized that eating beef containing polyomaviruses could contribute to the development of human cancer. In order to assess the distribution of the BPyV genome in meat from Germany, 101 beef muscle samples and 10 ground beef samples were analyzed here. A specific sample preparation method combined with or without rolling circle amplification (RCA) and BPyV-specific PCRs was developed and applied. BPyV-1 DNA was detected in 1/101 (1%) beef samples and in 2/10 (20%) ground beef samples. BPyV-2 DNA was detected in 3/10 (30%) ground beef samples while BPyV-3 was not detected in the samples. The use of RCA did not increase the detection rate in ground beef samples. Sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed the presence of BPyV-1, BPyV-2a and BPyV-2b. The entire genome of a ground beef BPyV-1 strain showed 97.8% sequence identity with the BPyV-1 reference strain and that of a ground beef BPyV-2a strain showed 99.9% sequence identity with strain 2aS11. It can be concluded that BPyV genomes can often be detected in ground beef samples, although higher sample numbers should be examined in the future to confirm this finding. Further studies should focus on the infectivity, tumorigenicity and heat resistance of the contained viruses to assess the risk of cancer induction from consumption of BPyVs contained in beef products.

690,Advances in antiviral vaccine development,"Antiviral vaccines are the most successful biomedical intervention to prevent epidemic viral diseases. Vaccination against smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle has been the basis for eradicating the disease, and recent advances in eradicating polio are promising. Although early vaccines were developed empirically by passage in live animals or eggs, newer vaccines have been developed due to the advent of new technologies, particularly cell culture and molecular biology. Recent technological advances in gene delivery and expression, nanoparticles, protein manufacturing and adjuvants have created the potential for new vaccine platforms that may provide solutions for vaccines against viral pathogens for which no interventions currently exist. In addition, the technological convergence of human monoclonal antibody isolation, structural biology and high-throughput sequencing offers new opportunities for atomic-level immunogen design. The selection of human monoclonal antibodies can identify immunodominant antigenic sites associated with neutralization and provide reagents to stabilize and resolve the structure of viral surface proteins. Understanding the structural basis for neutralization can guide vaccine target selection. Deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire and definition of the ontogeny of desired antibody responses can reveal the requirements for junctional recombination and somatic mutation for B cell recognition and affinity maturation. Taken together, this information will provide new strategic approaches for the selection of vaccine antigens, formulations and schemes. In addition, it creates the potential for rational vaccine design and the establishment of a catalog of vaccine technology platforms that would be effective against any family or class of viral pathogens and improve our preparedness to address emerging viral threats.

691,Genital zoster infection: the big scam,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are taxonomically closely related viruses that cause clinically distinct diseases but share common infectious characteristics. HSV-1 and HSV-2 both produce primary cutaneous and mucocutaneous infections followed by reactivation disease occurring at the same or a nearby anatomical site. The VZV primary infection, also known as chickenpox, is usually a childhood disease that causes smallpox-like skin lesions spread throughout the body. Reactivation VZV infection, often referred to as herpes zoster, generally occurs later in life but, unlike HSV disease, produces smallpox-like lesions at a different anatomical site, typically along dermatomes. Therefore, the clinical differential diagnosis of HSV reactivation infection and zoster is generally based on the anatomical location and appearance of the lesion(s). The recent availability of molecular assays has led to the unexpected diagnosis of zoster infections in both male and female patients presenting with genital lesions. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of HSV and VZV infections and to report on a laboratory experience that led to the diagnosis of zoster infections using a molecular assay in which nearly 10% of the 282 positives VZV samples were from genital sites.",,"Granato, P.

692,"Metagenomic detection of viral pathogens in Spanish honey bees: co-infection by aphid palsy, acute Israel palsy, and Sea Sinai viruses","The situation of honey bees in Europe has become progressively worse in recent years, with steady population decline and/or catastrophic winter losses. This has been largely attributed to the emergence of a variety of known and ""unknown"" emerging diseases. Previous studies have shown that colonies can often harbor more than one pathogen, making pathogen identification difficult using classical methods. By using an unbiased metagenomic approach that allows for the detection of both unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, detection of three viruses, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Israel Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), in honey bees from Spain is reported in this article. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees has only recently been reported and this is the first identification of such a strain in Europe. Similarly, LSV appears to be an as yet unclassified group of viruses with unclear colony health implications, and these viruses have not yet been identified outside of the United States. In addition, our study also shows that these bees carried a plant virus, turnip ringspot virus (TuRSV), which may serve as an important vector organism.

693,Whole genome sequence comparison of vtx2 converting phages from enteroaggregative hemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains,"BACKGROUND: Enteroaggregative hemorrhagic E. coli (EAHEC) is a novel pathogenic group of E. coli characterized by the presence of a vtx2 phage integrated into the genomic backbone of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC). Four different EAHEC serotypes have been described so far, causing a small outbreak and six sporadic cases of HUS in the period 1992-2012 in addition to the major outbreak in Germany in 2011. In the present work, we determined the entire genome sequence of the vtx2 phage, called Phi-191, present in the first described EAHEC O111:H2, isolated in France in 1992, and compared it with those of the vtx phage whose sequences were available. RESULTS: The entire genome sequence of the Phi-191 phage was identical to that of the vtx2 phage P13374 present in strain EAHEC O104:H4 isolated 20 years later during the German outbreak. In addition, it was also almost identical to those of other previously described vtx2 phages from EAHEC O104:H4 strains. Conversely, the Phi-191 phage appeared to be distinct from the vtx2 phage carried by the EAHEC O111:H21 isolated in Northern Ireland in 2012. Typical verocytotoxin-producing E. coli strains showed the presence of a 900 bp sequence that is uniquely associated with EAHEC phage and encodes a tail fiber. CONCLUSIONS: At least two distinct vtx2 phages, both characterized by the presence of a peculiar tail fiber-encoding gene, were involved in the generation of EAHEC. The finding of an identical vtx2 phage in two isolated EAggEC strains after 20 years despite the high variability described for vtx phages is unexpected and suggests that such vtx2 phages are subject to strong selection pressure. The observation that differential EAHEC infections have been traced in countries where EAggEC infections are endemic and human wastewater treatment is often ineffective suggests that such countries may represent the cradle for the emergence of the EAHEC pathotype. In these regions, EAggEC of human origin can contaminate the environment extensively, where they can encounter free vtx phage, which are likely to be spread through ruminant faeces.",,"Grande, L.;Michelacci, V.;Tozzoli, R.;Ranieri, P.;Maugliani, A.;Caprioli, A.;Morabito, S.",2014.0,2008-07-01 00:00:00,,0

Colinearity of genes was observed with the KSHV genome, and the herpesvirus core genes had strong sequence homology to the corresponding KSHV genes. RFHVMn lacked homologues of open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and KSHV ORFs K5 and K6, which appeared to be generated by duplication of ORFs K3 and K4 after KSHV and RFHV divergence. RFHVMn contained positional homologs of all other unique KSHV genes, although some showed limited sequence similarity. RFHVMn contained a number of candidate microRNA genes. Although there was little sequence similarity to KSHV microRNAs, one candidate contained the same seed sequence as the positional homologue kshv-miR-K12-10a, indicating functional overlap. Splicing of RNA transcripts was highly conserved between RFHVMn and KSHV, and strong sequence conservation was found in specific promoters and putative origins of replication, predicting important functional similarities. Sequence comparisons revealed that RFHVMn and KSHV evolved synchronously with the evolution of their hosts over the long term, and both viruses group phylogenetically within the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses. RFHVMn is the closest homologue of KSHV to be fully sequenced and the first sequenced RV1 rhadinovirus homologue of KSHV from an Old World non-human primate. The strong genetic and sequence similarity between RFHVMn and KSHV, coupled with similarities in biology and pathology, indicate that RFHVMn infection in macaques represents an important and relevant model for the study of KSHV in humans. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Gregory Bruce, A.;Ryan, J.

697,A metagenomic analysis of pandemic influenza a (2009 H1N1) infection in patients from North America,"Although metagenomics has been used for pathogen discovery before, its cost and complexity have prevented its use as a practical front-line diagnostic for unknown infectious diseases. Here we demonstrate the utility of two metagenomics-based strategies, a panviral microarray (Virochip) and deep sequencing, to identify and characterize the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus. Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the Collected at the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada and the United States (n=17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without prior information. Deep sequencing revealed reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to H1N1-2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%) with influenza genome coverage of up to 97% in one sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers close to the detection limits for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided insight into the upper respiratory tract microbiota and host gene expression in response to H1N1 infection in 2009. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the H1N1 genome from 2009 could be assembled de novo without the use of a reference sequence, including the assembly of multiple nearly full-length genomic segments.

698,The complete genome of the class virus - a novel picornavirus in pediatric stool,"Background: Every year, 2 million children worldwide die from diarrhea, but in about 30-50% of cases no etiological agent is found. Picornaviral genera such as Enterovirus, Kobuvirus, Cosavirus, Parechovirus, Hepatovirus, Techovirus and Cardiovirus have all been found in human and animal diarrhea. Modern technologies, particularly deep sequencing, enable rapid, high-throughput screening of clinical samples such as stool for new infectious agents implicated in human diseases. Results: A pool of 141 pediatric gastroenteritis specimens previously found negative for known diarrheal viruses were pyrosequenced. From a total of 937,935 sequence reads, a collection of 849 reads distantly related to Aichi virus was assembled and found to encompass 75% of a new picornavirus genome. The complete genome was subsequently cloned and found to share 52.3% pairwise nucleotide identity and 38.9% amino acid identity with Aichi virus. The low degree of sequence identity suggests a new genus of picornavirus, which we have termed the class virus. A blinded screening of 751 stool specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals yielded a second positive case of class virus infection, later found to be from the 11-month-old twin of the index case. Conclusion: We report the detection of human class virus 1, a member of a novel picornavirus genus, in the stool of two Northern California infants. Further characterization and epidemiological studies are needed to determine whether class viruses are significant causes of human infection.",,"Greninger, A. L.;Runckel, C.;Chiu, C.

However, this information is essential for monitoring animal and public health, updating vaccines, and understanding virus evolution and its large-scale spread. Methods: The study population consisted of 21 pig herds with clinical problems due to respiratory diseases. Nasal swabs from individual pigs were collected and tested by virus isolation in MDCK cells and by rtRT-PCR. All eight segments of 10 H3N2 viruses were sequenced and molecularly characterized using high-throughput sequencing. Results: The prevalence within the herd was between 2 and 100%. Structurally, the Ontario H3N2 viruses can be divided into three different groups. Group 1 was most similar to the original 2005 trH3N2 virus. Group 2 was most similar to the H3N2 isolates from the Ontario turkey, with the PB1 and NS genes from the trH3N2 virus and the M, PB2, PA and NP genes from the A(H1N1 )pdm09 virus. All group 3 internal genes were genetically related to A(H1N1)pdm09. Analysis of the antigenic sites of HA1 showed that group 1 had 8 aa changes within 4 antigenic sites, A(1), B(3), C(2) and E(2). Group 2 viruses had 8 aa changes within the 3 antigenic sites A(3), B(3) and C(2), while group 3 viruses had 4 aa changes within the 3 antigenic sites B(1), D(1) and exhibited E(2), compared to cluster IV H3N2 virus [A/swine/Ontario/33853/2005/(H3N2)].

The prevalence of antibodies to HEV was 92.8% (584/629), and HEV RNA was detected in 15% of cecal contents (93/629), 3% of plasma samples (22/629), and 2% of both (14/629). 629) demonstrated. 629). Although HEV is widespread in pigs in the UK and viremic pigs enter the food chain, most (22/23) viral sequences are clustered separately from the dominant type observed in humans. Therefore, UK reared pigs are unlikely to be the main source of human HEV infection in the UK. Further research is needed to identify the source of these infections.",,"Grierson, S.;Heaney, J.;Cheney, T.;Morgan, D.;Wyllie, S.;Powell, L.;Smith, D.;Ijaz, S.;Steinbach, F.;Choudhury, B.;Tedder, R.

702,Molecular and in vitro characterization of British swine hepatitis E virus,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is widespread in the global swine population. Although clinically inapparent in pigs, HEV infection is the cause of hepatitis E in humans and transmission through the food chain has been demonstrated. Following a 2013 study examining the prevalence of HEV infection in pigs of UK slaughter age, samples with the highest viral loads were selected for further characterisation. High throughput sequencing was used to obtain the full coding sequence from five samples. In-frame insertion within the HEV hypervariable region was observed in two samples. Virus isolation and culture was performed to investigate whether this mutation could be the cause of high-level viraemia and fecal shedding as observed in swine specimens. Based on viral growth kinetics, there was no evidence that these insertions affected replication efficiency in vitro, suggesting that as yet undetermined host factors may influence the course of infection and consequently the risk of foodborne transmission.",,"Grierson, S.

703,Genomic epidemiology of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus via colonization and skin and soft tissue infection,"OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus skin and skin tissue infections (Sa-SSTI) represent a significant burden on healthcare systems. New Zealand has a high incidence of Sa-SSTI and here most of the morbidity is caused by a polyclonal methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) bacterial population. However, MSSA also asymptomatically colonize the cornified epithelia of about 20% of the population, and their separation between commensalism and pathogenicity is poorly understood. Our goal was to see if MSSA are genetically differentiated across colonization and SSTI; and given the close interactions between humans and domestic animals, whether strains isolated from domestic animals differ from human strains. METHODS: We compared the genomes of co-colonization and clinical MSSA isolates obtained from humans and domesticated animals in New Zealand. RESULTS: Nuclear and accessory genome comparisons revealed a homogeneous bacterial population across colonization, disease, humans and pets. The MSSA colonization rate in dogs was comparatively low (5.4%). CONCLUSIONS: In New Zealand, most Sa-SSTI morbidity is caused by random sampling of the colonizing MSSA population, which is more in line with the opportunistic infection model than the paradigm that discriminates strains according to their pathogenicity. Therefore, studies of the factors that determine colonization and immune escape may be more advantageous than comparative virulence studies. Contact with pets may pose a low zoonotic risk.",,"Grinberg, A.;Biggs, P. J.;Zhang, J.;Ritchie, S.;Oneroa, Z.;O'Neill, C.;Karkaba, A.;Velathanthiri, N. S.;Coombs, G. W.",2017.0,10,,0
704,Identification of potyviruses infecting vanilla by direct sequencing of a short RT-PCR amplicon,"To identify the potyviruses infecting vanilla, a simple one-tube RT-PCR test was used in one step with degenerate primers followed by direct sequencing of a 327 bp coat protein gene fragment. Using this technique, an unequivocal species assignment was achieved for 34 potyvirus-infected vanilla samples collected between 1997 and 2005 in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. Virus identification was based on BLAST homology and nucleotide identities of 162-327 nt fragments with known potyvirus sequences. Species assignment was confirmed by neighbor joining of the 149 nt common to 32 vanilla sequences and 51 known potyviruses. Pending further identification, these data revealed four other potyvirus species that can infect vanilla: Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus, Cowpea Aphid-borne Mosaic Virus, Ornithogalum Mosaic Virus, and Wisteria Vein Mosaic Virus. The method was fast, inexpensive, easy to use and showed good taxonomic discrimination value. It also enabled the identification of potyviruses in neighboring weeds and thus should contribute to the understanding of potyvirus outbreaks occurring under different epidemiological circumstances.",,"Grisoni, M.;Moles, M.;Farreyrol, K.;Rassaby, L.;Davis, R.;Pearson, M.",2006.0,Aug,,0

706,Varicella zoster virus specific gp140: A highly immunogenic and disulfide-linked structural glycoprotein,"140,000 dalton disulfide-linked glycoprotein (gp140) specified by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in infected cultured cells was identified and precipitated by two murine monoclonal antibodies (VZ-151 and VZ-158). When analyzed under reducing conditions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gp140 was predominantly cleaved to a lower molecular weight 66,000 product (gp66). This protein was classified as a viral structural component because it was observed in the polypeptide profile of metrizamide gradient-purified enveloped virions. Immunofluorescence analysis using a monoclonal antibody probe documented gp140 expression in cultured cells inoculated with homologous (VZV-Oka) and heterologous (VZV-32) strains as well as in infected human tissues of chickenpox and zoster patients is highly conserved. That the glycoprotein was highly immunogenic was confirmed by the presence of high titre anti-gp140 antibodies in the sera of both hyperimmunized laboratory animals and naturally infected humans. Temporally, the humoral response to gp140 after primary VZV infection preceded that to the other viral glycoproteins. These studies therefore describe an immunogenic disulfide-linked structural viral glycoprotein that must belong to the other five previously described VZV-specific fucosylated species - gp118, gp98, gp88, gp62 and gp45.",,"Grose, C.;Edwards, D.

The data are compiled from the literature and personal experience. The clinical picture of this new disease, which has led to significant economic losses, is dominated by 1. an increased rate of shortened gestation periods with late abortion before day 110 or a prolonged gestation period; 2. an increase in stillborn piglets; 3. A greater degree of pre-weaning mortality combined with a higher frequency of secondary infections. Pathologic findings in piglets include subcutaneous edema, fluid accumulation in the body cavities and interstitial pneumonias are sometimes observed. Mononuclear placentitis is present in sows from affected herds that are examined prior to birth. Currently, an unclassified virus isolated by Dutch researchers is proposed as the causative agent, named Lelystad virus.",,"grosse Beilage, E.;Stockhofe-Zurwieden, N.;SchÃ¶ttker-Wegner, H.

Therefore, we first established a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based protocol that allows for the unbiased identification of transcripts in virus particles. We then applied our protocol to analyze RNA in an emerging zoonotic member of the Poxviridae family, namely cowpox virus. Our results showed the incorporation of 19 viral transcripts while host identifications were restricted to ribosomal and mitochondrial RNA. Most viral transcripts had an unknown and immunomodulatory function, suggesting that transcript incorporation may be beneficial for poxvirus immune evasion. Remarkably, the most abundant transcript originated from the D5L/I1R gene, which encodes a viral inhibitor of the host's cytoplasmic DNA acquisition machinery.",,"Grossegesse, M.;Doellinger, J.;Haldemann, B.;Schaade, L.;Nitsche, A.",2017.0,10 13,,0
709,Combined proteomics/genomics approach reveals proteomic changes in mature virions as a novel poxvirus adaptation mechanism,"Like poxviruses, DNA viruses possess a highly stable genome, suggesting that adaptation of viral particles to specific cell types is not limited to genomic alterations. Cowpoxviruses are zoonotic poxviruses with an exceptionally broad host range, demonstrating their adaptive potential in vivo. To elucidate the adaptation mechanisms of poxviruses, we isolated vaccinia virus particles from a rat and passaged them five times in a human and a rat cell line. We then analyzed the proteome and genome of the unpassaged virions and each passage. While the entire viral genome sequence was stable during passage, proteomics revealed several changes in virion composition. Interestingly, increased viral fitness was observed in human cells in the presence of increased immunomodulatory protein levels. Since the only minor variant was localized in a viral RNA polymerase subunit with increasing frequency during passage and, moreover, most minor variants were found in transcription-associated genes, protein levels were presumably regulated at the transcriptional level. This study is the first comparative proteomic analysis of virus particles before and after cell culture propagation, revealing proteomic changes as a novel poxvirus adaptation mechanism.",,"Grossegesse, M.;Doellinger, J.;Tyshaieva, A.;Schaade, L.;Nitsche, A.",2017.0,11 10,,0
710,Typing of bacteriophage strains by rapid single molecule analysis,"The rapid characterization of unknown biological samples is the focus of many current studies. Here we report a method for screening biological samples by optically mapping their DNA. We use a novel, one-step chemo-enzymatic reaction to covalently attach fluorophores to DNA at the four-base recognition sites of a DNA methyltransferase. Due to the diffraction limit of light, the dense distribution of the labels results in a continuous fluorescence signal along the DNA. The amplitude modulations (AM) of fluorescence intensity along the stretched DNA molecules reveal a unique molecular fingerprint that can be used for identification. We show that this labeling scheme is highly informative and allows for accurate genotyping. We demonstrate the method by labeling the genomes of lambda and T7 bacteriophages, resulting in a consistent, unique AM profile for each genome. These profiles are also used successfully to identify phage from a background phage library. Our method can provide an easy way to screen and type different organisms and has potential applications in metagenomic studies of different ecosystems.",,"Grunwald, A.;Dahan, M.;Giesbertz, A.;Nilsson, A.;Nyberg, L.

Since 2013, the autopsy lesions, histological examinations, virus isolation, phylogenetic analysis and selection pressure analysis of gE gene of vPRV for 395 clinical cases were recorded and 5,033 swine serum samples were detected by PRV gE-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The main clinical symptoms were miscarriages in pregnant sows, fatal neurological symptoms in piglets and respiratory diseases in growing pigs. On histopathological examination, necrotic splenitis, hepatitis and lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic nephritis and nonsuppurative encephalitis were observed. Typical eosinophilic inclusion bodies have been found in the nuclei of liver cells. 110 samples from 395 clinical cases tested positive for the gE gene by PCR. Fifteen vPRV strains were isolated and confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the gE gene. The strains shared 97.1% to 99.9% nucleotide (nt) and 96.6% to 99.5% amino acid (aa) homology with PRV reference strains. Analysis of selection pressure showed that a site in the codons of glycoprotein E was under positive selection. Of the 5,033 serum samples, 2,909 were positive by ELISA, representing a positive rate of 57.8%. These results indicated that vPRV was still widespread in Shandong province, indicating strong PRV infection pressure.

To examine the genetic composition, Dk/SD/009/08 was subjected to genome sequencing. The amino acid motif of the cleavage site was ""PLRERRRK-R/GL"", consistent with the characterization of the HPAIV. According to H5N1's latest unified nomenclature system, Dk/SD/009/08 has been placed in Clade 2.3.4. The BLAST results showed that four gene segments (HA, NA, NP, and NS) shared the highest nucleotide identities with AIVs of the H5N1 subtype, while the remaining four (PB2, PB1, PA, and M) shared the closest relationship with the H9N2 subtype exhibited. Therefore, Dk/SD/009/08 could be a natural reassortant virus. The phylogenetic analysis further suggested that G1-like H9N2 subtype AIVs, found mainly in southern China quail, might provide the internal genes for Dk/SD/009/08.",,"Gu, M.;Liu, W. B.;Cao, J.

Orf virus was identified by ELISA test (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay), recurrent infection test, transmission electron microscopy and PCR. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of two genes of the orf virus were analyzed. The results showed that the virus had typical parapoxvirus virions under electron microscopy and that many eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. In the ELISA test, the optical density (OD) readings of the sample showed a positive result, and the virus-infected rabbits showed a typical orf virus-infected appearance. All of these findings proved that the sample was an orf virus. The phylogenetic studies of the Orf B2L and Orf F1L genes showed that the virus clustered in different branches and was closer to the Orf virus Nantou (DQ904351) and the OV-SA00 isolates (AY386264). In addition, the above results could provide insight into the genotype of the etiological agent responsible for the Orf outbreak in Shanxi Province and could also provide a comparative overview of the B2L and F1L genes of parapoxvirus.",,"Gu, S.

According to an analysis of the differential expression between the mock-infected and PRV-infected cells, 4151 host lncRNAs were significantly upregulated and 2327 host lncRNAs were significantly downregulated in the latter group. Viral lncRNAs and several host lncRNAs were verified by Northern blotting and real-time PCR. The results indicated that the viral lncRNA LDI could regulate the expression of IE180, a potent transcriptional activator of viral genes. Furthermore, we characterized the expression of viral lncRNAs in culture of infected chicken primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG).

Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to assess risk to human and animal health and identify economic impacts such as failure to thrive. There is limited data on the detection and characterization of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in pigs in Ireland. A number of small new porcine DNA viruses have recently emerged worldwide, e.g. B. the torque tenosus virus, the swine bocavirus and the parvoviruses 2 and 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically diverse group of viruses recently identified in humans and animals. METHODS: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus and porcine bocavirus) was examined in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 samples were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a subset of samples (n=44) were then analyzed individually. Viral diversity was then examined using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. RESULTS: The initial screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV on this herd, with three distinct groups formed in the phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also examined in this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and Lineage I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some samples contained >1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm. CONCLUSION: Studying the diversity of circulating enteric viruses in Irish pig farms is important to improve the available prophylactic tools and to facilitate early detection of changes in circulating viruses.",,"Gunn, L.;Collins, P.

It may be useful to screen universal influenza virus vaccines by analyzing the epitopes of multiple subtypes of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. A total of 40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously derived from influenza virus HA antigens (the development and characterization of 40 mAbs generated using H1N1 influenza virus split vaccines were previously published) were used for detection and ELISA method used to classify mAbs into different influenza virus subcategories. Subsequently, the common contiguous amino acid sequences were identified by multiple sequence alignment analysis using the GenBank database and DNAMAN software for use in predicting the epitopes of the HA protein. Synthesized peptides of these shared sequences were made and used to verify and identify the predicted linear epitopes by localization and distribution analysis. Using these methods, nine linear HA epitopes distributed among different strains of influenza virus were identified, including three from influenza A, four from 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza, and two from H1. The present study showed that considering a combination of antigen-antibody reaction specificity, variation in influenza virus HA protein and linear epitopes can represent a useful approach for the development of effective multi-epitope vaccines.

We report that the emergence of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor binding specificity. In contrast to the ancestral clade 2.3.4 H5 proteins, new clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind to fucosylated sialosides due to the K222Q and S227R substitutions unique to highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins. North American clade 2.3.4.4 virus isolates retained only the K222Q substitution but still bind fucosylated sialosides.

Approximately 41.8% (41/98) of the diarrheal specimens and 5.7% (4/70) of the non-diarrheal specimens were Nebovirus positive based on RT-PCR results, and some specimens with diarrhea were infected with bovine rotavirus ( 73.2%), bovine coronavirus (36.6%) and/or bovine viral diarrhea virus (31.7%) co-infected. A phylogenetic analysis of 23 Nebovirus RdRp fragments showed that these strains were closely related to Nebraska-like (NB-like) strains, but were all in a single large branch. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of the 18 complete VP1 sequences from this study revealed that 14 kindreds belonged to lineage 1 and 4 kindreds to lineage 3. Notably, all four lineage 3 strains shared the same recombination event with a breakpoint within the P1A domain. The full genome of a nebovirus strain, Bo/YLA-2/17/CH, that exhibited a recombination event within the P1A domain of its VP1 was successfully sequenced and found to be 7453 nt in length, potentially representing a novel nebovirus strain based on the phylogenetic analysis of its complete genome sequence. In summary, this study shows that neboviruses are widespread in dairy cows in China and have a unique development of RdRp.

724,Sequence analysis of the Meq oncogene among Indian isolates of Marek's disease herpesvirus,"Marek's disease (MD), caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), is a highly contagious neoplastic disease in chickens that can be prevented by vaccination. However, in recent years, many cases of vaccination failure have been reported worldwide as chickens develop symptoms of MD despite proper vaccination. Pronounced polymorphism and point mutations in the Meq gene of MDV have been reported to be associated with virulence and oncogenicity. The present study was conducted with the aim of isolating and characterizing field isolates of MDV based on the Meq gene. Twenty-five specimens from suspected MDV cases were collected and processed for virus isolation in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) primary cultures, where 28% (7 of 25) specimens showed characteristic cytopathic effects of MDV in the form of plaques and syncytia. Additional evidence for the presence of MDV in these samples was confirmed by PCR. To analyze the diversity in all seven isolates of MDV, a polymorphism study was performed by cloning and sequencing the full-length (1020 bp) Meq gene. The sequence homology of 7 isolates with 23 reference strains showed 98.10-99.40% similarity in nucleotides and 95.90-98.50% similarity in amino acid sequences. Six isolates showed 5 repeat sequences of 4 prolines (PPPP), whereas one isolate showed only 4 repeats. In the phylogenetic analysis, these isolates formed a separate cluster showing a close relationship with the Chinese isolates. The study points to a high mutation rate in field isolates of MDV, which could be a likely cause of vaccine failure.",,"Gupta, M.;Deka, D.;Ramneek",2016.0,,10.1016/j.mgene.2016.07.009,0
725,Restriction enzyme analysis of bovine herpesvirus 1 DNA from an Indian isolate,"An Indian isolate of BHV-1 was analyzed using several restriction endonucleases. The restriction pattern of BHV-1 DNA containing HindIII, BamHI and EcoRI was found to be similar to other reported restriction endonuclease patterns for BHV-1 respiratory isolates. Thus, this isolate could be grouped under BHV-1.1 (respiratory form of BHV-1). Few restriction endonucleases yielded a different restriction profile of BHV-1 DNA. The total molecular size of the BHV-1 DNA for the isolate examined was also estimated to be 136 kb to 138 kb.",,"Gupta, P. K.;Rai, A.",1993.0,,,0
726,Genetic diversity in the VP1 gene of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype Asia 1,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the 1D gene (encoding VP1) from 61 Asia I FMD serotype virus isolates recovered from different outbreaks in India between 1985 and 1999, including two currently used vaccine strains, has been determined. The sequences were compared with each other and with those from other Asian countries. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the viruses could be divided into four genotypes (genotypes I-IV). All 61 isolates from India belong to a single genotype (genotype II) which is further subdivided into three lineages (B1, B2 and B3) under the same genotype. It was found that the B1 and B3 lineage viruses were more common before 1996, while the B2 lineage viruses appeared to be new variants responsible for most of the recent outbreaks. Most B1 lineage isolates lack an amino acid in the VP1 protein (position 44), whereas most B2 and B3 lineage isolates contain it, suggesting the possibility that these lineages evolved independently. The rate of evolution of FMD Asia-1 virus was also estimated and found to be 2.7 x 10(-2) synonymous substitutions per nucleotide per year.",,"Gurumurthy, C.

727,Turkey coronavirus is more closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus than to mammalian coronaviruses: a review,"Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is the cause of acute highly contagious enteric disease in turkeys. In recent years, TCoV has been increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in young turkeys in North America, resulting in economic losses due to stunted growth and poor feed conversion. Although the epidemiology and pathogenesis of TCoV have been extensively studied, TCoV remains one of the least characterized known coronaviruses. Avian and mammalian coronaviruses have been divided into distinct antigenic/genotypic groups; However, the classification of TCoV has been controversial. Previous studies showed that TCoV was closely related to bovine and other group 2 mammalian coronaviruses, but recent antigen and genomic sequence analyzes contradict these results and instead provide evidence that TCoV is closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV) is related. In addition, experimental studies have shown that the host range of TCoV, previously thought to be restricted to turkeys, includes chickens. These studies have raised additional questions about the classification of TCoV; specifically, whether IBV and TCoV are taxonomically distinct viruses or whether TCoV is merely a variant of IBV. Sequence analyzes of TCoV have confirmed the notion that TCoV is a variant of IBV, as these studies have shown that TCoV and IBV are very closely related. However, these studies were limited to only three TCoV strains and relatively small parts of the TCoV genome. TCoV is easily distinguished from IBV due to antigenic and biological differences, and these differences suggest that TCoV should be considered a distinct virus species. Additional studies are needed to better define the relationship between TCoV and IBV and to clarify this taxonomic question. Based on our current understanding, it seems prudent to consider TCoV and IBV as distinct virus species that share a close phylogenetic relationship and together form group 3 of the main antigenic groups of coronavirus.",,"Guy, J.

728,H5 avian and H9 swine influenza virus hemagglutinin structures: possible origin of influenza subtypes,"There are 15 subtypes of influenza A virus (H1-H15), all of which are found in bird species. Three caused pandemics in the last century: H1 in 1918 (and 1977), H2 in 1957 and H3 in 1968. In 1997 an H5 avian virus and in 1999 an H9 virus caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in Hong Kong. We have determined the three-dimensional structures of the hemagglutinins (HAs) of H5 avian and H9 swine viruses, which are closely related to the viruses isolated from humans in Hong Kong. We compared them to known structures of the H3-HA from the virus that caused the 1968 H3 pandemic and to the HA-esterase fusion (HEF) glycoprotein from an influenza C virus. Structural and sequence comparisons suggest that HA subtypes may have arisen through diversification of properties affecting the metastability of HAs required for their membrane fusion activities in viral infections.",,"Ha, Y.;Stevens, D.

731,"Possible sources and routes of infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 in poultry and wild birds in Central Europe in 2007, derived from probability analyses","In 2007, recurrent outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV occurred in several Central European countries. In-depth phylogenetic analyzes involving full genome sequences of the viruses involved were performed to elucidate possible invader origins and transmission routes. Tree reconstructions as well as inferences about host shifts and ancestral areas were performed in a maximum likelihood framework. All viruses belonged to a separate subgroup (designated ""EMA-3"") within Group 2.2 and were therefore distinct from two lineages of HPAIV H5N1 viruses (designated ""EMA-1"" and ""EMA-2"") found in of the same geographic area in 2006. Analysis of concatenated coding regions of all eight genome segments significantly improved the resolution and robustness of the reconstructed phylogenies compared to single-gene analyses. At the same time, the methodological limitations of the retrospective establishment of transmission networks in a comparatively small geographical region and over a short period of time became clear when only few corroborating field epidemiological data are available. There are still uncertainties regarding the origin of the EMA-3 viruses from a region that includes south-eastern Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as regarding the routes of spread to other European countries. The AIV surveillance programs for wild birds and poultry in these countries did not show the presence of these viruses in any population. There were several host changes between domestic poultry and wild bird populations. Analysis of eruptions in north-eastern Germany and nearby northern Poland in December 2007 has shown that the geographic and even temporal proximity of eruptions does not necessarily indicate a common source of incidence. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Haase, M.;Starick, E.;Fereidouni, S.;Strebelow, G.;Grund, C.;Seeland, A.;Scheuner, C.;Cieslik, D.;Smietanka, K.;Minta, Z.;Zorman-Rojs, O.;Mojzis, M.;Goletic, T.;Jestin, V.;Schulenburg, B.;Pybus, O.;Mettenleiter, T.;Beer, M.;Harder, T.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.005,0

This virus, which differs serologically from classic (type I) DHV, multiplied in liver and kidney cell cultures from ducks. Replication was limited in chicken and quail kidney and duck embryo fibroblast cultures. It did not replicate in a variety of other avian or mammalian cell cultures. The virus has been successfully cultured in embryonating duck eggs but not in chickens. DHV-III passed a 50 nm membrane filter, was stable at pH 3.0, and withstood treatment with 5% chloroform. Viral growth was not inhibited by treatment with 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine.

However, using deep sequencing and other open-minded approaches to detect viruses in mosquitoes has uncovered many new RNA viruses, most of which do not infect vertebrates. The discovery of these 'insect-specific' viruses (ISVs) has redefined the mosquito virus and led to the re-drawing of the boundaries of the taxonomic classification of viruses1,2.

734,Metagenomic detection of viruses in aerosol samples from workers in animal slaughterhouses,"Published studies have shown that animal slaughterhouse workers are at a higher risk of lung cancer compared to the general population. No specific contributors were identified, and exposure to multiple chemicals was investigated and found unrelated. Evidence points to a biological etiology, as workers exposed to live animals or biological material containing animal faeces, urine, or blood are at greatest risk. To investigate potential biological exposures in animal slaughterhouses, we used a metagenomic approach to characterize the profile of organisms present in an aerosol sample. An aerosol exposure assessment for individual workers was achieved through the collection of personal samples representing the respirable fraction of dust/bioaerosol in the workplace air in both cattle and sheep slaughterhouses. Two sets of nine personal aerosol samples were pooled for the cattle processing and sheep processing areas, respectively, generating a total of 332,677,346 sequence reads and 250,144,492 sequence reads of 85 bp in length, respectively. A eukaryotic genomic sequence was found at both sampling sites, and bovine, ovine, and human sequences were common. WU polyomavirus and human papillomavirus 120 sequences were detected in the metagenomic data set from the bovine processing area and these sequences were confirmed to be present in the original personal aerosol samples. This study represents the first metagenomic description of personal aerosol exposure, and this methodology could be applied to a variety of settings. The detection of two candidate viruses also justifies further investigations in connection with occupational exposure in animal slaughterhouses. © 2013 Hall et al.",,"Hall, R.

735,Detection of arboviruses and other microorganisms in experimentally infected mosquitoes using massively parallel sequencing,"The incidence of human diseases attributed to arbovirus infection is increasing worldwide, with effective control measures limited by issues of sustainability, insecticide resistance, and the lack of effective vaccines. Several promising control strategies are currently being developed, such as B. the release of mosquitoes trans-infected with virus-blocking Wolbachia bacteria. The implementation of any control program depends on effective virus surveillance and a thorough understanding of virus-vector interactions. Massively parallel sequencing has enormous potential for providing comprehensive genomic information that can be used to assess many aspects of arbovirus ecology, as well as evaluate novel control strategies. To demonstrate the proof-of-principle, we analyzed Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus experimentally infected with dengue, yellow fever, or chikungunya viruses. Random amplification was used to generate sufficient template for sequencing on the Personal Genome Machine. Viral sequences were present in all infected mosquitoes. In addition, in most cases we were also able to identify the mosquito species and mosquito microorganisms, including the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. Importantly, naturally occurring Wolbachia strains could be distinguished from strains that had been transfected into the mosquito. The method allowed us to assemble almost complete viral genomes and detect other microorganisms in a single reaction without prior knowledge of the sequence. This is a step towards the application of massively parallel sequencing as an arbovirus surveillance tool. It has the potential to provide insights into the dynamics of virus transmission and is applicable for post-release monitoring of Wolbachia in mosquito populations.",,"Hall-Mendelin, S.;Allcock, R.;Kresoje, N.;van den Hurk, A.

736,Metabarcoding analysis of eukaryotic microbiota in the gut of HIV-infected patients,"Research into the relationship between changes in the gut microbiota and human diseases, including AIDS, is a growing area. However, studies on the eukaryotic component of the gut microbiota are just beginning and have not yet been conducted in HIV-infected patients. In addition, the profiling of the eukaryotic community is influenced by using different methods at each step of culture-independent techniques. Herein, four DNA extraction protocols were first compared to test the efficiency of each method in recovering eukaryotic DNA from stool samples. Our results showed that the recovery of eukaryotic components from stool samples differs significantly between DNA extraction methods. Subsequently, the composition of the intestinal eukaryotic microbiota in HIV-infected patients and healthy subjects was examined by clone sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and 2 (ITS2) amplicons, and real-time PCRs. Our results showed that not only the richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) differ between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, depending on the molecular strategy used, but also the composition of the global eukaryotic community, with few overlapping taxa found between techniques. Furthermore, our results based on cloning libraries and ITS1/ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing revealed significant differences in fungal composition between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, but with no clear clusters separating the two groups. Malassezia restricta was significantly more common in stool samples from HIV-infected patients according to cloning libraries, while operative taxonomic units (OTUs) of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were significantly more common in stool samples from HIV-infected patients than in healthy subjects in both ITS subregions. Finally, real-time PCR revealed the presence of Microsporidia, Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis and Hymenolepis diminuta in different proportions in stool samples from HIV patients compared to healthy subjects. Our work has shown that using different sequencing approaches can affect perceived outcomes of eukaryotic diversity of the human gut. We also provide a more comprehensive overview of the eukaryotic community in the gut of HIV-infected patients through the complementarity of the different molecular techniques used. The combination of these different methods may provide a gold standard for a more complete characterization of the eukaryotic microbiome in future studies.",,"Hamad, I.;Abou Abdallah, R.;Ravaux, I.;Mokhtari, S.;Tissot-Dupont, H.;Michelle, C.;Stein, A.;Lagier, J.

737,Using Bayesian network modeling to unravel farm management risk factors for bovine viral diarrhea viral infection,"Understanding the risk factors for bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) transmission is important for planning national disease control programs. However, traditional statistical approaches may miss important features of BVD epidemiology due to the highly correlated nature of many farm-level risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, we used data collected in 2015/2016 from 304 cattle herds in New Zealand to compare the results of multivariate logistic regression versus Bayesian network (BN) analysis. Blood samples from 15 heifers from each herd were pooled and analyzed using an antibody ELISA test to classify BVD virus exposure status. Farmers were asked about their general management practices, knowledge of BVD and risk factors for disease transmission, including on- and off-farm movement, on-farm and inter-farm contacts, and whether they have implemented BVD control measures for their farm bulls. Multiple imputation was used to infer missing values in the dataset prior to statistical analysis. The results showed that 57/116 (49.1%) cattle farms and 95/188 (50.5%) dairy farms were probably actively infected with BVD virus. Almost 60% of the farms had heifers/cows brought onto the farm and 13.8% of the farmers reported contact with cattle from other farms. Multivariable logistic regression results showed that farms with heifers/cows on-site for all or most of the last five years had a higher risk of being BVD seropositive than farms without these movements (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29 - 4.24). Farms with occasional or infrequent contact between cattle and cattle from other farms were also at increased risk compared to farms with no animal-to-farm contact (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.33-5.41), although this association was not frequency-dependent was. Only close animal contacts between farms were directly associated with BVD status in the BN model, however this approach further unraveled other complex relationships between correlated management factors and provided additional important insights into BVD epidemiology. Compared to other countries with intensive production systems, contact across the fence appears to play a more important role in New Zealand's pastoral production systems and should be considered when developing strategies for a national BVD control program.",,"Han, J.

738,Genetic recombination between two genotypes of bovine genogroup III (BoNVs) and capsid sequence diversity between BoNVs and Nebraska-like bovine enteric caliciviruses,"To determine the genogroups and genotypes of bovine enteric caliciviruses (BECVs) circulating in calves, we determined the complete capsid gene sequences of 21 BECVs. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were phylogenetically compared to those of known human and animal enteric caliciviruses. Based on these analyses, 15 BECVs belonged to norovirus genogroup III and genotype 2 (GIII/2) and were genetically distinct from human norovirus GI and GII. Six BECVs had capsid gene sequences similar to those of the unclassified Nebraska (NB)-like BECV. The 15 bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) were more closely related to Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (GIII/2) and other known BoNVs of genotype 2 than to genotype 1 Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE. The BoNV Bo/CV521-OH/02/US showed high nucleotide and amino acid identities (84 and 94%, respectively) with the capsid gene of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK, while the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase genes were more closely related to those from Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE (77 and 87% identities, respectively) than to those from Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (69 and 69% identities), suggesting indicates that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a genotype 1-2 recombinant. Gene conversion analysis by the recombinant identification program and SimPlot also predicted that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US was a recombinant. Six NB-like BECVs shared 88-92% nucleotide and 94-99.5% amino acid identities with the NB-BECV in the capsid gene. The results of this study demonstrate the genetic diversity in the capsid genes of BECVs circulating in Ohio calf calves, provide new data for co-infections with different BECV genotypes or genogroups, and describe the first natural BoNV genotype 1-2 recombinant , analogous to the previously reported human norovirus recombinant.",,"Han, M.

However, many unknown viruses are poorly detected using conventional virus isolation and PCR testing. Development of a technology platform for the detection of unknown viruses. We have established the technology based on viral metagenomics in combination with novel molecular diagnostics. The technology consists of host nucleic acid removal, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to detect classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infected cells and a tissue sample from a pig infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). We amplified 13.7% of the sequences from the CSFV genome and 47.2% of the sequences from the PCV2 genome, respectively. In addition, we amplified 16.4% sequences of the simian parainfluenza virus type 5 genome from an unknown viral cell culture using the developed method. Furthermore, with the developed method in combination with high-throughput sequencing, we have detected 1.1% virus sequences including CSFV, PCV2, torque tenosus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and human adenovirus type 6 (Ad6) of 7 clinical swine specimens with unknown pathogens. The developed metagenomics-based method showed good sensitivity for the detection of both DNA and RNA viruses from different porcine samples and has the potential for universal detection of known and unknown viruses.

After the catastrophic outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV was also discovered in Europe. To better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology and factors that could influence the diverse impacts of the disease; 40 samples of pig feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by next-generation shotgun sequencing. A total of 38 new complete PEDV coding sequences were generated. In a global comparison, all examined sequences from central and south-eastern Europe formed a fairly homogeneous PEDV-S-INDEL cluster, indicating recent reintroduction. However, detailed analyzes revealed two new clusters and putative ancestral tribes. Based on the available background data, no connections could be made between clusters and location, farm type or clinical picture. In addition, the influence of secondary infections was examined using metagenomic datasets. While several co-infections were observed, no association with disease progression was found.

Transmission can be direct through contact with the animal, for example through contact with its faeces, or indirectly through arthropod vectors. Here we examined the virus content in rat faeces (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the Picornaviridae that are abundant in the microbiome of all samples.

Because few SaV studies have been conducted, it is difficult to draw any correlations between or inferences about incidence rates, detection, and overall prevalence. However, most studies agree that SaV infection occurs more frequently in young children than in adults, and that infection in children almost always occurs by the age of 5 years. In addition, children in day-care centers and institutions are most at risk of SaV-associated infection and transmission. A number of important insights into human SaV have recently been discovered. SaV strains have been detected in water samples including raw wastewater samples, treated wastewater samples and river samples. SaV strains have also been detected in shellfish samples destined for human consumption, and recombinant SaV strains have been identified in a number of different countries. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current knowledge of human SaV, which appears to be an increasingly important virus causing gastroenteritis in humans.

Phylogenetic analysis of the protease gene has shown that EDS virus is genetically more closely related to bovine adenovirus type 7 (BAV-7) and ovine adenovirus isolate 287 (OAV287) than either of these two viruses with other members the genus Mastadenovirus or EDS virus belongs to another member of the genus Aviadenovirus. The three viruses share further similarities in that they have a high percentage of AT in their genome and are characterized by having more compact genomes than other adenoviruses. The protease gene from all three viruses contained active site residues (H55-D72-C122 triad) and C104 (which provides a disulfide bond to cofactor pVIc). However, P137, which is found in all other members of the Mastadenovirus genus and is believed to be involved in trafficking, was absent from the protease of EDS virus, BAV-7 and OAV287. These results suggest that EDS virus should be classified in a separate taxon along with BAV-7 and OAV287.",,"Harrach, B.;Meehan, B. M.;BenkÃ¶, M.;Adair, B.

In the last five years, the known phylogenetic diversity of the hepacivirus genera has exploded. What was once an isolated infection in humans (and possibly other primates) has now spread to horses, rodents, bats, colobus monkeys, cows and, more recently, catsharks, shedding new light on the genetic diversity and host range of throws hepaciviruses. Interestingly, despite the identification of these many animal and primate hepaciviruses, equine hepaciviruses remain the closest genetic relatives of human hepaciviruses, providing an intriguing clue to the zoonotic source of hepatitis C virus. This review article summarizes the importance of these studies and discusses current thinking about the origin and evolution of animal hepaciviruses and their potential use as surrogate models for the study of hepatitis C virus.",,"Hartlage, A.

749,Comparative analysis of selected genes of the entopoxvirus Diachasmimorpha longicaudata and other poxviruses,"Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entopoxvirus (DlEPV) is the first symbiotic EPV described from a parasitic wasp. The DlEPV is introduced into the larval host of the tephritid fruit fly along with the wasp egg during oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches revealed that five of these are homologous to putative poxvirus proteins, such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, later transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and the regulatory small subunit of poly(A) polymerase (PAP). Three of these are similar to those found in other organisms, such as Arabidopsis thaliana gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), Caenorhabditis briggsae eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), and Enterococcus faecium lambda phage integrase (γ-Int). Transcriptional motifs for early (TGA, A/T, XXXXA) or late (TAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression that are conserved in poxviruses were identified using these ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and a chaining of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the parent node between fowlpox virus and the genus B, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV belong. The putative DlEPV GGT, eIF4A and κ-Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in either viral pathogenicity or parasitism enhancement via the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or via the integration of part of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly be. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

751,The outbreaks of Newcastle disease in Sudan from 2003 to 2006 were caused by genotype 5d viruses,"Newcastle disease (ND) is a serious neurological and respiratory disease in poultry that affects all species of birds but has traditionally not caused symptoms in wild waterfowl, the natural hosts. In the late 1990s, a new genotype, viz. 5d, which is pathogenic to all bird species including waterfowl, originated in China and has since spread from East Asia to parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the fusion protein gene of isolates from ND outbreaks in Sudan and found that all contemporary strains isolated between 2003 and 2006 were of genotype 5d and contained the virulent fusion protein cleavage site (F0) motif 112RRQKRF117 included.

752,"Transmission patterns of human enterovirus 71 in, from and between European countries, 2003 to 2013","Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is implicated in hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) epidemics and is believed to occur in East and Southeast Asia with severe neurological complications. In other geographical areas, the transmission of this virus is poorly known. We used large sequence datasets (of the gene encoding viral protein 1, VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to characterize the molecular epidemiology and geographic distribution patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2, and C4 in Europe relative to compare other parts of the world. European countries considered for the study were the Member States of the European Union (EU) as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Viruses of subgenogroups B4, B5 and C4 circulate mainly in East and Southeast Asia. Sporadic introductions of these subgenogroups are observed in Europe, but C1 and C2 viruses predominate. The phylogenies have shown evidence of multiple spread events involving C1 and C2 viruses in Europe since the mid-1990s. Two waves of sporadic C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The C2 outbreak in the Netherlands in 2007 and the emergence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 occurred while the circulation of C1 -Viruses was low. A chain of transmission involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and then on to Canada between 2001 and 2006. Recent events in which viruses were spread from, to and within Europe appear to be implicated in the long-term survival of EVs -71, highlighting the need for increased surveillance of this virus.",,"Hassel, C.;Mirand, A.;Lukashev, A.;Terletskaia Ladwig, E.;Farkas, A.;Schuffenecker, I.;Diedrich, S.;Huemer, H.

754,Detection of Campylobacter jejuni in rectal swab specimens from Rousettus amplexicaudatus in the Philippines,"Bats are the second largest mammal species and are widespread around the world. They are regarded as reservoirs and transmitters of zoonotic pathogens. However, there are hardly any reports on the detection of pathogenic bacteria kept in bats. Accurate knowledge of the pathogenic bacteria in the microbiota of bats is important for the control of zoonoses. Therefore, a metagenomic analysis targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA of the rectal microbiota in Rousettus amplexicaudatus was performed using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 103 genera of bacteria including Camplyobacter were detected. Campylobacter was the second most common genus, and Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni have been identified in the microbiome of R. amplexicaudatus. Campylobacteriosis is one of the serious bacterial diarrhea in humans and the species most commonly involved as the causative agent of campylobacteriosis is C. jejuni. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of C. jejuni in 91 wild bats using PCR. As a result of a PCR assay targeting the 16S-23S intergenic spacer, a partial C. jejuni genome was detected in only five R. amplexicaudatus. This is the first report that C. jejuni has been detected in rectal swab specimens from bats. C. jejuni is the most common cause of campylobacteriosis in humans, transmitted through water and contact with livestock. This result indicated that R. amplexicaudatus could be a carrier of C. jejuni.",,"Hatta, Y.;Omatsu, T.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Katayama, Y.;Taniguchi, S.;Masangkay, J.

755,Use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect avian leukosis virus vaccine contamination,"reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for avian leukosis virus (ALV) was developed to detect contamination of vaccines prepared in chicken embryonated eggs and cell cultures. ALV is highly pathogenic and causes a wide range of diseases in infected animals. ALV can be divided into five subgroups (AE). The envelope glycoprotein (env gp85) is the major antigenic determinant and responsible for subgroup classification. Viral RNA from all subgroups (AE) was isolated and amplified using three sets of primers. Subsequently, restriction endonuclease analysis confirmed product identity and distinguished between subgroups. In specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs experimentally vaccinated with ALV, viral RNA has been found in allantoic fluids as well as in vaccines spiked with various subgroups of ALV. No adventitious virus was detected in commercially available preparations. This system provides a rapid and specific in vitro method for the detection of ALV RNA as a foreign substance and can be used for quality control of avian vaccines.",,"HÃ¤uptli, D.;Bruckner, L.;Ottiger, H.

These developments have enabled microbial detection and characterization directly from clinical specimens, known as metagenomic sequencing. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed on five nasal and five fecal swab pools collected respectively from two primary and two secondary market slaughterhouses and one club pig purchaser in the southeastern United States. The sequences were assembled de novo and analyzed by BLASTN to identify viruses present in the samples. 27 different viruses were identified. Readouts resembling a diverse family of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified in almost every sample (47 out of 50). Other viruses identified at all five sampling sites and in more than half of the samples were bocavirus, torovirus, posavirus, torque tenovirus, IAS virus, picobirnavirus and techovirus. Viruses identified at multiple sites in more than 20% of samples included enterovirus, parvovirus, influenza A virus, sapelovirus, and senecavirus A. Other significant swine viruses detected less frequently were porcine circovirus type 2 , Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and Porcine Deltacoronavirus.

757,Bovine rhinitis viruses are common in US cattle with bovine respiratory disease,"Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiologic agents of the bovine respiratory disease complex, however little research on their epidemiology and ecology has been published over several decades. Only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified in the US, while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) have previously only been identified in England and Japan, respectively . Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and template assemblies using reference genomes yielded nearly complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The nearly complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5' nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was developed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive specimens identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV, and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five specimens. One sample showed only infection with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies with a cell culture-adapted BRBV revealed that immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the analyzed flocks. Taken together, these results indicate that BRV infection is common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate in US cattle and show high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from different locations.",,"Hause, B.

758,Characterization of a novel bovine and porcine influenza virus: Proposal for a new genus in the family Orthomyxoviridae,"We recently reported the isolation of a novel virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), with an overall homology of 50% to human influenza C viruses (ICV) from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus revealed a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of the C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether the C/OK virus could exist in a non-porcine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in US cattle herds as shown by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these results. To determine whether porcine/bovine C/OK viruses can be reassorted with human ICV and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel Immunodiffusion (AGID) performed. In vitro resorting using two human ICV and two porcine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to resort and give rise to viable progeny to produce. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent-cleaved virions between human and non-human viruses was observed in AGID using polyclonal antibodies reactive with related antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in pigs and cattle indicates that this new virus can spread and cause infection in other mammals, including humans. © 2014 Heimat et al.",,"Hause, B. M.;Collin, E.

In addition to RdRp, searching the conserved domain database identified domains associated with picornavirus capsid proteins, but failed to identify picornavirus helicase and proteinase domains. In addition, a domain representing a family of mycoplasma and ureaplasma immunoglobulin-blocking virulence proteins was identified near the 5″ terminus.

To assess the viral ecology of wild boar in the US, metagenomic sequencing was performed on 100 pooled nasal swabs. The virome was dominated by small ssDNA viruses belonging to the families Circoviridae, Anelloviridae and Parvovirinae. Only four RNA viruses have been identified: porcine kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus, and a new orthopneumovirus, tentatively named swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared approximately 90% nucleotide identity with murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine pneumovirus. A modified, commercially available ELISA for MPV revealed that approximately 30% of sera from wild and domestic pigs were positive for antibodies cross-reactive with MPV.

Here we present the first genomic sequence of a reference strain of PCPV (VR634) together with the genomic sequence of a PPV (F00.120R) isolated from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Finland. The F00.120R and VR634 genomes are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively, with genome organization similar to that of other PPVs. The predicted proteins from F00.120R and VR634 have an average amino acid sequence identity of over 95%, while sharing only 88% and 73% amino acid identity with the ORFV and BPSV proteomes, respectively. The most notable differences were found near the ends of the genome. F00.120R is missing six and VR634 is missing three genes, seen near the right terminus of other PPVs. Four genes at the left end of F00.120R and one in the middle of both genomes appear to be fragmented paralogues of other genes within the genome. VR634 has larger than expected inverted terminal repeats, possibly as a result of genomic rearrangements. The high G+C content (64%) of these two viruses together with amino acid sequence comparisons and whole genome phylogenetic analyzes support the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the genus Parapoxvirus and provide evidence that the virus is responsible for an outbreak of contagious stomatitis in reindeer in the winter of 1999-2000 can be classified as PCPV. © 2010 SGM.",,"Hautaniemi, M.;Ueda, N.;Tuimala, J.;Mercer, A.

Cuillé and PL Chelle in 1936 successful scrapie between sheep by experimental inoculation and DC Gajdusek-Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 1966 respectively remains a mystery. In 1982, S. Prusiner named them ""PRIONs"" (for ""PROteinaceous Infectious Particles"") because they appeared to lack the nucleic acids that would classify them as viruses. Although infectious or genetic mechanisms have rarely been identified, most of the rare human PRION diseases are 'sporadic'. They shared many clinical and neuropathological features with human neurodegenerative diseases (slow development, prominent nervous system involvement, amyloid deposits, poor immune response), the mechanism of which was not usually considered to be infectious. In 1991, H. Braak showed the low spread of neuropathological tau-associated lesions along anatomical pathways in the brain of Alzheimer's disease. They appear long before the clinical signs. It is believed that the abnormally misfolded proteins characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases aggregate after initial seeding. This leads to their transmission and cell-to-cell spread via neuronal and extraneuronal pathways, the unexpected extent of which is currently being investigated. Whether the seed is contagious or not remains a matter of debate. This new paradigm for understanding their natural history and phenotypic diversity, which has already led to assessing the diagnostic value of skin biopsy, should open the door to new therapeutic approaches.",,"Hauw, J.

768,Detection of Salmonella Typhimurium microevolution during a series of egg-associated outbreaks associated with a single chicken farm,"BACKGROUND: The bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is one of the most common causes of foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks. Between 2005 and 2008, a series of S. Typhimurium outbreaks occurred in Tasmania, Australia, all of which were traced to eggs from a single chicken farm. We sequenced the genomes of 12 isolates associated with these outbreaks to study the microevolution of a pathogenic S. Typhimurium clone in a natural, spatiotemporally limited population. RESULTS: The isolates, which shared a phage type similar to DT135, known locally as 135@ or 135a, formed a clade within the S. Typhimurium population with close similarity to the reference genome SL1334 (160 single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs). Ten of the isolates belonged to a single clone (<23 SNPs between isolate pairs) that likely represents the population of S. Typhimurium circulating on the chicken farm; the other two were from sporadic cases and genetically distinct from this clone. Divergence dating showed that all 12 isolates diverged from a common ancestor in the mid-1990s and the clone began to diversify in 2003-2004. This clone entered the human population several times between 2005 and 2008, during which time it continued to accumulate SNPs at a constant rate of 3-5 SNPs per year, or 1x10-6 substitutions site-1 year-1, faster than the longer-term ( ~50 years) rates previously estimated for S. Typhimurium. Our data indicate that approximately half of the non-synonymous substitutions are rapidly removed from the S. Typhimurium population, after which purifying selection is no longer important and the remaining substitutions become fixed in the population. The S. Typhimurium 135@ isolates were almost identical to SL1344 in terms of gene content and virulence plasmids. Their phage contents were similar to SL1344 except that they carried a different variant of Gifsy-1, they lacked the P2 residue found in SL1344, and they carried a new P2 phage, P2-Hawk, instead of SL1344's P2 phage SopEphi . DT135 lacks P2 prophage. Two additional plasmids were identified in the S. Typhimurium 135® isolates, pSTM2 and pSTM7. Both plasmids were IncI1, but phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and their bacterial hosts shows that these plasmids are genetically distinct and result from independent plasmid acquisition events. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a high-resolution insight into the short-term microevolution of the important human pathogen S. Typhimurium. It shows that purifying selection occurs rapidly (<= 6 years) and then declines in this population, and provides an estimate for the short-term substitution rate. The latter is likely to be more relevant for investigating foodborne outbreaks than previous estimates based on longer time periods.",,"Hawkey, J.;Edwards, D.

769,"Diversity demonstrated in VP3, NSP3 and NSP4 of rotavirus B in Japanese cattle","Bovine rotavirus B (RVB) is an etiological agent of diarrhea, mainly in adult cattle. At present, a few viral protein (VP)1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and nonstructural protein (NSP)1, 2, and 5 sequences of bovine RVB are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases, and none of these have been identified for VP3 , NSP3 and NSP4 reported. To fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB strains, we used a metagenomic approach and sequenced and analyzed the complete coding sequences (CDS) of VP3, NSP3 and NSP4 genes, as well as the partial or complete CDS of other genes of RVBs detected in Japanese cattle. VP3, NSP3 and NSP4 from bovine RVBs shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3-64.9% for VP3, 65.9-68.2% for NSP3 and 52.6-56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine , human, and porcine RVBs, suggesting that bovine RVBs belong to a new genotype. In addition, significantly low amino acid sequence identities for NSP4 (36.1-39.3%) were observed between bovine RVBs and the RVBs of other species. In contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those of RVBs from other species and rotavirus A (RVA) strains. Phylogenetic analyzes of all gene segments showed that bovine RVB strains formed a cluster that branched away from other RVBs. These results suggest that bovine RVBs evolved independently from other RVBs, but in a manner similar to other rotaviruses. These results provide insights into the evolution and diversity of RVB strains.",,"Hayashi-Miyamoto, M.;Murakami, T.;Minami-Fukuda, F.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Kishimoto, M.;Sano, K.;Naoi, Y.;Asano, K.;Ichimaru, T.;Haga, K.;Omatsu, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Aoki, H.;Shirai, J.;Ishida, M.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.01.003,1

771,Analysis of HIV-1 subtype B third variable region peptide motifs for induction of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 primary isolates,"The HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies for T-cell lineage-adapted HIV-1, but less so for primary isolates. We hypothesized that peptides representative of the diversity of natural HIV-1 V3 loop variants could capture elements of conserved higher order structures and thus stimulate broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies. We designed a panel of 29 subtype B V3 sequences postulated to reflect the range of V3 diversity. These peptides were used to immunize guinea pigs. The most potent peptide (62.19) clustered around the B-subtype consensus sequence and induced antibodies that reproducibly neutralized 31% of the B-subtype HIV-1 primary isolates evaluated but limited cross-neutralization of non-B-subtype HIV-1 strains exhibited. Taken together, these data indicated that the narrowed neutralization profile of antibodies induced by optimal subtype B V3 motifs likely represents the maximal breadth of neutralization of subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates induced by anti-V3 peptide -antibodies can be reached. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

772,"Group A rotaviruses in Chinese bats: Genetic composition, serology, and evidence for transmission and reassortment from bats to humans","Bats are natural reservoirs for many disease-causing viruses, and increasing evidence supports the idea that bats may also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. To date, 8 RVA strains have been identified from African and Chinese bats, which possess entirely new genotype constellations or possibly genotypes derived from other mammals. However, all data were mainly based on the detection of RVA RNA, which is only present during acute infections, which does not allow an assessment of the actual exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically examine the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 anal swabs or gut samples from bats and 448 bat sera were collected from five southern Chinese provinces. Specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) screening revealed four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed an entirely new genotype constellation, while the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widespread in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence for cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, while strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for the cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans and underscore the public health implications of bats as reservoirs of RVAs. IMPORTANCE Bat viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra and Nipah viruses are major pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses that can cause gastroenteritis in humans, although 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been identified in bats to date. Another 4 RVA strains were identified in this study, one of which provides strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological studies have also shown that RVA infection in bats is far more common than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.",,"He, B.;Huang, X. H.;Zhang, F. Q.;Tan, W.

774,Characterization of a novel G3P[3] rotavirus isolated from a lesser horseshoe bat: a distant relative of feline/canine rotaviruses,"Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many human-pathogenic viruses. A viral metagenomics-based approach was used to examine gut samples from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. 74 reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription PCR screening and virus isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel strain of RVA named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3] in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Complete genomic sequence analyzes showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is similar to human and animal rotaviruses, which are thought to be they come from cats. dog origin. Phylogenetic analysis showed that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, while VP4 was most closely related to an uncommon human RVA strain, CMH222, whose animal characteristics were isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a number of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infections showed that the bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to lactating mice and caused 100% mortality when inoculated orally at a titer as low as 5 x 102 50% tissue culture infecting doses. Since this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juveniles, will be crucial to determine whether or not this virus is widespread in the bat population.",,"He, B.;Yang, F.;Yang, W.;Zhang, Y.;Feng, Y.;Zhou, J.;Xie, J.;Feng, Y.;Bao, X.;Guo, H.;Li, Y.;Xia, L.;Li, N.;Matthijnssens, J.;Zhang, H.;Tu, C.",2013.0,,10.1128/jvi.02013-13,0
775,Genome-wide mapping of hypersensitive DNase I sites and association analysis with gene expression in MSB1 cells,"DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) mark different classes of cis-regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers. MSB-1, derived from chick Marek's disease (MD) lymphoma, is an MDV-transformed CD4+ T cell line for MD studies. Previously, DNase IHS sites were mainly studied in mammalian human cell types. To capture the regulatory elements specific to MSB1 cells and to investigate the molecular mechanisms of T cell transformation induced by MDV in MD, we generated a high-quality DHS map and gene expression profile for functional analysis in the MSB1 cell line. A total of 21,724 significant peaks of DHSs were identified from around 40 million short reads. The DHS distribution varied between the chromosomes and they accumulated preferentially in the gene-rich chromosomes. More interestingly, DHS accumulation appeared to be scarce in regions with many CpG islands. Furthermore, we integrated DHSs into the gene expression data and found that DHSs tended to enrich for highly expressed genes in entire gene regions, while DHSs showed no significant changes for weakly and silently expressed genes. In addition, the correlation of DHSs with lincRNAs expression was also calculated, implying that enhancer-associated lincRNAs are likely to originate from enhancer-like regions of DHSs. Taken together, our results showed that DNase I HS sites strongly correlate with active gene expression in MSB1 cells, suggesting that DHSs can be viewed as markers to identify the cis-regulatory elements associated with chicken Marek's disease are. © 2014 Er, Carrillo, Luo, Ding, Tian and Song.",,"He, Y.;Carrillo, J.

776,Whole genome sequencing of Newcastle disease genotype VI viruses from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded feral pigeon tissue reveals continuous evolution and previously unrecognized genetic diversity in the US,"Background: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is highly contagious and causes disease in both wild birds and poultry. A pigeon-adapted variant of genotype VI NDV, often referred to as pigeon paramyxovirus 1, is commonly isolated from columbids in the United States and worldwide. Complete genomic characterization of these genotype VI viruses circulating in wild columbids in the United States is limited, and failure of rapid diagnostic detection has been reported due to the genetic variability of the virus. Therefore, in this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and characterize these circulating viruses, providing valuable genetic information. NGS allows parallel deep sequencing of multiple samples. When applied to FFPE samples, this methodology allows for retrospective studies on infectious organisms. Methods: Tissue samples from FFPE feral pigeons (kidney, liver and spleen) from 10 US deaths between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed by NGS to detect and sequence NDV genomes from randomly amplified total RNA. The results were compared to previously published immunohistochemistry (IHC) results performed on the same samples. In addition, phylogenetic analyzes of the complete and partial fusion gene and the complete genome coding sequences were performed. Results: 23 out of 29 IHC-positive FFPE pigeon samples were identified as positive for NDV by NGS. Positive samples revealed an average genome coverage of 99.6% and an average median depth of 199. A previously described subgenotype (VIa) and a new subgenotype (VIn) of NDV were identified as causative agents of 10 pigeon mortality events in the US from 2010 to 2016. The Distribution of these viruses from the North American lineages is consistent with the distribution of Eurasian collared pigeons and rock pigeons in the US FFPE wild bird samples. There are at least two distinct US lines of genotype VI NDV kept in feral pigeons that are continuously evolving independently and have no apparent epidemiological links to viruses circulating abroad. These results support the hypothesis that columbids serve as a reservoir for virulent NDV in the US",,"He, Y.;Taylor, T. L.;Dimitrov, K. M.;Butt, S. L.;Stanton, J. B.;Goraichuk, I.

777,Electrostatic variation of hemagglutinin as a hallmark of avian influenza virus evolution,"Avian influenza virus is a zoonotic agent that has a significant impact on public health and the poultry industry. Monitoring virus development and spread is critical for surveillance and tracing programs currently based on serological or DNA sequencing phylogenetic analysis. However, virus-host interactions, antigenic drift, and spread of viral clades are highly dependent on variations in the surface features of capsid proteins. We report here that in silico comparative structural analyzes of hemagglutinin can reveal relevant evolutionary fingerprints, especially when integrated with sequence-based analyses. Phylogenetic analyzes of H9 virus strains from wild birds and poultry, performed using different methods, reliably lead to clusters of viruses in five main groups. Subsequent comparison of structural features revealed congruence between such clustering and electrostatic fingerprints on the surface. These latter fingerprints relate group-specific variations in electrostatic charges and isocontours to well-known hemagglutinin sites involved in modulation of immune escape and host specificity. This work suggests that integrating structural and sequence comparisons can improve the study of trends and relevant mechanisms in viral evolution.",,"Heidari, A.;Righetto, I.;Filippini, F.",2018.0,,10.1038/s41598-018-20225-3,0

(2010) MChip, a low-density microarray, distinguishes between seasonal human H1N1, North American swine H1N1, and the 2009 pandemic H1N1. Influenza and other respiratory viruses 4(6), 411-416. Background The MChip uses data from the hybridization of amplified viral RNA to 15 different oligonucleotides targeting the influenza A matrix (M) gene segment. An artificial neural network (ANN) automates the interpretation of subtle differences in the fluorescence intensity patterns of the microarray. The complete process from clinical sample to identification, including viral RNA amplification, can be completed in less than 8 hours for less than $10. Aims The work presented here represents an attempt to extend and test the capabilities of the MChip to discriminate influenza A/H1N1 from different species. Methods The MChip ANN was trained to recognize fluorescence image patterns of a variety of known influenza A viruses, including examples of human H1N1, human H3N2, porcine H1N1, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, and a variety of avian, equine, , canine and swine flu viruses. The robustness of the MChip ANN was assessed using 296 blinded isolates. Results Training of the ANN was augmented by the addition of 71 well-characterized influenza A isolates and resulted in relatively high accuracy (low misclassification) in distinguishing distinct H1N1 strains: nine human A/H1N1 (88 9% correct), 35 human A/H3N2 (97·1% correct), 31 North American swine A/H1N1 (80·6% correct), 14 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 (87·7% correct), and 23 negative specimens (91·3% correct ). Genetic diversity among porcine H1N1 isolates may have contributed to the lower success rate for these viruses. Conclusions The current study shows that the MChip has the ability to discriminate the genetic variations between influenza viruses with appropriate ANN training. Further selective enrichment of the ANN will improve its ability to rapidly and reliably characterize influenza viruses of unknown origin. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Heil, G.

779,Molecular characterization of avian reovirus isolates in Tunisia,"Background: Genotype analyzes of avian reoviruses isolated from organ samples from chickens with suspected clinical symptoms between 1997 and 2008 were based on sequences for both ÏƒC and ÏƒB genes and were aligned with those published in Genbank, allowing studies to be conducted enabled molecular classification and relationships. methods. The full length of the known variable protein ÏƒC and part of the ÏƒB-encoding genes were amplified by RT-PCR using conserved primers. PCR products were sequenced and the sequences were analyzed and aligned with avian reovirus sequences from the Genbank database. Results: The sequences of the ÏƒC-encoding genes of all isolated strains showed their close relationship with the American, Chinese and Indian strains. Taking the American strain S1133 as a reference, the two Tunisian isolates 97.1 and 97.2 showed some nucleotide substitutions. In isolate 97.1 the substitution was silent, whereas in strain 97.2 the mutation was at the first position of the corresponding codon and induces substitution of the encoded amino acid. For the βB-encoding gene, the sequences of the Tunisian strains showed mutations at positions two or three of the corresponding codons, resulting in amino acid substitutions at these positions. The phylogenetic trees based on ÏƒC and ÏƒB encoding genes revealed a closer relationship between Tunisian, American and Taiwanese genotype I isolates. Conclusion: Our study describes the genotype of avian reoviruses, which are not yet genetically well characterized. The characterization and classification of these viruses could be important for understanding the epidemiology of malabsorption syndrome and viral arthritis and improve our knowledge of the genotype of the strains circulating in Tunisian herds. In addition, studying their variable pathogenicity could be extremely important in choosing the appropriate vaccine strain to combat the disease. © 2013 Hellal Kort et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Hellal Kort, Y.;BourogÃ¢a, H.;Gribaa, L.;Scott-Algara, D.;Ghram, A.",2013.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-10-12,0

781,Emergence of a new strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O: Its phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship with the PanAsia pandemic strain,"In India, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O has been associated with more than 75% of outbreaks. Previous studies with this serotype have shown that the viruses circulating in India belong to a single genotype. Recent (February 2001) FMD epidemics in Europe have drawn worldwide attention to the source of the virus and has been traced to a strain, PanAsia (serotype O), present in India since 1990. In this study, pertinent to further characterizing the isolates of the Pan-Asian strain, we sequenced the complete VP1-encoding (1D) gene for 71 isolates of FMDV serotype O from India recovered from field outbreaks during the past 4 decades (1962-2001). . All isolates in the tree were distributed into three main branches (designated A, B and C); branch C is further divided into four groups (I-IV), of which group IV belongs to the PanAsia tribe. In addition, we show that the PanAsia strain has been endemic in circulation since 1982 (not 1990 as previously reported) and has been the most dominant outbreak strain in recent years, spreading to at least 17 states in the country. During 2001, another new group (Group III) of viruses with a genetic divergence of 5.4-11.1% at the nucleotide level was found co-circulating endemic to the PanAsia strain and slowly replacing it. At the amino acid level, this strain differed from the PanAsia strain at five amino acid positions in VP1. Although these strains differ at the nucleotide level, they retained a good antigenic relationship with one of the country's widespread vaccine strains (IND R2/75). Given the PanAsia virus' ability to persist, spread and outperform other strains, the current trend could be a cause for serious concern as the emerging virus replaces it. If so, then there is another strain as different as PanAsia that could pose a serious threat to the global dairy and meat industry.",,"Hemadri, D.;Tosh, C.;Sanyal, A.;Venkataramanan, R.",2002.0,,10.1023/a:1020165923805,0
782,Genetic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O isolates responsible for field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999,"Partial nucleotide sequences at the 3″ end of the 1D gene (encoding VP1) from 90 foot-and-mouth disease virus type O isolates recovered from field outbreaks in India between 1993 and 1999 were determined. The sequences were compared with each other and with reference viruses. The published sequences of 15 type O isolates obtained from different parts of Asia, as well as one isolate (O1BFS) from Europe and one from Egypt (O1/Sharquia/Egypt/72) were also included in the analysis for comparison. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the viruses could be divided into four different genotypes (genotypes I-IV). All 90 isolates from India were genotype I, as were the reference isolates from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. Genotype I isolates have been further divided into 16 subgenotypes. The Indian isolates were found to be extremely heterogeneous in nature and have been classified into 12 distinct genetic groups. In genotype I, the nucleotide sequence difference observed between isolates ranged from 0-11.6%, while in Indian isolates it ranged from 0-8.8%. Viruses of similar genetic groups are circulating in India, Bangladesh and Middle Eastern countries. Genotype-II and -III are represented by isolates from Lebanon (O1/Southern Lebanon) and Europe (O1-BFS), respectively. Genotype IV is made up of isolates from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The present study shows the emergence of viruses belonging to multiple genetic groups over a short period of time and the persistence of a single genetic group in the same geographic area over several years.

785,Human biliary glycoproteins act as receptors for interspecies transmission of mouse hepatitis virus,"variant of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), designated MHV-H2, was isolated by serial passage in mixed cultures of permissive DBT cells and non-permissive Syrian hamster kidney (BHK) cells. MHV-H2 efficiently replicated in hamster, mouse, primate kidney (Vero, Cos 1, Cos 7) and human adenocarcinoma (HRT) cell lines, but failed to replicate in testis (ST), feline kidney (CRFK) and canine kidney (MDCK) -cells. To understand the molecular basis for cross-species coronavirus transmission into human cell lines, the replication of MHV-H2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells expressing high levels of the human homologue of the normal murine receptor, biliary glycoprotein (Bgp), was investigated. . MHV-H2 replicated efficiently in human HepG2 cells, at low levels in breast cancer cells (MCF7) and poorly, if at all, in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (LS 174T) expressing high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These data suggested that MHV-H2 might use the human Bgp homologue as a receptor for entry into HepG2 cells. To further investigate the utilization of the MHV H2 receptor in human cell lines, blockade experiments were performed with a variety of monoclonal or polyclonal antisera directed against the human CEA genes. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antiserum directed against all members of the CEA family or with a monoclonal antibody, Kat4c (cd66abde), directed against Bgp1, CGM6, CGM1a, NCA and CEA reduces viral replication and the capacity of MHV-H2 to significantly infect HepG2 cells. Using a different panel of monoclonal antibodies with more limited cross-reactivities between the human CEAs, Col-4 and Col-14 but not B6.2, B1.13, Col-1, Col-6 and Col-12 blocked MHV-H2 Infection HepG2 cells. These antibodies did not block Sindbis virus (SB) replication in HepG2 cells and did not block SB, MHV-A59, or MHV-H2 replication in DBT cells. The monoclonal antibodies Col-4, Col-14 and Kat4c (cd66abde) all reacted strongly with human Bgp and CEA, but showed variable binding patterns with other CEA genes. Upon expression of human Bgp in normally non-permissive porcine testicular (ST) and feline kidney (CRFK) cells, the cells became susceptible to MHV-H2 infection. These data suggested that phylogenetic homologues of viral receptors represent natural channels for viral xenotropism and interspecies transmission.",,"Hensley, L. E.;Baric, R. S.",1998.0,,,0

We identified several well-represented putative eukaryotic circular single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among these, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a virus previously reported from a hyperthermal lake that exhibits characteristics of both single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single-stranded DNA viruses . We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to study the prevalence and viral load of both positive and negative strains of Daphnia mendotae-associated (Cladocera) hybrid virus (DMClaHV) over a summer season in Oneida and Cayuga Lakes. DMClaHV had a high prevalence within Daphnia populations where viral loads and the proportion of virus-positive individuals were higher prior to host population decline. The DMClaHV viral load was different between two species of daphnia (D. mendotae and D. retrocurva), and the dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We have detected DMClaHV in eggs (Ephippia) collected from sediments of Lake Oneida with an estimated age of 30 years. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm diameter) virus-like particles in daphnia that were distant from gut tissue and not associated with intracellular parasites.

The 3' untranslated region (UTR) and partial S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the 17 IB virus strains were determined and their identities compared to those of the relative reference strains to confirm the classifications generated using HRM curve analysis. Results: Of the 12 IB field viruses classified as subgroup 1, 2, or 3 by HRM curve analysis, the 3'UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences had ≥ 99% identities with the reference strain of each subgroup. Analysis of the 3'UTR and S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the five IB virus strains that could not be classified indicated that four belonged to one of the subgroups and one was a potential recombinant strain (between the 2nd and 3rd subgroup strains). and 3). A new recombinant strain was also discovered. Conclusion: HRM curve analysis can rapidly assign the majority of IB viruses present in field submissions to known subgroups. Importantly, the HRM curve analysis also identified aberrant genotypes that require further investigation. © 2010 The Authors.

788,Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus: sequence analysis of the small RNA segments from a collection of viruses worldwide,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFv) is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. It has a tripartite, negative-polarity, single-stranded RNA genome composed of large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. CCHF virus is enzootic in livestock and wildlife in many parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and is also recognized in south-eastern Europe. Serious illnesses, which manifest themselves as hemorrhagic fever and high mortality rates (up to 50%), are only known in humans. We have determined the complete sequence of the small genomic RNA segment of several strains of CCHF virus from outbreaks in Pakistan in 2000, Baghdad in 1976 and Uzbekistan in 1967 that they can be divided into seven subtypes. Superimposed on this pattern are connections between distant geographic locations, suggesting the existence of a global reservoir of CCHFv. In some cases, these links can result from livestock trade and long-distance transmission of viruses or infected ticks during bird migration. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Hewson, R.;Chamberlain, J.;Mioulet, V.;Lloyd, G.;Jamil, B.;Hasan, R.;Gmyl, A.;Gmyl, L.;Smirnova, S.

790,Coat protein gene sequences of five strains of peanut streak virus (PStV) from Thailand and their evolutionary relationship to other sequences of bean common mosaic virus,"The coat protein gene and part of the 3' non-coding region of five strains of peanut streak virus (PStV) from Thailand have been cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic comparisons of these strains known as T1, T3, T5, T6 and T7 and related sequences indicated that these strains are indeed PStV strains. In addition, PStV strains appear to be related to each other in terms of geographic origin. That is, the Thai strains are more closely related to each other than to strains from the US or Indonesia, despite the variety of symptoms caused by these strains and the overlap of symptom types between strains from different locations. Like other PStV strains, PStV-Thai can be considered a strain of Bean Common Mosaic Virus (BCMV), but can be distinguished from bean-infecting BCMV and Blackeye Cowpea Mosaic Virus (B1CMV) strains by sequence and host range. No evidence was found that PStV Thai strains, in contrast to PStV-Ib, are recombinants of PStV and B1CMV, although the T3 strain could be a recombinant of different PStV sequences. Phylogenetic analyzes of BCMV group viruses suggest that acquisition of the ability to infect peanuts may have occurred only once.",,"Higgins, C. M.;Cassidy, B. G.;Teycheney, P.

791,High-Throughput Sequencing Methods for Microbiome Profiling: Application to Food Animal Systems Review,"Analysis of microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing methods began in the mid-2000s, enabling the production of 1000 to 10,000 sequence reads per sample and megabases of data per sequence run. This depth of sequencing, unprecedented at the time, enabled the discovery of the “rare biosphere” in environmental samples for the first time. The technology was quickly applied to studies involving multiple human subjects. Perhaps these early studies served as a reminder that while the microbes inhabiting mammals are known to outnumber host cells by an order of magnitude or more, most of them are unknown members of our second genome, or microbiome (as suggested by Joshua Lederberg embossed). because of our inability to cultivate them. High-throughput microbial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing methods have now begun to reveal the composition and identity of archaeal, bacterial, and viral communities at many sites in and on the human body. Surveys of the microbiota of food producing animals have been published in recent years, and future studies should benefit from protocols and tools developed from large-scale studies of the human microbiome. Nevertheless, production animal-related resources such as improved host genome assemblies and an increased number and diversity of host-specific microbial reference genome sequences are needed to enable meaningful and robust analysis of 16S rDNA and WGS sequence data.",,"Highlander, S.

792,Influenza transmission reflects the seasonality of wild birds in the annual cycle,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) in nature have to overcome changing transmission barriers caused by the mobility of their main host, migratory wild birds, which change in the annual cycle. Using a phylogenetic network of viral sequences from North American wild birds (2008-2011), we demonstrate a shift from intraspecific to interspecific transmission that, along with rearrangement, allows IAV to achieve viral flux across consecutive seasons from summer to winter. Our study supports amplification of IAV during summer breeding seeded by overwintering viruses that persist locally and viruses introduced from a variety of latitudes. As birds migrate from breeding sites to lower latitudes, they become involved in transmission networks with greater connectivity to other bird species, with transmission of reassortant viruses between species peaking in winter. We propose that switching transmission dynamics could be a crucial strategy for pathogens infecting mobile hosts inhabiting regions with strong seasonality.",,"Hill, N. J.;Ma, E. J.;Meixell, B.

793,Microbial ecology along the gastrointestinal tract,"The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract ecosystem goes through a range of environmental, chemical and physical conditions as it runs from the oral cavity to the anus. These differences in conditions along with food or other ingested substrates affect the composition and density of the microbiota, as well as their functional roles, selecting those best suited to that environment. Previous studies have primarily focused on bacteria, with the number of studies on Archaea, Eukarya, and Viruses being limited despite their important roles in this ecosystem. Furthermore, due to the challenges associated with sampling directly from inside humans, many studies are still exploratory and mainly focus on the composition of microbiomes. Therefore, mechanistic studies to investigate functions in animal models are performed. However, differences in physiology and microbiomes need to be elucidated to support the translation of animal model findings into the human context. This review will highlight bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, discuss differences along the gastrointestinal tract of healthy humans, and make comparisons with three common animal models: rats, mice, and pigs.",,"Hillman, E.

794,"TTV, a novel human virus with a single-stranded circular DNA genome","The TT virus (TTV) was found in a hepatitis patient without virus markers in 1997. However, the actual impact of TTV on liver disease is uncertain to this day. Due to the lack of appropriate cellular systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still unclear. This overview attempts to summarize the current status of TTV on aspects other than taxonomic diversity of TTV. TTV was the first human virus with a single-stranded circular DNA genome. TTV has been considered a member of the Circoviridae, but others have suggested that it belongs to a new family. TTV differs from ambisense viruses of the genus circovirus in that the former genome is negative stranded. The genome structure of TTV is more closely related to chicken anemia virus of the genus Gyrovirus, however the sequence similarity is minimal, except for a short stretch at 3816-3851 of TA278. Currently, the working group proposes the full name for TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and the TTV-like minivirus as TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new genus Anellovirus (ring). TTVs are widespread in nonhuman primates and human TTV can cross-infect chimpanzees. Furthermore, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cows and sheep. TTV can be transmitted through mother-to-child infection. However, within one year after birth, the prevalence reaches the same level for children born to both TTV-positive and TTV-negative mothers, even without breastfeeding. The non-coding region surrounding a short 113 nt GC-rich stretch and occupying about one-third of the genome is thought to contain the putative origin of replication. Three mRNAs are expressed by TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb species. A protein translated from the 3.0 kb mRNA is considered to be the main capsid protein as well as a replicase. The nature of the proteins translated from the other two mRNAs is still conjectural. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons,Ltd.",,"Hino, S.",2002.0,,10.1002/rmv.351,0
795,Torque Teno Virus (TTV): Current Status,"Torque tenovirus (TTV), currently classified in the Circoviridae family, genus Anellovirus, has been identified for the first time in a patient with non-AE hepatitis. TTV has a single-stranded circular DNA of ∼3.8 kb. TTVs are extremely diverse, encompassing five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. The torque teno minivirus (TTMV) with a ∆2.9 kb genome also has broad variants. Two related 2.2 and 2.6 kb species recently joined this community. Recombinations between variants are common. This extensive TTV variety remains unexplained; It is unclear how TTVs could be viable and why they require such genetic variation. A clear culture system is not yet available. TTVs are ubiquitous in >90% of adults worldwide, but the human pathogenicity of TTV has not been fully established. Epidemiological studies must specify the variants being studied, clinical targets, and calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include higher viral loads in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and lupus. Active replication has also been found in infants with acute respiratory disease. TTV/TTMV-related viruses have been found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, as well as in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three types of mRNAs, 3.0-, 1.2- and 1.0-kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs have been detected in chicken anemia virus. The genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV appears to have at least three proteins; However, the precise functions of these proteins await further research.

796,Relationship of torque teno virus to chicken anemia virus,"This chapter examines the correlation between torque teno virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with each of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. This structure differs from that of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36 nt stretch near the origin of replication of TA278-TTV has more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions shows no significant similarity. Nonetheless, the relative assignment of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimic each other. In both, three or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are generated by transcription. The structural protein with the replicase domain is encoded by frame 1 in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is encoded by frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is required for CAV replication. It has been suggested that TTV forms a new family, Anelloviridae. Given these similarities and differences between CAV and TTV, it seems more reasonable to place CAV, the sole member of the genus Gyrovirus, together with TTV in Anelloviridae or in a new independent family. © 2009 Springers.",,"Hino, S.;Prasetyo, A.

797,Conservation of L and 3C proteinase activities in distantly related aphtoviruses,"The leader (L) proteinase of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) is an important virulence determinant in FMD infection. It has two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) induction of cleavage of the translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits Cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the aphthovirus genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but this shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aphthovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using in vitro transcription and translation analysis, we have shown that both ERAV and ERBV-L proteins have C-terminal processing activity. Furthermore, expression of ERAV-L, but not ERBV-L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in efficient inhibition of Cap-dependent translation in these cells. We have shown that the EBAV and FMDV-L proteinases induce eIF4GI cleavage at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and in turn produces distinct products that co-migrate with those induced by FMDV 3C. ERBV L-proteinase does not induce eIF4GI cleavage, consistent with its inability to turn off Cap-dependent translation. We have also shown that another unique feature of FMDV L, stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by ERAV L proteinase but not by ERBV L. The functional preservation of the divergent ERAV and FMDV proteinases suggests the likelihood of a similar and important role for these enzymes in the pathogenesis of infections caused by these distantly related aphtoviruses.",,"Hinton, T.

798,"Epidemiology of vampire bat-borne rabies virus in Goias, central Brazil: reassessment based on the GL intergenic region","BACKGROUND: Rabies associated with vampire bats harms both the livestock industry and the public health sector in central Brazil. The geographic ranges of vampire bat-borne variants of the rabies virus are limited by mountain ranges. These findings were elucidated by analyzing a highly conserved nucleoprotein gene. This study aims to elucidate the detailed epidemiological features of vampire bat-borne rabies virus by phylogenetic methods based on the 619-nt sequence including the non-conserved GL intergenic region. RESULTS: The rabies virus isolates transmitted by vampire bats classified into 8 phylogenetic lineages in the previous nucleoprotein gene analysis were classified into 10 phylogenetic lineages with significant bootstrap values. The distribution of most variants was again confirmed as limited by mountain ranges. In addition, variants in undulating areas have narrow distributions and are apparently separated by ridges. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the 619 nt sequence including the GL intergenic region is more useful for a state-level phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus than the partial nucleoprotein gene, and at the same time that the distribution of vampire bat-transmitted RABV variants tends to be separated not only by mountain ranges but also by ridges, suggesting that the diversity of RABV variants transmitted by vampire bats was limited by geographic waves.",,"Hirano, S.;Itou, T.;Carvalho, A.

800,"Phylogeny and natural history of the primate lentiviruses, SIV and HIV","Studies of the phylogeny of primate lentivirus over the past decade have identified at least five related but genetically distinct groups of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), each derived from a different African primate species. The hypothesis that HIV-2 (and SIVmac) arose from cross-species transmission of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) was strengthened by a more detailed characterization of the SIVsm/SIVmac/HIV-2 virus group. SIV from all four African green monkey (SIVagm) subspecies were characterized with an apparent chimeric genome structure of West African green monkey SIVagm. Although these naturally infected primates remain healthy, cross-species transmission to other primate species can lead to immunodeficiency, such as that caused by SIVsm infection of macaques (Macaca sp.) and recently by SIVagm infection of pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina). .

The only exception to this statement was a moderate destruction of the 1233 inhibitor in protein by the Newcastle disease virus.

After that, many transmission experiments were conducted, leading to the establishment of the basic concept of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The infectious agent was supposed to be a novel virus, so TSE was classified as a slow viral infection. In 1982, Prusiner studied the infectious fraction of scrapie-infected brain homogenate, defined the infectious agent as proteinaceous infectious particles that resist inactivation by methods that modify nucleic acids, and renamed the prion after virion in viral infections.",,"Hizume, M.;Mizusawa, H.",2007.0,,,0

Here we report that feline aminopeptidase N (APN), a cell surface metalloprotease on intestinal, lung, and renal epithelial cells, is a receptor for type II FIPV but not for type I FIPV. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) RG-4, which blocks infection of Felis catus (fcwf-4) fetal whole cells by type II FIPV, was obtained by immunizing mice with fcwf-4 cells, which are highly susceptible to FIPV . This MAb also blocked infection of fcwf-4 cells by feline enteric coronavirus type II (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). On the other hand, it did not block infection by type I FIPVs. MAb RG-4 recognized a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 120-130 kDa in feline intestinal brush border membrane (BBM) proteins. The polypeptide possessed aminopeptidase activity and the first 15 N-terminal amino acid sequences were identical to those of feline APN.

When the polypeptide specificity recognized by these monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was examined by Western immunoblotting, all of the MAbs reacted with the peplomer glycoprotein (S) of the virus. It was determined by a competitive binding assay that these MAbs recognize at least 3 different epitopes. The reactivity of these MAbs with 6 viruses identified as FIPV type I (UCD-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, NW-1 and Black), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) type II, strain 79-1683 , canine coronavirus (CCV) strain 1-71 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains TO-163 and SH were examined by neutralization tests. All MAbs neutralized FECV strain 79-1683, CCV strain 1-71 and TGEV strains TO-163 and SH, while not neutralizing the 6 FIPV type I viruses. In addition, the MAb against TGEV strain TO-163, which has potent neutralizing activity against 7 TGEV viruses, neutralized CCV strain 1-71, FECV strain 79-1683 and FIPv strain 79-1146, however, did not neutralize the 6 FIPV type I viruses. These results indicated that at least 3 epitopes are involved in the neutralization of FIPV type II strain 79-1146 and that these epitopes are not present in FIPV type I viruses but are present in FECV strain 79-1683 who does not induce feline infection peritonitis, TGEV strains TO-163 and SH and CCV strain 1-71.

Gross pathologic lesions were absent or inconsistent in most cases, but severe and consistent microscopic lesions were found in the brain and spinal cord, characterized by nonsuppurative panencephalomyelitis. Several virus isolates were obtained in embryonated duck eggs and in cell cultures (Vero and DF-1) inoculated with brain homogenates of affected ducks. After exclusion of other viruses, isolates were identified as flavivirus by flavivirus-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation of 2-week-old pekin ducks with a flavivirus isolate resulted in typical clinical symptoms and histological lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The inoculated virus was detected by RT-PCR from organ samples from ducks with clinical signs and histological lesions. The disease was also observed in commingled contact control birds with a delay of a few days. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5 and E gene sequences proved that the isolates were representatives of a new phylogenetic group within clade XI (Ntaya virus group) of the Flavivirus genus. This Malaysian duck tembusu virus (DTMUV), named Perak virus, shares moderate genomic RNA sequence similarity with a related DTMUV identified in China.

810,The high genetic variation of viruses of the genus Nairovirus reflects the diversity of their predominant tick hosts,"The genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae) contains seven serogroups consisting of 34 mostly tick-borne viruses, including several associated with serious diseases in humans and livestock [e.g. B. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) or Nairobi sheep disease (NSD). No comparative genetic studies or molecular detection tests for this virus genus were developed prior to this report. To characterize at least one representative from each of the seven serogroups, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers were designed that target the L-polymerase coding region of the RNA genome of these viruses based on conserved ones Amino acid motifs present in the predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis showed that the nairoviruses are a very diverse group, showing up to 39.4% and 46.0% nucleotide and amino acid identity differences, respectively. Viral genetic relationships correlated well with serological groupings and with tick host associations. The hosts of these viruses include both hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) ticks. Virus phylogenetic analysis reveals two major monophyletic groups: hard tick and soft tick vector viruses. In addition, viruses transmitted by ticks of the Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas genera also form three separate monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between tick and nairovirus phylogenies are consistent with a possible coevolution of the viruses and their tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data locating the divergence between hard and soft ticks between 120 and 92 million years ago point to an ancient origin for viruses of the genus Nairovirus. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

811,"Rapid detection, characterization and enumeration of foodborne pathogens","As food safety management evolves, microbiological testing will continue to play an important role in assessing whether food safety goals are being met. However, traditional microbiological culture-based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. This paper discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, research needs and future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that have led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and changing food testing practices. Rapid methods encompass many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instrumentation. The use of non-invasive sampling techniques in live animals came into focus particularly with the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the 1990s, which has been linked to the outbreak of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Serology remains an important tool to prevent foodborne pathogens from entering the human food supply via animal meat and milk. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is for the rapid screening of large numbers of samples, most of which are likely to test negative, resulting in faster product release for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, in which a primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common rapid testing approach. Recent reports show that it is possible to both enrich and enumerate a sample by pathogen-specific real-time PCR if the enrichment time is short. This can be particularly useful in situations where food manufacturers ask about the level of pathogens in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where miniaturization and multiple testing are the main drivers, meaning that not only is one instrument flexible enough to test for many pathogens, but many pathogens can also be detected with one test. The review is mainly based on the author's scientific work which has contributed with the following new developments in this field: (i) serological tests for large-scale screening, surveillance or eradication programmes, (ii) same-day detection of Salmonella which would otherwise be classified as difficult to achieve, (iii) pathogen counting after a short log-phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biotracing of pathogens based on mathematical modelling, even without an isolate. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad perspective of global health, international food supply and improving quantitative microbial risk assessment. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture-independent metagenomic detection, online monitoring, and a global validation infrastructure was emphasized.

However, scrapie strains can be distinguished to some extent by biological properties, such as transmissibility to experimental animals and the distribution of neuropathological lesions, and by biochemical properties, such as molecular mass and relative protease resistance of the disease-specific prion protein (PrPSc) isoform. . To tentatively characterize the predominant scrapie strains in Japan, we analyzed the transmissibility of ovine scrapie isolates to mice and the relative proteinase K (PK) resistance of the corresponding PrPSc. The results indicate that Japanese scrapie strains can be classified into at least three groups based on their biological and biochemical characteristics. The first group includes isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of ≥ 400 days and possess relatively high PK resistance PrPSc. The second group isolates contain PrPSc, which is highly resistant to PK digestion but is poorly transmitted to mice. The final group consists of isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of less than 300 days and are associated with PrPSc with reduced PK resistance. Sheep scrapie has occurred sporadically in Japan since 1982, with only 60 officially reported cases to date. However, the diversity of scrapie strains in the field suggested by our data raises concern that a scrapie strain similar to the parent pathogen of bovine spongiform encephalopathy might exist or emerge in Japan. Therefore, continuous surveillance for scrapie is required to prevent the further spread of scrapie not only among the sheep population but also to other species and to eliminate any potential risk of sheep scrapie to public health.",,"Horiuchi, M.;Nemoto, T.;Ishiguro, N.;Furuoka, H.;Mohri, S.;Shinagawa, M.",2002.0,,10.1128/jcm.40.9.3421-3426.2002,0
813,Rabies in Iraq: trends in human cases 2001-2010 and characterization of animal strains of rabies from Baghdad,"Rabies control requires a steady supply of reliable resources, constructive collaboration between veterinary and public health authorities, and systematic surveillance. These are challenging under any circumstances, but especially during a conflict. Here we describe available human rabies surveillance data from Iraq, animal rabies resampling results, and the first genetic characterization of circulating rabies strains from Iraq. Human rabies is notifiable, with an increase in reported cases since 2003 and a significant increase in Baghdad between 2009 and 2010. These changes coincide with an increasing number of reported dog bites. There is no laboratory confirmation of the disease or virus characterization and no systematic surveillance for rabies in animals. To address these issues, brain samples from pets in the greater Baghdad area were collected and tested for rabies. Three of 40 brain samples were positive using fluorescent antibody test and hemi-nested RT-PCR for rabies virus (RABV). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using partial nucleoprotein gene sequences derived from the samples showed that the viruses belong to a single virus variant and share a common ancestor with viruses from neighboring countries 22 (95% HPD 14-32) years ago. These include countries to the west, north and east of Iraq, some of which also have other virus variants circulating at the same time. These results suggest a possible multiple introduction of rabies into the Middle East and regular cross-border transmission of disease. Although 4000 years have passed since the rabies disease was originally described, animals and humans are still dying from this preventable and neglected zoonosis. © 2013 Horton et al.",,"Horton, D.

814,A new family of vertebrate viruses: Toroviridae,"The proposed family Toroviridae is characterized by coated, peplomer-bearing particles containing an elongated, tubular nucleocapsid with helical symmetry. The capsid can bend into an open torus, giving the virion a biconcave disc or kidney-shaped morphology (maximum diameter 120–140 nm), or the capsid can be straight, resulting in a rod-shaped particle (35 × 170 nm). Morphogenesis occurs by budding of preformed nucleocapsids through membranes mainly of the Golgi system and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The Berne virus proposed as a family prototype contains a single strand of infectious positive-sense RNA, M(r) approximately 6.5 x 106, which is polyadenylated. The RNA is surrounded by the major nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (M(r) approximately 20,000), which in turn is enveloped by a membrane containing a major protein (M(r) 22,000) and a phosphoprotein (M(r) 37,000). The approximately 20 nm long viral peplomers carry determinants for neutralization and hemagglutination; they are formed from a polydisperse N-glycosylated protein (M(r) 75,000-100,000). Four subgenomic polyadenylated RNAs with M(r)s of 3.0, 0.71, 0.46 and 0.26 x 106 were identified in infected cells. Torovirus replication is inhibited by actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin, and pre-irradiation of the host cell with UV light. All toroviruses identified to date cause enteric infections and are probably transmitted faecal-orally. Serological relationships between equine, bovine and human toroviruses have been demonstrated.",,"Horzinek, M. C.;Flewett, T. H.;Saif, L. J.",1987.0,,,0
815,Prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus in dairy herds in eastern China,"Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a worldwide pestivirus affecting cattle and other ruminants; However, there are few reports of epidemiological investigations of BVDV in east China. In this study, tank milk from 36 dairy herds in eastern China was subjected to serological testing, and 77.8% of the herds were positive for BVDV antibodies. The individual animal status in two herds was further examined by collecting blood samples, the positive ratio was 49.74% and 24.64%, and the average positive ratio of calves, heifers and lactating cows was 15.94%, 40.16 % and 41.7%, respectively. In addition, 8170 dairy cows from 36 herds were clinically examined for diarrhea syndrome, respiratory problems and reproductive disorders and the pathogens of all clinical cattle were further investigated. The results showed that BVDV was one of the main pathogens infecting animals in combination with various other viruses. Then nine BVDV strains were isolated; phylogenetic analyzes showed that the BVDV subtypes currently circulating in eastern China were BVDV 1a and BVDV 1c. In addition, of 377 cows tested, 1.86% were positive for the BVDV antigen. This study formed the basis for further studies on vaccination and control strategies of BVDV in eastern China.",,"Hou, P.;Zhao, G.;Wang, H.;He, H.",2018.0,2019-11-01 00:00:00,,0
816,Transcriptome analysis of rabbit spleen infected with porcine cholera lapin virus based on high-throughput sequencing technology,"In the current study, rabbit spleens were analyzed at 12 h, 24 h, 30 h, 36 h and 48 h after infection with swine cholera lapinvirus (C strain) using high-throughput sequencing. The rabbit genome was used as a reference to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points after infection. The top 10 DEGs were filtered by significance and we searched for their biological functions in the Uniprot and NCBI databases. The first three time points have 10 co-expressing genes, many of which are related to immunity and inflammation. The last two time points for the top 10 DEGs are identical, and B2 M, RLA-DR-ALPHA, CD74 and IGJ are involved in the antiviral immune response. The GO functional annotation showed that in biological processes at any time point except 24 hours after infection, the immune response has the most terms, followed by metabolism and regulation. According to the KEGG database, the DEGs for 24 h post-infection were enriched for the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, and the DEGs for 30 h post-infection were found to express a focal adhesion and ECM receptor interaction pathway exhibit. Furthermore, for 36 hands 48 h post-infection, the DEGs exhibit seven identical signaling pathways that are directly or indirectly related to the antiviral response. These signaling pathways included proteasome, lysosome, ribosome, chemokine signaling pathways, B-cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation pathway, and the Fc-gamma-R-mediated phagocytosis pathway C-strain infection, and provide a theoretical basis for the further understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which rabbits adapt to C strain infection.",,"Hou, Y.;Zhao, D.;Liu, G.;He, F.;Liu, B.;Fu, S.;Hao, Y.;Zhang, W.",2016.0,,,0
817,Molecular and phylogenetic analyzes of a novel amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV-1313),"Background: The amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV-A's) are naturally occurring, exogenously acquired gammaretroviruses native to wild Southern California mice. These viruses replicate in a variety of cell types, including human cells in vitro, and can cause both hematological and neurological disorders in both wild and inbred laboratory mice. Because MuLV-A's also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the coat proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and as vehicles for the transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts, including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-A's has not been established, and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains elusive. Here we present a complete genetic structure of a new amphotropic virus, designated MuLV-1313, and show that this retrovirus, along with other MuLV-A, belongs to a distinct molecular, biological, and phylogenetic class among MuLV strains, composed of a large Number of laboratory inbred or feral mice isolated. Results: The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to that of previously isolated MuLV-A, except that this virus replicates efficiently in both mammalian and chick cells. Compared to ENV proteins of other MuLV-A's (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 shows differences in its signal peptides and the proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein is entirely independent of those present in a wide range of murine retroviruses isolated from various inbred and wild mice worldwide. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome by dot plot analysis, comparing each nucleotide of one genome to the corresponding nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus is more closely related to the , with the exception of the env gene biologically distinct Ecotropic wild mouse retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from a different region of Southern California than any of the 15 MuLV strains whose full-length sequences are present in GenBank. This finding was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and hierarchical grouping of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313, which also placed all MULV-A in a genetically distinct category within the large family of retroviruses isolated from numerous mouse strains worldwide. Likewise, the construction of separate dendrograms for each of the Gag, Pol, and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 showed that the amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains. Conclusion: The molecular, biological, and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses including MuLV-1313 are distinct from a large family of exogenously or endogenously transmitted ecotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MuLV strains of laboratory and wild mice. Furthermore, both the naturally occurring amphotropic retrovirus and a biologically distinct ecotropic retrovirus of wild mice of southern California are more closely related on the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This is the first report of a full genome analysis of a unique group of phylogenetically distinct amphotropic viruses. © 2006 Howard et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Howard, T.

819,Detection of various novel astroviruses in small mammals in China,"Astroviruses infect humans and many animal species, causing gastroenteritis. To fully understand the distribution and genetic diversity of astroviruses in small mammals, we tested 968 anal swabs from 39 animal species, most of which were bats and rodents. We have detected various astroviruses in 10 bat species, including known bat astroviruses and a large number of novel viruses. Meanwhile, new groups of astroviruses have been identified in three wild rodent species, and a remarkably high genetic diversity of astroviruses has been discovered in Eothenomys cachinus. We have detected astroviruses in captive bred porcupines and a nearly complete genome sequence has been determined for one strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the full ORF2 sequence suggested that this strain may share a common ancestor with porcine astrovirus type 2. In addition, to our knowledge, this study reports the first detection of astroviruses in shrews and pikas. Our results provide new insights into understanding these small mammals as natural reservoirs of astroviruses.",,"Hu, B.;Chmura, A. A.;Li, J. L.;Zhu, G. J.;Desmond, J. S.;Zhang, Y.

820,Monitoring of avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in a commercial breeding farm in China and characterization of class I NDV isolates,"To determine the true prevalence of avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in ducks in Shandong Province, China, extensive surveillance studies were conducted in breeding ducks from an intensive farm from July 2007 to September 2008. Cloacal and tracheal swabs were taken monthly from 30 randomly selected birds that appeared healthy. All swabs were negative for influenza A virus recovery, while 87.5% of tracheal swabs and 100% of cloacal swabs collected in September 2007 were positive for Newcastle disease virus isolation. Several NDV isolates were obtained from tracheal and cloacal swabs from apparently healthy ducks. All isolates were apathogenic according to MDT and ICPI. The HN gene and the variable region of the F gene (nt 47-420) from four randomly selected isolates were sequenced. A 374 bp region of the F gene and the full length HN gene were used for phylogenetic analysis. Four isolates were identified as the same isolate based on 99.2-100% nucleotide sequence identities, indicating a closer phylogenetic relationship to lentogenic class I viruses. There were 1.9-9.9% nucleotide differences between the isolates and other class I viruses in the variable region of the F gene (nt 47-420), whereas there were 38.5-41.2% nucleotide differences between the isolates and class II viruses. The amino acid sequences of the F protein cleavage sites in these isolates were 112-ERQERL-117. The full length HN gene of these isolates was 1851 bp and encoded 585 amino acids. The homology analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the HN gene showed that there were 2.0-4.2% nucleotide differences between the isolates and other class I viruses, whereas there were 29.5-40.9% differences between the isolates and class I viruses. II viruses existed. The results indicate that these isolates are phylogenetically unrelated to the vaccine strain (LaSota).

821,Genetic diversity and positive selection analysis of the envelope protein gene E2 of classical swine fever virus in eastern China under C-strain vaccination,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes an economically important and highly contagious disease in swine worldwide. Vaccination against strain C is one of the most effective ways to control this disease. Since 2014, there have been sporadic outbreaks of CSF in some C-strain vaccinated provinces in China. To decipher the disease etiology, 25 CSFV E2 genes from 169 clinical specimens were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 25 isolates belonged to subgenotype 2.1. Twenty-three of the 25 isolates were clustered into a newly defined subgenotype, 2.1d, and shared some consistent molecular characteristics. To determine whether the entire E2 gene was under positive selection pressure, we used site-by-site analysis to identify specific codons that underwent evolutionary selection and found seven positively selected codons. Three positively selected sites (amino acids 17, 34 and 72) were identified in the antigenicity-relevant domains B/C of the amino-terminal half of the E2 protein. In addition, another positively selected site (amino acid 200) showed a polarity change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which may alter CSFV antigenicity and virulence. The results show that the circulating CSFV strains in Shandong province were mainly clustered in subgenotype 2.1d. Furthermore, identifying these positively selected sites could help unveil molecular determinants of virulence or pathogenesis and clarify the driving force of CSFV evolution in eastern China.",,"Hu, D.;Lv, L.;Gu, J.;Chen, T.;Xiao, Y.;Liu, S.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00085,0

823,Deep sequencing of the mouse lung transcriptome reveals a distinct long non-coding RNA expression associated with the high virulence of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in mice,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play several key regulatory roles in various biological processes. However, their role in the pathogenicity of influenza A virus (IAV) remains largely unexplored. Here, using next-generation sequencing, we systemically compared the response of the mouse lung whole transcriptome compared to either the highly pathogenic (A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010, CK10) or the nonpathogenic (A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403 / 2010, GS10) H5N1 virus. A total of 126 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) lncRNAs from three replicates were identified as being associated with high virulence of CK10, while 94 SDE lncRNAs were related to GS10. Functional category analysis indicated that the CK10-regulated SDE-lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs were highly associated with aberrant and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Further analysis of the canonical pathway also confirmed that these targets for inflammatory signaling pathways were highly enriched. In addition, 9 lncRNAs and 17 lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs associated with a large number of target genes were successfully verified by qRT-PCR. A targeted lncRNA (NONMMUT011061) that was clearly activated and correlated with a large number of mRNAs was selected for further in-depth analysis, including prediction of transcription factors, potentially interacting proteins, genomic localization, encoding ability, and secondary structure construction. More importantly, NONMMUT011061 was also markedly stimulated during highly pathogenic H5N8 virus infection in mice, suggesting a possible universal role of NONMMUT011061 in the pathogenesis of various H5 IAVs. Taken together, these results provide a subset of lncRNAs that may play an important role in influenza virus pathogenesis, and add the lncRNAs to the vast repertoire of host factors used by IAV for infection and persistence.",,"Hu, J.;Hu, Z.;Wang, X.;Gu, M.;Gao, Z.;Liang, Y.;Ma, C.;Liu, X.;Hu, S.;Chen, S.;Peng, D.;Jiao, X.;Liu, X.",2018.0,,,0

The complete genome of the DHBV strain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into a T-vector and sequenced. The results showed that the natural infection rate of DHBV in Hubei was 10%. The DHBV genome isolated by PCR (GenBank accession number DQ276978) had 3024 nucleotides with three overlapping reading frames encoding the surface, core and polymerase proteins, respectively. The comparison of the genome sequences of this strain with those of 17 DHBV strains from the GenBank showed an identity of 89.3% to 93.5% at the nucleotide level. The amino acid sequences of S protein, core protein and functional domain of Pol protein were highly reserved among all these DHBV strains. This Hubei strain was found to share more characteristic amino acids in the polymerase genes with the ""Chinese"" DHBV strains than with those of the ""Western"" country strains. This finding was also confirmed by a pedigree analysis. Therefore, this Hubei DHBV strain should be classified as a subtype of the Chinese strains.",,"Hu, Q.;Lei, Y. C.;Zhang, Z. Z.;Tian, Y.

825,Computational study of the interdependence between hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,"Influenza type A viruses are divided into subtypes based on their two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein facilitates viral attachment and entry into a host cell, and the NA protein aids in the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from pig H1N1 early strains of the 2009 pandemic preferentially binds to human-type receptors, with weak binding to avian-type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in Texas, USA in December 2013, prompting us to investigate the changes in genetic traits that might contribute to the increased virulence of the virus. Our time-series analysis of the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA-binding preference of this virus in the US, Europe and Asia is the trait of the swine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, it is a trait of seasonal human H1N1 and its binding avidity for avian-type receptors were both steadily increasing and had significant increases in 2013, with American strains showing the largest increases. The first change could improve virus transmission and replication in humans, and the second could increase their ability to cause infection deep in the lungs, which could be responsible for recent human deaths in Texas. Given the co-adaptation of HA and NA and evolutionary interactions, we also examined the NA activity of this virus to elucidate the functional balance between HA and NA during virus evolution. Finally, we identified amino acid substitutions in the virus HA and NA that were critical to the observed evolution.",,"Hu, W.",2015.0,,10.1109/tnb.2015.2406992,0

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the pathogen is key to adequately responding to suspected outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: We report a case that highlights the potential of semiconductor sequencing for the rapid determination of the novel viral genome sequences. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a method for rapid de novo assembly of the novel influenza A H7N9 virus genome directly from a patient's tracheal aspirate using a solid-state sequencer without culture and prior sequence information. In addition, characteristic amino acids were analyzed and phylogenetic analyzes were performed for key influenza A virus genes. RESULTS: Deep sequencing revealed 435,239 reads associated with H7N9 virus with an average length of 172 bp, representing 18.6% of all reads (2,339,680). The complete genome of the virus was obtained within 2 days by the de novo assembly method. The genomic average depth of coverage of the Ion Torrent PGM was up to 5679x. Selected characteristic amino acids were observed, and phylogenetic analyzes showed that the new H7 virus was genetically close to the 2011 Zhejiang duck H7N3 viruses. The new N9 sequences were most closely related to gene sequences of N9 derived from duck H11N9 in 2011 in Jiangxi and H2N9 sequences from Hong Kong in 2010 in China and therefore they may have a common ancestor.

828,Different microRNA alterations contribute to different outcomes after EV71 and CA16 infections: Insights from high-throughput sequencing in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses share genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses show some discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of rhesus monkeys infected with EV71 and CA16 at different time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs showed significant differences and 32 important miRNAs among them for target prediction showed opposite trends in the EV71 and CA16 infected samples. GO and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 signaling pathways. Subsequently, regulatory networks of miRNA transcription factors, miRNA-predicted targets, miRNA GOs, and miRNA pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Finally, we analyzed hierarchical GO categories of predicted targets involved in immune system processes, indicating that innate and adaptive immunity may be remarkably different after EV71 and CA16 infections. In summary, this report is the first to describe miRNA expression profiles in PBMCs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our results could provide a valuable basis for further studies on the regulatory role of miRNAs in the context of the different immune responses induced by EV71 and CA16 infections.",,"Hu, Y.;Song, J.;Liu, L.;Li, J.;Tang, B.;Wang, J.;Zhang, X.;Zhang, Y.;Wang, L.;Liao, Y.;He, Z.;Li, Q.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.biocel.2016.10.011,0
829,Comparative analysis of microRNAs in response to EV71 and CA16 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells by high-throughput sequencing to reveal different mechanisms of infection,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), mainly caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) infections, which presented significantly different clinical manifestations. However, the factors underlying these differences remain unclear. Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. Here we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 154 known and 47 new miRNAs showed notable differences in expression. Of these, 65 miRNAs, including 58 known and 7 novel miRNAs, showed opposite trends in EV71- and CA16-infected samples. We then focused primarily on the 56 known differentially expressed miRNAs by further examining them for target prediction. GO and pathway analysis of these targets showed that 18 biological processes, 7 molecular functions, 1 cellular component and 123 pathways were enriched. Among these signaling pathways, cadherin signaling, Wnt signaling and angiogenesis showed significant changes. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, signaling pathways, and transcription factors have been determined, suggesting that miRNAs exhibit intricate regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Consequently, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in adhesion. The results indicated that the differential changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection might be partially related to airway epithelial barrier function. Taken together, our data provide useful insights that help elucidate the various host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and may provide new therapeutic targets for these infections.",,"Hu, Y.;Song, J.;Liu, L.;Li, J.;Tang, B.;Zhang, Y.;Wang, J.;Wang, L.;Fan, S.;Feng, M.;Li, Q.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.024,0

The result showed that the expression levels of 214 types of microRNAs (miRNAs) were significantly different in PEDV-infected cells compared to normal PK-15 cells. Among them, 175 types of miRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 39 types of miRNAs were significantly downregulated. In addition, the qPCR results of miRNA expression trends were similar to those of Solexa sequencing. Heat map cluster analysis showed that the vast majority of viral groups were differentially expressed in miRNA compared to the control group. Go analysis showed that miRNAs are extensively involved in combining, binding of proteins, protein kinase activity, transfer enzyme activity, transfer of phosphorus-containing radicals, phosphotransferase enzyme activity and other biological effects. RT-qPCR expression trends verified by miRNA were consistent with high-throughput sequencing results. The results showed that swine epidemic virus infection had a significant impact on the level of miRNA expression in PK-15 cells, which provided a new idea for further study of miRNA preparation for treatment of PEDV.",,"Huang, J.;Lang, Q.;Li, X.;Xu, Z.;Zhu, L.;Zhou, Y.",2016.0,,,0
832,Pseudorabies viral replication is inhibited by a new target of miR-21,"Pseudorabiesvirus (PRV) is a porcine virus classified as a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of Herpesviridae. Recent studies have confirmed that viruses regulate gene expression in host cells. Commonly affected genes include oxidative stress response genes, genes involved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling, and interferon- and interleukin-related genes. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of host genes after PRV infection is still unclear. In this study, we used miRNA microarray approaches to assess miRNA expression in the PRV-infected porcine kidney-15 cell line (PK-15) and observed that miR-21 was expressed 12 h after infecting the cells with PRV was expressed at high levels. In addition, we identified chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), also termed interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), as a novel target gene of miR-21. IP-10 was downregulated 4 h after PRV infection. PRV replication was significantly inhibited by IP-10 overexpression. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Huang, J.;Ma, G.;Fu, L.;Jia, H.;Zhu, M.;Li, X.;Zhao, S.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2014.03.032,0
833,"Detection of a novel porcine parvovirus, PPV4, in Chinese pig herds","In order to determine whether the novel porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4) recently reported in America is widespread in China, a set of specific primers was developed and used for the molecular study of PPV4 among those reported in various countries between 2006 and 2010 Clinical specimens collected from China's provinces are used. The results showed that PPV4 is present in Chinese pig herds at a rate of 2.09% (12/573) among the clinical samples examined and at 0.76% (1/132) among the samples collected from healthy animals. We also found that PPV4 was not detected in samples collected prior to 2009. Analysis of the coding sequences revealed that the Chinese and American PPV4 genome sequences are closely related with greater than 99% nucleotide sequence identity. Similar to a previous study, viral genomes were detected in a head-to-tail configuration with different lengths of the non-coding region. Our results confirmed that PPV4 is a unique virus recently discovered in pigs. Phylogenetically, PPV4 is most closely related to bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2, which is not a bocavirus and is not assigned to any Parvovirinae genus) and shares limited amino acid identity with ORF1 (33.6%) and ORF2 (24.5%). In terms of genome structure and organization, PPV4 encodes an ORF3 in the middle of the viral genome that is similar to the Bocavirus genus. However, the PPV4 ORF3-encoded protein shares minimal amino acid identity with the ORF3-encoded proteins of the Bocavirus genus. © 2010 Huang et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Huang, L.;Zhai, S.

834,Differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus,"The swine epidemic, a devastating gastrointestinal disease, causes great financial losses due to its high infectivity, morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets, despite the development and application of various vaccines. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine differences in gut microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV). The results showed that the small intestinal microbiota of PEDV-infected suckling piglets was low in diversity and dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%). In addition, the composition of the small intestine microbiota of PEDV-infected suckling piglets showed significant differences to that of non-infected piglets. Some of the taxa that showed differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and PEDV-infected piglets were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism, as determined by predicting microbial function based on the bacterium 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, adapting the gut microbiota could be a promising method to prevent or treat PEDV.",,"Huang, M. Z.;Wang, S. Y.;Wang, H.;Cui, D. A.;Yang, Y. J.;Liu, X. W.;Kong, X. J.;Li, J.

835,A selective bottleneck shapes the evolutionary mutant spectra of enterovirus A71 during viral spread in humans,"RNA viruses accumulate mutations to rapidly adapt to environmental changes. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes various clinical manifestations with occasional severe neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 develops in the human body is unclear. Using deep sequencing and haplotype analyzes of viruses from different tissues of an autopsy patient, we attempted to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 develops the ability to invade the human central nervous system. A broad spectrum of mutants with different mutations were observed at the initial sites of infection in the respiratory and digestive systems. After viral invasion, we identified a haplotype switch and a dominant haplotype with glycine at VP1 residue 31 (VP1-31G) in virus particles that spread to the integumentary and central nervous systems. In vitro viral growth and fitness analyzes showed that VP1-31G conferred growth and a fitness advantage in human neuronal cells, while VP1-31D conferred enhanced replication in human colorectal cells. A higher proportion of VP1-31G was also found in fatalities, suggesting that it may facilitate central nervous system infection in humans. Our data provide a first glimpse into the EV-A71 quasi-species from oral tissues to the human central nervous system and show broad implications for the surveillance and pathogenesis of this re-emerging viral pathogen.<b>IMPORTANT</b> EV-A71 persists continues to be a global public health burden. Although EV-A71 is the main etiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease, it can also cause neurological pulmonary edema, encephalitis and even death, particularly in children. Understanding selection processes that enable dispersal and accurately estimating EV-A71 diversity during human invasion are critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine studies. Here we define a selection bottleneck that occurs in respiratory and digestive tissues. The glycine substitution at VP1 residue 31 helps viruses break the bottleneck and enter the central nervous system. This substitution is also beneficial for replication in neuronal cells in vitro. Considering that fatal cases contain an enhanced glycine substitution at VP1-31, we propose that the increased prevalence of VP1-31G alters viral tropism and central nervous system invasion can support. Our results provide new insights into a dynamic mutant spectral switch that is active during acute viral infection with emerging viral pathogens.",,"Huang, S. W.;Huang, Y. H.;Tsai, H. P.;Kuo, P.

836,Dual ATPase and GTPase activity of beak and feather disease virus replication-associated protein (Rep).,"Background: Parrot beak and feather disease affects parrots and results in an immunosuppressive disease often characterized by an abnormal shape and growth of the animal's beak, feathers and claws. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a single-stranded circular DNA virus and is classified as a member of the Circoviridae family. It is known that two large open reading frames (ORFs) encode the replication-associated (Rep) protein and the capsid-associated (Cap) protein. Methods: The BFDV Rep and Cap genes were fused to tags and then expressed and purified, respectively. Both the ATPase and GTPase activities of the recombinant Rep protein are measured. Substrate and ion preference, optimal conditions, effects of ATPase and GTPase inhibitors, and the presence of Cap protein on Rep protein ATPase and GTPase activity are examined. Finally, the effects of the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif and a new GYDG motif of the Rep protein on the ATPase and GTPase activities by different mutants are examined. Results: The recombinant Rep protein could show ATPase activity and GTPase activity. The Rep protein was able to hydrolyze both deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. Among the nucleoside triphosphates and deoxynucleoside triphosphates, the order of substrate preferences was found to be ATP > GTP > CTP >= UTP and dATP > dGTP > dTTP > dCTP, respectively. Both the ATPase and GTPase activities of the BFDV Rep protein required magnesium ions, and the presence of calcium ions significantly inhibited the ATPase and GTPase activities of the Rep protein. The optimal temperatures for ATPase activity and GTPase activity were both 56 degrees C, while their optimal pH values were both pH 7.5. Both the ATPase activity and the GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein were significantly downregulated by polynucleotides and the 36 bp dsDNA (located at the origin of replication) of the BFDV genome. The ATPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein was found to be more sensitive to sodium azide than to sodium orthovanadate and N-ethylmaleimide. Linoleic acid inhibited the GTPase activity of the Rep protein more than Dynasore. This suggested that the BFDV Rep protein should be classified as an F-type ATPase and a polyunsaturated fatty acid sensitive GTPase. In the presence of 10 ng of the Cap protein, the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of the BFDV Rep protein was significantly increased. In addition, the BFDV Rep protein contains the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif, and a new GYDG motif. Both the ATPase activity and the GTPase activity of various deletion and site-directed mutants of the Rep protein affecting these motifs were significantly reduced, suggesting that all three motifs contribute to the ATPase and GTPase activities; special. In addition, the ATPase activity and GTPase activity of the Rep protein deletion mutants were reversed in the presence of the Cap protein. This is the first example of dual ATPase and GTPase activity reported in the BFDV Rep protein. (C) 2015 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Huang, S. W.;Liu, H. P.;Chen, J. K.;Shien, Y. W.;Wong, M.

Here we report the isolation of multiple BPSV strains co-infecting a single animal. Whole genome analysis of isolated BPSV strains revealed genomic variability that likely influences the virulence and infectivity of the virus. In addition, incongruent phylogenetic relationships between viruses suggested genomic recombination.

838,Perpetuation and rearrangement of gull influenza A viruses in Atlantic North America,"Gulls are important hosts of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs), and gull AIVs often contain gene segments of mixed geographic and host lineage origin. In this study, the prevalence of AIV in gulls in Newfoundland, Canada, from 2008 to 2011 was analyzed. The overall prevalence was low (30/1645, 1.8%), but there was a clear peak of infection in autumn. AIV seroprevalence was high in Newfoundland Gulls, with 50% of gulls sampled showing evidence of prior infection. Sequences of 16 gull AIVs were determined and analyzed to shed light on the transmission, reassortment, and persistence dynamics of gull AIVs in Atlantic North America. A reorganization of the intercontinental and waterfowl lines was widespread. Of particular note was an all-Eurasian AIV and another with an intercontinental reassortant virus of the waterfowl lineage. These patterns of geographic and inter-host-group transmission underscore the importance of characterizing gull AIVs as part of attempts to understand global AIV dynamics.",,"Huang, Y.;Wille, M.;Benkaroun, J.;Munro, H.;Bond, A.

839,"A 4-year study of avian influenza virus prevalence and subtype diversity in ducks in Newfoundland, Canada","The island of Newfoundland, Canada is located on the eastern edge of North America and has migratory bird connections to the mainland and across the North Atlantic. Here we report a 4-year epidemiological study of avian influenza virus (AIV) in ducks in the St. John's area of Newfoundland. The overall prevalence of AIV detection in ducks during this study was 7.2%, with American Black Ducks contributing the majority of the samples collected and the AIV positives. The juvenile ducks showed a significantly higher AIV detection rate (10.6%) compared to adult ducks (3.4%). Seasonally, AIV prevalence rates were higher in autumn (8.4%), but positive results were also found in winter (4.6%). Preliminary serological tests showed a high incidence of previous AIV infection (20/38, 52.6%). A total of 43 viruses were characterized for their HA-NA or HA subtypes, showing a large diversity of AIV subtypes and a low recurrence of subtypes from year to year. Examination of the movement patterns of ducks in this region indicated that it is a largely non-migratory duck population, which could contribute to the observed pattern of high AIV subtype turnover. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 H1N1 and one H5N4 AIVs showed that these viruses closely resembled other low pathogenic AIV sequences from waterfowl in North America and all gene segments were assigned to American avian clades. In particular, the H1N1 viruses identified in consecutive years possessed homologous genomes. Such detection of homologous AIV genomes over years is rare, but points to the role of the environmental reservoir in viral perpetuation.",,"Huang, Y.;Wille, M.;Dobbin, A.;Robertson, G.

Phylogenetic analysis classified the viruses into a single genotype under Class I and four genotypes under Class II. The nineteen viruses assigned to Class II genotype VII were velogenic, while the other viruses were either mesogenic or lentogenic to chickens. Some NDV isolates (17/23) did not show neutralizing reactivity with a monoclonal antibody raised against the LaSota strain HN protein, reflecting mutation at the cognate antigenic epitope. When challenged with two genotype VII NDV isolates, LaSota vaccinated SPF chickens prevented disease development, but virus shedding was detected for at least 5 days post challenge. Circulation of the same NDV isolate for up to 13 years suggested the role of an environmental reservoir in NDV perpetuation and reinforced the importance of stringent biosecurity measures in addition to vaccination for disease control.",,"Huang, Y.;Yang, S.;Hu, B.;Xu, C.;Gao, D.;Zhu, M.;Huang, Q.;Zhang, L.;Wu, J.;Zhang, X.;Khan, M.

841,"Molecular Characterization of a Highly Pathogenic Pig: Virus Variant of Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome in Hubei, China","The Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is considered to be one of the most important pathogens in pigs worldwide. In 2006, more than 10 provinces in China experienced an epizootic outbreak of swine disease, characterized by high fever, flushed skin, and high morbidity and mortality. From June 2006 to April 2007, we examined some clinical samples in Hubei Province by RT-PCR and cloned several major genes, N, GP5 and NSP2 gene, which are shown in this study. The phylogenetic analysis of these genes revealed that the highly pathogenic PRRSV variant ZB was responsible for the 2006 outbreak of swine disease in Hubei Province, similar to the variants isolated in 2006 from other provinces in China, and belongs to the NA-type PRRSV. In the PRRSV variants, N and GP5 share about 90% identity with the prototypical ATCC VR-2332 and some typical Chinese NA-type isolates, with the exception of the 2850 bp NSP2 gene (shares only 65% identity with ATCC VR-2332) . But they all share more than and 97% identity with other highly pathogenic Chinese PRRSV strains. In addition, there are extensive amino acid (aa) mutations in the GP5 protein and 2 deletions in the Nsp2 protein compared to the previous isolates. Most of the variants found in the 2006 swine disease outbreak in China were the most phylogenetically distant variants from the typical NA-type PRRSV, and these differences may account for the differences in pathogenicity found between these variants and the original Chinese PRRSV strains have been observed.

842,Clinical features and phylogenetic analysis of coxsackievirus A9 in northern Taiwan in 2011,"Background: Coxsackievirus A9 (CA9) was one of the most prevalent enteroviral infection serotypes in Taiwan in 2011. After several patient series were reported in the 1960s and 1970s, few studies have focused on the clinical manifestations of CA9 infection. Our study examines and deepens the current understanding of CA9. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical presentations of 100 culture-proven CA9-infected patients in 2011 by reviewing their medical records and plotting the CA9 pedigree. Results: Of the 100 patients with culture-proven CA9 infections, the mean (SD) age was 4.6 (3.4) years and the male to female ratio was 1.9. Of the clinical manifestations, 96 patients (96%) had fever and the mean (SD) duration of fever was 5.9 (3.4) days. Sixty-one patients (61%) developed a rash, and the predominant pattern was a generalized, nonpruritic maculopapular rash without vesicular changes. While most patients had a throat injection, mouth ulcers were found in only 19 cases (19%), 6 of which were diagnosed as herpangina. Complicated cases included: aseptic meningitis (n=8), bronchopneumonia (n=6), acute cerebellaritis (n=1), and polio-like syndrome (n=1). The phylogenetic analysis for current CA9 strains is closest to CA9 isolate 27-YN-2008 from the border area of mainland China and Myanmar. Conclusions: The most common feature of CA9 during the 2011 epidemic in Taiwan is a generalized febrile rash rather than herpangina or hand, foot and mouth disease. Because persistent fever and some complications are possible, caution should be exercised both in patient assessment and in predicting clinical outcome. © 2013 Huang et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Huang, Y.

However, the exact contribution of the HN gene to NDV pathogenesis is not known. In this study, the role of the HN gene in NDV virulence was examined. Using reverse genetics methods, the HN genes of a virulent recombinant NDV strain, rBeaudette C (rBC), and an avirulent recombinant NDV strain, rLaSota, were swapped. The hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities of the chimeric viruses showed significant differences from those of their parental strains, but heterotypic F and HN pairs were equally effective in promoting fusion. It turned out that the tissue tropism of the viruses depends on the origin of the HN protein. The chimeric virus with the virulent virus-derived HN protein showed tissue preference similar to that of the virulent virus and vice versa. The chimeric viruses with reciprocal HN proteins either gained or lost virulence as determined by a standard chick intracerebral pathogenicity index assay and by mean time of death in chick embryos (a measure used to classify these viruses), indicating that virulence is a function of is the amino acid differences in the HN protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the virulence of NDV is multigenic and that F protein cleavage alone does not determine the virulence of a strain.",,"Huang, Z.;Panda, A.;Elankumaran, S.;Govindarajan, D.;Rockemann, D.

The RPM microbiome has not yet been studied by high-throughput sequencing. Samples of RPM eggs, larvae and stuffed adults/nymphs obtained in four poultry houses in the Czech Republic were used for microbiome analysis by Illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V4 region. A laboratory RPM population was used as a positive control for transcriptome analysis by pyrosequencing with identification of bacterial-derived sequences. Samples from swollen adult/nymph stages had 100-fold more copies of 16S rRNA gene copies than samples from eggs and larvae. The composition of the microbiome showed differences between the four poultry houses and between the observed developmental stages. In the adult microbiome, 10 OTUs comprised 90 to 99% of all sequences. Bartonella-like bacteria covered between 30 and 70% of the sequences in the RPM microbiome and 25% of the bacterial sequences in the transcriptome. The phylogenetic analyzes of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed two distinct groups of Bartonella-like bacteria forming sister groups: (i) symbionts of ants; (ii) genus Bartonella. Cardinium, Wolbachia and Rickettsiella sp. were found in the microbiomes of all stages tested, while Spiroplasma eriocheiris and Wolbachia were identified in the laboratory's RPM transcriptome. The microbiomes of eggs, larvae and engorged adults/nymphs differed. Bartonella-like symbionts were found in all stages and sampling sites. Bartonella-like bacteria were the most diverse group within the RPM microbiome. The presence of identified putative pathogenic bacteria is relevant in terms of human and animal health, while the identification of symbiotic bacteria may lead to new control methods aimed at destabilizing the arthropod host.",,"Hubert, J.;Erban, T.;Kopecky, J.;Sopko, B.;Nesvorna, M.;Lichovnikova, M.;Schicht, S.;Strube, C.;Sparagano, O.",2017.0,Nov,,0

This is in contrast to previous reports of other CPXV isolates. Shotgun DNA sequencing revealed multiple insertions and deletions in genes thought to be involved in host range, immune regulation, and established virulence factors. These preliminary data could indicate that CPXV strains with demonstrated human pathogenicity may have reduced virulence in mice and vice versa.

849,Oral fluids as a live animal sample source to assess cross-reactivity and cross-protection following intranasal influenza A virus vaccination in pigs,"Numerous antigenically distinct H1 influenza A virus (IAV) variants are currently circulating in North American swine, making vaccine development difficult due to the inability to formulate a vaccine that provides broad cross-protection. Experimentally, live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV) show increased cross-protection compared to inactivated vaccines. However, there is no standardized assay to predict cross-protection after LAIV vaccination. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) serum antibody is the gold-standard correlate of protection following IAV vaccination. LAIV vaccination does not induce a robust serum HI antibody titer; however, a local mucosal antibody response is elicited. Therefore, a live animal sample source is needed that could be used to assess LAIV immunogenicity and cross-protection. Here we evaluated the use of oral fluids (OF) and nasal washes (NW) collected after IAV inoculation as a live animal sample source in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to predict cross-protection compared to traditional serology. Both live virus exposure and LAIV vaccination provided heterologous protection, although protection against phylogenetically more closely related viruses was greatest. IAV-specific IgA was detected in NWand OF samples and was cross-reactive with representative IAV from each H1 cluster. Endpoint titers of cross-reactive IgA in OF from pigs exposed to live virus were associated with heterologous protection. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection, LAIV immunogenicity was reduced compared to live virus challenge. These data suggest that OF from pigs vaccinated with wild-type IAV with surface genes consistent with the LAIV seed strain could be used in an ELISA to assess cross-protection and antigenic relatedness of circulating and emerging IAV in evaluate pigs.",,"Hughes, H.

Immunoblot comparisons of BlCMV, Peanut Stripe Mosaic Virus (PStV), Bean Common Mosaic Virus (BCMV) and Azuki Bean Mosaic Virus (AzMV) showed equal reactivity of their 35K envelope proteins. Similar comparisons between CAMV and the necrotic BCMV strain (isolate NL3) revealed a serological relationship between their 32K envelope proteins, with the results providing the first evidence of a possible similarity between CAMV and BCMV NL3. Peptides from trypsin digests of the coat proteins of several of these legume-infecting potyviruses were analyzed by HPLC. The comparison of the peptide profiles confirmed the serological results in distinguishing the two subgroups. The coat protein peptide profiles of BICMV, PStV, AzMV and BCMV were nearly identical, suggesting that they could be considered strains of one virus.

With the world population projected to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, an increase in ruminant production is necessary to meet global protein needs despite limited land availability, while ensuring that environmental impact is minimized. While these goals are challenging, they can be achieved, but depend on our understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen microbiome to benefit global agricultural challenges have been ongoing for decades with limited success, mainly due to the lack of detailed understanding of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture most of these microbes outside of the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and address global challenges in livestock husbandry through animal husbandry and the introduction of early-life nutritional interventions has recently emerged as a promising new technology. Our inability to phenotype ruminants at high throughput has also hampered progress, although the recent increase in 'omic' data may allow the advancement of mathematical models and rumen microbial gene biomarkers as proxies. Advances in computational tools, high-throughput sequencing technologies, and culture-independent “omics” approaches continue to revolutionize our understanding of the rumen microbiome. This will ultimately provide the knowledge framework needed to solve current and future challenges in ruminant livestock husbandry.",,"Huws, S. A.;Creevey, C. J.;Oyama, L. B.;Mizrahi, I.;Denman, S.

The approach uses previous covariate information (serum neutralization titers collected from animals in 16 flocks) within a predictive model to classify a future observable flock.

855,High diversity and potential translocation of DNA viruses in ballast water,"Ballast water is a common vector for transporting invasive species into new marine and aquatic environments. We used a metagenomic approach to study the composition and diversity of viral communities in the ballast water of ships from Mexico, Saudi Arabia, New York and Panama, and in the water from the port of their destination in Busan, Korea. Myoviridae was the most common virus family in ballast water, followed by Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. We also identified viruses infecting invertebrates, amoebas and algae in Busan's ballast water and harbor water. Interestingly, several viruses infecting humans or other animals (swinepox virus, raccoonpox virus, suid herpesvirus, and human endogenous retrovirus) were found in the samples from New York and Panama. In addition, giant viruses were found in all ballast water samples, notably Megavirus chilensis in New York and Panama and Pandoravirus salinus in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. These results provide detailed descriptions of the properties of viruses present in ballast water, document significant viral diversity, and indicate the potential translocation of viruses across ballast water.",,"Hwang, J.;Park, S.

856,Molecular identification of three novel herpesviruses found in Australian farmed saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) and Australian freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni).,"As part of a larger investigation of three emerging disease syndromes characterized by conjunctivitis and pharyngitis, systemic lymphoid proliferation and encephalitis, and lymphonodular skin infiltrates in farmed saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus), and an emerging syndrome of systemic lymphoid proliferation in captive freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) cytopathic effects (CPE), including syncytial cell formation, were observed in primary crocodile cell lines exposed to cleared tissue homogenates from affected crocodilians. Ten cell cultures with CPE were then screened for herpesviruses using two broadly reactive herpesvirus PCRs. Amplicons were obtained from 9 out of 10 cell cultures and sequenced. Three new herpesviruses were discovered, and phylogenetic analysis of these viruses showed a 63 percent Bayesian posterior probability value for these viruses clustering with the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and a 100 percent posterior probability for clustering with a group containing which contains Alphaherpesvirinae and other unassigned reptilian herpesviruses. It is proposed to name them Crocodyline Herpesvirus (CrHV) 1, 2 and 3. CrHV1 and 2 were only isolated from saltwater crocodiles and CrHV3 only from freshwater crocodiles. A duplex PCR was developed that could detect these herpesviruses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, a sample type in which none of the broadly reactive PCRs could detect these herpesviruses. This work describes the isolation, molecular detection and phylogeny of these novel herpesviruses, but the association they have with the emerging disease syndromes warrants further investigation.",,"Hyndman, T.

Since 2003, increased surveillance and molecular characterization studies of hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been carried out in England and Wales. The dynamics of hepatitis E have changed recently with an increase in the number of native cases and an observed virus shift. methods. HEV antibody and RNA data were analyzed to determine annual number of acute infections, HEV genotype disposition, and viral phylogeny. This data was examined in the context of collected travel histories and demographic data. Results. A total of 2713 acute hepatitis E cases were diagnosed, of which 1376 were local infections. Travel-associated cases remained stable and were mainly associated with genotype 1 infections. In contrast, large variations in domestically acquired cases were noted, with a dramatic year-on-year increase between 2010 and 2012. Molecular characterization showed that native infections cluster into two distinct phylogenetic groups, with the emergence of a new group of genotype 3 viruses coinciding with the recent rise in cases. Conclusions. HEV infection rates are dynamic in England and Wales and are influenced by changing trends in indigenous cases. The recent increase in native cases and the emergence of native viruses that were not widely circulating prior to 2010 suggest that the risk of contracting HEV has changed.",,"Ijaz, S.;Said, B.;Boxall, E.;Smit, E.;Morgan, D.;Tedder, R.

858,Identification of bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) from cattle in Baden-Württemberg,"Caliciviruses are known to cause various diseases in many animal species. Bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) are associated with diarrhea in cattle. These viruses have been classified in the genus Norovirus and are closely related to human norovirus, the main cause of gastroenteritis in humans. This has raised questions about zoonotic transmission and an animal reservoir for the human viruses. Two samples out of 41 stool samples collected for diagnostic purposes from diarrheal cattle in Aulendorf, Germany tested positive for BEC. The samples were amplified with new degenerate BEC-specific primers that amplify a 263 bp portion of the RNA polymerase region. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences showed that these viruses are most closely related to genogroup III/2 (Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK) norovirus viruses.",,"Ike, A. C.;Roth, B. N.;BÃ¶hm, R.;Pfitzner, A.

859,Herd immunity and fatal cases of influenza among the population exposed to poultry and wild birds in Russian Asia in 2013-2014,"total of 1,525 blood serum samples were collected in October 2013 in Russian Asia from people living in areas with a high risk of occurrence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. The presence of antibodies against influenza viruses in the sera was tested in the hemagglutination inhibition test. None of the samples gave positive results with the antigens A/H5 and A/H7. Twelve strains of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) virus were isolated from people suspected to have died of influenza during the 2013-2014 epidemic season. All strains were similar to vaccine strain A/California/07/09 in terms of their antigenic properties and susceptibility to anti-neuraminidase drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Genetic analysis revealed that all strains belong to group 6, subgroup 6B of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Substitutions in HA1: S164F adds E235K as well as E47G, A86V, K331R, N386K, N397K in NA and K131E, N29S in NS1 and N29S, R34Q in NEP separate the studied strains into two groups: 1.

ORF5 showed nucleotide and amino acid identities of 87*5-100% and 87*6-100% among isolates, respectively. In a pedigree, all European isolates were grouped in a genotype different from that of the American reference strains (VR-2332, IAF-Klop). Two distinct clades have been identified among European isolates. Two Czech isolates (V-501 and V-503) and the Italian strain PRRSV 2156 fell into one group. The remaining European tribes formed the second group. Surprisingly, two separately clustered strains (V-501 and V-516) were isolated from the same herd. In addition, the possible effect of in vitro cultivation on the nucleotide sequence was analyzed.

862,Bats are an untapped system for understanding mammalian microbiome evolution,"Mammals evolved in a microbial world, and consequently microbial symbionts have played a role in their evolution. An exciting new sub-discipline of metagenomics addresses the ways in which microbes, particularly those in the gut, have facilitated ecological and phylogenetic irradiation of mammals. However, the vast majority of these studies focus on pets, laboratory models, or charismatic megafauna (e.g., pandas and chimpanzees). The result is a plethora of studies covering only a few taxa across the mammalian tree of life, leaving broad patterns of microbiome function and development unclear. Microbiome research in wildlife urgently needs a model system in which to test hypotheses about metagenomic involvement in host ecology and evolution. We propose that bats (order: Chiroptera) represent an ideal model system for comparative microbiome research, offering opportunities to study host phylogeny, diet, and other natural history traits related to the evolution of the gut microbiome.",,"Ingala, M.

These analyzes revealed that the parapoxviruses were divided into four groups and the region sequenced in this study was highly conserved within each group. Each of the Japanese isolates was assigned to one of these groups. These findings also indicated that parapoxvirus infections among wild Japanese sera appear to be caused by at least two different parapoxviruses, bovine papular stomatitis virus and orf virus.

864,Identification and characterization of Highlands J virus from a Mississippi sandhill crane using unbiased next-generation sequencing,"Advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms, commonly referred to as next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS), have significantly reduced the time, effort, and cost of DNA sequencing. Thus, NGS has become a routine tool for the discovery of new viral pathogens and is likely to become the standard for routine laboratory diagnostics of infectious diseases in the near future. This study demonstrated the application of NGS for the rapid identification and characterization of a virus isolated from the brain of an endangered Mississippi sandhill crane. This bird was part of a population recovery effort and was found in an emaciated condition a few days after Hurricane Isaac swept over the Mississippi refuge in 2012. Consistent with a togavirus isolated from the bird's brain, an arboviral etiology was strongly suspected. Because single molecular assays were negative for several known arboviruses, unbiased Illumina MiSeq NGS was used to definitively identify and characterize the causative viral agent. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis determined the viral isolate to be Highlands J virus, a known avian pathogen. This study demonstrates the use of unbiased NGS for the rapid detection and characterization of an unidentified viral pathogen and the application of this technology to wildlife disease diagnosis and conservation medicine.",,"Ip, H.

865,Viral pathotype and deep sequencing of the HA gene of a low pathogenicity H7N1 avian influenza virus causing death in turkeys,"Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of the H7 subtype generally cause mild disease in poultry. However, the evolution of an LPAI virus into a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) results in the generation of a virus that can cause serious illness and death. The classification of these two pathotypes is based in part on morbidity and death in chickens as determined in an intravenous pathogenicity assay, but the effect of LPAI viruses in turkeys is less well understood. During an investigation of LPAI virus infection in turkeys, groups of three-week-old birds vaccinated with A/chicken/Italy/1279/99 (H7N1) showed severe signs of disease and died or were euthanized within 7 days of infection. The virus has been detected in many internal tissues and organs of culled birds. To investigate the possible evolution of the infecting virus into a highly pathogenic form in these turkeys, a sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene cleavage site was performed by analyzing multiple cDNA amplicons from swabs and tissue sample extracts using Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing. In addition, an RT-PCR assay was developed to detect the HPAI virus. There was no evidence of the presence of HPAI virus in either the virus used as an inoculum or in swabs taken from infected birds. However, a small fraction (<0.5%) of the virus contained in individual trachea or liver samples contained a molecular signature at the HA cleavage site typical of an HPAI virus. All signature sequences were identical and resembled HPAI viruses collected during the 1999/2000 Italian animal epidemic. We assume that the detection of HPAI virus in tissue samples after infection with A/Chicken/Italy/1279/99 reflects the amplification of a virus present at very low levels in the mixed inoculum, but remarkably we did not observe any new ones HPAI virus signatures in amplified DNA analyzed by deep sequencing.",,"Iqbal, M.;Reddy, K.

The nucleotide sequence encoding VP1, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, from BD 3/99 was aligned to that of 17 other IBDV strains, including six very virulent, three classically virulent, five classically attenuated, one antigenic variant and two Serotype 2 strains. The VP1 genes of all very virulent strains were 97.5% to 99.8% identical. With the exception of one atypical Australian strain, 002-73, all of the classic virulent or attenuated and antigenic variant strains were also 97.5% to 100% identical. Serotype 2 strains showed only 4-6% divergence from classically virulent or attenuated serotype 1 strains; in contrast, however, the very virulent strains differed by 10.5% to 12.5% from the classic virulent or attenuated strains and serotype 2 strains. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of VP1 revealed 17 common, including 8 unique, amino acid substitutions in the very virulent strains. In the phylogenetic tree, the very virulent strains formed a distinct cluster and all other strains, including classically virulent, attenuated and antigenic variant strains and even serotype 2 strains, were grouped together. It is hypothesized that the VP1 of highly virulent IBDV is phylogenetically distinct from that of all other IBDV strains and likely originates from a previously unidentified source.",,"Islam, M.

869,A whole genome analysis of porcine astroviruses detected in Japanese pigs reveals genetic diversity and possible intra-genotypic recombination,"Porcine astroviruses (PoAstVs) are ubiquitous porcine enteric viruses that are distributed in several countries worldwide. Because PoAstVs are detected in apparently healthy pigs, the clinical significance of the infection is unknown. However, AstVs have recently been implicated in a serious neurological disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been suggested. So far, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs in the pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of near-complete genomes of 36 PoAstVs detected in Japanese pig feces by a metagenomic approach. Based on phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was found in individual faecal samples from eight pigs. The ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 pedigrees of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their topology. The PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 strain showed significant sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence for multiple possible recombination events within the genotype in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination may have contributed to genetic diversity and played an important role in the evolution of Japanese PoAstVs.",,"Ito, M.;Kuroda, M.;Masuda, T.;Akagami, M.;Haga, K.;Tsuchiaka, S.;Kishimoto, M.;Naoi, Y.;Sano, K.;Omatsu, T.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Aoki, H.;Ichimaru, T.;Mukono, I.;Ouchi, Y.;Yamasato, H.;Shirai, J.;Katayama, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.02.008,1

In Japan, BToVs are common across the country and cause gastrointestinal infections in calves and cows. In the present study, full genome sequences of two Japanese BToVs and partial genome sequences of two Japanese BToVs and a porcine torovirus (PToV) from distant regions in Japan were determined and genetic analyzes were performed. Pairwise nucleotide comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that Japanese BToVs shared a high level of identity with each other and showed high similarities to the BToV Breda1 strain in the S, M, and HE coding regions. Japanese BToVs showed high similarities to porcine toroviruses in the ORF1a, ORF1b and N coding regions and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, indicating a natural recombination event. Recombination analyzes mapped the putative recombinant breakpoints at the 3' ends of the ORF1b and HE regions.

872,Novel bioinformatic strategies to predict directed sequence changes in influenza virus genomes and to monitor potentially dangerous strains,"Background: With the remarkable increase in microbial and viral sequence data obtained from high-throughput DNA sequencers, new tools for the comprehensive analysis of large sequence data are needed. We have developed a ""Batch-Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM)"" that can characterize very many, even millions, of genomic sequences at one level. The influenza virus belongs to the zoonotic viruses and shows a clear host tropism. Important topics for bioinformatic studies of influenza viruses are the prediction of genomic sequence changes in the near future and the monitoring of potentially dangerous strains. Methods: To characterize sequence changes in influenza virus genomes after invasion into humans from other animal hosts, we applied BLSOMs to analyzes of mono -, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide compositions in all genome sequences of influenza A and B viruses and found a clear host-dependent clustering (self-organization) of the sequences. Results: Viruses isolated from humans and birds differed from each other in the mononucleotide composition. In addition, host-dependent oligonucleotide compositions that could not be explained in terms of host-dependent mononucleotide composition were revealed by oligonucleotide BLSOMs. Retrospective time-dependent directional changes of mono- and oligonucleotide compositions visualized on BLSOMs for human strains could provide predictive information about sequence changes in newly invaded viruses from other animal hosts (e.g. the swine-borne pandemic H1N1/09). Conclusions: Based on the host-dependent oligonucleotide composition, we proposed a strategy to predict viral sequence directional changes and to monitor potentially dangerous strains when introduced into human populations from non-human sources. Millions of genomic sequences of infectious microbes and viruses have become available due to their medical and social importance, and BLSOM can characterize the large amounts of data and support efficient knowledge discovery. © 2013 Iwasaki et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Iwasaki, Y.;Abe, T.;Wada, Y.;Wada, K.;Ikemura, T.",2013.0,,10.1186/1471-2334-13-386,0

874,Molecular properties of infectious bursal virus from asymptomatic broiler flocks in Europe,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) exists in several different antigenic and pathogenic forms. Immunosuppression in young chickens caused by this virus is not always associated with clinical signs of disease. The antigenic virus variants originally described in the USA do not typically cause any clinical symptoms, but can cause significant immunosuppression by destroying B lymphocytes. Using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, we conducted a screening of asymptomatic broiler flocks in Europe for IBDV. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the viral protein 2 (VP2) gene of four isolates from Spain and four isolates from France suggested that they may differ from the classical and highly virulent (vv) IBDV strains found across Europe. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene showed that all eight viruses were more similar to US variant viruses than to classical viruses. In two viruses, one from France and one from Spain, threonine was found at amino acid position 222 and serine at position 254. These two substitution mutations are characteristic of Delaware variant viruses. In addition, all eight viruses had a mutated amino acid position 318 from glycine to aspartic acid, another substitution mutation commonly found in US variant viruses. Although import restrictions prevented us from directly testing the antigenicity of these viruses, their nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences suggest that they may be antigenic distinct compared to classical and vvIBDV commonly found in Europe. Confirming the presence of antigenic variants of IBDV strains in Europe requires additional immunological studies to elucidate the precise nature of the viral epitopes. Our data support the need for these immunological studies.",,"Jackwood, D. J.;Cookson, K. C.;Sommer-Wagner, S. E.;Le Galludec, H.;De Wit, J. J.",2006.0,,10.1637/7528-032006r1.1,0
875,Diversity of the B genome segment of infectious bursal disease viruses in the United States,"Several phylogenetic lineages of the B genome segment of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) have been identified. Although this genome segment has been shown to contribute to virulence, little is known about the genetic lineages that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 IBDV strains collected from 2002 to 2011 in the United States were examined. Despite hailing from nine different states, the majority (47) of these viruses originated in California. A 722 base pair region near the 5' end of genome segment B, beginning at nucleotide 168 and ending at 889, was examined and compared to sequences available in GenBank. Nucleotide sequence alignment showed that mutations were frequently observed and that they were evenly distributed across the region. When the predicted amino acids were aligned, it was found that the amino acids at positions 145, 146, and 147 change frequently. Six different amino acid triplets were observed and the very virulent (vv) IBDV strains (based on the presence of the vvIBDV genome segment A sequence) all had the T145, D146 and N147 triplet. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic analysis of the 67 nucleotide sequences revealed four significant lineages of genome segment B among US viruses. One of these included the B genome segment typically found in vvIBDV, and three contained non-vvIBDV genome segment B sequences. When the available sequences in GenBank were added for analysis, two additional lineages that did not contain US viruses were observed ; one contained virus from China and the other contained virus from Ivory Coast. Although the samples tested did not represent all poultry-producing regions in the United States, serotype 1 viruses from states outside of California all belonged to a genomic segment B lineage. The other three lineages observed in the United States were colonized with viruses unique to California, with the exception of the serotype 2 line in which the type strain was an Ohio serotype 2 virus. The data provide further evidence of the importance of identifying genomic segment B during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV strains. © 2012 American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Jackwood, D.

Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates revealed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite clusters around the two predominant populations for Ark-type virus were observed, likely due to mutations related to the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. Phylogenetic network analysis of mass-type viruses reveals two groupings corresponding to vaccine sequences from different manufacturers. No satellite groups were observed for mass-type viruses, consistent with the lack of persistence of this vaccine type in the field. No vaccine against DMV/1639 viruses was used at the time of collection and phylogenetic network analysis showed a scattered network, indicating no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains evolved under negative selection, whereas the Ark-type viruses had evolved under positive selection. These data support the hypothesis that the use of live attenuated vaccines plays a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role of live vaccines play a role in the evolutionary trajectory of these viruses.",,"Jackwood, M.

878,"Genetic analysis of avian influenza A viruses isolated from native waterfowl at live bird markets in Hanoi, Vietnam, which preceded fatal human H5N1 infections in 2004","The first known cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in Vietnam occurred in late 2003. However, HPAI H5N1 and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 and H9N3 viruses were isolated in live birds from domestic waterfowl market surveillance (LBM) in Vietnam in 2001 and 2003. To explore the possible role of these early viruses in the genesis of H5N1 -strains that infect humans, we performed sequencing and molecular characterization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of two goose HPAI-H5N1 strains belonged to clade 3 and their surface glycoprotein and replication complex genes were most closely related to A/duck/Guangxi/22/01 (98.5 -99.7% homologous). (H5N1) virus discovered simultaneously in southern China, while the M and NS genes are derived from an A/duck/Hong Kong/2986.1/00 (H5N1)-like virus. The H5-HA gene of duck HPAI-H5N1 strain belonged to clade 5 and acquired a gene constellation of A/quail/Shantou/3846/02 (H5N1), A/teal/China/2978.1/02 (H5N1) and A /partridge/ Shantou/2286/03 (H5N1)-like viruses. The phylogenetic analysis also showed that all eight gene segments of the goose and duck viruses HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5N2 differed from those of the H5N1 clade 1 viruses, which have been known to cause fatal human infections since late 2003 caused by Vietnam. The duck H9N3 isolates derived genes from waterfowl influenza viruses and their H9 HA belonged to the Korean lineage. The PB2 gene of A/duck/Vietnam/340/01 (H9N3) virus had lysine at position 627. Based on molecular characterization of specific surface amino acid residues and relevant internal protein-coding genes, Vietnamese H5N1 and H9N3 virus isolates demonstrated specificity for the avian cell surface receptor and sensitivity to currently approved anti-influenza A virus chemotherapeutic agents. Our results suggest that the H5N1 and H5N2 viruses that circulated between geese and ducks in LBMs in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2001 and 2003 were not the immediate ancestors of the clade 1 viruses associated with fatal infections been associated with humans in Vietnam.

879,Genetic Analysis of Avian Influenza Viruses: Cocirculation of Avian Influenza Viruses with Allelic A and B Nonstructural Genes in Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) Ducks Wintering in Japan,"The 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) pandemic influenza virus strains have genes related to avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The nonstructural (NS) gene of AIVs plays an important role in the host-virus interaction. However, little is known about the degree of diversity of this gene in pintail ducks (Anas acuta) wintering in Japan. This study describes the characteristics of H1N1, H1N2, H1N3, H5N2, H5N3, H5N9 and H7N7 viruses derived from pintails. Most of the viruses turned out to be from avian strains unrelated to pandemic and seasonal flu strains. Nonetheless, the NP genes of 62.5% (5/8) viruses were found to be closely related to an A/pig/Korea/C12/08, suggesting an exchange of genetic material and ongoing mammalian-associated evolution of AIVs. In addition, all viruses except Aomori/422/07 H1N1 contain the PSIQSRGLF motif, which is normally found in avian, porcine and human H1 strains. The Aomori/422/07 H1N1 has a PSVQSRGLF motif identical to a North American strain. These findings connected to an important intercontinental, Asian-American biogeographical interface. Phylogenetically, all viruses were clustered in Eurasian lineage. The co-circulation of allelic A and B viruses (NS gene) was evident in the study, suggesting the existence of a wide reservoir of influenza A viruses in overwintering pintails in Japan. © 2012 Alam Jahangir et al.",,"Jahangir, A.;Ruenphet, S.;Sultana, N.;Shoham, D.;Takehara, K.",2012.0,,10.1155/2012/847505,0
880,Isolation and characterization of H9N2 influenza virus isolates from outbreaks of respiratory disease in poultry,"The present study reports the isolation and characterization of the H9N2 virus responsible for a disease characterized by symptoms including difficulty breathing, head swelling, nasal discharge, reduced food intake, cyanotic crest, reduced egg production and mortality. Virus isolation from allantoic fluid inoculated with tracheal aspirates and whole genome sequencing of two isolates were performed on an Ion Torrent sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H9N2 isolates are reassortant viruses sharing a G1-like lineage for HA, NA and NP, a Hok/49/98-like lineage for PB1 and PA, and a PK/UDL-01/05 -like lineage for PB2, IL/90658/00-like lineage for the NS and an unknown lineage for the M gene. Analysis of the HA cleavage site revealed a sequence of (333PARSSRGL340), indicating that these isolates are of low pathogenicity. Isolate 2 has leucine at amino acid position 226, a substitution associated with mammalian adaptation of avian influenza virus. Isolate 1 has the S31N substitution in the M2 gene, which has been linked to drug resistance, and R57Q and C241Y mutations in the NP gene, which have been linked to human adaptation. The result reported here provides a deep insight into the H9N2 viruses circulating in Indian domestic poultry and supports the policy of active efforts to control and manage H9N2 infection in Indian poultry.",,"Jakhesara, S.

881,Emergence of a genotype I variant of infectious avian bronchitis virus from the northern part of India,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main causes of continued economic strain on the poultry industry worldwide. IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. IBV infection causes respiratory and nephrogenic symptoms in broilers. In addition, its infection leads to reduced fertility and hatchability in layer birds. We have determined the first full genome sequence of an IBV variant from an outbreak in Haryana state, northern India, using next-generation sequencing. In phylogenetic analysis of the IBV isolate, it clustered with genotype I lineage 1 (GI-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the S gene from IBV isolates showed a high degree of identity with strains isolated from Tamil Nadu and the reference vaccine strains. Our result suggests that the IBV virus isolated from unvaccinated chicken flocks in northern India may be a revertant strain that originally evolved from the live attenuated vaccine strains used in the region. Determining the full genome sequence of additional IBV isolates from India is necessary to understand the epidemiology of IBV in India.",,"Jakhesara, S. J.;Nath, B.;Pal, J. K.;Joshi, C.

882,"Pathotypic and sequence characterization of Newcastle disease viruses from vaccinated chickens showing genotypes II, IV and XIII circulating in India","Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) causes a highly contagious disease that plagues the global poultry industry. The nature and molecular epidemiology of NDVs that have been prevalent in recent outbreaks in India are poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize NDVs prevalent in vaccinated herds in India using whole genome sequencing and biological pathotyping. Twelve field isolates were collected from outbreaks occurring in different parts of India and characterized as velogen based on their intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and amino acid sequence at the F protein cleavage site. All 12 field isolates and five commonly used vaccine strains were selected for whole genome sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM technology, yielding complete genome sequences for ten field isolates and all vaccine strains. The genomes of all isolates were found to be 15 192 nt in length and show a high level of conservation across multiple genomic traits with APMV-I viruses. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary distance calculations assigned the isolates to genotypes II, IV, and XIII. Revisiting other recently reported strains provided preliminary evidence for genotypes VI, VII, and XVIII circulating in India. Comparison between the field and vaccine virus sequences revealed unique genomic and amino acid differences in key antigenic regions of the F and hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) genes that can be targeted for site-directed mutagenesis to assess the impact of these substitutions on viral pathogenicity. This study underscores the need to evaluate current vaccines through systematic protective testing to determine protective efficacy against field isolates.",,"Jakhesara, S. J.;Prasad, V. V.;Pal, J.

884,Sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene of infectious bronchitis viruses: identification of a new phylogenetic group in Korea,"Between 2001 and 2003, twelve Korean infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) were isolated from chickens suspected to be carriers of infectious bronchitis analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were divided into three groups according to their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the 12 isolates resembled the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three other isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed different RFLP patterns. Amplified PCR products from the twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced for comparison to the published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains. The Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology with each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. In terms of deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5-99.3% similarity among themselves and 44.9-80.3% similarity with non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some of the IBV isolates appear to belong to a new group distinct from the non-Korean IBV strains or from previously isolated Korean IBV strains. In particular, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 represented a separate group. These results suggest that Korean IBVs appear to be constantly evolving.",,"Jang, J. H.;Sung, H.

885,Antigenic and genetic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus type A isolates to select a candidate vaccine strain indicates the emergence of a virus variant responsible for recent outbreaks in India,"Recent reports indicate the presence of two antigenic and genetic groups (genotypes VI and VII) of foot and mouth disease virus (FMD) type A in India and differ from the vaccine strains. To select suitable field isolates as candidate vaccine strains, antisera will be tested against representative isolates from both genotypes and two vaccine strains in use in a neutralization assay. Two candidate vaccine strains from both genotypes are selected with close antigenic matches to the field isolates. From the result it can be seen that IND 81/00 (genotypes VII) gave better antigenic coverage (antigenic relationship (r) value > 0.40 in 79% of isolates from 2002-2003) than IND 258/99 (genotype VI ; r-value > 0.40 in 42% of isolates from 2002-2003). Phylogenetic analysis based on the P1 genomic region assigned all recent isolates (2001–2003) to genotype VII, with the emergence of a new virus variant (VIIb-VP359del) with an amino acid deletion at an antigenically critical residue (VP359), indicating a large evolutionary leap likely due to immune selection. Although very limited in scope, these data indicate an apparent dominance of genotype VII over genotype VI and underscore the need to continue further molecular-epidemiological studies to substantiate this finding. © 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Jangra, R.

In this article we describe the clinical observations, diagnostic procedures and epidemiological investigations that were carried out to elucidate the source of the infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology, virus isolation and sequence analysis of a 493 bp fragment of the VP1 gene. Phylogenetically, the causative virus was closely related to pathogenic GPV strains isolated in 2003 and 2004 from Poland and the UK, respectively. The Swedish isolate showed less homology with pathogenic strains from Hungary and Asia and with attenuated vaccine strains. The epidemiological investigation showed that the virus was first introduced on a contract farm (Farm A) and then transmitted with newly hatched goslings to the farm that submitted the birds for necropsy (index farm). The exact point in time and the source of the introduction of the virus into company A could not be determined with absolute certainty. Possible sources of infection included backyard geese eggs that had been supplied to Farm A for incubation and subcontractor hatching, wild geese visiting the flock of breeding geese in the pasture on Farm A, and a clutch of Canada goose (Branta canadensis) eggs that did so was produced by wild geese and hatched in the same machine as the eggs from farm A.",,"Jansson, D.

889,ViQuaS: an improved reconstruction pipeline for viral quasispecies spectra generated by next-generation sequencing,"MOTIVATION: The combined effect of high replication rate and low fidelity of viral polymerase in most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses leads to the formation of a viral quasi-species. Uncovering information about quasi-species populations greatly benefits the study of disease progression, antiviral drug development, vaccine development, and viral pathogenesis. We present a new analysis pipeline called ViQuaS for the reconstruction of viral quasispecies spectra using short next-generation sequencing reads. ViQuaS is based on a novel reference-based de novo assembly algorithm for constructing local haplotypes. A significantly extended version of an existing global strain reconstruction algorithm is also used. RESULTS: Benchmarking results showed that ViQuaS outperformed three other previously published methods called ShoRAH, QuRe and PredictHaplo with improvements of at least 3.1-53.9% in retrieval, 0-12.1% in precision and 0-38 .2% in F-score related to stretch sequence composition and improvements of at least 0.006-0.143 in KL divergence and 0.001-0.035 in root mean square error related to stretch frequency estimation over the next best algorithm under different simulation settings.

890,"Mixed triple: related viruses in unique, recent isolates of the highly virulent type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus detected by deep sequencing","WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION: In February 2013, very severe acute clinical symptoms were observed in calves, heifers and dairy cattle on several farms in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, Germany. Deep sequencing revealed the coexistence of three distinct genome variants within novel highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2) isolates. While the majority (approximately 95%) of the population had a duplication of a 222 nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7 NS2 coding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. In addition, unusual mutations were found within the highly conserved p7 protein and near the p7 NS2 cleavage site in both variants. Using a reverse genetic system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it could be shown that duplication-free genomes are generated de novo from duplication-containing genomes during replication. The major variant with duplication is compulsorily accompanied by the minor variant without duplication. The prediction of the RNA secondary structure enabled the analysis of the unique but stable mixture of three BVDV variants and also provided the explanation for their formation. Finally, our results suggest that the duplicating variant plays the major role in the highly virulent phenotype. SIGNIFICANCE: This study emphasizes the importance of full genome deep sequencing combined with manual in-depth data analysis for studying viruses in basic research and diagnostics. Here we examined recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus isolates from a series of outbreaks in 2013. We discovered a unique feature of the viral genome, an unstable 222-nucleotide duplication that is eventually deleted by viral polymerase activity, resulting in an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all isolates examined. Our study is of great importance to the field, as we show that these insertion/deletion events enable another level of genome plasticity of plus-strand RNA viruses, in addition to the known polymerase-induced single nucleotide variations, which are widely considered to be the most important become the basis for viral adaptation and evolution.",,"Jenckel, M.;Hoper, D.;Schirrmeier, H.;Reimann, I.;Goller, K.

891,"Identification of two novel reassortant avian influenza A viruses (H5N6) in whooper swans in Korea, 2016","Background: On November 20, 2016, two new strains of the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus (HPAIVs) were isolated from three whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) in Gangjin Bay, South Jeolla Province, South Korea. The identification of HPAIVs in wild birds is important due to the potential risk of transmission of these viruses to poultry and humans. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gangjin H5N6 viruses were classified in the Asian H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage and were distinguishable from H5N8 and H5N1 HPAIVs previously isolated in Korea. With the exception of the acid polymerase (PA) gene, the viruses were most closely related to A/duck/Guangdong/01.01SZSGXJK005-Y/2016 (H5N6) (98.90~99.74%). The PA genes of the two novel Gangjin H5N6 viruses were most closely related to AIV isolates previously isolated from Korea, A/hooded crane/Korea/1176/2016 (H1N1) (99.16%) and A/environment/ Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) (98.65%). The absence of newer viruses according to A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) indicates the need for analysis of new wild bird AIVs isolated in Korea as they may provide further clues to the origin of these novel reassortant H5N6 viruses . Conclusions: Although research into the origins and epidemiology of these infections is ongoing, the most likely route of infection for the whooper swans was direct or indirect contact with reassortant viruses shed by migratory wild birds in Korea. Because H5N6-HPAIV can potentially be transmitted to poultry and humans, continued surveillance of AIV in wild birds will help mitigate this risk.",,"Jeong, J.;Woo, C.;Ip, H.

Genontologic (GO) analyzes of the DEGs from these comparisons indicated that ORFV could elicit a strong immune response of the host cells in the early stage of infection. Furthermore, GO and network analysis revealed that positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis were integrated into the host cells by up- or down-regulating the expression level of DEGs involved in apoptotic signaling pathways to achieve oral mucosal tissue homeostasis during exposure to ORFV -Infection. In summary, our study describes for the first time the direct effects of ORFV on its host's global host gene expression using high-throughput RNA sequencing, which provides a resource for future characterization of the interaction mechanism between the mammalian host and ORFV.",,"Jia, H.;Zhan, L.;Wang, X.;He, X.;Chen, G.;Zhang, Y.;Feng, Y.;Wei, Y.;Zhang, Y.;Jing, Z.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0186681,0
897,Phylogenetic analysis using the E2 gene of classical swine fever virus reveals a new subgenotype in China,"Outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF) have caused severe economic consequences in China. Phylogenetic analyzes based on full-length E2 gene sequences showed that five classical swine fever virus (CSFV) isolates collected in Hunan province in 2011 and 2012, along with seven other isolates from neighboring Guangdong provinces (5) and Guangxi (2) these could be classified as a new subgenotype 2.1c, possibly endemic to southern China for at least fourteen years. Isolates of subgenotype 2.1c share 90.2-94.9% and 89.9-93.8% nucleotide sequence similarity separately with those of subgenotypes 2.1a and 2.1b in the E2 gene, which are lower than the nucleotide identities between subgenotypes 2.1a and 2.1b (91.1-95.7%) . Further analysis based on a partial E2 gene sequence (216.nt) showed that isolates of subgenotype 2.1c are also circulating in Thailand. E2 amino acid sequence alignment revealed that isolates of subgenotype 2.1c have SPA. a†'.

898,[The Genotyping and Molecular Evolution of Varicella Zoster Virus],"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV, human herpesvirus 3) is a member of the family Herpesviridae and is classified along with HSV-1 and HSV-2 as an alpha subfamily. VZV is the causative agent of chickenpox (varicella), mainly in children, after which it establishes a latency period in the sensory ganglia with the potential for reactivation at a later date to cause shingles (zoster). In recent years, molecular epidemiological studies have increasingly been conducted to monitor mutations in the VZV genome, distinguish vaccine viruses from wild-type viruses, study the phylogeny of VZV strains around the world, and understand the evolution of the different clades of VZV. The advances have major implications for the fields of epidemiology, virology and bioinformatics.

899,Integrative analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs of piglet lung alveolar macrophages during H1N1 swine influenza A virus infection,"H1N1 swine influenza A virus (H1N1 SwIV) is an important subtype of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. MiRNAs relevant to H1N1 SwIV have rarely been reported. To understand the biological functions of miRNAs during H1N1-SwIV infection, this study profiled differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in piglet pulmonary alveolar macrophages during H1N1-SwIV infection using a deep sequencing approach validated by real-time quantitative PCR became. Compared to the control group, 70 and 16 DE miRNAs were identified on post-infection day (PID) 4 and PID 7, respectively. 56 DE miRNAs were identified between PID 4 and PID 7. Our results suggest that most host miRNAs are downregulated in defense against H1N1-SwIV infection during the acute phase of swine influenza, while their expression levels gradually return to normal during the recovery phase to avoid the occurrence of too severe lung injury in pigs. In addition, targets of DE miRNAs were also obtained, for which bioinformatic analyzes were performed. Our results would be useful to study the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in human influenza, since pigs serve as an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of human influenza.",,"Jiang, P.;Zhou, N.;Chen, X.;Zhao, X.;Li, D.;Wang, F.;Bi, L.;Zhang, D.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep08167,0
900,Transcriptome analysis shows dynamic changes in HEK 293T cells infected with coxsackievirus A16,"BACKGROUND: Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and Enterovirus 71 (EV71) are two of the major causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Although many studies have focused on infection and pathogenic mechanisms, the host cell transcriptome profile after CVA16 infection is still largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we compared the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of human embryonic kidney 293T cells infected and uninfected with CVA16. We highlighted that the transcription of SCARB2, a cellular receptor for both CVA16 and EV71, was upregulated almost 10-fold in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. CVA16-induced upregulation of SCARB2 transcription may increase the possibility of subsequent infection of CVA16/EV71, resulting in coinfection with two viruses in a single cell. This explanation would partially explain the cocirculation and genetic recombination of a large number of EV71 and CVA16 viruses. Based on a correlation analysis of miRNAs and genes, we speculated that the high expression of SCARB2 is modulated by downregulation of miRNA has-miR-3605-5p. At the same time, we found that differentially expressed miRNA target genes are mainly reflected in the interaction between extracellular membranes (ECM) and receptors and in circadian rhythm signaling pathways, which may be related to clinical symptoms of patients infected with CVA16, such as e.g. B. Aphthous ulcers, cough, myocarditis, drowsiness and possibly meningoencephalitis. The miRNAs hsa-miR-149-3p and hsa-miR-5001-5p can upregulate genes in these morbid signaling pathways associated with CVA16 and cause other clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The present study elucidated the changes in 293T cells after CVA16 infection at the transcriptome level, which contain upregulated SCARB2 and genes involved in ECM-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm signaling pathways, as well as important miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression. These results provided new insights into the pathogenesis of HFMD induced by CVA16 infection.",,"Jin, J.;Li, R.;Jiang, C.;Zhang, R.;Ge, X.;Liang, F.;Sheng, X.;Dai, W.;Chen, M.;Wu, J.;Xiao, J.;Su, W.",2017.0,01 25,,0

The enveloped virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kilobases that is 5'-capped and has a 3'-polyadenylation tract. The complete genome sequence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Peking isolate, was determined by cloning sequencing and primer walking. The entire genome is 27733 nucleotides long and has ten open reading frames: 5'-orf1a-orf1ab-s-3a-3b-em-6a-6b-n-3'. Alignments of the genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate with those of two AIBV strains and one SARS coronavirus were each performed. The genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate compared to that of the IBV strain LX4 (incomplete, 19440 bp) was 91.2% similar. However, the full genome sequence of the IBV Beijing isolate was 85.2% identical to that of the IBV strain Beaudette and only 50.8% homologous to that of the SARS coronavirus. The results showed that the genome of IBV shows remarkable variation. And the IBV Beijing isolate is not closely related to the SARS coronavirus. Phylogenetic analyzes based on the entire genome sequence, S protein, M protein and N protein also showed that the AIBV Beijing isolate is a solitary virus in group III and is distant from the SARS coronavirus.

903,Detection and molecular characterization of enteric viruses in breeding turkeys,"The present study was performed to detect and characterize enteric viruses (rotavirus, astrovirus, reovirus and coronavirus) in breeding chicks. Five turkey breeding flocks were selected. Fecal samples were collected from all flocks at 1 week of age and then every two weeks until the chicks reached 9 weeks of age. The fecal samples were pooled in groups of five. Of the 193 pools (""Samples"") tested by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, 47.2%, 30.6% and 10.4% of the Samples were positive for Astrovirus, Rotavirus and Reovirus, respectively. The coronavirus was not detected in any of the samples. A total of 118 (61.1%) specimens were positive for one or more enteric viruses. Of the 118 samples, 70 (59.3%) were positive for a single virus and 48 (40.7%) for a combination of viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the polymerase gene showed that astroviruses clustered into two groups with sequence homology ranging from 85.6 to 100% at the nucleotide level. Based on the NSP4 gene sequences, rotaviruses clustered in a group and shared 96.3 to 99.9% sequence homology at the nucleotide level. The reoviruses clustered into a single group based on their S4 gene sequences with 96.9 to 100% sequence homology. Different amino acid sequences of all three viruses can influence the antigenicity and/or pathogenicity of these viruses and require further investigation.

908,Rat hepatitis E virus: geographic accumulation within Germany and serological detection in wild Norwegian rats (Rattus norvegicus),"Zoonotic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in developed countries is thought to be caused by transmission from wild boar, domestic pigs, and deer as reservoir hosts. The detection of HEV-specific antibodies in rats and other rodents has suggested that these animals may represent an additional source of transmission of HEV to humans. Recently, a novel HEV (ratHEV) was discovered in Norwegian rats from Hamburg, Germany, which shows the typical genome organization but large nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence to other mammalian and avian HEV strains. Here we describe the multiple detection of ratHEV RNA and HEV-specific antibodies in Norway rats from other cities in north-east and south-west Germany. Full genome analysis of two novel strains from Berlin and Stuttgart confirmed the association of ratHEV with Norwegian rats. The available data indicate a persistence of this virus in the rat populations from Berlin and Hamburg. Phylogenetic analysis of a short stretch of open reading frame 1 confirmed a geographical clustering of the corresponding sequences. Serological studies using recombinant rat HEV and genotype 3 capsid protein derivatives revealed antigenic differences which could be caused by the high divergence in amino acid sequences in the immunodominant region. The high number of animals showing only ratHEV RNA or anti-ratHEV antibodies indicated a non-persistent infection in the Norwegian rat. Future studies need to demonstrate the transmission routes of the virus in rat populations and its zoonotic potential.

Genotypes 3 and 4 have been identified in parallel in pigs, wild boar and other animal species and their zoonotic potential has been confirmed. Until 2010, these genotypes, along with avian HEV strains that infected chickens, were the only known members of the Hepeviridae family. Subsequently, other HEV-related viruses were detected in wild boar, various HEV-like viruses were identified in rats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, foxes, bats and moose, and a distantly related pathogen was described in closely related salmonids.

911,Epidemiology of rabies in south-eastern Europe,"Rabies remains endemic in a number of countries in south-eastern Europe, including Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. With the likely eastward enlargement of the European Union, rabies control programs are likely to be stepped up to reduce the disease burden in the new accession countries. Before launching such programs, a clear understanding of the epidemiology of the virus in this part of Europe is crucial. With the exception of Turkey, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the most important disease reservoir in south-eastern Europe. However, cases of rabies in dogs (Canis familiaris) are reported regularly. In contrast to northern Europe, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) does not appear to be a vector in the south. This study summarizes the current rabies situation in south-eastern Europe and reveals the phylogenetic relationships between the viruses in a number of countries in the Region. Rabies virus RNA was extracted from original samples and a fragment of the nucleoprotein gene was amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR. Automated sequencing was used to deduce nucleoprotein gene sequences and these were used to construct a molecular phylogeny of rabies viruses in south-eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, the dog is the main vector that brings rabies into contact with humans and livestock. However, other species can also act as a reservoir for the disease, making it difficult to develop elimination strategies. The fox is the main reservoir species for rabies in Romania, although cases in dogs are regularly reported. Despite a gradual decline in canine rabies, urban herds of the disease still exist in many regions of Turkey. In addition, there is some evidence that the fox was an important vector for rabies and may be responsible for the increase in rabies in cattle in the country's Aegean region. There is evidence of cross-border rabies movements by both wild animals and dogs throughout the region.",,"Johnson, N.;Freuling, C.;Vos, A.;Un, H.;Valtchovski, R.;Turcitu, M.;Dumistrescu, F.;Vuta, V.;Velic, R.;Sandrac, V.;Aylan, O.;MÃ¼ller, T.;Fooks, A.

912,The antibiotic Carbadox contained in the feed induces phage gene transcription in the microbiome of the pig intestine,"Carbadox is a quinoxaline di-N-oxide antibiotic that is fed to over 40% of young pigs in the United States and has been shown to induce phage DNA transduction in vitro; However, the effects of carbadox on the functions of the pig microbiome are poorly understood. We investigated the in vivo longitudinal effects of carbadox on microbial gene expression in pig intestines (fecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (fecal dsDNA viromes). Microbial metagenome, transcriptome and virome sequences were annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function using FIGfam (isofunctional homolog sequences) and SEED subsystem databases. When the beta diversities of FIGfam microbial annotations were compared, the control and carbadox communities were distinct 2 days after carbadox introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-associated lower expression of FIGfams (n=66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization, and RNA metabolism (q<0.1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects within specific populations. Interestingly, treatment with carbadox 2 days after carbadox introduction (q ≤0.07) resulted in greater expression of FIGfams associated with all stages of the phage lytic cycle, suggesting carbadox-mediated induction of prophage and phage DNA recombination suggests. These effects were reduced by 7 days of continuous dietary carbadox, indicating an acute effect. In addition, the viromes contained a few genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics, but these did not change in frequency over time or with treatment. Results demonstrate reduced bacterial growth and metabolism, prophage induction and potential transduction of bacterial fitness genes in porcine gut bacterial communities as a result of carbadox administration. IMPORTANCE FDA regulations governing the use of antibiotics in agriculture have focused on antibiotics that are important to human medicine. Carbadox is an antibiotic that is not used in humans but is commonly used on US pig farms. It is important to investigate potential side effects of using Carbadox as it has been shown to promote bacterial evolution, which may indirectly affect antibiotic resistance of clinically important bacteria. Interestingly, the present study shows greater prophage gene expression in the faeces of carbadox-fed animals than in the faeces of non-medicated animals 2 days after the start of carbadox-feeding treatment. Importantly, the phage genetic material isolated in this study contained genes that could confer resistance to antibiotics important in human medicine, suggesting that antibiotic resistance genes relevant to humans are mobile between bacteria via phages. This study highlights the side effects of antibiotics and shows the need to consider different antibiotic effects when using antibiotics or considering new regulations.",,"Johnson, T.

Next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to advance the understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD- improve cattle. However, it has not yet been used to study the bovine lower respiratory tract microbiome. The aim of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in postmortem lung and lymph node tissue samples collected from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and corresponding mediastinal lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were collected from calves diagnosed with BRD cases by veterinary laboratory pathologists and from clinically healthy calves. NGS 16S amplicon libraries targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) were used to determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results: Leptotriciaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of calves that died from BRD. Leptotriciaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella, and Bacteroides showed higher relative abundances in postmortem lung specimens collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves compared to clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in postmortem lymph node specimens collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves compared to clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were then assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences. Conclusions: The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and the mediastinal lymph node of calves that died of BRD and of clinically healthy HF calves were characterized. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotriciaceae OTU have been sequenced and found not to be identical to any known genus of bacteria. This indicates that we have identified a new species of bacteria associated with BRD.",,"Johnston, D.;Earley, B.;Cormican, P.;Murray, G.;Kenny, D. A.;Waters, S. M.;McGee, M.;Kelly, A. K.;McCabe, M.

914,Identification of avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 in chicken farms in Indonesia,"The avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 (AIV-H9N2) has become established in poultry in Asia and Africa. AIV-H9N2 has not previously been reported in Indonesia. Here we describe the presence of AIV-H9N2 in chicken farms in Indonesia. 99 cases were observed in different provinces of Indonesia. Clinical signs, pathological lesions and egg production were recorded. Confirmation was by virus isolation, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. To construct the hemagglutinin (HA) phylogeny, the secondary data of the Eurasian lineages were downloaded from GenBank. For neuraminidase, five sequences with the highest similarities to any sequence found in this study were downloaded. The phylogeny was derived using the neighbor joining method in the MEGA6 package. 49 AIV-H9N2 positive cases were observed, of which 35 tested positive for AIV-H9N2 only. The age of the infected chickens was 43.17 ± 16.56 weeks and their egg production was 35.85 ± 17.80% lower than before the outbreak. The BLAST search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the HA-encoding gene identified in this study shared 98% sequence identity with that of A/musk duck/Vietnam/LBM719/2014(H9N2), while its neuraminidase-encoding gene sequences shared 94% shared 98% and 100% identities with three different influenza viruses. The phylogeny shows that the AIV-H9N2 HA found in this study forms a clear cluster with some sequence data from Vietnam and China. The NA sequence data form three distinct clusters. We conclude that AIV-H9N2 is widespread in many provinces of Indonesia.

915,"Molecular identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses infecting gray geese (Anser anser), feral pigeons (Columbia livia) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).","Given the discovery of a previously unknown coronavirus as the etiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is likely that other coronaviruses than those previously known are circulating in animal populations. The results of a coronavirus screening using universal coronavirus RT-PCR of the bird species greylag goose (Anser anser), wild pigeon (Columbia livia) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) are presented here. Corona viruses were found in cloaca swab samples of all three bird species. In the greylag goose, 40 out of 163 birds examined tested positive for coronavirus, while two pigeons out of 100 examined and one mallard duck out of five examined tested positive. The infected greylag geese showed lower body weights compared to virus-negative birds, indicating a clinical importance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyzes performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences showed that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch from the group III coronaviruses. All of the novel avian coronaviruses contained the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3-inch untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses revealed the presence of two additional goose coronavirus open reading frames with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins and one additional open reading frame Pigeon coronavirus reading frame with a predicted transmembrane domain downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. © 2005 SGM.",,"Jonassen, C.

916,Phylogenetic Analysis of Bovine Pestiviruses: Testing the Development of Clinical Symptoms,"This study presents a phylogenetic analysis of 115 bovine pestiviruses. A sequence dataset preceding the 5' untranslated genomic region was analyzed using maximal sparsity, bootstrapping, and sparsity jackknifing. We tested the group's proposed classifications and analyzed the development of symptoms associated with pestivirus infections in cattle. Based on the historical framework provided by our phylogenetic trees, we have also characterized the extent and importance of the contamination of biologics by the virus. Our phylogenetic analyzes showed that the previously defined genotypes are monophyletic. except genotype 1a. Based on our cladograms, we propose the existence of more than 12 monophyletic groups within species BVDV 1. Mapping of clinical symptoms suggests that the appearance of some genotypes may have been caused by an alteration in the pathogenic process. Enteric problems appear to be ancestral, while reproductive and respiratory problems arise with the appearance of genotypes 1b, 1d and the Arg 1 genotype proposed here. The distribution of contaminating strains on the cladograms indicates that pestivirus contamination is a common process and also suggests that a contaminated product could be a vehicle for viral spread. Implications for virus evolution, virus taxonomy, veterinary medicine and biotechnology are discussed. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2004.",,"Jones, L. R.;Cigliano, M. M.;Zandomeni, R. O.;Weber, E.

917,Homologous Recombination in Bovine Pestiviruses - Phylogenetic and Statistical Evidence,"Bovine pestiviruses (Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1 (BVDV 1) and Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 2 (BVDV 2)) belong to the genus Pestivirus (Flaviviridae), which consists of positive-stranded RNA viruses and causes significant economic losses worldwide. We used phylogenetic and bootstrap analyzes to systematically scan alignments of previously sequenced genomes to further explore the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for virus variation. Previously published data suggest that homologous crossover may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the genomic rearrangements observed in cytopathic (cp) strains of bovine pestiviruses. Nevertheless, homologous recombination involves not only homologous crossings, but also the exchange of a homologous region of the acceptor RNA. Furthermore, cytopathic strains represent dead paths in evolution since they are isolated exclusively from the fatal cases of mucosal disease. Here we report evidence for homologous inter-genotype recombination in the genome of a non-cytopathic (ncp) strain of Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1, the type species of the genus Pestivirus. We also show that homologous recombination within the genotype could be a common phenomenon in both types of pestivirus. This evidence shows that homologous recombination contributes to the diversification of bovine pestiviruses in nature. Implications for virus evolution, taxonomy and phylogenetics are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Jones, L. R.;Weber, E. L.",2004.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2004.04.004,0
918,Occurrence of the virulence-associated PB2 E627K substitution in a fatal human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A (H7N7) infection as determined by Illumina ultra-deep sequencing,"Bird flu viruses are able to cross species barriers and infect humans. Although evidence of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses is so far limited, the evolution of variants towards more efficient human-to-human transmission could lead to a new influenza virus pandemic. In both avian influenza A (H5N1) and recently emerging avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses, the E627K mutation of the polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2) appears to be critical for human adaptation. During a major outbreak of influenza A(H7N7) virus in the Netherlands in 2003, the A(H7N7) virus isolated from a fatal human case contained the PB2 E627K mutation and a hemagglutinin (HA) K416R mutation .

920,Detection of fowlpox virus carrying different genome segments of reticuloendothelosis virus,"Fowlpox virus (FWPV), the type species of the genus Avipoxvirus family Poxviridae, is a large double-stranded DNA virus that causes fowlpox in chickens and turkeys. Remarkably, avian retroviral reticuloendothelosis virus (REV) sequences are frequently found integrated into the genome of FWPV. While some FWPV strains carry residues of the REV long terminal repeats (LTRs), other strains have been shown to contain nearly full-length inserts of the REV provirus in their genome. In the present study, we discovered heterogeneous FWPV populations carrying the REV-LTR or the almost complete REV provirus genome in a Merriam (Meleagris gallopavo merriami) wild turkey. The bird had papules distributed over the non-feathered areas of the head. Avipoxvirus-like virions were observed in the lesions by transmission electron microscopy and the presence of FWPV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing performed on nucleic acid extracted from the skin lesions revealed two FWPV genomic populations carrying either a 197 nt remnant of the REV LTR or a 7939 nt fragment encoding the full-length REV provirus is equivalent to. Notably, PCR amplification using primers targeting FWPV sequences flanking the REV insertion site confirmed the natural occurrence of the heterogeneous FWPV genomic populations in an additional clinical specimen from another fowlpox-infested turkey. In addition, sequencing of a historical FWPV isolate obtained from chickens in the US in 2000 also revealed the presence of the two FWPV-REV genome populations. The results here demonstrate distinct FWPV populations that contain variable segments of the REV genome integrated into their genome. These different genomic populations are likely the result of homologous recombination events that take place during FWPV replication.",,"Joshi, L. R.;Bauermann, F. V.;Hain, K. S.;Kutish, G.

922,Generation of henipavirus nucleocapsid proteins in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Hendra and Nipah viruses are emerging zoonotic viruses and their genomes share nucleotide and predicted amino acid homologies that place them in the Paramyxoviridae family. Currently, these viruses are classified in the new genus Henipavirus within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. The genes encoding HeV and NiV nucleocapsid proteins were cloned into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector pFGG3 under the control of the GAL7 promoter. A high level of expression of these proteins (18-20 mg/l yeast culture) was obtained. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the primary structure of both proteins with 92% sequence coverage obtained using MS/MS analysis. Electron microscopy revealed the assembly of typical herringbone structures of purified recombinant nucleocapsid proteins characteristic of other paramyxoviruses. The nucleocapsid proteins showed stability in yeast and can be easily purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation. HeV nucleocapsid protein was detected by sera derived from HeV-infected fruit bats, humans and horses, and NiV nucleocapsid protein was immunodetected with sera from fruit bats, humans and pigs.

Here we characterize ALV-J strain PDRC-59831, a newly studied US isolate of ALV-J. Five-day-old chick embryos were infected with this virus, and the chicks developed myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas within 2 months of hatching. To investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations into the MET gene in two of the five hemangiomas examined. This integration site has not been seen in previous work characterizing ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis. MET is a well-known proto-oncogene that acts through a variety of signaling pathways and is involved in many neoplasms.

924,Common viral integration sites identified in avian leukosis virus-induced B-cell lymphomas,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces B-cell lymphoma and other neoplasms in chickens by integrating into or near cancer genes and interfering with their expression. Four genes - MYC, MYB, Mir-155 and TERT - have previously been identified as common integration sites in these virus-induced lymphomas and are believed to play a causative role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing to identify additional genes that drive tumorigenesis in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. In addition to the four previously implicated genes, we identify other genes as common integration sites, including TNFRSF1A, MEF2C, CTDSPL, TAB2, RUNX1, MLL5, CXorf57, and BACH2. We also analyze the genome-wide ALV integration landscape in vivo and find an increased frequency of ALV integration near transcription start sites and within transcripts. Previous work has shown that ALV prefers a weak consensus sequence for integration into cultured human cells. We confirm this consensus sequence for ALV integration in vivo in the chicken genome. IMPORTANCE Avian leukosis virus induces B-cell lymphomas in chickens. Previous studies showed that ALV can induce tumors through insertional mutagenesis, and several genes have been implicated in the development of these tumors. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing to reveal the genome-wide ALV integration landscape in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. We find increased levels of ALV integration near transcription start sites and use joint integration site analysis to greatly expand the number of genes involved in the development of these tumors.

926,Genetic heterogeneity of Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) isolates from Turkey: identification of a new subgroup in BVDV-1,"The genetic heterogeneity of Turkish ruminant pestiviruses was examined by phylogenetic analysis of complete Npro-coding nucleotide sequences. A total of 30 virus isolates obtained from 15 provinces of the country between 1997 and 2005 were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The virus isolates were mainly from cattle, with one isolate from sheep. The bovine isolates all belonged to BVDV-1, the sheep isolates to BVDV-2. Fifteen isolates formed a new subgroup within BVDV-1, tentatively named BVDV-11. The remaining bovine isolates were typed as BVDV-1a (n=4), BVDV-1b (n=4), BVDV-1d (n=3), BVDV-1f (n=2) and BVDV-1h (n=1). ). The isolates assigned to BVDV-11 came from different geographical regions in different years. There was no correlation between genetic grouping and the locations from which isolates were obtained. Viruses originating from one farm belonged to the same subgroup in most cases (n=5). This study indicates that the newly discovered subgroup BVDV-1l is predominant and widespread in Turkey. In addition, a sheep virus isolate was identified as the first member of BVDV-2 to be reported in Turkey.

The viruses studied were adapted to grow in a porcine epithelial cell line (KSEK6) and were shown to exhibit a prominent CPE in advance. These viruses were successively passaged in the monocyte cultures regardless of the occurrence of CPE. The 3rd passage cultures were titered for infectivity using KSEK6 cells. Of the viruses examined, only Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) was able to multiply in the monocytes. Four ADV strains, two virulent and two attenuated strains, were compared for growth in two cell lines. The final amount of infectious progeny measured after 72 hours of incubation at 36.5 degrees C was almost in a similar order between 2 cell lines. However, the amount of infectious progeny produced at 24 hours of incubation was higher in SW/K99 cells than in KSEK6 cells. The appearance of CPE was also more evident in SW/K99 cells in an early incubation. The data show that the viral susceptibility of monocytes to ADV is higher than that of the epithelium.

929,Partial sequence of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of avian adenoviruses: a reference panel for general diagnostic PCR in poultry,"Adenoviruses are common infectious agents in various poultry species. The traditional serological typing of new isolates by virus neutralization tests is now being replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs recommended for the detection of adenoviruses were designed to target the gene of the main capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the family Adenoviridae can be found. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry had to be devised. A much more sensitive PCR targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene has recently been described. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses regardless of their genus. Avian adenoviruses (FAdVs) isolated from chickens to date comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has only been determined from three FAdV types representing three species. In the present work, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was completed with those of the other FAdVs. The newly determined sequences will facilitate the identification of new FAdV isolates as an existing species or as a putative new FAdV. Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for amplification of the hexon and other genes can be designed and performed according to the preliminary species classification.",,"KajÃ¡n, G.;Sameti, S.;Benko, M.",2011.0,,10.1556/AVet.2011.006,0

JEV can cause febrile illness and encephalitis mainly in humans and horses and occasionally in cattle. At the end of September 2010, a 114-month-old cow presented with neurological symptoms similar to those observed in previous cases of bovine Japanese encephalitis (JE); therefore we performed virological and pathological tests on the cow. As a result, JEV was isolated from the cerebrum of the affected cow. We determined the complete genome sequence of the JEV isolate, which we named JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, including the envelope (E) gene region and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Our E region and full genome phylogenetic analyzes indicated that the isolate belongs to JEV genotype 1 (G1). The isolate JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010 was most closely related to several JEV G1 isolates in Toyama Prefecture, Japan between 2007 and 2009 according to E region phylogenetic analysis. In addition, nucleotide alignment showed that the deletion in the 3'UTR was the same in JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010 and several other JEV G1 isolates identified in Toyama Prefecture in 2008-2009. A haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed to detect anti-JEV antibodies in the affected cow and the test detected 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)-sensitive HI antibodies to JEV in the serum of the affected cow. Histopathological examination revealed nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in the affected cow and immunohistochemical assay detected JEV antigen in the cerebrum. We diagnosed the case as JE in a cow based on the findings of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis observed in the central nervous system, JEV antigen was detected in cerebrum, JEV was isolated from cerebrum, and 2-ME-sensitive HI antibodies to JEV in serum have been proven.

Influenza viruses cause annual human epidemics, seasonal and pandemics. Seasonal influenza epidemics caused by influenza A and B viruses result in 3-5 million severe cases and thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Influenza pandemics caused by the influenza A virus occur at unpredictable intervals. Influenza A virus will cause epidemics and pandemics due to its spread of migratory birds, pigs, horses and humans. Transmission can occur from person to person through pathogens, coughing and sneezing. Pandemics are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality compared to seasonal influenza. Four such pandemics have occurred in the past century, 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009. Influenza B causes only human-to-human spread, emphasizing that no other hosts are involved and therefore not involved in pandemics. Influenza C is a mild disease.[1] It causes seasonal influenza episodes such as northern infections when they occur from September to March while southern infections occur from May to September. Due to the variation of viruses responsible for infections in these two seasons; it needs two different sets of vaccines.

934,(Hochpathogene) Vogelgrippe als Zoonoseerreger,"Zoonotic pathogens that challenge the world every year are influenza A viruses. Human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses have occurred periodically in the past. Wild waterfowl are carriers of the full diversity of influenza virus A subtypes and are therefore most likely the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. While avian influenza viruses are generally of low pathogenicity (LPAIV) in their natural avian reservoir, some have acquired virulence by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible chicken fowl. These so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) then cause mass mortality in susceptible birds and lead to enormous economic losses when poultry is affected. In addition to a number of avian influenza virus subtypes that have sporadically infected mammals, the HPAIV H5N1 Asia has strong zoonotic characteristics and has been transmitted from birds to various mammalian species, including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses could be descended directly from avian influenza viruses or arise after genetic rearrangement between avian and mammalian viruses. So far, HPAIV H5N1 already fulfills two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype, it has not yet appeared in the human population and has infected at least 438 people and caused severe illness and high mortality in 262 people to date (August 2019 2009). Acquiring efficient human-to-human transmission would complete the emergence of a new pandemic virus. Therefore, tackling H5N1 at its source is a prerequisite to reducing the pandemic risks posed by this virus. Other influenza viruses considered pandemic candidates are of the H2, H7, and H9 subtypes, all of which have infected humans in the past.

936,Evidence of the co-circulation of enteric viruses in wastewater and in the population of Greater Cairo,"Aims: To characterize the major enteric viruses (Enterovirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus and Adenovirus) in Greater Cairo wastewater and to compare the results with clinical data collected during the same period. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-two wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants were collected from April 2006 to February 2007. Enteroviruses, noroviruses (NoVs) and rotaviruses (RVs) were detected by RT-PCR in 22%, 18% and 8x, respectively. 3% of samples. No adenovirus and astrovirus were detected. G2P[8], G9P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and rare G12 RV isolates as well as one bovine RV have been identified in the environment. The environmental NoV strains mostly belonged to genogroup I (84%). Rotavirus and some of the NoVs were similar to those found in the clinical specimens at the same time. Conclusions: Comparison of environmental and clinical data suggests that similar RV and NoV isolates were circulating in the environment and in the population over the same time period.

937,A simple method for parallel deep sequencing of whole influenza A genomes,"Given the major threat to human and animal health posed by influenza A and its ability to evolve rapidly through mutation and rearrangement, tools that enable its timely characterization are needed to help monitor its evolution and spread. For this purpose, deep sequencing can be a very valuable tool. This study reports a comprehensive method that enables deep sequencing of the whole genome of influenza A subtypes using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx). Using this method, the entire genomes of nine viruses were sequenced in parallel, encoding the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, the human H5N1 virus, and the porcine H1N1 virus, in a single lane of a GAIIx flow cell to an average depth of 122 -fold represent . This technique can be applied to cultured and uncultured viruses. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Kampmann, M. L.;Fordyce, S. L.;Ãvila-Arcos, M. C.;Rasmussen, M.;Willerslev, E.;Nielsen, L. P.;Gilbert, M. T.

938,"Nucleotide sequence of avian carcinoma virus MH2: Two potential onc genes, one related to avian virus MC29 and the other related to murine sarcoma virus 3611","The 5.2 kilobase (kb) avian carcinoma virus MH2 RNA genome has the genetic structure 5'-γgag (0.2 kg)-mhg (1.2 kg)-myc (1.4 kb)-c (0, 4kg)-poly)A) (0.2kb)-3'. γgag is a partial retroviral core protein gene, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. Here we determined the nucleotide sequence of 3.5 kb from the 3' end of γg to the 3' end of the molecularly cloned MH2 proviral DNA to elucidate the genetic structure of the virus and compare it to other mht- and myc-containing ones oncogenic virus and the chicken protomyc gene. The following results were obtained: (i) γgag-mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides ending with a stop codon near the 3' end of MHT. The 3,969 nucleotides from mht to the stop codon are 80% sequence related to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc sequence is preceded by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the cellular proto-myc gene and is linked up to a 3' termination codon and 40 non-coding nucleotides with the avian myc sequences. Retrovirus MC29 and chicken colinear proto-myc. Thus, myc forms a second MH2-specific gene together with a 5' retroviral exon. (iii) myc is followed by the 3'-terminal c-region of approximately 400 nucleotides, which is collinear with that of Rous sarcoma virus except for one Substitution near the 5' end of the long terminal repeat. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the γgag-mht gene, which is closely related to the MSV 3611 γgag-raf transforming gene, and the myc gene, which is related to the MSV 3611 transforming gene MC29. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the cellular proto-onc genes, which become viral onc genes upon sequence transfer, are a small group, since out of the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses, from which the mht/raf The homology has so far been determined most closely.",,"Kan, N.

939,"Impact of emergence of coxsackievirus A6 on hand, foot and mouth disease epidemic in Osaka City, Japan","Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute febrile illness characterized by fever; Sore throat; and blistering rash on hands, feet and oral mucosa. Until 2010, HFMD in Japan was predominantly associated with enterovirus (EV) A71 and coxsackievirus (CV) A16. In 2011, CV-A6 emerged as the primary pathogen, causing the largest HFMD epidemic in Japan since 1981. Since then, CV-A6 has caused major HFMD epidemics every 2 years. Phylogenetic analysis of complete viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences revealed that most of the CV-A6 strains detected in Osaka City from 2011 to 2015 were placed in a different clade than the CV-A6 strains identified by 1999 to 2009 were detected. The A6 strains detected in 2011 and most of the CV-A6 strains detected between 2013 and 2015 have been mainly divided into two distinct genetic groups. Each epidemic strain carried unique amino acid substitutions in the putative DE, EF, and GH loops of the VP1 protein exposed on the virion's surface. There is a possibility that the occurrence of substitutions on the surface of the virion and an accumulation of a susceptible population are significant factors in recent HFMD epidemics.",,"Kanbayashi, D.;Kaida, A.;Yamamoto, S.

940,Genetic characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N8 viruses isolated from wild birds in Egypt,"newly emerged H5N8 flu virus was isolated from green-winged teal in Egypt in December 2016. In this study, we provide a detailed characterization of the full genome of Egyptian H5N8 viruses and some virological features. Genetic analyzes showed that the Egyptian H5N8 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the genome of Egyptian H5N8 viruses was related to recently characterized clade 2.3.4.4 reassortant H5N8 viruses isolated from various Eurasian countries. Several peculiar mutations have been characterized in the Egyptian H5N8 viruses, which likely allow transmission and virulence of these viruses in mammals. The Egyptian H5N8 viruses preferentially bind to avian-like receptors over human-like receptors. The Egyptian H5N8 viruses were also fully susceptible to amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors. Chicken sera raised against commercial inactivated avian influenza H5 vaccines showed no or very little reactivity with the currently characterized H5N8 viruses, consistent with genetic dissimilarity.

941,Reassortant swine influenza viruses isolated in Japan contain genes from the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1).,"In 2013, three reassortant swine influenza viruses (SIVs) - two H1N2 and one H3N2 - were isolated from symptomatic pigs in Japan; each contained genes from the 2009 pandemic virus A(H1N1) and endemic SIVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H1N2 viruses, A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 and A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013, were reassortants containing genes from the following three distinct lineages: (i) H1 and Nucleoprotein (NP) genes derived from a classic porcine H1-HA lineage uniquely circulating among Japanese SIVs; (ii) neuraminidase (NA) genes from H1N2 porcine human-like viruses; and (iii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. The H3N2 virus, A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013, comprised genes from two sources: (i) hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes derived from H3N2 swine human and human-like viruses and (ii) other genes from Pandemic A( H1N1) 2009 viruses. The phylogenetic analysis also indicated that each of the reassortants could have arisen independently in Japanese pigs. A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 was found to have strong antigenic reactivities with antisera generated for some seasonal human lineage viruses isolated during or before 2003, while A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 reactivities with antisera against viruses isolated after 2004 were significantly weaker. In addition, antisera against some strains of seasonal human H1 viruses did not react with either A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 or A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013. These results indicate that the emergence and spread of these reassortant SIVs pose a potential public health risk. © 2014 The Societies and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",,"Kanehira, K.;Takemae, N.;Uchida, Y.;Hikono, H.;Saito, T.",2014.0,,10.1111/1348-0421.12152,0
942,"Genetic analyzes of avian influenza viruses in Mongolia, 2007–2009, and their relationships to Korean domestic and wild bird isolates","The present study was conducted to monitor wild birds based on fears that they could spread the avian influenza virus (AIV) between Mongolia and Korea, which share the same migration route. From 1,528 stool samples analyzed between 2007 and 2009, 21 low pathogenic AIV were isolated. Nineteen AIV-positive stool specimens were identified as Anseriformes by DNA barcoding. The most commonly isolated subtype was H3 (61.9%) and the most common hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination was H3N8 (52.4%). A phylogenetic analysis was performed to assess their genetic relationships with those of domestic and wild birds in Korea. The H3 and H7 surface genes belonged to the Eurasian lineage and clustered together in a group with Korean wild birds and poultry. Most of the N8 genes grouped phylogenetically with viruses isolated in Eurasia, while one of the Mongolian viruses and some Korean viruses belonged to the North American lineage. The internal gene acid polymerase protein was indistinguishable from the highly pathogenic H5N1-AIV of goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (gs/gd)-like virus.

943,Isolation of a reassortant H13N2 virus from a faecal sample of a mallard duck in South Korea,"Background: The virus subtype H13N2, A/mallard/Kr/SH38-45/2010 (H13N2), was first isolated from a faecal sample of a mallard duck in South Korea. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes revealed that this virus arose through genetic mixing between Eurasian and North American gene pools and possibly between wild ducks and gulls. The H13 and N2 surface genes clustered together in a group with Eurasian isolates from gulls and wild birds, respectively. The PB2, PA, NP, M and NS segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage, whereas the PB1 gene was clustered in the North American lineage. In addition, they showed a bird-dependent pattern in phylogenetic analysis: the M gene resembled viruses of the H13 subtype in seagulls, while other segments resembled the avian influenza viruses of other wild duck subtypes. Conclusions: The data suggest that the new reassortant H13N2 virus isolated in South Korea may have arisen through genetic rearrangement between intercontinental and interspecies transmission in wild birds. © 2012 Kang et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Kang, H.

Cell degeneration and necrosis were observed microscopically. Electron microscopy showed round or oval virions, 80 nm to 120 nm in diameter, surrounded by a spiked shell. The virus has been classified as low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) according to OIE standards. It was called A/Emu/HeNen/14/2004(H9N2)(Emu/HN/2004). The HA gene (168315p) was amplified by RT-PCR and compared to other animal H9N2 AIV sequences in GenBank, the US National Institutes of Health's genetic sequence database.

NDV genotype VII and genotype IX viruses have been the predominant circulating genotypes in China, which could potentially be responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken flocks in recent years. While ducks and geese usually presented inapparent infections. methods. In the present study, we examine the complete genome sequence, clinicopathological characterization, and transmission of two virulent Newcastle disease viruses, SS-10 and NH-10, isolated from domestic ducks in southern China in 2010. Results: F and complete gene sequences based on phylogenetic analysis showed that SS-10 (genotype VII) and NH-10 (genotype IX) belong to class II. The deduced amino acid sequence was <sup>(112)</sup>RRQK/RRF<sup>(117)</sup> at the fusion protein cleavage site. Animal experimental results showed that the SS-10 virus isolated from ducks was highly pathogenic to chickens and geese, but weakly pathogenic to ducks. It could be detected in the spleen, lungs, kidneys, trachea, small intestine, bursa, thymus, pancreas and cecal tonsils, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and transferred to the naive contact birds. In addition, it could be transmitted to chickens, ducks and geese through naive contact. However, the NH-10 virus isolated from ducks was able to infect some chickens, ducks and geese, but only resulted in the death of chickens. Also, it could be transmitted to the naïve contact chickens, ducks and geese. Conclusion: The two NDV isolates showed different biological properties in terms of pathogenicity and transmission in chickens, ducks and geese. Therefore, there is no species preference for fowl, duck, or goose viruses, and more attention should be paid to transmission of VII-NDVs between ducks, geese, and chickens between ducks, geese, and chickens for the control and eradication of ND.",,"Kang, Y.;Li, Y.;Yuan, R.;Li, X.;Sun, M.;Wang, Z.;Feng, M.;Jiao, P.;Ren, T.",2014.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-11-147,0
946,Phylogenetic and pathotypic characterization of Newcastle disease viruses circulating in southern China and transmission in different birds,"Although Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with high pathogenicity has been frequently isolated in poultry in China since 1948, the mode of its transmission among avian species is still largely unknown. Since various wild bird species are potential sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks and pigeons at live bird markets (LBMs) in southern China as part of an H7N9 surveillance program from December 2013 to February 2014. To simulate the natural transmission of different animal species in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVs namely GM, YF18 and GZ289 isolated from different birds to assess the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks and pigeons. In addition, to study the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks and pigeons with 106 EID50 of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hours after infection, the naïve contact groups were matched with those who had been vaccinated with each of the viruses to monitor contact transmission. Our results showed that genetically distinct viruses circulate in LBMs in southern China's Guangdong province, and that NDV from different birds exhibit different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted to different birds. We therefore propose continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBM to prevent the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and emphasize the need for virus-host relationship studies.",,"Kang, Y.;Xiang, B.;Yuan, R.;Zhao, X.;Feng, M.;Gao, P.;Li, Y.;Li, Y.;Ning, Z.;Ren, T.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00119,0
947,Isolation and characterization of a parapoxvirus from sheep with papular stomatitis,"An outbreak of papular stomatitis occurred in a flock of sheep in Hokkaido, Japan. Histological examination, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopic observation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. The lesions were characterized by epithelial hyperplasia, acanthosis, ballooning degeneration of the spinous layer and stratum granulosum. A parapox virus was isolated from the skin lesion of affected sheep and characterized genetically and antigenically. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the PCR product revealed an ORF virus (ORFV) specific pattern and the isolate reacted with monoclonal antibodies against ORFV. The partially deduced amino acid sequence of the viral envelope gene was identical to that of the major Japanese ORFVs. These results indicated that the outbreak was due to infection with the parapox virus. The isolated virus could be classified as an ORFV and was closely related to the major Japanese ORFVs but not to foreign ORFVs or other parapoxviruses.",,"Kanou, Y.;Inoshima, Y.;Shibahara, T.;Ishikawa, Y.;Kadota, K.;Ohashi, S.;Morioka, K.;Yoshida, K.;Yamada, S.",2005.0,Jul,,0

These avian reoviruses were analyzed phylogenetically and compared to sequences of avian reoviruses in the Genbank database. The avian reoviruses could be grouped into 5 different genotyping clusters and this classification was identical when comparing the sequences of the 5'-end, the 3'-end or the entire β-C protein open reading frame. Therefore, sequencing of both parts of the gene encoding β-C protein seems reliable for classification. We have been unable to identify a correlation between ÏƒC sequences of avian reoviruses and the disease state from which they were isolated. The sequences found in the Netherlands and Germany, like those in Taiwan, are more dispersed than the known avian reovirus Ïƒ C sequences in the US and Australia.

949,Hepatitis E virus in young pigs in Finland and characterization of the isolated partial genomic sequences of genotype 3 HEV,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections occur in pigs worldwide. Swine infection is usually subclinical, but HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic agents that cause sporadic, indigenous human cases of hepatitis E. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and dynamics of HEV infections in young pigs by analyzing a total of 273 faecal samples collected from six farrowing farms in order to genetically characterize the obtained HEV isolates and the phylogenetic relationships of HEV -to study isolates found in different pig farms in Finland. Fecal shedding of HEV of individual piglets was followed in two farms selected from five farms identified as HEV RNA positive. Excretion of HEV was found in 87.5% of the piglets. Piglets developed primary HEV infection 3-8 weeks after weaning, and at the time of transfer to fattening farms, virtually all (96.6%) of the pigs with a sample available at that time were still shedding the virus. According to phylogenetic analysis, all HEV isolates obtained belonged to HEV genotype 3, subtype e, and a separate farm-specific isolate was from 10 out of 11 farms examined. The results of our study indicate that HEV infection is very common in young pigs and HEV RNA positive pigs allow HEV transmission from farrowing to fattening farms, posing a potential risk of infection for pig farmers, and that genetic variation in HEVs from different originate farms arise.",,"Kantala, T.;Heinonen, M.;Oristo, S.;Von Bonsdorff, C.

950,Supersize me: How whole genome sequencing and big data are changing epidemiology,"In epidemiology, identifying ""who infected whom"" allows us to quantify key characteristics such as incubation times, heterogeneity in transmission rates, duration of contagiousness, and the presence of high-risk groups. Although invaluable, the existence of many plausible routes of infection makes this difficult and epidemiological contact tracing either unsafe, logistically prohibitive, or both. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technology is enabling the identification of traceable differences in the pathogen genome that are transforming our ability to understand high-resolution disease transmission, sometimes even down to the host-to-host scale. We review current examples of using whole genome sequencing of pathogens for the purpose of forensically tracing transmission routes, focusing on the particular problems where evolutionary dynamics are complemented by epidemiological information on the most likely timing of events as well as possible transmission routes got to .

951,Next-generation sequencing technologies: tool to study avian virus diversity,"Increasing globalization, climatic changes and the interface between wildlife and livestock have led to the emergence of novel viral pathogens or zoonoses, which have become a serious problem for bird, animal and human health. High biodiversity and bird migration facilitate the spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods, which are designed to be virus specific or aim to be limited to a group of viral agents, impede the identification of new viruses or viral variants. Recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches provide culture-independent methods useful for understanding viral diversity and discovering new viruses, thereby enabling better diagnosis and disease control. This review discusses the different possible steps of an aNGS study using sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches to identify novel avian viruses and their diversity. NGS led to the identification of a wide range of new viruses such as picobirnavirus, picornavirus, orthoreovirus and avian gamma-coronavirus associated with fulminant disease in guinea fowl and is also used to describe viral diversity among avian species.

Chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and turkey parvovirus (TuPV) belong to the genus Aveparvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. Avian parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses composed of three open reading frames, the first two encoding nonstructural protein (NS) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP), and the third encoding viral capsid proteins 1 (VP1 and VP2). Unlike other parvoviruses, the VP1 unique region does not contain the phospholipase A2 sequence motif. Recent experimental studies have suggested that the parvoviruses are the candidate pathogens in cases of enteric disease syndrome. Current diagnostic methods for avian parvovirus detection include PCR, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant VP2 or VP1 capsid proteins. Furthermore, sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms have enabled rapid and simultaneous detection of parvovirus from affected and healthy birds.

Astroviruses are a recently identified cause of gastroenteritis in animals, which currently includes two species suspected of causing diarrhea in humans. Using pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, we analyzed human stool samples from different continents for astrovirus-related RNA sequences. We identified variants of the two known human astrovirus species and, based on genetic distance criteria, three new astrovirus species, all distantly related to mink and ovine astroviruses, which we tentatively named HMOAstV species AC. The complete genome of species A showed all the conserved features of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the three groups of astroviruses now found in human stool (HAstV, AstV-MLB, and HMOAstV) were more closely related to animal astroviruses than to each other, suggesting that human astroviruses may periodically arise from zoonotic transmissions.

Here we describe a simple and efficient way to multiplex enrichment of MinION libraries using biotinylated PCR-generated decoys in a novel approach, overcoming technical limitations related to the chemistry of the sequencing adapters and the length of the DNA fragments. Using phage lambda and Escherichia coli as models, we selectively enrich for specific targets, significantly increase corresponding read coverage, and eliminate unwanted regions. We show that by capturing genomic fragments containing the target sequences, we recover reads that expand the target regions and thus can be used to determine potentially unknown flanking sequences. By pooling enriched libraries derived from two different E. coli strains and analyzing them in parallel, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method in multiplex format. Crucially, we have evaluated the optimal decoy size for large fragment libraries and are the first to describe a standardized method for target enrichment in the MinION platform.",,"Karamitros, T.;Magiorkinis, G.",2015.0,2015-12-01 00:00:00,,0
958,"Genetic characterization of H3N2 influenza viruses isolated from swine in North America, 1977-1999: evidence for fully human and reassortant virus genotypes","Since 1998, H3N2 viruses have caused epizootic respiratory disease in swine in major swine producing regions of the United States. These outbreaks are notable because previously swine flu in North America was almost exclusively caused by the H1N1 virus. We sequenced the full-length protein-coding regions of all eight RNA segments from four H3N2 viruses isolated between March 1998 and March 1999 from swine in the Midwestern United States, H3N2 viruses isolated in January 1997 and from one piglet in Canada were recovered from a pig in Colorado in 1977. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 1977 Colorado and 1997 Ontario isolates are entirely human influenza viruses. However, the viruses isolated from swine in the Midwestern United States since 1998 include reassortant viruses containing the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and PB1 polymerase genes from human influenza viruses, matrix, nonstructural, and nucleoprotein genes from classical swine viruses, and PA and avian PB2 polymerase genes contain viruses. The HA proteins of the reassortant Midwestern swine viruses can be distinguished from those of the 1995 lineage of human H3 viruses by 12 amino acid mutations in HA1. In contrast, the Sw/ONT/97 virus, which did not spread from pig to pig, lacks 11 of these mutations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BV",,"Karasin, A. I.;Schutten, M. M.;Cooper, L. A.;Smith, C.

960,The intestinal eukaryotic vioma in healthy and diarrhea-sick newborn piglets,"Neonatal swine diarrhea of unclear etiology has been reported from a number of European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to investigate a possible viral involvement in this diarrhea and to describe the intestinal virome with a focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrheal and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analyzed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) subjected to a sequence-independent amplification. Samples from piglets with diarrhea from the same herds were pooled, while samples from healthy piglets were analyzed individually. A total of 29 clinical samples as well as two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. Eight different mammalian virus families were detected in the healthy samples (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrheal samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae). It was not possible to assign a specific virus family to the diarrhea examined. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhea was caused by known mammalian viruses. However, the results indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the gut as early as 24–48 hours after birth, suggesting immediate postpartum or possibly transplacental infection.",,"Karlsson, O.

961,"A severe pediatric infection with a novel Enterovirus A71 strain, Thuringia, Germany","Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection is an important cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Outbreaks, including severe cases with neurological and cardiopulmonary complications, have been reported from Southeast Asia in particular. In Europe, the epidemiology of EV-A71 is not well understood. In the summer of 2015, a two-year-old girl from Thuringia presented with rhombencephalitis/cerebral encephalitis, which was associated with severe neurological and cardiopulmonary complications. EV-A71 was detected in stool and almost the entire viral genome was amplified and sequenced. While the VP1 coding region of the capsid protein belongs to the EV-A71 subgenogroup C1, the 3D polymerase coding region represents a unique lineage. Thus, the data suggest that the Thuringian EV-A71 sequence likely represents a recombinant. The case underscores the importance of intensified EV-A71 surveillance in Germany and Europe, including analysis of full genome data.",,"Karrasch, M.;Fischer, E.;Scholten, M.;Sauerbrei, A.;Henke, A.;Renz, D.

962,Understanding the evolutionary relationship of the hemagglutinin protein of influenza viruses using phylogenetic and molecular modeling studies,"The existing H1N1 swine flu (2009) is pandemic in nature and is responsible for worldwide economic losses and deaths. Among the eight gene segments of H1N1, hemagglutinin (HA) plays an important role in virus attachment to the host cell surface, and entry of viral RNA into the host cell leads to infection. In this study, the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the H1N1 (2009) HA from Mexico City were examined along with 1952 sequences from different subtypes of the pandemic influenza A virus, and the results showed that the closest relative of strain H1N1 ( 2009) from Mexico with tribe H1N1 (2009) consisted tribe H1N1 (2007) Mallard Norway. The analysis of the secondary structures predicted from the protein sequence revealed that in the years 2005 to 2010 a reduction in size of the alpha helices was observed in many regions of the sequences. Conversely, an analysis at the structural level is required to critically assess the functional importance. Therefore, for the above proteins, a structural level study was performed by constructing the 3D structure of these proteins through homology modelling. The models were validated and structural level similarities were assessed by overlay. Subsequently, docking studies were performed to find out the binding mode of sialic acid (SA) with influenza HA. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the interactions of the SA molecule with the HA. Energetic analysis shows that the van der Waal interaction is more favorable for the binding of HA with SA of whole influenza virus. Binding pocket analysis shows that H-bond donor and acceptor intensities are higher in H1N1 (2009). © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,"Karthikeyan, M.;Kirubakaran, P.;Singh, K.

963,Potential risks from porcine single-stranded DNA virus associated with xenotransplantation,"Routine large-scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is approaching clinical reality thanks to several cutting-edge technologies, most notably the ability to rapidly produce genetically defined pigs. However, the use of porcine organs in humans carries risks, including the unwanted cross-species transmission of viruses and the adaptation of these porcine viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize whole viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in mammalian viroma studies. In particular, the ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a propensity for adaptation to new hosts and cross-species barriers. Porcine-associated ssDNA viruses include torque tenosus virus (TTSuV) in the Anelloviridae family, porcine parvoviruses (PPV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV), both in the Parvoviridae family, and porcine circoviruses (PCV) in the family of the Circoviridae, some of which have been shown to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses to the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Due to the limited knowledge available about the prevalence, predilection and pathogenicity of swine-associated ssDNA viruses, careful screening and monitoring is required. In the event of a positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses from xenotransplantation pig herds may be required.",,"Karuppannan, A.

964,"Phylogenetic relationships of the G gene sequence of bovine ephemeral fever virus isolated in Japan, Taiwan and Australia","The G gene, which encodes the neutralization antigen of Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus (BEFV), has been characterized to define the molecular epidemiology of the virus in Japan and the genetic relationships between the Japanese, Taiwanese and Australian isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the gene were highly conserved among the Japanese strains regardless of the year of isolation and were closely related to the Taiwanese strains. Through phylogenetic analysis, the Japanese and Taiwanese strains have been clearly classified into three chronological clusters: 1966, 1984-1989, and 1996-2004, suggesting that the bovine ephemeral fever epidemics in both countries may occur almost simultaneously through the same genotype. On the other hand, the Australian tribes were distantly related to these East Asian tribes and were placed in the independent fourth cluster of the phylogenetic tree. Three amino acid substitutions at residues 224, 271 and 499 in the neutralizing epitopes, two of which create new glycosylation sequences, are thought to be responsible for antigenic variations in bovine ephemeral fever virus. The cross-neutralization test with bovine ephemeral fever virus isolated in Japan showed that the vaccine developed on the basis of the oldest Japanese strain, YHL, seems to still be effective in combating bovine ephemeral fever in Japan. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Kato, T.;Aizawa, M.;Takayoshi, K.;Kokuba, T.;Yanase, T.;Shirafuji, H.;Tsuda, T.;Yamakawa, M.",2009.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.021,0

966,Analysis of the evolution of codon usage patterns in avian rotaviruses and their preferred host,"Rotavirus infections are a worldwide problem with the occurrence of very different viruses classified into 8 types (AH). We report here the evolutionary assessment of virus–host codon usage patterns in avian rotavirus (AvRV) of species RVA, RVD, RVF, and RVG (preferably affecting birds). Values of nucleotide content, codon usage bias (CUB), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and effective number of codons (ENCs) were examined with the aim of overexpressing the major viral inner capsid protein (VP6) of this AvRV species. The results confirm that evolutionary traits influence rotavirus (RV) genetic diversity and the impact of host natural selection on AvRVs codons. Synonymous codon usage patterns were evaluated using multivariate statistical methods on all available AvRV-encoding gene sequences. RSCU trees harbored all AvRV species and preferred host sequences in one topology, confirming a greater close proximity of AvRVs to the host chick cell genes. Similarly, the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) results also showed higher adaptation of AvRVs to its chicken host. Codon preference analysis of RVs revealed that the VP6 gene is better expressed in the yeast system, while codon optimization may be required for effective expression in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. The results provide fundamental clues on the dynamics of AvRV evolution and their host adaptation, which could be used for further research on avian species in the future.",,"Kattoor, J. J.;Malik, Y.

967,CRISPRs from Enterococcus faecalis and E. hirae isolates from pig feces have species-specific repeats but share some common spacer sequences,"Clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are currently a topic of interest in microbiology because of their role as a prokaryotic immune system. Previous studies on the distribution and characterization of CRISPR have focused on pathogenic bacteria, while less is known about CRISPR in commensal bacteria, where they may play an important role in the ecology of human and other animal microbiota and serve as a record of interactions between bacteria and viruses. A combination of PCR and sequencing was used to determine the prevalence and distribution of CRISPR arrays in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus hirae isolates from feces of healthy pigs. Both type II CRISPR-Cas and orphan CRISPR (without Cas genes) were detected in the 195 isolates examined. CRISPR-Cas was detected in 52 (46/88) and 42% (45/107) E. faecalis and E. hirae isolates, respectively. The prevalence of orphan CRISPR arrays was higher in E. faecalis isolates (95%, 84/88) than in E. hirae isolates (49%, 53/107). Species-specific repeat sequences were identified in orphan CRISPR arrays, and 42 unique spacer sequences were identified. Only two spacers matched previously characterized porcine virome sequences, and many apparently derived from enterococcal chromosomal sequences. Surprisingly, 17 (40%) of the spacers were detected in both species. Shared spacer sequences are evidence of a lack of species specificity in the agents and mechanisms responsible for spacer integration, and the abundance of spacer sequences corresponding to bacterial chromosome sequences reflects interspecific interactions within the gut microbiota.",,"Katyal, I.;Chaban, B.;Ng, B.;Hill, J.

968,Insights into the plasmidome of the bovine rumen,"Plasmids are self-replicating genetic elements capable of mobilization between different hosts. Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process thought to be a powerful and shaping evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the entire plasmid population in the vicinity of the bovine rumen, which harbors a complex and dense microbiota of enormous importance to humans. We developed a method to isolate total rumen plasmid DNA, called rumen plasmidoma, and subjected it to deep sequencing using Illumina's paired-end protocol and analysis using public and custom bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidoma contigs aligned with plasmids from rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at different times, suggesting that not only the bacterial taxa but also their plasmids are defined by the ecological niche. The bacterial strain distribution of the plasmidoma differed from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. However, both shared a dominance of Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Apparently, the rumen plasmidome is of a highly mosaic nature capable of interbreeding with phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidome to two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it became clear that the rumen plasmidome encodes functions that are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and might confer advantages on their hosts, suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as previously implied for viruses.",,"Kav, A.

In April 2013, the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced surveillance of environmental and human syndromes for the virus. Environmental samples from poultry markets in 21 city CDCs (n=8,942) and respiratory samples from individuals with influenza-like illness or pneumonia (n=32,342) were tested; Viruses isolated from 6 environmental samples and 16 patients were sequenced.

Only a portion of the above amplified PCR products of the F and HN genes (374 and 1713 bp) and their deduced amino acid residues were compared to the other 60 NDVs retrieved from GenBank. Most (29/30) of the youngest Taiwanese isolates were classified as subgenotype VIIe, while only one isolate was classified as subgenotype VIIc. All 29 isolates of subgenotype VIIe were further subclassified and provisionally designated as sub-subgenotypes VIIe2 (13 isolates), VIIe3 (5 isolates) and VIIe4 (11 isolates). Isolates of subsubgenotype VIIe2, possessing the 112R-RQKR-F117 motif and amino acid residue substitutions at positions 23 (L to F) and 90 (T to A), were collected between 2002 and 2005. Isolates of sub-subgenotype VIIe3 carrying the 112R-RKKR-F117 motif and amino acid residue substitutions at positions 74 (E to G) and 75 (A to G) within the epitopes and 114 (Q to K) within the cleavage site of the F- Proteins were collected in 2003-2006. The subsubgenotype VIIe4 isolates with the motif 112R-RQKR-F117 and amino acid substitutions at positions 23 (L to F), 26 (I to T) and 90 (T to A) were collected between 2007 and 2008. All NDV isolates in this study showed a high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), they were all classified as velogenic NDV types. Viruses of sub-genotypes VIIe2 and VIIe4 are now dominant and have been implicated in most of the recent ND outbreaks in Taiwan.

PCR amplification and sequencing of selected genes from the virus and phylogenetic inference from aligned sequences were performed to identify and classify the virus. Marginal spines had no effect on the percentage of infection or days to death of newly molted 5th instars infected with spiny or smooth-edged F. mairei leaf blades 24 h before and after drop-feeding at doses of 10(8) or 10(9). OBs ml were fed (1). Fifth instar that were fed spiny or smooth-edged blades of grass had similarly undamaged PMs when viewed with a scanning electron microscope. Fourth instar fed virus treated F. arundinacea subsp. fenas leaf blades with intact or removed spiny margins did not differ in ratio of infection or days to death. The food bolus moves in a liquid medium within the PM, and Frass dissections showed that marginal spines were often located within a food bolus separated from the PM by non-spinous plant material, rather than adjacent to the PM; Therefore, the friction of the edge spikes with the PM may have been low. These results suggest that armyworms are no less susceptible to baculovirus infection when feeding on smooth-edged tall fescue cultivars planted for improved livestock performance compared to those feeding on standard cultivars with smooth leaf margins prickly edges feed. We believe this is the first study to examine the effects of a natural physical structure on the disruption of PM and infection by a baculovirus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

972,Porcine circovirus 2 genetic variability in vaccinating and non-vaccinating commercial farms,"Vaccines against porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) are now widely used to control diseases caused by the virus. Although the vaccines protect pigs from the disease, they do not confer sterilizing immunity and therefore PCV2 infections continue on farms. PCV2 is expected to be able to rapidly adapt to environmental stresses such as vaccination due to its high evolutionary rate. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular variation of PCV2 in relation to vaccination. PCV2 variability was assessed using samples from infected pigs from five never-vaccinated and two herds where the pigs had been vaccinated for at least two years. For genetic analysis, whole PCV2 genomes were amplified and then pooled by vaccination status from serum from eight vaccinated infected pigs and 16 non-vaccinated infected pigs. The variability of the virus populations was quantified using next-generation sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis. The number of segregation sites was similar in the unvaccinated (n=109) and vaccinated pools (n=96), but the distribution of these sites in the genome was different. Most notably, in the capsid gene, the number of segregation sites was only observed in the unvaccinated population. Based on the structural analysis, some low-frequency amino acids are expected to result in viruses with biologically low fitness. In contrast, D294 in Replicase represents a novel amino acid that was dominant and unique in the vaccinated pool. This work showed that different PCV2 populations circulated in commercial farms and that this variability was different in samples obtained from vaccinating and non-vaccinating farms.",,"Kekarainen, T.;Gonzalez, A.;Llorens, A.;Segales, J.",2014.0,Aug,,0

978,Epidemiology of human and animal kobuviruses,"Kobuviruses belong to the Picornaviridae family. Initially, members of the genus Kobuvirus were named after their host species. The viruses found in humans are referred to as ""Aichi virus"", the viruses from bovines are referred to as ""bovine kobuvirus"" and the viruses isolated from pigs are referred to as ""porcine kobuvirus"". Currently, a taxonomy of kobuviruses has been proposed and the virus species have been renamed. ""Aichi virus"" was renamed ""Aichivirus A"", ""bovine kobuvirus"" was renamed ""Aichivirus B"", and ""porcine kobuvirus"" was changed to ""Aichivirus C"". Among Aichivirus A, three distinct members including Aichivirus 1 (human Aichivirus), canine Kobuvirus 1 and murine Kobuvirus 1 have been described. Aichi virus 1 is distributed worldwide in humans and has been identified with a low incidence (0–3%) in sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis. Aichi virus 1 has been reported to be associated with various types of clinical diseases, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever, purulent conjunctivitis, and respiratory symptoms. The studies from Japan, Spain, Germany and Tunisia showed that a high prevalence of antibodies against Aichi virus 1 was found in the population. Aichivirus B, or formerly known as bovine kobuvirus, was first reported in 2003. Since then, Aichivirus B has also been reported from several countries worldwide. The overall prevalence of Aichivirus B varies from 1 to 34.5%, and the highest prevalence was found in cattle with diarrhea in Korea. Aichivirus C, or porcine kobuvirus, is widespread in pigs. Aichivirus C has been found in both diarrheal and healthy pigs and the positive rate of this virus varies from 3.9 to 100%.

980,A multicenter study to evaluate the performance of high-throughput sequencing for virus detection,"The ability of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to detect known and unknown viruses makes it a powerful tool for comprehensive microbial investigations, such as B. the evaluation of novel cell substrates that can be used for the development of new biological products. However, like any new assay, regulatory applications of HTS require method standardization. Therefore, our three laboratories initiated a study to evaluate the performance of HTS for the potential detection of viral adventitious agents by spiking model viruses into different cell matrices to mimic putative materials for biologics manufacture. Four model viruses were chosen based on different physical and biochemical properties and commercial availability: human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and human reovirus (REO). In addition, the porcine circovirus (PCV) was tested by a laboratory. Independent samples were prepared for HTS by adding intact virus or extracted viral nucleic acids, individually or mixed, to various HeLa cell matrices (resuspended whole cells, cell lysate, or total cellular RNA). Data were obtained using different sequencing platforms (Roche 454, Illumina HiSeq1500 or HiSeq2500). Bioinformatic analyzes were performed independently by each laboratory using available tools, pipelines, and databases. The results showed that comparable virus detection was achieved in the three laboratories, independent of sample processing, library preparation, sequencing platform and bioinformatic analysis: Between 0.1 and 3 viral genome copies per cell were detected for all model viruses used. This study underscores the potential of using HTS for the sensitive detection of adventitious viruses in complex biological samples with a cellular background. <b>IMPORTANT</b> Recent investigations into high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have led to unexpected discoveries of known and new viruses in a variety of sample types, including research materials, clinical materials, and biological products. Therefore, HTS can be a powerful tool to complement current methods for detecting the absence of adventitious or unwanted viruses in biological products, especially when using a new cell line. However, HTS is a complex technology with different platforms that needs to be standardized to evaluate biologics. This collaborative study was conducted to examine the detection of different virus types with two different HTS platforms. The results of the independently conducted studies showed similar sensitivity of virus detection regardless of the different sample preparation and processing methods and bioinformatic analyzes performed in the three laboratories. The comparable HTS detection of different virus types supports the future development of reference virus materials for the standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.",,"Khan, A.

981,Sequence data to clarify the taxonomic position of common bean mosaic virus and black-eyed bean mosaic virus isolates,"The nucleotide sequences of the coat protein genes and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-NTRs) of three isolates of common bean mosaic virus (NL1, NL3 and NY15) and one isolate of black-eyed cowpea mosaic virus (W) were determined. Comparison of these sequences revealed that the envelope proteins of NL1, NY15 and W were identical in size (287 amino acids) and shared overall sequence similarity (94-97%) and 84-98% in their N-terminal regions. In addition, their 3' NTRs were very similar in length [253 to 256 nucleotides (nt)] and sequence (93 to 96% similarity). In contrast, the coat protein of NL3 had only 261 amino acids and showed 87-89% similarity to NL1, NY15 and W, while its N-terminal region showed only 46-61% similarity. The NL3 3'-NTR also showed significant differences, both in length (240 nt) and in sequence (56-63% similarity). These results, combined with previous serological findings, justify the conclusion that NL1, NY15 and W should be considered as strains of the same virus, i.e. Bean Common Mosaic Virus, and that NL3 is a strain of another potyvirus, for which the name ""Bean Black Root Virus” proposed.",,"Khan, J.

Antibodies directed against N- and C- or N-terminal peptide regions of the coat proteins of the above strains enabled discrimination between B1CMV-W, BCMV-NY15 and BCMV-NL3 in electroblot immunoassay and in ELISA. The discrimination was better for antibodies directed against N-termini than for those against N- and C-termini. BCMV strain NL1 reacted with both B1CMV-W and BCMV-NY15, but not with BCMV-NL3.

984,Viral diversity and clonal evolution from unphased genomic data,"Background: Clonal expansion is a process by which a single organism reproduces asexually, resulting in a diversifying population. It is inherently ubiquitous, from pathogen development within the host to the outbreak of infectious diseases. Standard phylogenetic tools rely on full-length genomes of individual pathogens or population consensus sequences (phased genotypes). Although high-throughput sequencing technologies are capable of examining population diversity, their inherent short sequence reads preclude assessing whether two reads are from the same clone (out-of-phase genotypes). This obstacle severely limits the application of phylogenetic methods and the study of host dynamics of acute infections using this rich data source. Methods: We introduce two diversity measures to study the evolution of clonal populations using aphased genomic data, eliminating the need to construct full-length genomes. Our method follows a maximum likelihood approach to estimate evolutionary rates and times to the most recent common ancestor based on a relaxed molecular clock model; independent of a growth model. Deviations from neutral development indicate the presence of selection and bottleneck events. Results: We evaluated our methods in silico and then compared them to existing approaches using the well-characterized 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We then applied our method to high-throughput genome data from Marburg virus-infected non-human primates and deduced the timing of infection and the rate of evolution within the host and identified purifying selection in virus populations. Conclusions: Our method is able to take advantage of smaller variants, present in less than 1% of the population, and capture genomic diversification within days of infection, making it an ideal tool for studying the dynamics of acute RNA virus infections.",,"Khiabanian, H.;Carpenter, Z.;Kugelman, J.;Chan, J.;Trifonov, V.;Nagle, E.;Warren, T.;Iversen, P.;Bavari, S.;Palacios, G.;Rabadan, R.",2014.0,Oct,,0
985,Genetic characterization and pathogenicity assessment of Newcastle disease virus isolated from wild peacock,"The continued spread and emergence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) poses a potential threat to the domestic poultry industry around the world. Mainly, wild bird species have always been considered as a natural reservoir for virus and the spread of the disease. In the present study, we report the isolation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV/Peacock/India/2012) in a necropsy brain tissue sample from wild peafowl from northern India. The full genome of the virus was found to be 15,186 nucleotides (nts) with six genes in the order 3-N-PMF-HN-L-5, followed by a 55-nts leader region at the 3-inch Region delimited are ² end and a 114 nts trailer sequence at the 5 inch end. Sequence analysis of the fusion protein revealed the <sup>112</sup>RRQKRF<sup>117</sup> dibasic amino acid cleavage site, a characteristic motif of the virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in genotype II of Newcastle disease virus and showed the lowest mean percentage deviation (6%) with other genotype II counterparts intracerebral pathogenicity index (1.40) in day-old chicks as mesogenic (intermediate pathotype). The report emphasizes the dynamic ecology of NDV strains circulating in a wild bird host during the 2012 outbreak in northern India. In addition, the genotypic and pathotypic characterizations of the isolate could be helpful in the development of a homologous vaccine against the NDV strain circulating in the bird population.",,"Khulape, S.

989,Genetic variability in hepatitis B virus,"In 1988 it was reported that the complete nucleotide sequences of 18 strains of hepatitis B virus (HBV) were divided into four genetic groups (A to D) with more than 8% variation between groups. This classification of strains based on genome sequence has since proven to be an important tool in understanding HBV epidemiology and evolution and has been expanded to include three additional genotypes. In parallel to the HBV genotypes described in humans, HBV strains isolated from various primates and hepadnaviruses occurring in woodchucks, ground squirrels, ducks and herons were examined. Sequence differences between HBV genotypes can result in structural differences at the pregenome level and also dramatic differences at the translational level when specific and common mutations occur. There is growing evidence that the clinical picture, response to treatment and long-term prognosis may differ depending on which genotype infected the patient. Therefore, consideration of conventional serological patterns in a patient must take into account the genotype of the infecting strain. Nucleotide variability between HBV strains has been used in several studies to follow transmission pathways, and as it becomes increasingly clear that the differences between HBV genotypes are important, the need for reliable and simple methods for differentiating HBV genotypes has arisen. This review summarizes the knowledge of HBV genotypes in terms of their genetic, structural and clinically significant differences and their origin and evolution in the context of hepadnaviruses in general.",,"Kidd-Ljunggren, K.;Miyakawa, Y.;Kidd, A.

990,Identification of plant protein kinases in response to abiotic and biotic stress using superSAGE,"Plants are stationary organisms that are exposed to many environmental influences. To survive, they must perceive and respond to biotic and abiotic stress efficiently. Protein kinases are essential for the perception of environmental stimuli and trigger signaling cascades. Kinases are among the largest and most important gene families for biotechnology purposes and pose many challenges for bioinformaticians due to the combination of conserved domains alongside diversified regions. Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] is an important legume crop adapted to different agroclimatic conditions such as drought, humidity and different temperatures. For this culture, coupling the SuperSAGE method with high-throughput sequencing technology would generate reliable transcriptome profiles with millions of tags counted and statistically analyzed. An approach to assess biotic and abiotic stress was performed, generating over 13 million cowpea SuperSAGE tags extracted from leaves/roots of plants under abiotic (mechanical injury and salinity) or biotic (CABMV, cowpea aphid mosaic virus) stress were available. The annotation and identification of tags linked by BlastN to previously well-characterized ESTs enabled subsequent identification of kinases. The annotation efficiency depended on the database used, with the KEGG proving to be a good source for annotated ESTs, especially when supplemented with independent geneontological categorization as well as the gene index using selected species. The use of different approaches allowed the identification of 1,350 kinase candidates considering biotic libraries and 2,268 regarding abiotic libraries, based on a combination of appropriate descriptions and GO terms. Additional searches of kinase-specific databases allowed the identification of a relatively small number of additional kinases, revealing the paucity of kinase databases for non-model organisms, particularly plants. Regarding the kinase families, a total of 713 potential kinases were divided into 13 families of the CMGC and STE groups. Regarding the differentially expressed kinases, 169 of the 713 potential kinases were identified (p<0.05), 100 up- and 69 down-regulated when comparing different libraries, allowing the generation of a comprehensive panel of differentially expressed kinases under biotic and abiotic stress in a non- Model plant like cowpea. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",,"Kido, E.

991,Predicting the global spread of H5N1 avian influenza,"The spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Asia, Europe and Africa is having an enormous impact on the poultry industry and poses a significant threat to human health. The ways in which the virus has spread and will spread between countries have been discussed at length, still need to be analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 out of 21 H5N1 introductions to Asian countries were most likely from poultry and 3 out of 21 were most likely from migratory birds. In contrast, dispersal to most (20/23) countries of Europe was most likely by migratory birds. Distribution in Africa was probably partly by fowl (2/8 introductions) and partly by migratory birds (3/8). Our analyzes predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced to the mainland by infected poultry in the Western Hemisphere and subsequent movements of migratory birds from neighboring countries to the United States than from eastern Siberia. These results underscore the potential synergies between trade and wildlife movements in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control. © 2006 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Kilpatrick, A.

This virus has been mentioned as a bovine stool-associated circular DNA virus (BoSCV)-like virus discovered from pig feces. However, the thorough properties of the virus have not been identified. Therefore, this research focuses on finding a complete genome sequence and analyzing the genetic characteristics of the virus. The virus, now called Porcine Stool-associated Circular DNA Virus (PoSCV Kor) in Korea, consists of 2,589 bases that form a circular structure. It has two major ORFs encoding replicase and capsid protein inversely, with each stem-loop structure lying between the 5' and 3' ends of the two putative ORFs. These properties are the same as PoSCV in New Zealand, but differ from chimpanzee stool-associated circular viruses (ChiSCVs) and BoSCV, which have a stem-loop structure. Therefore, it would be certain that PoSCV Kor is very similar to PoSCV in terms of genetic aspect; the same number of nucleotide bases and amino acid identity of replicase and capsid proteins (96 and 93%, respectively). This fact could be confirmed by finding that PoSCV Kor and PoSCV are in the same cluster by phylogenetic analysis based on comparison with full sequences of other circular ssDNA viruses.",,"Kim, A.

However, the main etiological agent is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared viral diversity in proventriculus samples from herds diagnosed with TVP to healthy herds in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads determined by high-throughput Sequencing were generated, with a mean length of 160 nt. Enrichment of viral sequences indicated that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although we could not identify a causative agent of TVP that matched the known morphology, picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an association with TVP. The five samples yielded 1045-1720 bp contigs with 81-84% nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). Whole genome analysis showed that the novel picornavirus QIA01 strain was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7% nt and 95.5% aa sequence identity), but differed in the structural region and partial 2A peptides (56.2% nt and 23.9% aa sequence identity). In addition, QIA01 virus was similar (87.0% nt and 95.6% aa sequence identity) to chicken Megrivirus, which was recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in Hungary.

To test the effect of HGF neutralization with antibodies on anti-cancer T cell immunity, we generated surrogate antibodies reactive with the mouse homologue of the epitope targeted by YYB-101. First, we immunized a chicken with human HGF and monitored changes in the B cell repertoire by next generation sequencing (NGS). We then extracted the VH gene repertoire from the NGS data, clustered it into components according to sequence homology, and classified the components according to the change in the number of unique VH sequences and the frequency of VH sequences within each component after immunization. These changes should accompany the preferential proliferation and somatic hypermutation or gene conversion of B cells encoding HGF-reactive antibodies. One component showed significant increases in the number and frequency of unique VH sequences and harbored genes encoding human HGF-responsive antibodies that competed with YYB-101 for HGF binding. Some of the antibodies also reacted to mouse HGF. The selected VH sequences shared 98.3% identity and 98.9% amino acid similarity. It is therefore likely that the antibodies they encode all respond to the epitope targeted by YYB-101.",,"Kim, S.;Lee, H.;Noh, J.;Lee, Y.;Han, H.;Yoo, D.

1001,The prevalence and genetic characteristics of porcine circovirus types 2 and 3 in Korea,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), are threatening the swine industry worldwide. Five genotypes of PCV2 have recently been identified: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d and PCV2e. In addition, a novel porcine circovirus was identified from a case of a sow with dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive disorders based on metagenomic analysis and classified as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic properties of PCV2 and PCV3 in clinical samples. RESULTS: A total of 471 specimens (161 lung and lymph node tissue samples from 34 sites and 310 serum samples from 47 sites) were tested for PCV2. Among them, 171 samples from 59 PCV2 positive farms were genotyped. An additional 690 specimens (296 lung and lymph node tissue specimens from 91 sites, 108 aborted fetal specimens from 26 sites and 286 serum samples from 47 sites) were tested for PCV3. Based on the results of PCV2 genotyping, PCV2d was the most common genotype (107 out of 171 samples) and co-infections with combinations of PCV2a, 2b and 2d were identified in 48 samples from 17 farms. A total of 14 samples from 11 farms were also positive for both PCV2 and PCV3. For PCV3, 57 samples (9.8%) from 32 farms (23.2%) were positive. Of the 108 aborted fetuses from 26 farms, only 2 samples were positive for PCV3. Based on sequence comparisons, PCV2d shares 89.6-91.0% and 93.2-94.3% homology with PCV2a and PCV2b, respectively; 98.6-100% homology is shared by the PCV2d strains. The PCV3 strains identified in this study show 98.0-99.5% homology. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that PCV2d has become the predominant genotype in Korea.

1002,Complete genome sequence of a novel Newcastle disease virus: Strain isolated from a chicken in West Africa,"The full genome sequence of an African Newcastle disease (NDV) virus strain isolated from a chicken in Togo in 2009 has been determined. The genome is 15,198 nucleotides (nt) long and is classified in genotype VII in the class II cluster. Compared to conventional vaccine strains, the African strain contains a previously described 6-nt insert in the downstream untranslated region of the N gene and a new 6-nt insert in the HN-L intergenic region. Differences in genome length are a marker for the natural history of NDV. This is the first description of a class II NDV strain with a 15,198 nt genome and a 6 nt insert in the HN-L intergenic region. The sequence divergence compared to vaccine strains was significant, likely a contributor to outbreaks, and illustrates the continued development of new NDV strains in West Africa. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Kim, S.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of H7 avian viruses, at least 12 different genotypes were represented. Most H7 viruses contained at least one gene segment of the highly pathogenic A/Sck/Hong Kong/YU100/02(H5N1)-like avian virus, and they could be divided into at least two antigenic groups. Although we did not detect any genetically identical strains, the HI test showed close cross-reactivity of some isolates with the H7N9 viruses from China. Animal experiments showed that most genotypes could replicate in the lungs of mice and chickens without prior adaptation and some, particularly the subtypes H7N4 and H7N7, caused mortality in mice. These findings add to the growing concerns about a pandemic related to the recent H7 viruses and underscore the importance of continuous surveillance of avian influenza viruses in the wild.",,"Kim, Y.

The effective, but expensive and not entirely harmless vaccination was discontinued in 1991 in all countries of the European Union. However, research on this virus, one of the most studied viruses, both in the field of basic virology and animal health, continues to bring new data on still little-known aspects of its biology such as cell penetration, RNA translation, replication and capsid assembly. These different aspects are checked. The development of biotechnology has allowed the rise of new vaccines, if not more efficient, but at least fully secured.

1006,"Analysis of the diversity and evolution of rotavirus species, including the newly determined full-length genome sequences of rotavirus F and G","Rotaviruses are a major cause of viral acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Eight distinct rotavirus (AH) species have been defined based on antigenicity and nucleotide sequence identities of the VP6 gene. The first complete genome sequences of rotavirus F (strain 03V0568) and G (strain 03V0567) with lengths of 18,341 and 18,186 bp, respectively, are described here. Both viruses have open reading frames for the rotavirus proteins VP1 to VP7 and NSP1 to NSP5 located at the 11 genome segments. Nucleotide sequence identities with other rotaviruses ranged from 29.8% (NSP1 gene) to 61.7% (VPI gene) for rotavirus F and from 29.3% (NSP1-2 gene) to 65.9% (NSP2 gene ) for rotavirus G, confirming their classification as separate virus species. Encoded proteins showed remarkable sequence differences between rotavirus species. In contrast, the 5'-terminal non-coding sequences of genomic segments are highly conserved among all rotavirus species. Different 3'-terminal consensus sequences are found between rotavirus A/D/F, rotavirus C and rotavirus B/G/H. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed a segregation of rotaviruses into two major clades consisting of rotavirus A/C/D/F and rotavirus B/G/H. Within these clades, rotavirus F mainly grouped with rotavirus D and rotavirus G with rotavirus B. In addition, differentiation between mammalian and avian rotavirus A strains, host-specific evolution of rotavirus B and C, and an ancient reassortment event between avian rotavirus A and D are given by the phylogenetic data. These results underscore the high diversity of rotaviruses as a result of a complex evolutionary history. (C) 2012 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Kindler, E.;Trojnar, E.;Heckel, G.;Otto, P.

1007,Investigating the intra-host and intra-herd sequence diversity of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"Because of the poor fidelity of the enzymes involved in RNA genome replication, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus samples contain unique polymorphic populations. In this study, deep sequencing was used to characterize the diversity of FMD virus (FMD) populations in 6 infected cattle present on a single farm during the 2007 UK outbreak series. A novel RT-PCR method was developed to amplify a 7.6 kb nucleotide fragment encompassing the polyprotein-coding region of the FMDV genome. Illumina sequencing of each sample identified the subtle polymorphic structures at each nucleotide position, ranging from consensus-level changes to variants present at a frequency of 0.24%. These data were used to study FMD population dynamics at both the herd and host levels, to assess host effects on virus swarm structure, and to identify transmission links with viruses detected on other farms in the same series of outbreaks. A total of 5 consensus variants were identified in 7 samples from 6 different animals, in addition to 104 sub-consensus variants, 22 of which were shared by 2 or more animals. Further analysis revealed differences in the swarm structures of samples collected from the same animal, suggesting the presence of different virus populations developing independently at different lesion sites within the same infected animal.",,"King, D.

Hemagglutination (HA) antigen was prepared from each isolate by phospholipase C treatment of virus concentrated from allanto-amniotic fluids of infected chick embryos. A HI test was performed with the HA antigen of each isolate against a battery of 17 antisera raised against different IBV strains classified by virus neutralization (VN). The HI test identified Ark 99 and Holland isolates similar to strains previously classified by VN. Two isolates included in this study were not inhibited by any of the reference antisera and therefore appeared to be antigenically distinct. The isolates were also evaluated by VN and the results of the VN and HI methods were consistent. Therefore, the results suggest that the HI test may be useful for rapid, presumptive identification of new IBV isolates.",,"King, D. J.;Hopkins, S. R.",1984.0,,,0
1009,Improved bioinformatic profiling of VIDISCA libraries for virus detection and discovery,"VIDISCA is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation method designed to enrich for viral nucleic acids from samples before performing high-multiplex, low-depth sequencing. Reliable detection of known viruses and discovery of novel divergent viruses from NGS data requires specialized analysis tools that are both sensitive and accurate. Existing software was used to design a new bioinformatics workflow for high-throughput virus detection and discovery from VIDISCA data. The workflow leverages the molecular biology of VIDISCA library preparation, specifically the use of the Mse1 restriction enzyme, which produces biologically replicated library inserts from identical genomes. The workflow performs a full metagenomic analysis to classify non-viral sequences including parasite and host, and performs virus-specific analyzes separately. The ribosomal RNA sequence is removed to increase downstream analysis speed and remaining reads are clustered at 100% identity. Known and new viruses are sensitively detected by comparison to a virus-only protein database and false positives are removed. A new cluster profiling analysis takes advantage of the viral biological replicates produced by Mse1 digestion and uses read clustering to characterize the presence of short genomes at very high copy number. Importantly, this analysis ensures that highly repeated sequences are identified even when no homology is detected, as demonstrated here with detection of a novel gokushovirus genome from human feces. The workflow was validated using reading data obtained from serum and fecal samples from HIV-1 positive adults and serum samples from pigs infected with the atypical porcine pestivirus.",,"Kinsella, C.

The morphological and physical characterization of the virus has not been addressed. Genome structure (Fig.1) Genome organization, proteins that are responsible for the cytopathogenic effect were discussed according to the current state of knowledge. The differences between the two biotypes of BVDV - cytopathogenic (cp, Fig. 2) and non-cytopathogenic (ncp) viruses - have also been discussed, with the classification being based on recombinative events to which the viral genome is exposed. For now, based on the results of recent research, it appears that the recombinative events of the amino terminus of the p80 non-structural enzyme protein of BVDV (Fig. 3) are mainly responsible for the transformation of ncp BVDV - mainly present in nature - to cp BVDV and thus to the development of mucosal diseases, MD.",,"Kiss, I.;Kecskemeti, S.",1998.0,Jul,,0
1012,Recovery of divergent avian bornaviruses from cases of ventricular dilatation disease: identification of an etiological candidate,"BACKGROUND: Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a deadly disease threatening domestic and wild parrots worldwide. It is characterized by lymphoplasmic infiltration of the ganglia of the central and peripheral nervous system, resulting in central nervous system dysfunction and impaired enteric motility and associated wasting. A viral etiology for PDD has been suspected for nearly 40 years, but to date no etiological drug candidate has been reproducibly linked to the disease. RESULTS: Analysis of 2 PDD case-control series collected independently on different continents using panviral microarray revealed Bornavirus hybridization signature in 62.5% of PDD cases (5/8) and in none of controls (0/8). Ultra high throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete viral genomic sequence from one of the virus positive PDD cases. A Bornavirus-like genome organization with a high degree of sequence deviation from all previous Bornavirus isolates was found for this pathogen. We propose the name Avian Bornavirus (ABV) for this pathogen. Further specific ABV-PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls revealed a significant difference in ABV detection rate in PDD cases (71%, n=7) compared to controls (0%, n= 14) (P = 0.01 ; Fisher's exact test). A partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates that we have now obtained from these and an additional group of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV genetic subgroups. CONCLUSION: These studies clearly demonstrate the existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse Bornaviruses and provide a compelling candidate for the search for an etiological agent of PDD.",,"Kistler, A.

1014,Current Knowledge on Porcine Circovirus 3 (PCV-3): A novel virus with as yet unknown implications for swine industry auditing,"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) is a recently described virus belonging to the Circoviridae family. It is the third member of the circovirus genus capable of infecting pigs, along with PCV-1, which is considered non-pathogenic, and PCV-2, one of the most economically relevant viruses for the global swine industry. PCV-3 was originally identified by metagenomic analysis in 2015 in tissues from pigs suffering from swine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation. The lack of other common pathogens as potential infectious agents of these diseases raised the suspicion that PCV-3 might be etiologically involved in the occurrence of the disease. Subsequently, viral genome was detected in apparently healthy pigs, and retrospective studies showed that PCV-3 was present in pigs as early as the early 1990s. In fact, current evidence suggests that PCV-3 is a fairly widespread virus worldwide. Recently, viral DNA was also found in wild boar, extending the susceptibility to infection in the Suidae family; in addition, the potential reservoir role of this species for the domestic pig has been suggested. Phylogenetic studies using available partial and full PCV-3 sequences from around the world have revealed high nucleotide identity (>96%), although two main groups and several subclusters have also been described. In addition, the existence of a common ancestor, dated to around 50 years ago, has been suggested. Considering the economic importance and known impact of PCV-2 on the swine industry, a new member of the same family as PCV-3 should not be neglected. Studies on epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunity and diagnostics are guaranteed in the coming years. Therefore, this review will update current knowledge and future research trends on PCV-3.",,"Klaumann, F.;Correa-Fiz, F.;Franzo, G.;Sibila, M.;Nunez, J. I.;Segales, J.",2018.0,,,0
1015,Occurrence and phylogenetic analysis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory disease outbreaks in Norway,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. The seroprevalence of BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in respiratory disease epidemics is unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in BRD epidemics and to perform a phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated the presence of bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view that BRSV is the main pathogen. G-gene sequencing of BRSV-positive specimens showed that the currently circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II along with other northern European isolates. An isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also studied. This tribe formed a separate branch in subgroup II, distinctly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two distinct strains co-occurring in the same geographic area. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenically important part of the G protein. The results showed that BRSV is the main etiological agent of BRD epidemics in Norway and that it often acts as the sole viral agent. Phylogenetic analysis of the Norwegian BRSV strains and several previously published isolates supported the theory of BRSV geographical and temporal aggregation.",,"Klem, T.

Replication competent PERV γ1 proviruses assigned to a specific subfamily and hybrid viruses derived from retroviral recombination events between subfamilies have been observed. Future porcine genome sequencing projects will uncover several novel PERV proviruses from additional breeds and animals. An assessment of these viral genomes must be performed to assess the potential risk of cross-species retroviral infection. In this study, we tested common sequence comparison methods for PERV sequence classification and hybrid clone detection.

Types 3 and 7 turned out to be identical and related to serotype 2. All other nine BEV were contained in either serotype 1 or 2. Not all strains in each serotype were identical and antigenic variants were designated as subtypes. Antigenic relationships not revealed by VN were detected in CF and IP tests. Bovine enterovirus strains whose antisera exhibited the broadest intratypical reactivity were proposed as prototypes.

1023,Gentian Mosaic Virus: A new species in the genus Fabavirus,"SUMMARY A viral isolate, designated N-1, obtained from a gentian plant (Gentiana scabra) exhibiting mosaic-like symptoms was mechanically transmitted to nine plant species in six families. These plants are known to be hosts of fabaviruses. The N-1 isolate consisted of isometric particles, 30 nm in diameter, and contained two RNA molecules of approximately 6.0 and 3.6 kb in length, as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNAs were encapsulated separately in two of the three particle types. Each particle contained two different proteins with Mr values of 39.3 x 10(3) and 26.6 x 10(3) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of complete nucleotide sequences of the RNAs indicated that each encoded a single large polyprotein in which putative functional proteins were arranged in a manner similar to that in broad bean wilt virus 1 (BBWV-1) and broad bean wilt virus 2 (BBWV-2), which are members of the genus Fabavirus (family Comoviridae). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins showed that those from isolate N-1 shared 38 to 66% identity with those of BBWV-1 and BBWV-2, but only 16 to 42% identity with those of a comovirus, cowpea mosaic virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on RNA polymerase amino acid sequences placed isolate N-1 in a separate lineage from BBWV-1 and BBWV-2. In the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, isolate N-1 showed a distant serological relationship to BBWV-1, BBWV-2, and the mild Lamium mosaic virus, another fabavirus. Our results suggest that N-1 represents a new type of fabavirus. We propose the name gentian mosaic virus for this new species.",,"Kobayashi, Y.

1024,Bovine Diarrhea Virus: ein Update,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen of cattle, a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Pestivirus, which also includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV or porcine choleravirus) and ovine border disease virus (BDV). It causes significant economic losses, mainly associated with reproductive disorders. Pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses about 40 nm in diameter. The nucleocapsid is probably icosahedral. The genome consists of a single-stranded positive RNA encoding approximately 430 kD protein product. Gene expression consists of the synthesis of a polyprotein that is processed co- and post-translationally. According to its behavior ""in vitro"" two biotypes can be distinguished: non-cytopathic (ncp) and cytopathic (cp), most likely derived from ncp by mutations and/or recombination. BVDV can cross the placenta and infect the fetus, causing a variety of problems from fetal death to the birth of a persistently infected (P) calf, depending on the age of the fetus at the time of infection. PI animals are immunotolerant to the virus and shed it in all secretions. Only the ncp biotype was isolated from PI animals. Superinfection of a PI animal with a cp strain causes mucosal disease, which is always fatal. Since 1993, outbreaks of a serious, sometimes hemorrhagic disease caused by ncp BVDV have occurred in Canada and the United States. Genomic and serological differences between the ""traditional"" strains and the viruses isolated from these outbreaks led to the subdivision of BVDV into subtypes I and II, both including cp and ncp strains. Analyzes of the 5'-UTR non-coding zone of the genome of pestiviruses from different species (bovine, ovine, porcine) suggest that there are at least 3 genotypes within the genus. A new classification of these viruses based on genomic sequence rather than species of origin has been proposed. Genomic heterogeneity exists in the BVDV genome, which has 3 hypervariable zones, 2 of them in the major neutralizing protein. In Argentina, the prevalence of BVDV antibodies in the cattle population is 70% and the prevalence of persistent infections is about 1%.",,"Kobrak, A.;Weber, E. L.",1997.0,,,0

Twenty of the viral genomes were sequenced over their entire length and a further thirteen were sequenced, including flanking sequences, at two specific sites, the LCR and the E5 ORF. Alignment and analysis of the sequences revealed no statistically significant spatial differences between the bovine and equine sequences. None of the proposed points of divergence noted by other authors had significant species-specific features. Our results indicate that BPV1 is shared between horses, asinins and cattle and that virus transmission between cattle and equidae is a repeated and ongoing phenomenon.",,"Koch, C.;Ramsauer, A.

1029,Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of the herpesvirus of the genus Varicellovirus,"BACKGROUND: The varicelloviruses comprise a genus within the alphaherpesvirus subfamily and infect both humans and other mammals. Recently, next-generation sequencing has been used to generate genomic sequences of several members of the varicellovirus genus. Here, currently available varicellovirus genome sequences were used for phylogenetic, recombination, and genetic distance analyses. RESULTS: A phylogenetic network encompassing genomic sequences of individual species was generated and suggested a possible restriction between ungulate and non-ungulate viruses. Genetic distances within species were higher for ungulate viruses (pseudorabiesvirus (SuHV-1) 1.65%, bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) 0.81%, equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) 0.79%, equine herpesvirus type). 4 (EHV-4) 0.16%) as non-ungulate viruses (feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) 0.0089%, canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV-1) 0.005%, varicella zoster virus (VZV) 0.136% ). The G+C content of the ungulate viruses was also higher (SuHV-1 73.6%, BHV-1 72.6%, EHV-1 56.6%, EHV-4 50.5%) compared to the non-ungulate viruses ( FHV-1 45.8%, CHV-1 31.6%, VZV 45.8%), suggesting a possible link between G+C content and genetic diversity within the species. Varicellovirus clade nomenclature is variable across species, and we propose standardization based on genomic-genetic distance. A recent study reported no recombination between sequenced FHV-1 strains, however in the present study both split tree, bootscan and PHI analysis indicated recombination. We also found that the recently sequenced Brazilian CHV-1 strain BTU-1 may harbor a genetic signal in the UL50 gene of an unknown varicellovirus. CONCLUSION: Together, the data contribute to a better understanding of varicellovirus genomics, and we also propose a new clade nomenclature scheme based on genetic distances.",,"Kolb, A.

1032,"The genetic clustering of natural animal isolates, laboratory and vaccine strains of Borna disease virus strongly reflects their regional geographic origin","The aim of this study was to gain more detailed insights into the genetic evolution and variability of the Borne Disease Virus (BDV). Phylogenetic analyzes were performed on field viruses derived from naturally infected animals, the BDV vaccine strain ""Dessau"", four widespread laboratory strains and the new BDV subtype No./98. Four regions of the BDV genome were analyzed: the complete p40, p10 and p24 genes and the 5' untranslated region of the X/P transcript. BDV isolates from the same geographic area showed a significantly higher degree of identity to each other than to BDV isolates from other regions, regardless of host species and year of isolation. Five different clusters could be formed within the endemic areas, which correspond to the geographic regions from which the viruses originate: (i) a Swiss, Austrian and Liechtenstein Rhine Valley group, closely related to the geographically adjacent Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria II group (ii) im west of Germany; (iii) a third group, called Group Bavaria I, restricted in occurrence to Bavaria; (iv) a southern Saxony-Anhalt and adjacent northern group of Saxony bound to the territories of those states in the eastern part of Germany; and (v) a mixed group consisting of samples from different areas of Germany; however, these came mainly from the federal states of Thuringia and Lower Saxony. Within these groups, the laboratory strains and the vaccine strain were grouped according to their geographic origin. All field and laboratory strains, as well as the vaccine strain, clearly separated from the recently described and highly divergent BDV strain No./98, which originates from an area in Austria where Borna disease is not endemic.",,"Kolodziejek, J.;Durrwald, R.;Herzog, S.;Ehrensperger, F.;Lussy, H.;Nowotny, N.",2005.0,Feb,,0

Complete genomic sequences of human and mosquito-derived viruses were identified, genetically compared and phylogenetically analyzed. The viruses were not identical but were closely related to each other and to more recent Czech and Italian isolates, suggesting a co-circulation of related WNV strains within a limited geographic area. The detection of WNV in a blood donation from an area with low human WNV prevalence (only three serologically diagnosed cases between 2008 and 2014) is surprising and underscores the importance of WNV nucleic acid testing of blood donations even in such areas of active mosquito surveillance programs.",,"Kolodziejek, J.;Seidel, B.;Jungbauer, C.;Dimmel, K.;Kolodziejek, M.;Rudolf, I.;HubÃ¡lek, Z.;Allerberger, F.;Nowotny, N.",2015.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0126381,0
1034,Whole genome analysis of human and bovine G8P-1 rotavirus strains isolated in Nigeria provides evidence for direct interspecies transmission from bovine to humans,"Group A bovine rotavirus (RVA) G8P[1] strains have rarely been detected in humans. Two Nigerian G8P[1] strains, HMG035 (RVA/Human-tc/NGA/HMG035/1999/G8P[1]) and NGRBg8 (RVA/Cow-tc/NGA/NGRBg8/1998/G8P[1]), were previously suggested the VP7, VP4 and NSP1 genes to be of bovine origin. In order to obtain detailed information about the origin and evolution of these G8P[1] strains, the complete nucleotide sequences of the entire genome of the HMG035 and NGRBg8 strains were determined and analyzed in the present study. Analysis of the whole genome revealed that strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 are very closely related in all 11 segments and have a bovine RVA-like genotype constellation (G8-P[1]-I2-R2-C2 -M2-A11- N2-T6-E2-H3). In addition, each of the 11 genes in strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 appeared to be of bovine origin on phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, it was suggested that the HMG035 and NGRBg8 strains derive from a common origin, and the NGRBg8 strain was assumed to represent an example of bovine RVA strains transmitted to humans. Our results provide clear evidence for the direct transmission of RVA strains between cattle and humans.",,"Komoto, S.;Adah, M. I.;Ide, T.;Yoshikawa, T.;Taniguchi, K.",2016.0,9,,0
1035,Reassortment of human and animal rotavirus gene segments into novel DS-1-like G1P 8 rotavirus strains,"Recently, the emergence and rapid spread of novel DS-1-like human G1P[8] rotaviruses in Japan has been reported. More recently, such reassortant intergenogroup strains have been identified in Thailand, suggesting the continued spread of unusual rotavirus strains in Asia. During rotavirus surveillance in Thailand, three DS-1-like reassortant intergenogroup strains with G3P[8] (RVA/Human-wt/THA/SKT-281/2013/G3P[8] and RVA/Human-wt/THA /SKT- 289/2013/G3P[8]) and G2P[8] (RVA/Human-wt/THA/LS-04/2013/G2P[8]) genotypes were identified in stool samples from hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the complete genomes of strains SKT-281, SKT-289 and LS-04. On analysis of the whole genome, all three strains showed unique genotype constellations, including genogroup 1 and 2 genes: G3-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 for strains SKT -281 and SKT-289 and G2-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 for strain LS-04. With the exception of the G genotype, the unique genotype constellation of the three phyla (P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2) is commonly shared with the DS-1-like G1P[8]. ] Tribes. In the phylogenetic analysis, nine of the 11 genes of strains SKT-281 and SKT-289 (VP4, VP6, VP1-3, NSP1-3, and NSP5) appeared to originate from DS-1-like G1P[8] strains, while the remaining VP7 and NSP4 genes appeared to be equine and bovine, respectively. Thus, strains SKT-281 and SKT-289 appeared to be reassortant strains for DS-1-like G1P[8], animal-derived human and/or animal rotaviruses. On the other hand, seven of the eleven genes of strain LS-04 (VP7, VP6, VP1, VP3, and NSP3-5) appeared to originate from locally circulating DS-1-like G2P[4] rotaviruses, while three were thought to be genes (VP4, VP2 and NSP1) are derived from DS-1-like G1P[8] strains. Notably, the remaining NSP2 gene of strain LS-04 appeared to be bovine. Therefore, strain LS-04 was assumed to be a multiple reassortment strain for DS-1-like G1P[8], locally circulating DS-1-like G2P[4], bovine-like human and/or bovine rotavirus. Overall, the large genomic diversity among the DS-1-like G1P[8] strains appeared to have been generated by a reassortment with human and animal strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of whole-genome-based characterization of DS-1-like intergenogroup-like reassortant strains with G3P[8] and G2P[8] genotypes that have emerged in Thailand. Our observations will provide important insights into the evolutionary dynamics of new DS-1-like G1P[8] strains and related reassortants.",,"Komoto, S.;Tacharoenmuang, R.;Guntapong, R.;Ide, T.;Tsuji, T.;Yoshikawa, T.;Tharmaphornpilas, P.;Sangkitporn, S.;Taniguchi, K.",2016.0,,,0
1036,Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of H9N2 swine influenza virus from sick pigs in southern China in 2010,"In January 2010, before pigs were infected with foot-and-mouth disease in Guangdong, some pigs showed flu-like symptoms; coughing, sneezing, runny nose and fever. The researchers collected as many nasopharyngeal swabs from all the sick pigs as possible. An H9N2 influenza virus was isolated from the swine population. The full genome of an isolate designated A/Swine/Guangdong/L1/2010(H9N2) was sequenced and compared to the sequences available in GenBank. Analysis results showed that the sequence of A/Swine/Guangdong/L1/2010(H9N2) was similar to that of several avian influenza viruses. According to phylogenetic analysis of the complete gene sequences, A/Swine/Guangdong/L1/2010(H9N2) possibly originates from the reassortment of avian influenza viruses.",,"Kong, W. L.;Huang, L.

1037,Varicella-zoster virus induces apoptosis in vitro in subpopulations of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the Herpesviridae, subfamily α-Herpesvirinae, is pathogenic only in humans. Chickenpox is the result of primary infection with VZV. During the viraemic stage, VZV infects peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spreads to the periphery. In skin cells it causes typical lesions. Apoptosis has been demonstrated in various cell types from other α-herpesviruses. In this in vitro study, VZV-infected T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and monocytes were examined using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. All infected cell types showed signs of apoptosis: reduced DNA content, DNA fragmentation, loss of membrane integrity, and altered nuclear morphology. The observed results led to the assumption that VZV can induce apoptosis during infection in vivo in the PBMC subpopulations. Â© 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

To study the evolution of foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMD) and to aid in disease control measures, genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of 43 field isolates representative of the animal disease was performed. The nucleotide sequence of the VP1 coding region was determined for the viruses and used in this study. Two serotype A lines, A/Arg/00 and A/Arg/01 (1000/1000 bootstrap) and two distinct serotype O/Arg/00 lines (848/1000 bootstrap) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that viruses A/Arg/01 and O/Arg/00 may be related to earlier South American isolates, while the origin of A Argentina 2000 viruses remains unclear.

1040,Heterogeneity of ruminant pestiviruses: academic interest or important basis for vaccine and diagnostic development?,"Pestiviruses cause economically important diseases in livestock. Members of the pestiviruses are bovine virus diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and border disease virus (BDV). Phylogenetic analyzes based on the entire nucleic acid sequence encoding Npro allow a statistically significant separation of established species and of subgroups within the species. BVDV-1 strains isolated in Germany can be assigned to at least five different subgroups. In contrast, all BVDV-2 isolates detected in Germany to date are closely related and belong to a subgroup. A group of virus isolates from sheep and zoo animals differs markedly from established pestivirus species and can be designated BDV-2. The antigenetic relationship of pestiviruses was examined using defined virus isolates and antisera in cross-neutralization assays. Six antigenic groups were distinguished according to the genetic clusters BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2 and Giraffe-1. A significant antigenic difference was also observed between members of subgroups 1a and 1b of BVDV-1.

Nevertheless, little effort has been expended to understand the properties of the avian H1N1 influenza viruses. Here we present the genome sequence and a molecular and virological characterization of an avian influenza A virus, A/Wildvogel/Korea/SK14/2014 (A/SK14, H1N1), isolated from migratory birds in South Korea during the 2014-2015 winter season. Full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to the Eurasian bird lineage. Although retaining the avian receptor binding preference, the A/SK14 virus also displayed detectable human-like receptor binding and was able to replicate in differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. In animal models, A/SK14 virus was moderately pathogenic in mice and the virus was detected in nasal washes of vaccinated guinea pigs but not in direct contact guinea pigs. Although A/SK14 showed moderate pathogenicity and no evidence of transmission in a mammalian model, our results suggest that the dual receptor specificity of A/SK14-like virus could allow for more rapid adaptation to mammals, highlighting the importance of further continuous surveillance and Monitoring underscores risk assessment activities.",,"Koo, B.

1043,Evolution of thymidine and thymidylate kinases: the possibility of independent capture of TK genes by different groups of viruses,"The phylogenetic analysis of viral and cellular thymidine and thymidylate kinases was performed using computational methods. Several alignments and preliminary phylogenetic trees have been constructed for the two families of these enzymes, including a) mammalian thymidine kinases (TK), poxviruses, African swine fever virus, E. coli, and bacteriophage T4; and b) thymidylate kinases (ThyK) from yeast and poxviruses and distantly related herpesvirus proteins with both enzymatic activities. Analysis of the alignment of the first family TKs highlighted three highly conserved segments. Two of these corresponded to the A and B motifs of the purine NTP binding pattern. The third, C-terminal segment that showed the highest conservation comprised a modified Zn finger motif. It is speculated that this motif may be involved in TK oligomerization. Phylogenetic trees constructed using three different methods suggested that cellular TK genes could be captured independently by T4 bacteriophage, African swine fever virus, fowlpox virus, and the other smallpox viruses. The observed tree topologies appear to contradict popular schemes of virus-host coevolution and imply that different subdivisions of smallpoxviruses diverged at earlier stages of evolution than their hosts. Bacteriophage T4 deoxynucleoside monophosphate kinase has been shown to be related to the ThyK family. Phylogenetic analyzes suggested that ThyK genes were likely acquired independently from phage T4, poxviruses, and herpesviruses.",,"Koonin, E. V.;Senkevich, T. G.",1992.0,Apr,,0
1044,Characterization of the RKZ isolate of ovine herpesvirus 1,"cytopathic effect (CPE), characterized mainly by rounded cell foci, was observed in cultures of primary choroid plexus cells from healthy lambs after cryopreservation. By co-cultivation with infected cells, the infectious agent could be transferred to other primary cells of ovine origin. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that a high percentage of sheep (65-80% in 3 different flocks from Slovakia) are infected with this infectious agent. Electron microscopy of cells with CPE showed the presence of herpesvirus particles. Viral DNA was isolated from infected cells using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and further used as a probe in Southern blot analysis. The probe reacted specifically only with DNA from cells infected with ovine herpesvirus 1 (OvHV-1), but not with DNA from other ruminant herpesviruses. Some of the HindIII restriction fragments of the DNA of the resulting OvHV-1 isolate, designated RKZ, were cloned. A portion of the H9 clone was sequenced, identifying a gene encoding a polypeptide homologous to the conserved herpesvirus VP23 structural protein. From comparison of the sequence of this clone with VP23 sequences of other herpesviruses, it was deduced that OvHV-1 could be classified within the Rhadinovirus genus of the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. The sequencing of the H9 clone of the DNA of the RKZ isolate enabled the establishment of a sensitive and highly specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of OvHV-1.",,"KopÃ¡Äek, J.;RejholcovÃ¡, O.;KoptidesovÃ¡, D.;ÄŒiampor, F.;Rijsewijk, F.

1048,Phylogenetic evolution of the porcine human influenza virus: A 2009 H1N1 pandemic,"Knowing the genome constellation of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus from different countries and different hosts is valuable for monitoring and understanding the evolution and migration of these strains. The complete genome sequences of selected global influenza A viruses are publicly available, and longitudinal genomic studies of human, avian, and swine influenza A viruses are scarce. All downloadable influenza A virus SIV sequences available on the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) platform were first analyzed via the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource web servers. A phylogenetic study of the circulating human pandemic H1N1 virus revealed that the new variant possesses a distinctive evolutionary trait. There is no way the H1N1 pandemic acquired new genes from other distinguishable viruses that have recently been circulating in local human, swine, or domestic fowl populations from different geographic regions. The extensive genetic diversity among entire segments present in the pandemic H1N1 genome suggests that multiple introductions of the virus occurred over the period 1999-2009. The initial interspecies transmission may have occurred in the distant past, and thereafter the reassortant steps result in three lineages: classical SIV prevalent in North America, avian SIV in Europe, and avian, related SIV in Asia.

Experimental inoculation of 1-day-old chickens resulted in lower hematocrit values, atrophy of the thymus and atrophy of the bone marrow. CAV was confirmed by PCR in thymus, bone marrow, Fabricius bursa, liver, spleen, ileocecal tonsils, duodenum and proventriculus. The nucleotide sequence of the gene for the entire viral protein (VP)1 was determined by direct sequencing. The alignment of the VP1 nucleotide sequences of Slovenian CAV isolates (CAV-69/00, CAV-469/01 and CAV-130/03) showed 99.4% to 99.9% homology. VP1 nucleotide sequence alignment of Slovenian isolates with 19 other CAV strains showed 94.4% to 99.4% homology. Slovenian isolates shared the highest homology with the BD-3 isolate from Bangladesh. Alignment of the deduced VP1 amino acids showed that the Slovenian isolates shared 100% homology and had an amino acid sequence most similar (99.6%) to the Bangladeshi BD-3 strain and 99-1% to the G6 strain from Japan was similar to strain L-028 from the United States. The Slovenian isolates were the least similar (96.6%) to strain 82-2 from Japan. A phylogenetic analysis based on the arrangement of the VP1 amino acids showed that the CAV isolates used in the study formed three groups, indicating the possible existence of genetic groups among the CAV strains.

1050,Circulation of infectious bronchitis virus strains of genotypes Italy 02 and QX in Slovenia between 2007 and 2009,"Fourteen infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) detected in broiler, broiler parent and layer flocks in Slovenia between 2007 and 2009 were molecularly analyzed using reverse transcription PCR and direct sequencing of the S1 gene. Phylogenetic analyzes based on partial S1 gene sequences revealed that seven strains were classified as genotype Italy 02, a genetic group of IBV previously undetected in Slovenia. Another seven strains were classified as QX genotype. The results of phylogenetic analyzes and epidemiological investigations revealed that the genetic classification correlates with the geographical origin of the IBV strains. Greater genetic variability (maximum nucleotide and amino acid divergences were 4.8% and 9.9%, respectively) was observed in the Slovenian strains of the Italy 02 genotype detected between 2007 and 2009 than in strains of the QX genotype isolated in 2008 and 2009 (1st .2% and 1.3% respectively). The Slovenian strains classified as Italy 02 genotype form a separate genetic cluster. These strains shared five specific amino acid substitutions that were fixed during the monitoring period. Strains of the QX genotype that share a particular amino acid substitution also form a separate genetic cluster. © 2011 American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"KrapeÅ¾, U.;Slavec, B.;Rojs, O.

1052,Metagenomics - a new approach to studying our microbial neighbors,"Background: In our time, the information society, computer-aided technologies, including data analysis methods, are part of every area of life. Bioinformatics offers approaches to acquiring and updating knowledge that were unthinkable two decades ago. Metagenomics is the field of bioinformatics that helps improve our knowledge of the composition of microbial species in production of pets, humans, or the environment. Aims: This thesis describes the essential steps of a metagenomics analysis. As an example, the metagenomic study of swine dysentery as an important animal disease is shown. Material and Methods: Intestinal contents were collected from three different intestinal sections (ie caecum, colon and rectum) from three clinically affected fattening pigs. All DNA was extracted from the samples and then sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. The 1,782,466 reads produced were pooled and analyzed. The reads were matched against archea, bacterial and viral genome databases by the octopus bioinformatics tool. The results of the alignments were visualized using the Krona tool. Results and Discussion: The presented case study helps the reader to understand how metagenomics studies work and provides new professional knowledge about the microbiome of selected organs in different living beings. The proportions of the different taxa provide insight into the microbial communities of the gut of diseased animals. In addition, a brief overview is given to show the possible applications of metagenomics in the field of animal health. Bioinformatics is an emerging field and it is very important to know about the methods, their possible outcomes and limitations – for both clinicians and researchers. This work provides a simple introduction to metagenomics in the language of veterinarians.",,"Kriko, E.;Farkas, R.;Adorjan, A.;Makrai, L.;Solymosi, N.",2018.0,Jul,,0
1053,Deep sequencing analysis reveals temporal microbiota changes associated with the development of bovine digital dermatitis,"Bovine digital dermatitis (DD) is a leading cause of lameness in dairy cattle worldwide. Despite 35 years of research, the definitive etiological agent associated with the disease process is still unknown. Previous studies have shown that several species of bacteria are associated with lesions, with spirochetes being the most reliably identified organism. This study describes the deep sequencing-based metagenomic analysis of 48 staged DD biopsy specimens collected during a three-year longitudinal study of disease progression. Over 175 million sequences were evaluated using shotgun and 16S metagenomics techniques. Based on the results of shotgun sequencing, there was no evidence of a fungal or DNA virus etiology. The bacterial microbiota of biopsy specimens undergoes a systematic series of changes that correlate with the novel morphological lesion scoring system developed within this project. This scoring system was validated because the microbiota of each stage differed statistically significantly from those of other stages (P<0.001). The microbiota of the control biopsy specimens were the most diverse and became less diverse as lesions developed. Although Treponema spp. predominant in the advanced lesions, they were at relatively low frequency in the newly described early lesions associated with the initiation of the disease process. The consortium of Treponema spp. identified early in the disease changes significantly as the lesions progress through the identified morphologic stages. The results of this study support the hypothesis that DD is a polybacterial disease process and provide unique insights into the temporal changes in bacterial populations during lesion development. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Krull, A.

The cytopathic effect of these viruses on cultured cells was similar to that of enteroviruses. However, virus neutralization tests against standard antisera were negative. Phylogenetic analysis with the complete VP4 nucleotide sequences of these 6 viruses and 29 serotypes of enteroviruses classified 3 of the viruses as serotype Echovirus Type 18 (EV18) and 3 as serotype Human Enterovirus 71 (HEV71). These results were confirmed by remicroneutralization tests with HEV monospecific antisera or additional phylogenetic analysis with the complete VP4 nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic analysis using complete VP4 genes is more useful in identifying enterovirus serotypes than neutralization tests using enterovirus serotype-specific antisera.",,"Kubo, H.;Iritani, N.;Seto, Y.",2002.0,,,0

The 23,957 bp genome sequence was obtained through the combined use of semiconductor and capillary sequencing. Although genomic characterization showed that the virus most closely resembled bush viper reovirus strain 47/02, and in phylogenies performed on all segments, the two strains formed a monophyletic group, nucleotide (48.4–70, 3%) and amino acid (39.2 -80.7%) sequence identity values between the two reptilian reoviruses were moderate.

1057,Next Generation Sequencing (NGS): Analysis of fecal samples from pigs with diarrhea,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are a major breakthrough in the field of infectious disease diagnostics, as they enable the detection of novel pathogens without prior sequence knowledge, enabling simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens, whole genome studies, and metagenome studies. The aim of this study was to determine the value of NGS in detecting pathogens in clinical specimens, namely specimens from diarrheal pigs. Fecal samples from four pigs with severe diarrhea were analyzed. NGS libraries were made from sample suspensions and used for Ion torrent sequencing. A total of 396,486 reads were assembled into 1,537 contigs. Taxonomy units were assigned 786 contigs while 751 contigs remained unassigned. All four specimens were positive for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PED). Viruses of the genus Picobirnavirus and porcine Astrovirus were also detected in two samples, while one sample was positive for virus of the genus Torovirus. In addition to viral sequences, sequences from bacteria, archaea, nematodes, protista and amoebas were also detected in the samples examined. Based on these results, we can conclude that NGS technology is a powerful tool for infectious disease diagnostics, allowing us to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in complex samples.",,"Kuhar, U.;Kusar, D.;Papic, B.;Toplak, I.",2016.0,,,0
1058,Virus nomenclature below the species level: A standardized nomenclature for laboratory animal-adapted strains and variants of viruses belonging to the family Filoviridae,"The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) organizes the classification of viruses into taxa, but is not responsible for the nomenclature of taxa members. International expert groups such as the ICTV Study Groups recommend the classification and naming of viruses and their strains, variants and isolates. The ICTV Filoviridae Study Group recently introduced an updated classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Subsequently, together with numerous other filovirus experts, a unified nomenclature for their natural genetic variants and isolates was developed, aiming at simplifying the retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases. This is an important first step towards a viral genome annotation standard as envisaged by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Here, this work is extended to include filoviruses obtained in the laboratory by artificial selection by passage in laboratory hosts. The previously developed template for naming natural filovirus genetic variants (<virus name> <isolation host suffix>/<country of sampling>/<year of sampling>/<genetic variant name>-<isolate name>) is retained, but it it is proposed to adapt the type of information added to each field for variants adapted to laboratory animals. For example, the full name of a Mayinga variant of the Ebola virus adapted at the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology would be ""Vector"", which is said to cause diseases in guinea pigs after seven passages, similar to ""Ebola virus VECTOR/C.porcellus-lab /COD/ 1976/Mayinga-GPA-P7"". As suggested for the names of natural filovirus variants, we recommend using the full name in databases and in the methods section of publications. Abbreviated names (e.g. ""EBOV VECTOR/C.por/COD /76/May-GPA-P7"") and abbreviations (e.g. ""EBOV/May-GPA-P7"") may be used in further text depending on the importance of conveying information that is full-length in the name ""EBOV"" would suffice if only one EBOV strain/variant/isolate is addressed © 2013 Springer-Verlag Vienna (outside US).",,"Kuhn, J.

Recent molecular characterization of both viruses confirmed their already known close serological relationship and revealed that they are non-segmented, single-stranded and negative-stranded RNA viruses uniquely related to members of the order Mononegavirales (Bornaviruses, Filoviruses, Paramyxoviruses and Rhabdoviruses). A third pathogen, soybean cyst nematode virus 1 (SbCNV-1, previously named soybean cyst nematode nyavirus), was recently identified as an additional member of this new virus group.

1060,Taxonomic reorganization of the family Bornaviridae,"Knowledge of bornaviruses has increased significantly over the past decade. A possible reservoir of mammalian Borna disease virus has been identified, distinct Bornaviruses have been identified in birds and reptiles, and endogenous Bornavirus-like elements have been discovered in the genomes of several vertebrate species. Previous sequence comparisons and alignments have shown that the members of the current Bornaviridae family are phylogenetically diverse and not adequately classified in the existing Bornavirus taxonomy supported by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). We provide an update of these analyzes and describe their impact on the taxonomy. We propose keeping the surname Bornaviridae and the genus Bornavirus, but reorganizing the species classification. PAirwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) of Bornavirus genomes and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) comparison of genome and protein sequences combined with other previously published phylogenetic analyzes and known biological properties of Bornaviruses indicate that this genus contains at least five species should include : Mammalian 1 bornavirus (classic borna disease virus and divergent borna disease virus isolate #/98), Psittaciform 1 bornavirus (bird/psittazine bornavirus 1, 2, 3, 4, 7), Passeriform 1 bornavirus (Avian/Canary Bornavirus C1, C2, C3, LS), Passeriform 2 Bornavirus (Estrildid Finch Bornavirus EF) and Waterbird 1 Bornavirus (Avian Bornavirus 062CG). This classification is also consistent with the biological properties of these viruses and their vertebrate hosts. A snake bornavirus to be designated Loveridge's garter snake virus 1 should be classified as a member of another species (Elapid 1 bornavirus) not assigned to any genus in the Bornaviridae family. Avian Bornaviruses 5, 6, MALL and another 'Reptilian Bornavirus' ('Gaboon Viper Virus') should remain unclassified until further information is available.

1061,Reorganization and expansion of the nidoviral family Arteriviridae,"The Arteriviridae family currently includes a single genus, Arterivirus. This genus includes four species as taxonomic homes for Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV), Lactate Dehydrogenase Elevating Virus (LDV), Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), and Simian Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (SHFV), respectively . A revision of this classification is urgently needed to take into account the recent description of eleven very different simian arteriviruses in various African non-human primates, a novel arterivirus in an African forest opossum, and a novel arterivirus in common bushtails in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is inconsistent with the latest version of the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated, modified, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence cutoffs are constructed based on a newly established phylogeny of the 1b open reading frame and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of encoding complete arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDV + PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFV + simian arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the opossum arterivirus), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus is divided into two species to reflect the marked divergence of the European and American ""types"" of PRRSV, both of which are now given viral status. The current species of simian hemorrhagic fever virus is divided into nine species to accommodate the twelve known simian arteriviruses. Non-Latinized binomial species names are introduced to replace all current species names to clearly distinguish them from virus names, which remain largely unchanged.",,"Kuhn, J.

1062,Genomic Characterization of the Genus Nairovirus (Family Bunyaviridae),"Nairovirus, one of five Bunyavirus genera, includes seven species. Genomic sequence information is limited for members of the Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes, Qalyub, Sakhalin, and Thiafora nairovirus species. We used next-generation sequencing and historical viral culture samples to determine 14 full-length and nine coding full-length nairoviral genome sequences to further characterize these species. Viruses not previously sequenced include Abu Mina, Clo Mor, Great Saltee, Hughes, Raza, Sakhalin, Soldado, and Tillamook viruses. In addition, we present genomic sequence information on additional isolates of previously sequenced Avalon, Dugbe, Sapphire II and Zirqa viruses. Finally, we identify Tunis virus, previously thought to be a phlebovirus, as an isolate of Abu Hammad virus. Phylogenetic analyzes indicate the need for reassignment of Sapphire II virus to Dera Ghazi Khan nairovirus and reassignment of Hazara, Tofla and Nairobi sheep disease viruses to new species. We also propose new species for the Kasokero group (Kasokero, Leopards Hill, Yogue viruses), the Ketarah group (Gossas, Issyk-kul, Keterah/Soft tick viruses) and the Burana group (WÄ“ nzhÅ u tick virus, Huángpí) before tick virus 1, TÇŽchéng tick virus 1).

1063,Occurrence of endogenous viral genes in two strains of white Leghorn chickens selected for egg production and susceptibility or resistance to Marek's disease,"Endogenous viral (ev) genes related to avian leukosis virus were classified in two differentially selected Leghorn strains to investigate whether such genes affect production traits. Strain K had been selected for resistance to Marek's disease (MD) and for high egg production and egg weight, while strain S had been selected only for MD sensitivity. Aside from the fact that the founders of phylum K included some commercial birds, both phyla were derived from a common genetic base. DNA restriction fragment length analyzes of 110 strain K and 94 strain S birds revealed the presence of 8 different ev genes, 6 of which were identical to previously identified loci. This result was confirmed by testing for group specific antigen (gs antigen), the product of the gag region of the ev genes. The levels of gs antigen in the birds closely followed the predictions from data obtained from previously described ev genes. Both strains had a similar average number of ev genes per bird (3.5 and 3.2 for strains S and K, respectively). However, strain K carried only five different ev genes, while strain S carried seven. Four of these loci were present in both strains. Among the ev genes absent or less common in strain K were those encoding either infectious endogenous virus (ev-10 and possibly ev-19) or the internal viral gag proteins (ev-3). Only those ev genes that are transcriptionally silent or that encode the viral envelope gene were present at increased frequency in strain K. The results indicate that selection for egg traits and/or resistance to Marek's disease reduces the abundance of ev genes that produce endogenous virus or the viral gag proteins.",,"Kuhnlein, U.;Gavora, J.

1064,Natural viral infection by pest des petits ruminants: novel pathologic findings resembling other morbillivirus infections,"The present study describes pathological and virological findings in 15 sheep and 6 goats that died in Turkey from natural infection with Petits ruminant virus plague. Pathologic findings included erosive-ulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulative necrosis in the liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in the lymphatic tissue. Syncytial cells were prominent, particularly in the oral mucosa, alveoli, liver and lymphatic tissue. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions have been observed in epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and abomasal mucosa. Immune labeling of the viral antigen was observed in addition to the more typical sites in kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart and myocytes of the tongue. In this study, we report and describe in detail the first small ruminant plague endemic to Kirikkale Province, Central Anatolia of Turkey. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathological findings in natural viral infection with small ruminant plague provide a basis for similarity to other morbillivirus infections, such as. B. Canine distemper and marine mammal distemper. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyzes showed that the 448 bp genomic fragment was amplified in 18 cases (18/21, 85.7%).

1065,Emergence of novel reassortant H6N2 avian influenza viruses in ducks in India,"Recent reports of human infection by avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H6, which is widespread in terrestrial poultry, indicate the virus' evolution into a possible pandemic strain. Here we report the antigenic and genetic characterization of two H6N2 viruses isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in Kerala and Assam, India, in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The hemagglutination inhibition assay demonstrated antigenic divergence between the two isolates, confirmed by amino acid differences at 55 positions (15.98%) between their hemagglutinin (HA) 1 pathogenic to poultry and susceptible to oseltamivir. However, Kerala14 had a V27I mutation marker for amantadine resistance in M2. Assam15 virus had additional N-linked glycosylation on HA2 (position 557) compared to Kerala14 virus. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that both viruses belonged to different lineages (Eurasian and Asiatic II). The phylogeny of neuraminidase and internal gene segments revealed that both viruses are novel reassortants and are genetically distinct with different gene constellations. The results suggest that independent introductions of the two H6N2 viruses to India and migratory wild birds on the Central Asian flyway could be the source of H6N2 viruses in ducks in India. Therefore, continued AIV surveillance in poultry and wild birds is essential to early detect the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential and to control their spread.",,"Kumar, M.;Nagarajan, S.;Murugkar, H.

In the present study, an orf outbreak in the Muzzaffarnagari sheep flock at the Central Institute for Research on Goats (CIRG), Makhdoom, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India was investigated. Primary goat testicle cell culture was first used to isolate orf virus (ORFV). The identity of the virus was confirmed by amplification and sequence analysis of the major envelope glycoprotein (B2L) gene and designated ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. In the phylogenetic analysis of the B2L protein gene, it clustered with the ORFV strains from China, suggesting that different ORFV strains circulate in India.

1067,Hepatitis E Virus: The Current Scenario,"Hepatitis E infection, caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause of acute hepatitis in developing countries with poor sanitation and hygiene. The virus is divided into four genotypes (1-4) with one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 2 exclusively infect humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 also infect other animals, particularly pigs. Large outbreaks of acute hepatitis caused by genotype 1 or 2 viruses are common in endemic areas due to fecal-oral transmission, usually through contamination of drinking water. With a high relapse rate in young adults (aged 15 to 45 years), the disease is particularly severe (20 to 30% mortality) in pregnant women. HEV appears to be a zoonotic disease transmitted by swine, wild boar, and deer, or through food. Chronic infections are rare, except in immunocompromised individuals, such as B. Recipients of organ transplants. A subunit vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease but is not yet commercially available. Our understanding of HEV has changed significantly in recent years and in this article we review the information currently available regarding the molecular biology, pathobiology and epidemiology of HEV infection. We also review current therapeutic interventions and strategies used to control HEV infection, with a focus on potential approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against HEV. © 2012 International Society for Infectious Diseases.",,"Kumar, S.;Subhadra, S.;Singh, B.;Panda, B.

A complete genome sequence is not currently available for the three African viruses Bagaza, Zika and Kedougou viruses, each of which represents a separate virus subgroup according to the latest virus classification. In this study, we obtained a complete genome sequence from each of these three viruses and characterized the open reading frames (ORFs) in terms of gene sizes, cleavage sites, potential glycosylation sites, distribution of cysteine residues, and unique motifs. The sequences of the three viruses were then scanned for genetic relatedness across the entire length of the ORF against available sequences from other African flaviviruses and selected reference viruses. Overall, the data showed that Kedougou virus was close but distinct from dengue viruses, while Bagaza virus shared genetic relatedness with West Nile virus in several genomic regions.

1069,Muscovy Duck Reovirus ÏƒC protein is atypically encoded by the smallest genome segment,"Although musk duck reovirus (DRV) shares characteristics with the reovirus isolated from chickens, commonly referred to as avian reovirus (ARV), the two virus species are antigenically distinct. Similar to the previously identified DRV βB-encoding gene (1201 bp long), the three other small double-stranded RNA genomic segments of DRV have been cloned and sequenced. They were 1325, 1191, and 1124 bp, respectively, and contained conserved terminal sequences common to ARVs. They encoded individual expression products except for the smallest (S4) which contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). BLAST analysis revealed that the proteins encoded by the 1325 and 1191 bp genes shared high levels of identity with ARV ÏƒA and ÏƒNS, respectively, and to a lesser extent with other orthoreovirus counterparts. No homology was found for the S4 ORF1-encoded p10 protein. The 29.4 kDa product encoded by S4 ORF2 appeared to be 25% identical to ARV S1 ORF3-encoded κC, a cell-binding oligomer that induces type-specific neutralizing antibodies. The introduction of large gaps in the N-terminal part of the DRV protein was necessary to improve the amino acid sequence alignment of DRV and ARV ÏƒC. However, a leucine zipper motif was conserved, and secondary structure analysis predicted a three-stranded α-helical coiled-coil function at this amino moiety. Thus, despite extensive sequence discrepancies, DRV ΔC has been proposed to be structurally and probably functionally related to ARV ΔC. This work provides evidence for the diversity of the polycistronic S-class genes of reoviruses isolated from avians and raises the question of the relative classification of DRV in the orthoreovirus genus.",,"Kuntz-Simon, G.;Le Gall-ReculÃ©, G.;de BoissÃ©son, C.;Jestin, V.",2002.0,,,0
1070,"Comparative metagenomic profiling of symbiotic bacterial communities associated with Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes pavlovskyi, and Dermacentor reticulatus ticks","Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes pavlovskyi, and Dermacentor reticulatus ticks living in western Siberia are responsible for transmitting a number of pathogens that cause tick-borne diseases in humans and animals. Since these ticks are plentiful in the suburbs of large cities, agricultural areas and popular tourist spots, and often infest humans and livestock, data on the microbiome of these organisms are needed. Using 16S metagenomic profiling, we assess bacterial communities associated with I. persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi, and D. reticulatus ticks collected from the Novosibirsk region of Russia. A total of 1214 ticks were used for this study. DNA extracted from the ticks was pooled by tick species and sex. Sequencing of the V3-V5 domains of 16S rRNA genes was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform. The following bacterial genera were common in the studied communities: Acinetobacter (all three tick species), Rickettsia (I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus) and Francisella (D. reticulatus). B. burgdorferi sensu lato and B. miyamotoi sequences have been detected in I. persulcatus and I. pavlovskyi but not in D. reticulatus ticks. The pooled samples of all tick species examined contained bacteria from the Anaplasmataceae family, although their abundance was low. DNA from A. phagocytophilum and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was first observed in I. pavlovskyi ticks. Significant interspecies differences were observed in the number of bacterial taxa as well as in intraspecies diversity associated with tick sex. The bacterial communities associated with the I. pavlovskyi ticks showed higher biodiversity compared to those of the I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus ticks. Bacterial community structure was also diverse among the tick species studied, as shown by permutation analysis of variance using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric (p=0.002). The variation between sexes was confirmed by PERMANOVA tests in I. persulcatus (p=0.042) and I. pavlovskyi (p=0.042) ticks. Our study showed that 16S metagenomic profiling could be used to rapidly estimate the abundance of medically important bacteria in tick populations inhabiting different natural biotopes, and thus the epidemic hazard of studied flocks.",,"Kurilshikov, A.;Livanova, N.

1071,Genetic diversity and intergenogroup recombination events of sapoviruses detected in pig feces in Japan,"Sapoviruses (SaV) are enteric viruses that infect humans and animals. SaVs are very diverse and are divided into several genogroups based on structural protein sequences (VP1). SaVs detected in pigs belong to eight genogroups (GIII, GV, GVI, GVII, GVIII, GIX, GX, and GXI), but little is known about the distribution of SaV genogroups in the Japanese pig population. In the present study, 26 nearly complete genomes (> 6000 nucleotides: nt) and three partial sequences (2429 nt, 4364 nt and 4419 nt length, including the entire VP1 coding region) of SaV were obtained from one diarrhea patient and 15 non-patients - Diarrheal pig feces in Japan via a metagenomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 amino acid sequence (aa) revealed that 29 porcine SaVs were classified into seven genogroups; GIII (11 strains), GV (1 strain), GVI (3 strains), GVII (6 strains), GVIII (1 strain), GX (3 strains) and GXI (4 strains).

Most Korean strains formed a distinctive cluster in genotype VI and were genetically distant (4.0-8.7%) from other subtypes (a, b, c, d, and e) and tentatively designated VIf. Some Korean strains isolated in 1995 were grouped into genotype VIIa and they were closer to Taiwanese strains than western Europeans.

The relationship between the first and the recurring viruses is unclear. To determine the molecular epizootiology of recurrent LPAI, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using partial nucleotide sequences of four gene segments (HA, NA, NP, and PB2) from eight H9N2 viruses of chicken origin. The H9N2 recurrent viruses showed greater nucleotide similarity in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes to the 1996 Korean isolates than other Eurasian viruses, and formed a clear cluster with the early Korean isolates and some isolates from migratory and domestic ducks in Japan and China. Phylogenetic analyzes using internal genes showed that some Korean isolates formed a cluster with other subtypes such as H5N1, H6N1 and H6N2 in China and Taiwan. These results suggest that the recurrent viruses are descendants of early Korean H9N2 isolates, but further studies are needed to explain their phylogenetic relationship to viruses in China. © 2006 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Kwon, H.

1077,Different vaccination routes affect the infectivity and pathogenesis of H5N1 infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chickens and domestic ducks,"Classified as Qinghai-like virus (clade 2.2), H5N1 type A influenza viruses are a unique lineage of type A influenza viruses with the ability to cause significant disease and fatality in gallinaceous and anseriform birds, including domestic and wild ducks. The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility and pathogenesis of chickens and domestic ducks to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/224/05 (H5N1) when administered via the respiratory tract or diet. The chickens and ducks were more susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus, as evidenced by low infectious and lethal virus doses, when exposed intranasally compared to dietary routes of vaccination (intragastric or orally fed infected chicken meat). In the dietary exposure pathogenesis study, pathological changes included hemorrhage, necrosis and inflammation associated with virus detection. These changes were generally observed in most chicken visceral organs between 2 and 4 days post-inoculation (DPI) and resemble lesions and viral localizations observed in birds in natural cases or in experimental studies using intranasal administration. Dietary exposure to the virus caused the ducks to develop a systemic infection characterized by moderate lymphocytic encephalitis, necrotized hepatitis, and pancreatitis with corresponding virus detection within the lesions. In both chickens and ducks with food exposure, lesions, virus, or both, were first detected in the upper alimentary tract at 1 DPI, suggesting that the alimentary tract was the first site to be affected after ingestion of infected meat or gavage of virus in liquid medium was affected . However, as shown in the chicken infectivity study, dietary infection required higher exposure doses to induce infection compared to intranasal exposure in chickens. These data suggest that upper respiratory exposure to the H5N1 HPAI virus in birds is more likely to result in virus infection and transmission than consumption of infected meat, unless the latter contains high levels of virus, such as those found in cannibalized infected carcasses are found. © American Association of Avian Pathologists 2010.",,"Kwon, Y.

1078,Virological surveillance and preliminary antigenic characterization of influenza viruses in pigs in five European countries from 2006 to 2008,"This study presents the results of virological surveillance of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Belgium, UK, Italy, France and Spain from 2006 to 2008. Our main objectives were to clarify the occurrence of the three SIV subtypes - H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 - at regional level for the identification of new reassortant viruses and for the antigenic comparison of SIVs with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were examined by virus isolation. The subtypes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) were determined using standard methods. Out of a total of 169 viruses, 81 were classified as ""bird-like"" H1N1, 36 as human-like H3N2 and 47 as human-like H1N2. Only five new reassortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had human-like HA and three H1N2 viruses had avian-like HA. All three SIV subtypes have been detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses have been detected in the UK and north-west France. Cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing with hyperimmune sera against selected older and newer human influenza viruses revealed a strong antigenic relationship between 1980s human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and H1N2 and H3N2 humanoid SIVs, confirming their common origin. However, antisera to human viruses isolated during the last decade did not react with currently circulating H1 or H3 SIVs, suggesting that young people in particular may be susceptible to some degree of SIV infection. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"Kyriakis, C.

Various reassortants of pandemic ""swine"" H1N1 influenza A vaccine viruses (121XP, X-179A and X-181) and wild-type strains A/California/07/2009(H1N1) and A/PR/8/34 have been identified propagated embryonated eggs and used for Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq DNA/RNA sequencing. The RNA sequences of these viruses published in the NCBI were used as references for aligning the sequencing reads generated in this study. Consensus sequences of these viruses differed from the NCBI deposited sequences at several nucleotides. 121XP strain obtained by reverse genetics was more heterogeneous than X-179A and X-181 strain produced by conventional reassortant technology. The passaged 121XP virus contained four non-synonymous mutations in the HA gene. One of these mutations (Lys226Glu) was in the antigenic Ca site of HA (present in 18% of the population). Two non-synonymous mutations were present in HA from viruses derived from X-179A: Pro314Gln (18%) and Asn146Asp (78%). The latter mutation, located in the Sa antigenic site, was also detected at a low level (11%) in wild-type A/California/07/2009(H1N1) virus and was present as a complete substitution in those X-181-derived Viruses present from the X-179A virus. In the passaged X-181 viruses, two mutations occurred in HA: a silent mutation A1398G (31%) in one batch and G756T (Glu252Asp, 47%) in another batch. The latter mutation was localized in the conservative region of the Ca antigenic site. The RNA sequencing protocol proved to be robust, reproducible and suitable for monitoring the genetic consistency of influenza vaccine seed stocks.",,"Laassri, M.;Zagorodnyaya, T.;Plant, E.

The Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae is an example. The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a very diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Here we report complete genome sequences for 11 viruses within this group, with a focus on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyzes revealed the presence of high genetic diversity within these two species complexes, consistent with that of the five other species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported interspecies divergence thresholds, the data suggested that these two complexes should indeed be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic clade apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence divergences between viruses in this group and viruses in other species complexes of the Simbu serogroup were similar to the degrees of divergence between the other orthobunyavirus serogroups.

In this study, we sequenced entire genomes of eight H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic fowl in eastern China, and compared them to those of typical influenza virus strains. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that all eight genomes belonged to clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 7.2, the two main circulating clades in China. Viruses clustered in clade 2.3.2.1 shared a high degree of homology with H5N1 isolates from East Asia. Isolates accumulating in clade 7.2 have been found to circulate across China, with an east-west density gradient. Pathogenicity studies in mice showed that these isolates replicate in the lungs and clade 2.3.2.1 viruses have a significantly higher level of virulence compared to clade 7.2 viruses.

CaPV infections produce similar symptoms in sheep and goats, and the three viruses cannot be distinguished serologically. As there are conflicting opinions on the host specificity of CaPVs, particularly for goatpox and ovinepox viruses, the development of rapid genotyping tools will enable more accurate disease diagnosis and surveillance for better management of capripox outbreaks. This paper describes a species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on unique molecular markers found in the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR) gene sequences of CaPVs, using dual hybridization probes for their simultaneous detection, quantification and genotyping. The assay can differentiate between CaPV strains based on differences in melting point temperature (Tm) obtained after fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA). It is highly sensitive and has low intra- and inter-run variation. This real-time PCR assay will make a significant contribution to CaPV diagnosis and better understanding of CaPV epidemiology by enabling rapid genotyping and gene-based classification of viral strains and unambiguous identification of isolates. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Lamien, C.

1088,Avian Flu - Eradication in commercial poultry is still nowhere in sight,"Avian influenza viruses are highly contagious microorganisms that mainly affect birds. Nonetheless, they have also been isolated from a number of mammals, including humans. The avian flu virus can cause great economic losses to the poultry industry due to its high mortality rate. Although there are pathogenic variants with low virulence, which usually cause only mild or no clinical symptoms, subtypes H5 and H7 can mutate from a low virulence to a high virulence (pathogenic) virus and should be considered in eradication strategies. The primary source of infection for farmed poultry is direct and indirect contact with wild birds, with waterfowl being a natural reservoir of the virus. Live poultry markets, exotic birds and ostriches also play a significant role in avian influenza epidemiology. Secondary transmission (ie between poultry farms) of the avian influenza virus is mainly attributed to fomites and humans. Airborne transmission is also important, and the virus can be spread in humans through aerosols. Diagnostic tests detect viral proteins and genes. Virus-specific antibodies can be detected by serological testing, with virus isolation and identification being complementary methods. The number of bird flu outbreaks seems to be increasing - in the last 5 years outbreaks have been reported from Italy, Hong Kong, Chile, Netherlands, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, China, Pakistan, United States of America, Canada, South Africa and Malaysia. In addition, a growing number of human cases of avian influenza, some fatal, have been occurring in parallel with outbreaks in commercial poultry. There is great concern about the possibility that a new virus subtype with pandemic potential could emerge from these outbreaks. From a human health perspective, eradicating the virus in poultry is imperative; However, the large number of small-scale poultry farms, lack of control experience and resources, and international scale of transmission and infection make rapid control and long-term prevention of recurrence difficult. In the western world, renewed interest in free-range farming poses a threat to future outbreaks. The growing ethical objections to large-scale bird culling call for a different approach to eradicating avian influenza.",,"Landman, W. J. M.;Schrier, C. C.",2004.0,,,0
1089,Three novel canine papillomaviruses support the formation of taxonomic clades,"More than 100 human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been identified and their entire genomes sequenced. Most of these HPVs can be divided into three different genera, the alpha, beta, and gamma papillomaviruses (PVs). It should be noted that only one or a small number of PVs were identified for each individual animal species. However, four canine PVs (CPVs) (COPV, CPV2, CPV3 and CPV4) have been described and their entire genomic sequences published. Because of their sequence similarities, they belong to three different clades. In the present study, circular viral DNA was amplified from three dogs showing evidence of pigmented plaques, endophytic papilloma, or squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Analysis of the DNA sequences suggested that these are three new viruses (CPV5, CPV6 and CPV7) whose genomes contain all the conserved sequence elements of known PVs. The genomes of these seven CPVs were compared to properly classify them. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis as well as pairwise sequence alignments of the putative amino acid sequences showed that CPV5 grouped well with CPV3 and CPV4, while CPV7 grouped with CPV2, but neither group matched other classified PVs. However, CPV6 groups with COPV, a lambda PV. Based on this evidence, therefore, the assignment of CPVs to three different clades could be supported. Therefore, similar to HPVs, it could be that the known and currently unknown CPVs are related and form only a few clades or genera. © 2009 SGM.",,"Lange, C.

In this review, we focus on therapeutic approaches for some of the more important tick-borne viruses from these 3 families. These viruses are Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) and the newly discovered tick-borne phleboviruses known as thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), heartland virus and bhanja virus of the Bunyaviridae family, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV ), Powassan virus (POWV), Louping ill virus (LIV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) from the Flaviviridae family. To date, there is no effective antiviral drug against most of these tick-borne viruses. Although antiviral drugs such as ribavirin are commonly used to treat CCHF in some countries, there are concerns that ribavirin may not be as effective against CCHF as initially thought. Here we also discuss the availability of vaccines to combat these viral infections. The lack of treatment and prevention approaches for these viruses is highlighted and we hope this review can increase public health awareness of the threat posed by this group of viruses. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",,"Lani, R.;Moghaddam, E.;Haghani, A.;Chang, L.

1091,Habitat and genome structure of the marine Pseudoalteromonas siphovirus B8b isolated from the northwest Mediterranean,"Marine viruses (phages) alter bacterial diversity and evolution with implications for marine biogeochemical cycles, and yet few well-developed model systems limit the possibilities for hypothesis testing. Here we isolate Mediterranean phage B8b using Pseudoalteromonas sp. QC-44 as a host and characterize it using myriad techniques. Morphologically, phage B8b has been classified as a member of the Siphoviridae family. One-step growth analysis showed that this siphovirus had a latency period of 70 min and released 172 new virus particles per cell. Host range analysis against 89 bacterial host strains revealed that phage B8b encoded 3 Pseudoalteromonas strains (52 tested, >99.9% nucleotide identity of 16S rRNA gene) and 1 non-Pseudoaltermonas strain related to Alteromonas sp. (37 strains from 6 genera tested), helping to limit the phylogenetic distance possible in a phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer event. The genome size of Pseudoalteromonas phage B8b was 42.7 kb, with clear structural and replication modules, the former being delineated by exploiting the identification of 16 structural genes by virion structural proteomics, only 4 of which showed any similarity to known structural proteins. In nature, this phage was widespread in coastal marine environments in both photic and aphotic layers (found in 26.5% of available viral metagenomes), but was not abundant in any sample (average abundance per sample was 0.65% of reads ). Together, these data improve our understanding of siphoviruses in nature and provide fundamental information for a new ""rare virosphere"" phage-host model system.",,"Lara, E.;Holmfeldt, K.;Solonenko, N.;Sa, E.

1092,Blood transcriptomes reveal novel parasitic zoonoses circulating in Madagascar's lemurs,"Zoonoses are an imminent threat to the world's population, and nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases can spread among wild animals, domestic animals and humans. A One World, One Health perspective provides us with an ideal framework to understand and potentially contain the spread of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact between humans, livestock and wildlife, and increasing the potential for disease spread. Given Madagascar's long geographic isolation, coupled with the recent and repeated introduction of agricultural and invasive species, it is likely that a number of circulating pathogens in lemur populations remain uncharacterized. Therefore, it is imperative that new approaches for de novo pathogen discovery are implemented. To this end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from two species of critically endangered wild lemurs (Indri indri and Propithecus diadema) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results reveal several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating in lemurs, some of which can cause disease in wildlife, livestock, and humans. We anticipate that advanced methods for de novo identification of unknown pathogens will have broad utility in characterizing other complex disease transmission systems.",,"Larsen, P. A.;Hayes, C.

1093,Characterization of a novel potyvirus that naturally infects chickpeas,"During the growing seasons from 1999 to 2001, symptoms consisting of mosaic formation, stunting, yellowing, wilting, internodal shortening and phloem discoloration were observed in chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) grown in Chuquisaca Department, southern Bolivia. In some fields, around 10% of the plants showed virus-like symptoms and suffered from severely reduced seed yields. Lentils (Lens culinaris) were also observed to be infected, but not peas (Pisum sativum) or broad beans (Vicia faba) growing in nearby fields. Infected chickpea tissue reacted positively to the potyvirus group-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), but there was no serological reaction with antisera to the yellow bean mosaic virus, yellow clover vein virus, cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, pea seed-borne mosaic virus, bean common mosaic virus, or bean potyviruses -Common Mosaic Necrosis Virus. Western blots of total protein extracts probed with the potyvirus MAb revealed a single band of approximately 32 kDa. Comparative sequence analysis of cDNA clones generated from the putative coat protein gene consisted of 282 amino acids (31.9 kDa) and showed moderate identities of 67, 66, 163, 63 and 61% with the coat proteins of potyvirus Pepper Severe Mosaic Virus , Pepper Yellow Mosaic Virus, Potato Virus Y, Plum Pox Virus and Pepper Mottle Virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the coat protein amino acid sequence revealed that this virus is a unique member of the family Potyviridae and is phylogenetically most closely related to a group of Solanaceae-infecting potyviruses and not to other legume-infecting potyviruses.

1094,Recent developments in research with BHV-4,"Type 4 bovine herpesvirus is widespread in cattle herds around the world. Although the virus is not a direct pathogen, its role in secondary infections makes it an important pathogen for research purposes. The paper summarizes the results of foreign and domestic laboratories over the past five years. The main results of foreign research groups were the identification of a protein that plays a role in virus-cell interaction, some data on the replication cycle and a detailed study of viral DNA, which provided new clues for the classification of this virus in the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. Ever since the first BHV-4 strain was isolated in Hungary (BARTHA, 1963), this virus has always been one of the main targets of their research activities. In animal experiments, they examined the spread, distribution, viremia and latency of the virus using various methods such as polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and virus isolation. The virus shares some characteristics of beta and gamma herpesviruses. During infection, the virus binds mainly to the respiratory and immune systems, persists in leukocytes for a very long time, periodically appears in blood serum and establishes persistent infection in nerve and nerve cells. immune tissue. By reducing the mitotic activity of leukocytes in vitro, the virus may play a role in inhibiting some immune functions.",,"Laszlo, E.",1999.0,Apr,,0

1096,The discovery and sequence analysis of four avian deltacoronaviruses in the Middle East reveals interspecies hopping with recombination as a potential mechanism for bird-to-bird and bird-to-mammal transmission,"The emergence of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East has once again demonstrated that animal coronaviruses (CoVs) are a potential source of human epidemics. To investigate deltacoronavirus diversity in animals in the Middle East, we tested fecal samples from 1,356 mammals and birds in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Four novel deltacoronaviruses were detected in eight birds from four species by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR): FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a hawk, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a Houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE -HKU30 of five quail. Full genome sequencing showed that FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 belong to the same CoV species, suggesting recent interspecies transmission between hawks and their prey, Houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain. Western blotting detected specific anti-FalCoV-UAE-HKU27 antibodies in 33 (75%) of 44 hawk serum samples, supporting true infection in hawks after virus ingestion. QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 belongs to the same CoV species as porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), previously discovered in pigs and tree sparrows, respectively, and supporting bird-to-pig transmission. Recombination involving the spike protein is common in deltacoronaviruses, which may facilitate transmission between species. FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 originate from the recombination between white eye coronavirus HKU16 (WECoV HKU16) and magpie robin coronavirus HKU18 (MRCoV HKU18), QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from recombination between PorCoV HKU15/SpCoV HKU17 and Munia coronavirus HKU13 (MunCoV HKU13) and PorCoV HKU15 from the recombination between SpCoV HKU17 and bulbul coronavirus HKU11 (BuCoV HKU11). Birds in the Middle East are hosts for various deltacoronaviruses with potential for transmission between species.<b>IMPORTANT</b> In an attempt to study deltacoronavirus diversity among mammals and birds in Dubai, four new deltacoronaviruses were identified in fecal samples from eight detected birds of four different species: FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a Houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon and QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from five quails. Genome analysis revealed evidence of recent interspecies transmission between hawks and their prey, Houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as transmission from bird to pig. Recombination, which is known to be common in some coronaviruses, was also common in these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly in the spike region. Such recombination, involving the receptor-binding protein, can contribute to the emergence of new viruses capable of infecting new hosts. Birds in the Middle East are hosts for various deltacoronaviruses with potential for transmission between species.",,"Lau, S. K. P.;Wong, E. Y. M.;Tsang, C. C.;Ahmed, S. S.;Au-Yeung, R. K.

1097,Chickens harbor various picornaviruses derived from possible interspecies transmission using recombination,"While chickens are an important reservoir for emerging pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, little is known about the diversity of picornaviruses in poultry. We have discovered a previously unknown variety of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 trachea samples from 93 out of 900 chickens by reverse transcription-PCR, and their partial 3Dpol gene sequences constitute five distinct clades (I to V) among the known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different strains revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six new picornavirus species (ChPV1 from strain I, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from strain II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from strain III, ChGV1 from strain IV) and one existing species (bird -encephalomyelitis virus). from group V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes presented distinct phylogenetic locations and genomic features distinct from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. In addition, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a new genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, particularly in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. Nevertheless, these novel picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses from other avian species (ChPV1 related to Passerivirus A, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to Avisivirus A and Duck Hepatitis A virus, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to Melegrivirus A, ChGV1 to Gallivirus A). In addition, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus whose P2 and P3 regions may be derived from melegrivirus A. Chickens are an important reservoir for various picornaviruses that can cross avian species barriers through mutation or recombination. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Lau, S. K. P.;Woo, P. C. Y.;Yip, C. C.

Knowledge of the diversity of viromes present in reservoir species can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens. In this study, we advance the knowledge of porcine astrovirus diversity by reporting the genetic characterization of an unknown astrovirus lineage. Phylogenetic analyzes provided evidence that this porcine astrovirus lineage is unique and appears to share no common ancestor with any known mamastrovirus.

1099,Molecular variation in the nucleoprotein gene (ORF7) of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV),"The nucleoprotein gene (ORF7) of 15 European isolates of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) was sequenced and compared with corresponding sequences of other PRRSV isolates (2 European and 13 American) and one isolate each of other arteriviruses (lactate dehydrogenase increasing). virus (LDV), monkey hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV)). Their phylogenetic relationships were established using neighbor joining and parsimony methods. Four lineages (PRRSV, LDV, SHFV and EAV) were distinguished. Two genotypes of PRRSV, European and American, could be further identified. The European PRRSV genotype was highly conserved. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in PRRSV ORF7 revealed four stable regions that are conserved, probably because of their requirement for nucleocapsid function and/or structure. No constant accumulation of mutations in ORF7 could be pinpointed when examining either synonymous or non-synonymous mutations. The passage of European PRRSV in vivo had little impact on the ORF7 sequence: only a small number of synonymous substitutions in ORF7 were detectable, confirming its low variability.

1100,Biochemical and genomic characterization of musk duck parvovirus,"duck parvovirus (DPV), isolated from musk ducks during the 1989 animal epidemic in France, was purified from inoculated allanto-amniotic fluids by CsCl density gradient centrifugation and characterized. For full and empty non-enveloped icosahedral virus particles, banding was observed at densities of 1.39-1.42 and 1.38, respectively, with a diameter of 22-23 nm. Viral proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the estimated molecular weights of the 3 major proteins were 91, 78 and 58 kDa. The nucleic acid was shown to be a single-stranded DNA of approximately 5,300 bases terminated by palindromic hairpins. These results confirm the earlier classification of the virus in the family Parvoviridae by Jestin et al. [14] based on morphological and serological principles.

1101,Molecular characterization of foot-and-mouth disease serotype A viruses circulating in Vietnam in 2009,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been one of the main causes of endemic outbreaks in Vietnam in recent years. In this work, six foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) serotype A viruses collected during endemic outbreaks in January and February 2009 in four different provinces of Vietnam were genetically characterized with regard to their complete genome sequences. Genetic analysis based on the complete viral genome sequence showed that they were closely related, sharing 99.0-99.8% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic and derived AS analyzes of the capsid-encoding gene VP1 showed that the six Vietnamese strains were all classified into genotype IX out of a total of 10 major genotypes worldwide, sharing 98.1-100% AS identity. They were most closely related to the type A strains recently isolated in Laos (A/LAO/36/2003, A/LAO/1/2006, A/LAO/6/2006, A/LAO/7/2006 and A / LAO/8/2006), Thailand (A/TAI/2/1997 and A/TAI/118/1987) and Malaysia (A/MAY/2/2002), the 88.3-95.5% nucleotide (nt ) identities. In contrast, Vietnamese type A strains showed low nt identities with the two ancient type A FMDVs isolated in Thailand in 1960 (a15thailand iso43) and in the Philippines in 1975 (aphilippines iso50), ranging from 77.3 to 80 .9% nt identity was enough. A multiple alignment based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the capsid VP1-encoding gene of type A FMDV revealed three amino acid substitutions between Vietnamese strains and the strains of other Southeast Asian countries (Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines). Valine was substituted for alanine at residue 24, arginine for asparagine at residue 85, and threonine for serine at residue 196. In addition, type A FMDV strains recently isolated in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaysia all have an amino acid deletion at residue 140 of the capsid VP1 protein compared to the two ancient type A FMDV strains from Thailand and the Philippines, as well as most other Type A representatives worldwide.

1102,Heterogeneity and genetic variations of foot-and-mouth disease viruses of serotypes O and Asia 1 isolated in Vietnam,"Six field foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs), including four strains of serotype O and two strains of serotype Asia 1, were collected from endemic outbreaks in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in four different provinces of Vietnam. The viruses were isolated and genetically characterized with regard to their complete genome sequences. Genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences revealed that the four serotype O FMDVs were related and shared 95.2% nucleotide (nt) identity and 97.5-97.6% amino acid (aa) identity . Genetic analysis and a pedigree based on the FMDV VP1 gene showed that the four present Vietnamese serotype O strains share a high degree of identity with other serotype O members of the Mya-98 lineage of the Southeast Asian (SEA) topotype exhibit. The four viruses were all clustered into the Mya 98 lineage of the SEA topotype and shared 92.3-95.6% nt and 93.4-96.7% aa identity. This finding of the Mya-98 lineage differed from previous reports that the Vietnamese serotype O strains belonged to the Cam-94 lineage of the SEA topotype and two other topotypes, Middle East South Asia (ME-SA) and Cathay. For the two serotype Asia 1 FMDVs, genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences as well as the VP1 gene revealed that they belonged to two genogroups, IV and V. Of note, the As1/VN/QT03/2007 strain of genogroup V, isolated in 2007, was very closely related to the pandemic Asia-1 strain that caused 2005 FMD outbreaks in China (Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, FJ906802) and Mongolia (Asia1/MOG/05, EF614458), and shared 99.0-99.3% nt and 99.5-100% aa identity. In contrast, the second genogroup IV strain As1/VN/LC04/2005 isolated in 2005 was closely related to all referenced Vietnamese serotype strains Asia 1 found in the GenBank databases, sharing 86.4– 100% nt and 90.9-100% aa identity with each.

HA1 subunit phylogenetic analysis of H9 subtype isolates revealed that Korean AIV isolates differed from isolates from Hong Kong poultry markets in 1997. None of the Korean AIVs had multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, conferring high pathogenicity on some H5 and H7 AIVs. Nucleoprotein and matrix gene phylogenetic analysis showed that Korean isolates cluster with AIVs of Eurasian origin. The pathogenic potential of one of the isolates (MS96) was evaluated after multiple passages in 14-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Fourteen-day-old ECE derivatives of MS96 showed increased HA titer and increased embryo mortality in eggs; this was evident after the third passage in the 14 day old ECE. Sequence analysis of the MS96 cleavage site after the third and tenth passage in 14-day-old ECE revealed no changes in the amino acid sequence. The pathogenicity of MS96 after the tenth passage in 14-day-old eggs (MS96p10(ECE14)) was tested in 4-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens. The 14-day-old derivative MS96p10(ECE14) showed a broader tissue tropism and induced more severe clinical symptoms than the parent virus. Furthermore, after intranasal inoculation of 86-week-old broiler breeders and 30-week-old laying hens, the MS96p10(ECE14) derivative induced more severe signs of depression than the parental virus and a transient decline in egg production.",,"Lee, C.

1106,Characterization of Korean avian influenza viruses H5 and H7 with low pathogenicity in chickens,"So far it has been known that all isolated highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) causing a systemic infection with a high mortality rate in poultry species belong to either the H5 or H7 subtypes. The HPAI viruses can arise due to the insertion of several basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein after the low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses were introduced into poultry. In the present study, we examined the phylogenetic characteristics of the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI) H5 (n=4) and H7 (n=3) isolated from wild birds in Korea by analyzing nucleotide sequences of all 8 gene segments of the viral genome. We also examined the infectivity, transmissibility and pathogenic potential of these viruses in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all viruses used in the study were in the Eurasian lineage and were similar to viruses isolated in Asian countries that share the East Asian-Australasian migratory bird flight path. Our H5N2 isolates failed to replicate and transfer to chickens, but the H7N8 isolates replicated and transferred to contact chickens efficiently. Additionally, since our H7N8 isolates caused watery diarrhea in chickens, these viruses may not only serve as progenitors of new strains of HPAI, but may also cause clinical disease in poultry. Although there have been no reports of LPAI mutations to HPAI in these regions, surveillance efforts in wild birds should focus on surveillance for introduction and transmission of HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5 and H7 viruses. © 2012 Poultry Science Association Inc.",,"Lee, D.

Twelve lentogenic viruses showed HA activity against horse erythrocytes, while 1 lentogenic virus and the velogenic virus were negative. Lentogenic viruses (n=13) had sequence motifs of 112ERQERL117 (n=1) or 112GRQGRL117 (n=12) at the F0 cleavage site, while velogenic virus (n=1) had a sequence motif of 112RRQKRF117 at the same site. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three different genotypes can exist in domestic ducks in Korea; one class I genotype (genotype 2) and two class II genotypes (genotypes I and VII). The class I virus was most closely related to genotype 2 strains isolated in birds from the US, Germany and Denmark. Twelve class II lentogenic viruses were grouped into genotype I and then subdivided into at least three clusters, namely Aomori-like, Ulster2C-like and V4-like.

1112,Genetic diversity of isolates of infectious avian bronchitis virus in Korea between 2003 and 2006,"Thirty-three field isolates of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were obtained from commercial chicken flocks in Korea between 2003 and 2006 and characterized phylogenetically by nucleotide sequence analysis of the hypervariable region of the IBV S1 gene. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that recent field isolates of IBV formed at least three different phylogenetic types including KI, K-II and K-III. KI type IBV consisted of 13 native IBV isolates that developed from the Kr-EJ/95 strain and then split into the type K-Ia and type K-Ib lineages. K-II type IBV isolates (n=19) were closely related to nephropathogenic IBV variants from China and Japan. The K-III type isolate (Kr/D064/05) first identified in this study was closely related to enteric IBV variants of the Chinese strains that cause proventriculitis. Sequence comparisons revealed >27.5% amino acid differences between IBV types. The molecular epidemiological properties of IBV field isolates are briefly discussed.",,"Lee, E. K.;Jeon, W. J.;Lee, Y.

1113,"The genome sequence of the Yaba-like disease virus, a yatapoxvirus","The genome sequence of Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), an unclassified member of the genus Yatapoxvirus, has been determined. Excluding the terminal hairpin loops, the YLDV genome is 144,575 bp in length and contains inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of 1883 bp. Within 20 nucleotides from the termini there is a sequence conserved in other poxviruses that is required for the resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but the ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that are either ≤180 nucleotides in length or conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed toward the termini, while ORFs within the central region of the genome are encoded on each DNA strand. In the central region, ORFs have a conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared to vaccinia virus ORFs, and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more divergent and in seven cases have no counterparts in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; Examples include two proteins similar to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins similar to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a type I interferon binding protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that YLDV is very closely related to Yaba monkey tumor virus, but outside the yatapoxvirus genus, YLDV is more closely related to swinepoxvirus and leporipoxviruses than to other chordopoxvirus genera. © 2001 Academic Press.",,"Lee, H.

1114,Generation of reassortant influenza viruses within the non-industrial poultry system,"We compared the genetic and biological properties of 35 influenza viruses with different epidemiological backgrounds in Korea, including canine influenza virus H3N2 (CIV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that chicken-adapted H9N2 viruses (A/chicken/Korea/96006/96 [CK/Kor/96006-like]) acquired aquatic avian gene segments through reassortment, and these reassorted H9N2 viruses were more frequently detected from smaller poultry species than of farm poultry. Conversely, gene segments from CK/Kor/96006-like viruses were also detected in most domestic duck viruses. Interestingly, in contrast to wild waterfowl, domesticated ducks harbored close relatives of all eight gene segments of H3N2 CIV that preferred binding to avian receptors. Therefore, bi-directional virus transmission events between landfowl and waterfowl are believed to have occurred, particularly within the non-industrial poultry system. These events contributed to the generation of a novel reassortant, H3N2 CIV. To avoid generating other reassortants capable of interspecies transmission, gene movements in the non-industrial poultry systems should be elucidated and managed. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Lee, H.

1115,Survival of prototype strains of somatic coliphage families in environmental aquatic environments and when exposed to monochromatic low-pressure UV radiation or heat,"The potential use of specific taxonomic groups of somatic coliphages as viral indicators based on their aquatic persistence and prevalence was investigated. Representative type strains of the 4 major taxonomic groups of somatic coliphages were seeded into test water and an ambient surface water source of drinking water, and the survival of the seeded phages was measured over 90 days at temperatures of 23-25 and 4°C. The viruses Microviridae (strain type PhiX174), Siphoviridae (strain type Lambda) and Myoviridae (strain type T4) were the most persistent in the water at the tested temperatures. The Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) and the Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda) were the most resistant viruses to UV radiation, and the Myoviridae (type strain T4) and the Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) were the most resistant viruses to heat. Because of their longer persistence in water and their relative resistance to heat and/or UV radiation, the Myoviridae (type strain T4), the Microviridae (type strain PhiX174), and the Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda) were the preferred somatic coliphage candidates as aquatic faecal indicator viruses, the Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) being the most resistant to these conditions overall. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Lee, H.

1116,Genome-wide analysis of influenza virus RNA and nucleoprotein association,"The genomes of the influenza A virus (IAV) consist of eight single-stranded RNA segments surrounded by viral nucleoprotein (NP) molecules. Classically, the interaction between NP and viral RNA (vRNA) is represented as a uniform pattern of “pearls on a string”. Using high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP), we identified the NP vRNA-binding profiles for two H1N1 IAV strains in virions. Contrary to the dominant model for vRNA packaging, NP in strains A/WSN/1933 and A/California/07/2009 does not bind vRNA uniformly, rather each vRNA segment has a unique binding profile that contains enriched or poor sites in the NP association. Interestingly, despite extensive sequence conservation, both H1N1 strains have similar but different NP-binding profiles. Peaks identified by HITS-CLIP were verified as true NP binding sites based on insensitivity to DNA antisense oligonucleotide-mediated RNase H digestion. Furthermore, analysis of the nucleotide content of NP peaks revealed that these sites are relatively G-rich and U-poor compared to the genome-wide nucleotide content, indicating a yet unidentified sequence bias for NP association in vivo. Taken together, our genome-wide study of NP-vRNA interaction has implications for understanding influenza vRNA architecture and genome packaging.",,"Lee, N.;Le Sage, V.;Nanni, A. V.;Snyder, D.

1118,Attenuated vaccines can recombine into virulent field viruses,"Under experimental conditions, recombination between herpesviruses was observed in vitro and in vivo. This has raised safety concerns about the use of attenuated herpesvirus vaccines in human and veterinary medicine, and adds to other known concerns associated with their use, including reversal of virulence and disease arising from recurrent reactivation of a lifelong chronic infection. We used high-throughput sequencing to study the relationships between emergent field strains and vaccine strains of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV, Gallid herpesvirus 1). We show that independent recombination events between different attenuated vaccine strains resulted in virulent recombinant viruses that became the dominant strains responsible for widespread diseases in Australian commercial poultry flocks. These results underscore the risks of using multiple different attenuated herpesvirus vaccines or vectors in the same populations.",,"Lee, S. W.;Markham, P. F.;Coppo, M. J.;Legione, A. R.;Markham, J.

1119,First complete genome sequence of infectious laryngotracheitis virus,"Background: Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes acute respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. So far, only a complete genomic sequence of ILTV has been reported. This sequence was generated by concatenating subsequences from six different ILTV strains. Therefore, the complete genomic sequence of a single (individual) ILTV strain has not been previously determined. This study aimed to use high-throughput sequencing technology to determine the complete genomic sequence of a live attenuated vaccine strain of ILTV. Results: The complete genomic sequence of the ILTV Serva vaccine strain was determined, annotated and compared to the concatenated ILTV reference sequence. The genome size of the Serva strain was 152,628 bp, with a G+C content of 48%. A total of 80 predicted open reading frames were identified. The Serva strain had 96.5% DNA sequence identity with the concatenated ILTV sequence. Notably, the concatenated ILTV sequence was found to lack four major regions of sequence, including 528 bp and 594 bp of sequence in the UL29 and UL36 genes, respectively, and two copies of a 1563 bp sequence in the repeat regions. Significant differences in the size of the predicted translation products of 4 other genes (UL54, UL30, UL37 and UL38) were also identified. More than 530 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified. Most of the SNPs were located within three genomic regions corresponding to the sequence of the SA-2 ILTV vaccine strain in the ILTV concatenated sequence. Conclusions: This is the first complete genomic sequence of a single ILTV strain. This sequence will facilitate future comparative genomic studies of ILTV by providing a convenient reference sequence for sequence analysis of other ILTV strains. © 2011 Lee et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Lee, S.

1120,Dicer-2 and Piwi-mediated RNA interference in mosquito cells infected with Rift Valley fever virus,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae) transmitted by mosquitoes. It infects humans and ruminants and causes dramatic epidemics and animal diseases in Africa, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. While recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the nonstructural protein NSs as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about mosquito vector infection. Here we examined RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines, Aag2 cells from Aedes aegypti and U4.4 and C6/36 cells from Aedes albopictus. In contrast to mammalian cells, where NSs form nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NSs expression such that NSs filaments were never formed in nuclei of U4.4 cells, and in the case of Aag2 cells, to one disappeared early after infection. In contrast, in C6/36 cells, NSs core filaments were visible throughout the course of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing showed that production of viRNAs in C6/36 cells known to be Dicer-2 deficient was very low, but expressed some viRNAs bearing a Piwi signature . In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced high levels of viRNAs that predominantly matched the S segment and displayed Dicer-2 and Piwi signatures. While 21 nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were predominant during early infection, the population of 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNAs (piRNAs) progressively increased and later became prevalent during acute infection and during persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined effects of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways elicited an efficient antiviral response, allowing, among other things, the suppression of NS filament formation and the establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to elicit an antiviral response against secondary infection with a superinfecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.",,"Leger, P.;Lara, E.;Jagla, B.;Sismeiro, O.;Mansuroglu, Z.;Coppee, J.

1121,Exploring the contribution of bacteriophages to antibiotic resistance,"Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on our planet. They infect susceptible bacterial hosts, where they either multiply or persist. In the latter case, phages can transfer new functions to their hosts through gene transfer, thus contributing to their adaptation (short-term) and evolution (long-term). In this regard, the role of phages in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial hosts in natural environments is not well understood. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of 33 viromas from different habitats to investigate whether phage harbor ARGs. Our results indicate that while human-associated viromes do not or rarely carry ARGs, viromes from non-human sources (e.g., pig feces, raw sewage, and freshwater and marine environments) contain a large reservoir of ARGs, indicating that phage might play a part on the spread of antibiotic resistance. With this in mind, the role of phages should not be underestimated and should be considered when developing strategies to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis.",,"Lekunberri, I.;Subirats, J.;Borrego, C.

1123,Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression of recombinant vectors show that the binding protein G of bovine respiratory syncytial virus differs from that of human respiratory syncytial virus,"Bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus causes severe lower respiratory tract disease in calves, similar to the disease caused by human respiratory syncytial (HRS) virus in children. While there is antigenic cross-reactivity between the other important viral structural proteins, the major glycoprotein G of the BRS virus and that of the HRS virus are antigenically different. The G glycoprotein has been implicated as a binding protein for the HRS virus. We have performed a molecular comparison of the BRS virus glycoprotein G with its HRS virus counterparts. cDNA clones corresponding to BRS virus G glycoprotein mRNA were isolated and analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. BRS virus G-mRNA contained 838 nucleotides excluding poly(A) and had a large open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BRS virus G polypeptide revealed only 29-30% amino acid with the G protein of either HRS virus subgroup A or B. Despite this low level of identity, however, there were strong similarities in the predicted hydropathy profiles of the G BRS virus and HRS virus proteins. A cDNA molecule containing the complete G open reading frame of BRS virus G was inserted into the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene by homologous recombination, and a recombinant virus containing the BRS virus G protein gene was isolated. This recombinant virus expressed the BRS virus G protein as shown by Western immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence of infected cells. The BRS virus G protein expressed from the recombinant vector was transported to infected cells and expressed on their surface. Antisera against BRS virus G protein prepared using the recombinant vector to immunize animals recognized BRS virus attachment protein but not HRS virus G protein and vice versa, indicating the lack of an antigenic Cross-reactivity confirmed between the BRS and HRS virus attachment proteins. Based on the data presented here, we conclude that BRS virus should be classified within the genus Pneumovirus in a separate group from HRS virus and that it is no more closely related to HRS virus subgroup A than to subgroup B of the HRS virus.",,"Lerch, R.

1124,Real-time PCR for simultaneous detection and genotyping of bovine viral diarrheal virus,"Since two bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) genotypes occur in Belgian herds, their distinction is important for disease surveillance. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed to detect and classify genotypes I and II bovine viral diarrhea viruses. A pair of primers specific for highly conserved regions of the 5-UTR and two TaqMan probes were designed. The FAM and VIC-tagged probe sequences differed by three nucleotides, allowing differentiation between genotype I and II. Assay detectability of genotype I and II real-time PCR assays was 1000 and 100 copies, respectively. Very reproducible data was obtained, since the coefficients of variation of the threshold cycle values in the runs were less than 2.2%. The correct classification of genotype I and II viruses was assessed using reference strains and characterized field isolates of both genotypes. The applicability in clinical diagnostics was evaluated on pooled blood samples by measuring the FAM- and VIC-associated fluorescence after the run. 100% agreement with conventional RT-PCR method confirmed that this new technique could be used for routine detection of persistently infected immunotolerant animals. © 2003 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Letellier, C.;Kerkhofs, P.",2003.0,,10.1016/j.jviromet.2003.08.004,0

For this purpose, primer pairs in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) were chosen. Primers B(E) and B2 were in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus specific. Two primer pairs called B3B4 and B5B6 were specific for BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. Using this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with either the B3B4 or the B5B6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV isolates tested, but not for BDV or CSFV.

1126,Surveillance of Avian Influenza Virus in Wild Birds in Georgia: 2009-2011,"The Caucasus, on the border between Europe and Asia, is important for the migration and wintering of wild waterfowl. Three air routes, the Central Asian, the East African-West Asian and the Mediterranean/Black Sea air route converge in the Caucasus region. Therefore, the Caucasus region could serve as a migratory bridge for influenza virus transmission when birds accumulate in high concentrations during the post-breeding, migratory, and wintering seasons. Since August 2009, we have established a wild bird influenza virus surveillance network using five sampling areas geographically spread across suitable habitats in east and west Georgia. We took pairs of tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh fecal samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 avian orders, of which 84 were positive for avian influenza virus (AIV) by real-time RT-PCR. No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were detected. The overall AIV prevalence was 1.6%. We observed a peak prevalence in large gulls during autumn migration (5.3-9.8%), but a peak prevalence in black-headed gulls in spring (4.2-13%). In ducks, we observed an increased AIV prevalence during the autumn post-moult aggregation and migratory arrest period (6.3%), but at lower levels than in other more northerly post-moult areas in Eurasia. We observed another peak in prevalence during the wintering period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological surveillance of a breeding colony of Armenian gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive upon arrival at the breeding colony, but juveniles remained serologically and virologically negative for AIV throughout their time on the breeding grounds, in contrast to AIV data from gulls from elsewhere geographical areas regions. We show that close phylogenetic relatives of viruses isolated in Georgia originate from a wide geographic range across western and central Eurasia and from areas represented by several different flight routes likely connecting different host subpopulations. © 2013 Lewis et al.",,"Lewis, N.

1127,The evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus: effects of recombination and selection,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus is an economically important animal virus that exhibits extensive genetic and antigenic heterogeneity. To examine the evolutionary forces that have influenced the population dynamics of foot-and-mouth disease virus, single genes and the encoding genomes for the Eurasian (Asia1, A, C, and O) serotypes were analyzed for phylogenetic relatedness, recombination, and genetic diversity, and Selection. Our analyzes show that paraphyletic relationships between serotypes are not as prevalent as previously thought and suggest that convergent evolution may be obscuring the phylogenetic relationships. We provide evidence that the identification of recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoint patterns between and within serotypes is highly dependent on the level of genetic diversity and convergent traits present in a given dataset, as well as the methods used to detect recombination. Here we also examine the effects of adaptive positive selection on the capsid proteins and nonstructural genes 2B, 2C, 3A, and 3Cpro to identify genomic regions involved in genetic diversity and antigenic variation. Two different categories of positive selection at the amino acid level were examined; conservative (stabilizing) selection, which retains certain phenotypic properties of an amino acid residue and radical (destabilizing), and selection, which dramatically alters the phenotype and possibly the functional and/or structural features of the protein. Approximately 29% of the residues in the capsid proteins were under positive selection. Of these, 64% were under the influence of destabilizing selection, 80% under the influence of stabilizing selection, and 44% had phenotypic traits influenced by both types of selection. The majority of residues selected (74%) were outside of known antigenic sites; suggesting additional uncharacterized epitopes and genomic regions involved in antigenic drift. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Lewis-Rogers, N.;McClellan, D.

1128,Close relationship between the 2009 H1N1 virus and South Dakota AIV strains,"Although previous publications suggest that the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) was rearranged from swine viruses of North America and Eurasia, the immediate ancestry always remains due to the large evolutionary distance between the 2009 H1N1 virus and the previously isolated strains still elusive. Since the H1N1 flu was unveiled in 2009, influenza has attracted a great deal of interest and as a result a large number of influenza virus sequences have been deposited in the public sequence databases. Blast analysis showed that the recently submitted South Dakota 2007 avian influenza virus strains and other North American avian influenza strains contained genetic segments very closely related to the 2009 H1N1 virus, suggesting that these avian influenza viruses are very closely related to the H1N1 virus are from 2009. Phylogenetic analyzes also indicate that the 2009 H1N1 viruses are associated with the avian and swine influenza viruses circulating in North America. Since the migratory wild birds are preferable to pigs as carriers to spread the influenza viruses over long distances, it is highly likely that birds played an important role in the intercontinental evolution of the 2009 H1N1 virus. It is important to understand the evolutionary path of the emerging influenza virus to find a way to prevent further emerging cases.

Its high abundance can pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes leading to the formation and spread of PCV3 are still poorly understood. Herein, the probable origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 are determined based on available genomic sequences. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found in clade 1 bat histories. Using various phylogenetic methods, two main genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. The effective population size of PCV3 was found to have increased rapidly between late 2013 and early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. Compared to other single-stranded DNA viruses, a relatively high value for the effective reproduction number (Re) and a higher evolutionary rate were found, and positive selection at codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) was identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a possible change in an antigenic epitope at position 320, may have allowed PCV3 to evade the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective prevention and control measures.",,"Li, G.;He, W.;Zhu, H.;Bi, Y.;Wang, R.;Xing, G.;Zhang, C.;Zhou, J.;Yuen, K.

The identified genes have been designated as UL1, UL2, UL3, UL4, UL5, UL6, and UL7 homologues of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Located between UL3 and UL4, DEV UL3.5 had no homologue in HSV-1. The arrangement and transcriptional orientation of the eight genes was collinear with their homologues in HSV-1. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the deduced amino acid alignments of eight proteins with their homologues in 12 alpha-herpesviruses. In the UL1, UL3, UL3.5, UL5 and UL7 protein trees, the branches were more closely related to the genus Mardivirus. However, the phylogenetic trees of the UL2, UL4, and UL6 proteins showed a large distance from Mardivirus, suggesting that the DEV evolved differently from other viruses in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and formed a single branch within that subfamily.

1132,"Characterization of the genes encoding UL24, TK and gH proteins from duck enteritis virus (DEV): Evidence for the classification of DEV","Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is assigned to the Herpesviridae family, but has not yet been assigned to any genus. Four overlapping fragments were amplified from the DEV genome using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The combined length of the four fragments was 6202 bp, containing the genes encoding unique long (UL) 24, thymidine kinase (TK), and glycoprotein H (gH) proteins. UL24 overlapped TK by 64 nucleotides (nt) in a head-to-head transcriptional orientation, and TK and gH had the same transcriptional orientation. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these 3 derived DEV proteins with other 12 alphaherpesviruses revealed 5 highly conserved sites in UL24 as well as another 5 consensus regions in TK and 4 consensus regions in gH. The RNA polymerase II transcription control elements were identified in all DEV UL24, TK and gH. These elements included core promoters, TATA motifs and polyadenylation sites. The phylogenetic analysis for the genetic classification of DEV in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily with other 12 alphaherpesviruses was calculated. The result showed that DEV was more closely related to avian herpesviruses than to other alphaherpesviruses, with the exception of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). After the phylogeny-based analysis and the homology comparison of the functional domains of UL24, TK and gH, DEV should finally be assigned to a separate genus of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae in the family Herpesviridae. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Li, H.;Liu, S.;Kong, X.",2006.0,,10.1007/s11262-005-0060-6,0
1133,"Avian influenza virus, subtype H9N2, affects gut microbiota, barrier structure injury and inflammatory bowel disease in the ileum of chickens","The H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (H9N2 AIV) has caused significant losses to the poultry industry due to the high mortality associated with secondary infections attributable to E. coli. This study attempts to investigate the underlying secondary mechanisms after H9N2-AIV infection. Initially, nine-day-old specific pathogen-free chickens were assigned to control (uninfected) and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Using Illumina sequencing, histological examination, and real-time quantitative PCR, H9N2 AIV was found to cause gut microbiota disruption, injury, and inflammatory damage to the gut mucosa. Notably, five days post-infection (dpi), Escherichia genera, particularly E. coli, were significantly increased (p<0.01), while Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and other probiotic organisms were significantly reduced (p<0.01). At the same time, mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin 3 and occludin), TFF2 and Muc2 was significantly reduced (p<0.01), indicating disruption of tight junctions of intestinal epithelial cells and damage to the mucin layer Construction. In addition, mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-22, IFN-alpha and IL-17A was significantly upregulated in gut epithelial cells, resulting in an inflammatory response and gut injury.

In order to confirm the causative agent and examine the epidemiology of the disease, a total of 38 flocks of chickens, including 187 samples, from Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Shandong and Hunan provinces in China were collected and determined by PCR -Detection, sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and virus isolation. 81 samples (positive rate of samples, 81/187, 43.3%) spread over 33 chicken flocks (positive rate of chicken flocks, 33/38, 86.8%) were detected as positive for avian adenovirus (FAdV) by the PCR method by of which 30 were identified as FAdV species C, 41 as species D, 9 as species E, and 1 as virus species by phylogenetic analysis, implying that at least three species (C, D, and E) of FAdVs were prevalent in China and the Types C and D were predominantly the predominant virus strains. Interestingly, our results showed that two types of FAdV (C and D) coexisted in a herd, leading to complex conditions for disease prevalence. In addition, 13 viral strains of FAdV-C were isolated from different geographic areas and one of the isolates from Henan province, designated HN/151025 strain, was inoculated into 40-day-old specific pathogen-free chickens via intramuscular or oral route to evaluate the pathogenicity. It was found that 90% (9/10) chickens in the intramuscular injection group died and 30% (3/10) birds in the oral infection group died after challenge. Histopathological examination showed that pathology was limited to liver, kidney, spleen and heart. These results indicated that the virus was a highly virulent strain.",,"Li, H.;Wang, J.;Qiu, L.;Han, Z.;Liu, S.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2016.09.006,0

Cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be important modulators of intricate viral-host interactions. To elucidate the role of miRNAs in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells during CPIV3 infection. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNA libraries in CPIV3-infected and mock-infected MDBK cells. The results showed that a total of 249 known and 152 novel candidate miRNAs were differentially expressed in MDBK cells after CPIV3 infection, and 22,981 and 22,572 target genes were predicted, respectively. In addition, an RT-qPCR assay was used to further confirm the expression patterns of 13 of these differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets. Functional annotation analysis showed that these up- and down-regulated target genes are mainly involved in MAPK pathway, Jak-STAT pathway, Toll-like receptor pathway, p53 pathway, focal adhesion, NF-kappa B pathway, and apoptosis, etc. involved Al.

To date, over 60 million LLR doses have been distributed to children. However, very little is known about the fecal excretion of LLR in children. Therefore, in September-November 2011/2012, faecal samples (n = 1,184) were collected from 114 children for 15 days after vaccination. Fecal output and viral load were determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit (EIA) and real-time RT-PCR. The complete genome was sequenced and the vaccine strain isolated by culture in MA104 cells. Approximately 14.0% (16/114) of the children had rotavirus-positive samples from EIA for at least 1 day after vaccination. Viral loads in EIA positive specimens ranged from < 1.0 x 103 to 1.9 x 108 copies/g. Fecal excretion occurred as early as day 2 post-vaccination and as late as day 13 post-vaccination, peaking at days 5-10. peak day after vaccination. An LLR strain was isolated by culture in MA104 cells. Sequence analysis showed 99% identity with the LLR prototype strain.

The partial open reading frame 2 (ORF2) genomes (nt6461-6860, nt5994-6294) of 45 HEV strains detected in 14 cities in China were amplified and sequenced using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Results. Forty-one of 45 strains (91%) share the same genotype with HEV Burma strain (B), with greater than 98% nucleotide identities with the representative Chinese HEV strain. Only 4 HEV strains differ significantly from the 3 prototype HEV strains, with nucleotide identities of 77%-80% with the Burmese/Chinese HEV strain, 74%-76% with the Mexican strain, and 74%-77% with the neu discovered HEV US/pig strain. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these 4 strains may represent 2 distinct subtypes belonging to a new genotype of HEV that differs significantly from the prototype strains from Mexico, Burma and US/pigs.

1140,Identification and genome analysis of two duck-derived Tembusu virus strains in southern China,"Since the winter of 2010, flocks of egg-laying ducks in southern China's Guangdong province have been suffering from a widespread infectious disease with abrupt egg laying and death. However, the causative agent was not known. We obtained two independent virus isolates named FS and JM from the diseased layer flocks and identified them as duck-originated Tembusu virus by PCR detection, sequencing the full-length open reading frames (ORFs). Both isolates, FS and JM, shared high sequence similarity with isolates of duck-derived Tembusu virus, which first emerged in April 2010 in eastern China. Blast analysis shows that the entire ORF sequences of FS and JM have the highest similarity ([99%) to BYD-1 (the first reported duck tembusuvirus) and JS804 (the first reported geese tembusuvirus ), indicating that full-length genomes were highly conserved in aquatic Tembusuviruses. The present study suggests that duck-originated Tembusuviruses spread rapidly from eastern China to southern China and caused widespread infections. The high conservation of duck-derived Tembusu virus strains provides the genomic basis for selecting strains for vaccine production to better protect against this new viral infection. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",,"Li, L.;An, H.;Sun, M.;Dong, J.;Yuan, J.;Hu, Q.",2012.0,,10.1007/s11262-012-0753-6,0

In a retrospective analysis of 32 cases of bovine encephalitis of unknown etiology, 3 additional infected animals were identified using PCR and in situ hybridization for viral RNA. Viral RNA has been restricted to the nervous system and has been detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions consisted of extensive neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing, distributed preferentially in the gray matter and most severely in the cerebellum and brainstem, with increasing intensity caudally along the spinal cord.

1143,Several different circoviruses infect livestock and are commonly found in human and chimpanzee feces,"Circoviruses are known to infect birds and pigs and can cause a wide range of severe symptoms with significant economic implications. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States, and from wild chimpanzees. Strong genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the family Circoviridae, which we tentatively named ""cyclovirus"", with genetic diversity comparable to that of all known species in the genus Circovirus. Circoviridae detection in the stool of adult US Americans was limited to porcine circoviruses, which were also found in most US pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in human stools outside the US are dietary, we compared them genetically to the cycloviruses found in muscle tissue samples from commonly consumed livestock in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local meat samples from cows, goats, sheep, camels and chickens suggested that the majority of the 25 cyclovirus species identified could be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA virus genomes in different mammals, including humans, is significantly greater than previously thought, and that frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human faeces provides numerous opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses, found in 7% to 17% of human stool outside the US and 3% to 55% of tested meat samples outside the US, in human and animal disease is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains along with 29 published strains in the Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except one isolated and one published were grouped into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a large phylogenetic branch with no new dominant strains, while all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V, which is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. Examination of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein revealed 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs are unique to isolated strains and 7 motifs are unique to published strains, leading to the notion of further supports no new dominant tribes. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences showed that the amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions are polymorphic and diverse and show no evidence of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Overall, no dominant new strain circulated in southern China between 2004 and 2008. Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have continuously evolved with genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been consistent but rare outbreaks in commercial herds in southern China between 2004 and 2008. To guard against the sudden emergence of new predominant strains, continuous monitoring of IBV strains circulating in the field is of utmost importance. © 2009 Elsevier BV",,"Li, L.;Xue, C.;Chen, F.;Qin, J.;Xie, Q.;Bi, Y.;Cao, Y.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.022,0

Two types have previously been reported in dogs, Minute Virus of Canines (MVC), which are associated with neonatal disease and fertility problems; and canine bocavirus (CBoV), which is associated with respiratory disease. Results: In this study, we identified and characterized a novel bocavirus, which we termed canine bocavirus 3 (CnBoV3), using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and anuric renal failure. The three major ORFs of CnBoV3 (NS1, NP1 and VP1) shared less than 60% AS identity with those of other bocaviruses, qualifying them as a new species based on the ICTV criteria. Inverse PCR demonstrated the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in the liver.

At least 155 H5N6 outbreaks have been reported in China, including 15 human infections. These repeated outbreaks have increased concerns that the H5N6 virus could spread to humans and cause a pandemic. In February 2016, peacocks at a breeding farm were infected with a highly contagious disease. Post-mortem studies, including RT-PCR and virus isolation, confirmed that the highly pathogenic H5N6 influenza virus was the causative agent and the strain was named A/Pavo Cristatus/Jiangxi/JA1/2016. In animal studies, it showed high pathogenicity in chickens and an estimated mean lethal dose in mice of ~104.3 TCID50. A phylogenetic analysis showed that JA1/2016 was clustered in the H5 clade 2.3.4.4. The FG594-like H5N6 virus from Guangdong Province was the likely predecessor of JA1/2016, and the estimated time of departure was June 2014. Furthermore, we found that H5N6 influenza viruses can be divided into the following two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 2 influenza viruses have not been detected since late 2014, while group 1 influenza viruses have continuously evolved and rearranged with the ""gene pool"" circulating in southern China, leading to the emergence of new subtypes of this influenza virus.

Testing of intracellular enzymes of interest (e.g. when Escherichia coli is used) often requires chemical or enzymatic cell lysis, which can be lengthy and expensive. In this study, a series of UV-inducible autolytic vectors were constructed to provide a simpler means of cell lysis free of additional fluid handling. The SRRz lysis gene cassette from bacteriophage lambda was cloned downstream of a UV-inducible promoter, the recA promoter or the umuDC promoter, and further inserted into the backbone of pUC18 and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. SRRz expression and cell lysis was induced by UV irradiation. For both the RecA and UmuDC promoters, the lysis efficiency was found to be consistent at 30°C and exceed 60% as measured with β-galactosidase as a reporter. However, at 37°C, lysis profiles were found to be erratic. UV lysis in 96-well plates also produced consistent lysis results comparable to those obtained by lysozyme treatment, demonstrating the utility of these autolytic vectors in high-throughput screening. This set of artificial SRRz autolytic units should be transferrable to other vectors.

However, traditional methods for studying genomic terms are challenging due to the time-consuming protocols and their inefficiency, where critical details are easily lost. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it a powerful tool for studying genomic terms. In this study, we used NGS to sequence an iridovirus genome and twenty phage genomes and confirmed for the first time that the high frequency sequences (HFSs) found in the NGS reads are in fact the terminal sequences of viral genomes. In addition, we established a criterion to distinguish the type of term and the mode of viral packaging. We also got additional terminal details like terminal repeats, multi-termini, asymmetric termini. Using this approach, we were able to simultaneously detect details of genome ends and obtain the full sequence of bacteriophage genomes. In theory, this application can be extended to analyze larger and more complicated genomes of plant and animal viruses.

Result: To determine the effects of PPV infection on the cellular miRNAome, we used high-throughput sequencing to sequence two miRNA libraries derived from porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells under normal conditions and during PPV -Infection were produced. There was differential miRNA expression between the uninfected and infected cells: 65 miRNAs were upregulated and 128 miRNAs were downregulated. We have demonstrated expression of miR-10b, miR-20a, miR-19b, miR-181a, miR-146b, miR-18a and other previously identified immune-related miRNAs. Gene ontology analyzes and KEGG functional annotations of the host's target genes indicated that the miRNAs are involved in complex cellular signaling pathways, including cellular metabolic processes, immune system processes and gene expression. Conclusions: These data suggest that a large group of miRNAs are expressed in PK-15 cells and that some miRNAs were altered in PPV-infected PK-15 cells. A number of microRNAs play important roles in regulating immune-related gene expression. Our findings should aid in the development of new control strategies to prevent or treat PPV infections in pigs.",,"Li, X.;Zhu, L.;Liu, X.;Sun, X.;Zhou, Y.;Lang, Q.;Li, P.;Cai, Y.;Qiao, X.;Xu, Z.",2015.0,,10.1186/s12985-015-0359-4,0
1157,Genetic analysis of two pig reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses isolated in China with different virulence,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains S1 and SY0608 were individually isolated in 1997 and 2006 and had variable pathogenicity in pigs. To understand their genomic properties, the full-length genomes of the S1 and SY0608 isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that their genome composition differed significantly, sharing only 88.5% nucleotide identity. The genetic variation and amino acid substitutions were not randomly distributed in the genome and were mainly concentrated in ORF1a, ORF3 and ORF5. The SY0608 strain with high pathogenicity had a 30 amino acid deletion at amino acid positions 480 and 532-560 compared to the S1 strain. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of Nsp1-Nsp8, GP2-GP5, M and N of S1 and SY0608 with other PRRSV isolates showed that variations were mainly found in the Nsp2, GP3 and GP5 proteins. Compared to the S1 strain, the SY0608 strain showed some potential glycosylation site mutations in GP5 at amino acid positions between 26 and 39, possibly associated with viral antigenicity. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the two strains belonged to two different branches, indicating no differences in pathogenicity. Interestingly, the deletion strains recently isolated in China formed a new side branch that revealed the same evolutionary trend. © 2008 Springer Verlag.",,"Li, Y.;Wang, X.;Jiang, P.;Chen, W.;Wang, X.",2008.0,,10.1007/s00705-008-0207-6,0
1158,From Discovery to Distribution: The Evolution and Phylogeny of Getah Virus,"Getah virus (GETV) was first isolated in Malaysia in 1955. Since then, epidemics in horses and pigs caused by GETV have resulted in enormous economic losses. At present, GETV has spread throughout Eurasia and Southeast Asia, including mainland China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia, and Russia. The data show that the GETV Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) existed about 145 years ago (95% HPD: 75–244) and gradually evolved into four distinct evolutionary populations: Groups I–IV. The MRCA of GETVs in Group III, which includes all GETVs isolated from mosquitoes, pigs, horses and other animals since the 1960s (from 19°N to 60°N latitude), existed about 51 years ago (95% HPD : 51″). ""72). Group III is responsible for most viral epidemics in domestic animals. Analysis of the sequence and structure of the GETV E2 protein revealed seven common amino acid mutation sites. These sites are responsible for the structural and electrostatic differences found between widespread group III isolates and the prototype strain MM2021. These differences may account for the recent geographic spread of the virus. Given the economic importance of GETV infection in pigs and horses, we recommend conducting rigorous viral screening and surveillance programs.",,"Li, Y. Y.;Liu, H.;Fu, S. H.;Li, X. L.;Guo, X.

1159,MicroRNA-23b promotes replication of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) by targeting IRF1,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause various leukemia-like proliferative diseases in the hematopoietic system of chickens. Here we examined the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of ALV-J infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify the genes and miRNAs associated with ALV-J invasion. A total of 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J infected spleens compared to uninfected control spleens. miR-23b expression was upregulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control spleens, and transcriptome analysis revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression was upregulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to uninfected spleens spleens were downregulated. A dual luciferase reporter assay showed that IRF1 was a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression significantly (P=0.0022) decreased IRF1 mRNA levels and suppressed IRF1 3'-UTR reporter activity. In vitro experiments showed that miR-23b overexpression enhanced ALV-J replication, while miR-23b loss of function inhibited ALV-J replication. IRF1 overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication and IRF1 knockdown enhanced ALV-J replication. Furthermore, IRF1 overexpression significantly increased (P = 0.0014) IFN-β expression. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-23b may play an important role in ALV-J replication by targeting IRF1.",,"Li, Z.;Chen, B.;Feng, M.;Ouyang, H.;Zheng, M.;Ye, Q.;Nie, Q.;Zhang, X.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep10294,0
1160,Evidence that porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus induced nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets,"In China, there was an acute outbreak of porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) infection in piglets, which was characterized by neurological symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea and wasting. Coronavirus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in the homogenized tissue suspensions of the brains of dead piglets, and a wild strain of PHEV was isolated, characterized and designated PHEV-CC14. Histopathological examination of the dead piglets showed features of nonsuppurative encephalitis, and some neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic, and neuronophagia. Similarly, mice vaccinated with PHEV-CC14 were found to exhibit central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction with symptoms of depression, bulging waists, erect and vellicating front claws. Furthermore, PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in cortices of dead piglets and infected mice supported viral infections of the nervous system. Then the major structural genes of PHEV-CC14 were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically, and the strain shared 95%-99.2% nt identity with the other PHEV strains available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis has clearly established that the wild strain is clustered in a subclade with an HEV JT06 strain. These findings suggested that the virus had a strong tropism for the CNS and thus caused nonsuppurative encephalitis as a cause of death in piglets. At the same time, the predicted risk of widespread transmission showed some variation among the PHEV strains currently circulating worldwide. Most importantly, the information presented in this study can not only provide a good reference for the experimental diagnosis of PHEV infection for pig breeding, but also promote the development of new effective vaccines.",,"Li, Z.;He, W.;Lan, Y.;Zhao, K.;Lv, X.;Lu, H.;Ding, N.;Zhang, J.;Shi, J.;Shan, C.;Gao, F.",2016.0,,,0

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze microRNA expression in Fabricius spleen, thymus, and bursa of H5N1-HPAIV-infected and uninfected chickens and ducks. We annotated the genomic positions of duck microRNAs and compared the microRNA repertoires of chickens and ducks. Our results showed that the microRNA expression patterns in the homologous immune organs of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and ducks differ significantly. In addition, there was a greater divergence between microRNA expression patterns in immune organs from HPAIV-infected chickens than in HPAIV-infected ducks. Together, our results could help elucidate the role of microRNAs in the differential immunity of chickens and ducks against H5N1 HPAIV.",,"Li, Z.;Zhang, J.;Su, J.;Liu, Y.;Guo, J.;Zhang, Y.;Lu, C.;Xing, S.;Guan, Y.;Li, Y.;Sun, B.;Zhao, Z.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.febslet.2014.12.019,0

Marek's disease virus (MDV)-induced T-cell lymphoma is also an excellent biomedical model for neoplasia research. Recently, miRNAs have been shown to play a crucial role in mediating neoplastic transformation. To examine host miRNA expression profiles in the tumor transformation phase of MDV infection, we performed deep sequencing in two MDV-infected samples (tumorous spleen and MD lymphoma from the liver) and two uninfected controls (uninfected spleen and lymphocytes). through. A total of 187 and 16 known miRNAs were identified in chicken and MDV, respectively, and 17 new chicken miRNAs were further confirmed by qPCR. We identified 28 down-regulated miRNAs and 11 up-regulated miRNAs in MDV-infected samples by bioinformatic analysis. Of nine others tested by qPCR, seven were verified. gga-miR-181a, gga-miR-26a, gga-miR-221, gga-miR-222, gga-miR-199* and gga-miR-140* were downregulated and gga-miR-146c was found in MDV- infected tumorous spleens and MD lymphomas upregulated. In addition, 189 putative target genes were predicted for seven differentially expressed miRNAs. Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated gga-miR-181a interactions with MYBL1, gga-miR-181a with IGF2BP3, and gga-miR-26a with EIF3A.

We have previously reported that the northern hog macaques were also susceptible to HIV-1. To make this animal a potential HIV/AIDS model and to discover the mechanism of viral control, we here attempted to examine the role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted immune responses on HIV-1 infection-related viral replication and disease progression. As a first step, we first cloned and characterized the classical MHC class I gene of northern hog-tailed macaques. In this study, we identified 39 MHC class I alleles, including 17 MHC A and 22 MHC B alleles. Of these identified alleles, 30 were new and 9 were identical to alleles previously reported from other macaque species. The MHC-A and MHC-B loci were both duplicates as rhesus monkeys and southern hog monkeys. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the patterns of positive selection in northern hog-tailed macaques and demonstrated the existence of equilibrium selection with 20 positive selection sites in the peptide-binding region. Analysis of B and F peptide-binding pockets in northern and southern pig-tailed macaques and rhesus macaques suggested that they would likely share some common peptides for presentation. Thus, this study provides important information on MHC immunogenetics and adds value to the northern hog-tailed macaque as a promising HIV/AIDS model.",,"Lian, X. D.;Zhang, X. H.;Dai, Z. X.;Zheng, Y.

1165,Arboviruses and Their Related Infections in China: A Comprehensive Field and Laboratory Review Over the Last 3 Decades,"Extensive field and laboratory investigation has been carried out across China since the 1980s, and a total of 29 virus species belonging to 7 families and 13 genera have been identified by virological, morphological and immunological methods, as well as whole genome sequencing and molecular genetic analysis. Most virus isolates belong to 9 genera in the families Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Togaviridae and Reoviridae. Among them, 4 genera (Orthobunyavirus, Bunyavirus, Phlebovirus, and Nairovirus) belong to the Bunyaviridae family, and 3 genera (Seadonavirus, Orbivirus, and Cypovirus) belong to the Reoviridae family. Analysis of the relationship between viruses and human/animal diseases showed that Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenic syndrome virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, West Nile virus and Tahyna virus can cause human and animal infections and disease epidemics in China. This review systematically presents the current status of arbovirus and vector diversity and geographic distribution in China.

All strains were determined to be velogenic by plaque formation, mean time to death (MDT) of embryonated oocytes, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). The acidic guanidinium thiocyanate method was used to prepare viral RNA. A 908 bp nucleotide fragment was amplified by RT-PCR starting at the N-terminus of the F gene and the PCR segments were cloned into the PGEM-T vector and sequenced. The similarities of the nucleotide sequences (1-519 bp) and the predicted amino acid sequences of the F gene (1-125) were analyzed by comparing the 12 NDV isolates with the NDV vaccine strains Lasota, B1, H1 and V4 with classical NDV strains were and newer strains of animal diseases. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains were of two new genotypes; the NDV strains that caused the 1998-1999 outbreak of ND in western China were of genotype VIIa, while the strains from Qinghai Province (1979-1985) were of genotype VIII, found predominantly in southern Africa. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Liang, R.;Cao, D.

The nucleotide sequences were compared to other previously characterized BLV variants from different geographical areas (Belgium, France, Italy, North America, Australia, Japan and Argentina). The majority of the segments analyzed showed a tendency towards nucleotide substitution without changing the amino acid. The constructed phylogenetic tree showed the relationships and differences between and within proviruses. Most of the samples in Argentina formed a cluster. The samples from Japan were also clustered except for one and some of them showed high homology with the isolates from Australia and the USA.

A portion of the amplified F protein DNA product (nucleotide sequence 47-418) and the deduced amino acid sequences were phylogenetically compared to those of strains previously reported in Taiwan and other geographic regions. Our results showed that all Taiwanese isolates (n=20) collected between 2003 and 2006 belong to genotype VIId according to the pedigree. In addition, all six Taiwanese isolates obtained in 2003 carry the 112R-RQK-R116 motif and have the amino acid L23 replaced with F23 (assigned as Group 1). On the other hand, 12 of the 14 Taiwanese isolates obtained between 2004 and 2006 possess the 112R-RKK-R116 motif and the amino acid G74 instead of E74 (assigned as group 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported VIId isolate possessing the sequences of G74/112R-RKK-R116 within the F0 protein. Since high mortality, severe clinical symptoms, typical postmortem lesions and high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) were observed in the NDV-infected chickens, these isolates acquired between 2003 and 2006 are considered to be velogenous type. Group 2 viruses have become prevalent in recent years and are responsible for most outbreaks in Taiwan. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it can be postulated that these isolates arose from previously reported local strains and that the group 2 family emerged last in genotype VIId.

The present study examined the genetic and protectotypic traits of newly emerged Korean IBV strains. A phylogenetic analysis showed that several recent isolates formed two distinct clusters (new clusters 1 and 2) distinct from other pre-existing clusters. The new cluster 1 IBV strains represented recombinants between the Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and the QXIBV strain. New cluster 2 IBV strains showed low amino acid homology (<58.7%) compared to previous isolates. We evaluated the protective effect of commercial IBV vaccines (H120 and K2 strain) against these new isolates. In cross-protection studies, the H120 strain did not provide adequate protection against these variants. However, the highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine, K2 strain, provided significantly higher levels of protection against variants compared to H120 vaccinated chickens (P<0.05 or better).

Zoonotic transmission may contribute to the high HEV seroprevalence in the human population of many countries. A novel divergent HEV from moose (Alces alces) in Sweden was recently identified by partial genome sequencing. Because only one strain was found, its classification within the HEV family, prevalence in moose, and zoonotic potential were unclear. We therefore analyzed samples from 231 moose in seven Swedish provinces for HEV and sequenced a nearly complete moose HEV genome. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to classify this virus within the family Hepeviridae and to examine possible host-specific determinants. METHODS AND RESULTS: HEV prevalence in elk was determined by PCR (marker of active infection) and serological assays (marker of past infection) of sera and 51 faecal samples from 231 Swedish elk. Markers of active and past infection were found in 67 (29%) animals, while 34 (15%) were positive for HEV RNA, 43 (19%) were seropositive for anti-HEV antibodies, and 10 (4%) had both markers . The number of young HEV RNA positive individuals was greater than that of the elderly, and the number of anti-HEV antibody positive individuals increased with age. The high-throughput sequenced elk HEV genome was 35-60% identical to existing HEVs. Partial ORF1 sequences from 13 elk strains showed high similarity between them, forming a distinct monophyletic clade with a common ancestor of the HEV genotype 1-6 clade, which includes members known for zoonotic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high frequency of HEV in moose in Sweden, with markers for current and past infection detected in 30% of the animals. Moose are thus an important animal reservoir of HEV. The phylogenetic relationship indicated that the elk HEV belonged to the group of genotypes 1-6, which includes strains that also infect humans, and therefore could indicate potential for zoonotic transmission of this HEV.",,"Lin, J.;Karlsson, M.;Olofson, A.

Comparative phylogenetic analyzes of viral DNA sequences from the preS/S region of previously reported and new HHBV strains isolated from captive gray herons (Germany) and free-ranging gray herons (USA), respectively, showed high conservation (95% sequence similarity) with two separate clusters, suggesting a common ancestor of all tribes. Our data show for the first time that several heron subspecies are infected with HHBV and that these infections occur in non-captive birds. Phylogenetic analyzes and the fact that the different heron species are geographically isolated populations suggest that lateral transmission, viral adaptation, and environmental factors all play roles in the spread and evolution of HHBV.",,"Lin, L.;Prassolov, A.;Funk, A.;Quinn, L.;Hohenberg, H.;Frolich, K.;Newbold, J.;Ludwig, A.;Will, H.;Sirma, H.;Steinbach, F.",2005.0,May,,0

1179,Molecular epidemiology of avian leukosis virus subgroup J isolated from meat-type chickens in southern China between 2013 and 2014,"Members of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) cause various diseases associated with tumor formation and reduced fertility, resulting in large economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. To assess the status of ALV-J infection in meat chickens in southern China, the molecular epidemiology of ALV-J strains was examined. A total of 265 clinical specimens collected in southern China from 2013 to 2014 were tested for the presence of ALV-J in this study, resulting in 12 virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 91.7% (11/12) of ALV-J isolates had high homology to Chinese strata isolates and belonged to a subgroup. One of the ALV isolates (designated GD1411-1) was relatively closely related to the ALV-J broiler isolates, suggesting that the GD1411-1 isolate may be a transitional strain. Several unique nucleotide substitutions in gp85 and the U3 region were detected in all 12 ALV-J isolates. This study provides some interesting information on the molecular characterization of ALV-J isolates. These findings will be useful in understanding the pathogenic mechanism of ALV-J infection.",,"Lin, W.;Li, X.;Dai, Z.;Zhang, X.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.;Zhang, H.;Chen, F.;Xie, Q.",2016.0,,10.1007/s00705-016-3003-8,0
1180,Genetic and pathobiological characterization of H3N2 canine influenza virus isolated in 2009-2010 in Jiangsu province of China,"The emerging canine influenza virus (CIV) is a cause of significant veterinary and public health concern. In 2009-2010, six strains of H3N2 influenza virus were isolated from dogs in Jiangsu Province, China. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of eight gene segments revealed that the six viruses most closely resembled a canine influenza virus of the H3N2 subtype recently isolated in cats from South Korea, which originated from an avian strain. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the six Jiangsu isolates with the most similar avian strains, we found that all isolates shared several mutations at the receptor binding sites, potential glycosylation sites, and cleavage sites in HA1 and antigenic sites in both the HA1 and NA segments. Significantly, a unique two amino acid insertion was found in the NA stalk. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice showed that viral RNA could be detected in major rodent organs such as brain, heart, spleen, kidney, liver and intestine, and lung. All organs removed from infected mice showed significant lesions and viral antigen staining. This study underscores the potential of domesticated animals to become a reservoir for influenza viruses and the need for surveillance programs to detect transmission between species. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Lin, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Zeng, X.;Lu, C.;Liu, Y.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.016,0
1181,"Detection and characterization of viruses causing hand, foot and mouth disease in children in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia","Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral infection in infants and children. The main causative agents of HFMD are Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) infections have recently been reported in neighboring countries. Infected infants and children may have a fever, mouth/throat ulcers, skin rashes, and blisters on hands and feet. In addition, EV71 infection can cause fatal neurological complications. Since 1997, EV71 has caused fatalities in Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia. The purpose of this study was to identify and classify the viruses detected in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of HFMD in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia. From December 2012 to July 2013, a total of 28 samples were collected from patients with clinical case definition of HFMD. The HFMD viruses were detected using semi-nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (snRT-PCR). The positive snRT-PCR products were sequenced and virus phylogenetic analyzes were performed. 12 of 28 samples (42.9%) were positive by snRT-PCR, seven were CVA6 (58.3%), two were CVA16 (16.7%) and three were EV71 (25%). Based on phylogenetic analysis studies, EV71 strains have been identified as subgenotype B5; CVA16 strains classified as subgenotype B2b and B2c; CVA6 strains closely related to strains in Taiwan and Japan. In this study, HFMD in Seri Kembangan was caused by different types of enteroviruses, namely EV71, CVA6 and CVA16.",,"Ling, B. P.;Jalilian, F. A.;Harmal, N. S.;Yubbu, P.;Sekawi, Z.",2014.0,,,0
1182,"Hypothesis about the source, transmission and characteristics of infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus - based on analysis of epidemiological field studies and gene sequence analysis","Summary: On March 31, 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human influenza A virus (H7N9) infections had occurred in the provinces of Shanghai and Anhui, China. H7N9 cases were later discovered in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was estimated that the virus first spread north along the route of migratory birds and then spread to neighboring provinces through the sale of poultry. Epidemiological studies were conducted on samples from the external environment of infected cases, routes of transmission, farmers' markets and live poultry markets. A phylogenetic study of viral sequences of human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Lake Taihu were highly homologous with those from the outer environment. This suggests that avian viruses transmitted by waterfowl combine with the virus transmitted by migratory birds, resulting in the H7N9 avian influenza virus, which is highly pathogenic to humans. It is possible that the virus was spread from domestic wild fowl to domestic fowl and then to humans, or was further spread by trading in wholesale poultry markets. As the weather has gotten warmer and measures have been taken to end the poultry trade and facilitate health communication, the epidemic has been kept under control in the first half of the year. However, the source of infection in the Taihu Lake triangle area remains. The H7N9 epidemic is likely to hit the area later in the year and next spring when migratory birds return, and possibly even spread to other areas. Therefore, great importance should be attached to the wildfowl in Taihu Lake as a repository and spreader of the virus: the study and investigation of this population is essential.",,"Ling, F.;Chen, E.;Liu, Q.;Miao, Z.;Gong, Z.",2015.0,,10.1111/zph.12110,0
1183,Turkey rhinotracheitis virus: in vivo and in vitro polypeptide synthesis,"Turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) virus is a paramyxovirus associated with recent outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in turkeys. According to morphological criteria, it resembles pneumoviruses more than other members of the paramyxovirus family. In this communication we report the identification of five virus-induced polypeptides in TRT virus-infected BS-C-1 cells. The Mr of these polypeptides was estimated to be 38K, 35K, 30K, 19K, and 15K based on their electrophoretic mobility in 6-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. The virus specificity of four (the 38K, 35K, 30K and 19K Mr polypeptides) of these five was confirmed by their predominance as products of in vitro translation of mRNA from TRT virus-infected BS-C-1 cells . An additional virus-specific polypeptide with an estimated Mr of 22K was revealed by in vitro translation and may be either a non-structural polypeptide or a minor structural protein. All six polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by a murine antiserum. Three other polypeptides (129K, 57K and 45K) were also immunoprecipitated. The 57K, 45K, and 15K Mr polypeptides have been glycosylated, and the 57K glycopolypeptide may be a disulfide-bonded dimer of the 45K and 15K glycopolypeptides. Another important 83 K Mr glycopolypeptide was observed, but its virus specificity could not be confirmed. Taken together, our results tentatively identify eight or nine TRT virus-specific polypeptides and are consistent with the classification of TRT virus as a new member of the genus Pneumovirus.",,"Ling, R.;Pringle, C.

1188,Genetic characterization and mutational analysis of Qihe547-Aujeszky disease virus in China,"Background: Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) can cause neurological disorders in young pigs, respiratory disorders in older pigs, and abortion or delivery of mummified fetuses or stillborn newborns. The recurrence of Aujeszky's disease (AD) in pig farms vaccinated with live vaccine (Bartha-K61) has caused significant economic losses to the Chinese swine industry since late 2011. A field ADV, named Qihe547, was isolated from pigs suspected of having AD presenting with clinical symptoms. To better understand the genetic properties and mutations of Qihe547 ADV, the entire genome was sequenced and analyzed. Results: The genomic length of Qihe547 ADV was 143,404 bp, with 73.59% G+C content. A phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome of ADV strains revealed that Chinese ADV strains belonged to a group with three subgroups. Qihe547 ADV was closely related to these new ADV strains isolated in China since 2012. Qihe547 showed numerous hypervariable regions compared to foreign ADV strains. Amino acid (AA) insertion or deletion was observed in 34 genes of Qihe547 ADV. In addition, numerous AA mutations were found in the major protective antigen genes (gB, gC and gD genes). The differences of potential antigenic peptides in the major protective antigens between Qihe547 ADV and ADV Bartha were detected in the dominant antigenic regions of gB (AA59-AA126, AA507-AA734), the extracellular region of gC and gD. Conclusion: High diversity was observed between Qihe547 and foreign ADV isolates. The AA variations and potential antigenic peptide differences in the key functional regions of the major protective antigen (gB, gC, and gD) of ADV Qihe547 may contribute to virus immune evasion and may be in part the reason the virus evades vaccination of the Bartha K61 vaccine.

Here we characterized these viruses by performing sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes of their viral genes, assessed their virulence in ducks and mice, and performed cross-protection experiments in chickens. Sequence analysis revealed that the HA genes of these H5N5 viruses showed 97.1-97.8% homology to A/Wild Duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) influenza virus and their NA genes 96.4-96 Exhibited .8% nucleotide identity with the NA gene of A/duck/Hunan/5613/2003 (H6N5) influenza virus belonging to the Eurasian lineage. Genotypic analyzes showed that these H5N5 viruses were multiple reassortants among H5N1, H5N2, H6N2 and H6N5 viruses. Analysis of the HA clade showed that these H5N5 viruses cluster in clade 2.3.4. In animal studies, these H5N5 viruses caused 50% mortality in ducks and 100% mortality in chickens. In cross-protection experiments, the Clade 2.3.2 avian influenza vaccine in chickens was only able to provide 75% protection against H5N5 virus challenge. In addition, the H5N5 virus efficiently replicated in the lungs of mice, suggesting that the H5N5 viruses have the potential to infect mammalian hosts.

To identify changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression and post-transcriptional regulatory responses to PRV infection in porcine renal epithelial (PK15) cells, we sequenced a small RNA (sRNA) library prepared from infected PK15 cells and compared them to a library made from uninfected cells using Illumina deep sequencing. Here we found 25 novel viral miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing and 20 of these miRNAs were confirmed by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Interestingly, these novel viral miRNAs are present throughout the PRV genome like β-herpesviruses, in contrast to the usual miRNAs encoded by the α-herpesviruses, which are abundant in the Large Latency Transcript (LLT). Viral miRNAs are predicted to target multiple genes and form a complex regulatory network. GO analyzes on host targets of viral miRNAs have been implicated in complex cellular processes including the metabolic pathway, biological regulation, stimulus response, signaling process, and immune response. Furthermore, 13 host miRNAs were expressed with significant difference after infection with PRV: 8 miRNAs were upregulated and 5 miRNAs were downregulated, which may affect viral replication in the host cell.

Our data confirmed that the EMCV strains isolated from pigs and rats showed high homology between each other, implying that rats may play an important role in EMCV transmission between domestic pigs and wild boar.",,"Liu, H.;Li, Y.;Zhang, G.;Sang, S.;Wang, C.;Chang, H.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.032,0

1200,Characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolated from waterfowl in China,"Ten representative isolates of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) recovered from outbreaks in waterfowl (geese and ducks) in China since 1997 have been characterized both pathotypically and genotypically. Mean time of death and intracerebral pathogenicity index were used to assess the virulence of the isolates. Pathogenicity tests showed that all 10 isolates were velogen strains. The 535 nucleotide major functional region of the F gene was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site in all 10 isolates was 112RRQKRF117, which is a typical sequence of velogenic strains and consistent with the results of in vivo pathogenicity tests. A pedigree based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was constructed for genotyping. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most isolates were of genotype VII virus. Only one strain, WG, was found to be genotype IX virus. This strain was closest to F48E9, which was isolated in China in 1946 and used as a standard challenge strain in vaccine evaluation in China. So genotype IX virus still causes sporadic infections in geese in China. Further phylogenetic analysis of genotype VII strains revealed that all of these strains can be divided into 5 subgenotypes and most of the isolates (8 strains) were classified as VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks. has been responsible since the end of the past century in China. Only 1 strain, NDV03-053, has been shown to be genotype VIIc virus. The results show that the VIId NDV genotype strains are the main pathogens responsible for most outbreaks of ND in waterfowl in China since 1997.",,"Liu, H.;Wang, Z.;Wang, Y.;Sun, C.;Zheng, D.;Wu, Y.",2008.0,,10.1637/8030-061507-Reg,0
1201,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of novel Newcastle disease virus isolates from mainland China,"Seventy-nine velogenetic Newcastle disease (NDV) virus isolates were obtained from infected chicken flocks during the 2006 Newcastle disease (ND) outbreak in various regions of mainland China. The F gene fragment (535 bp, from nt 47 to 581 of F gene) encoding the main functional region of F protein was obtained by RT-PCR and sequenced. All sequences obtained in this study were submitted to GenBank. All isolates have the 112R-RQ/RK/RR-F117 motif at the cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is typical for velogenic NDV isolates. For genotyping, a pedigree was constructed based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene and the 79 isolates could be divided into two genotypes, viz. VIId and III. Most isolates turned out to be of genotype VIId; only two isolates were of genotype III. Genotype VIId NDV was the predominant pathogen responsible for most outbreaks of Newcastle disease in China. According to studies on the molecular epidemiology of NDV in China from 2002 to 2006, the proportion of isolates of genotype VIId NDV shows an increasing trend. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1202,Molecular epidemiological analysis of the Newcastle disease virus isolated in China in 2005,"83 strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were isolated from outbreaks in chickens, pigeons, geese and ducks in China in 2005 and genotypically characterized. The major functional region of the F gene (535 nucleotides) was amplified and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was constructed using sequences from 83 isolates and representative NDV sequences obtained from GenBank. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all newly characterized strains belonged to six genetic groups: I, II, III, VIb, VIIc and VIId. All isolates belonging to Groups I and II (14 in total) were lentogenic according to the amino acid sequences of the fusion protein cleavage site and were either V4 or LaSota type depending on the vaccines used. Most of the isolates (64 in total) have been assigned to group VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most outbreaks of Newcastle disease since the end of the last century. One strain, NDV05-055, was in Group VIIc, three pigeon strains were in Group VIb, and one isolate, NDV05-041, was in Group III and was characterized as a velogen strain.

1203,Phylogenetic characterization and virulence of two Newcastle disease viruses isolated from wild birds in China,"Wild birds are considered a natural reservoir of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). However, there is no information on the IX NDV genotype of wild birds, particularly Columbiformes. In this study, two genotype IX NDV viruses were isolated from wild birds. One was from Eurasian Blackbird while the other was from Spotted-necked dove. After purification by plaque technique, complete genomes of both viruses were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial fusion gene (F) and the full genome showed that both strains belonged to genotype IX. Based on the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), the Eurasian blackbird virus was a velogenic virus while the spotted pigeon strain was a lentogenic virus. However, both strains showed a velogenic cleavage site. In addition, the Eurasian blackbird strain showed greater replication ability and generated larger foci of fusion in vitro than the spotted pigeon strain. Comparing all the corresponding protein sequences of both strains, there were only 9 different amino acid residues between them. Furthermore, after analyzing these differences, the information on lentogenic NDV with multibasic cleavage site was presented.",,"Liu, H.;Zhang, P.;Wu, P.;Chen, S.;Mu, G.;Duan, X.;Hao, H.;Du, E.;Wang, X.;Yang, Z.",2013.0,Dec,,0
1204,"Rapid characterization of avian reoviruses using phylogenetic analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is described that amplified the full length sigmaC-encoding and sigmaNS-encoding genes of avian reovirus (ARV). DNA fragments of 1022 and 1152 base pairs, respectively, were amplified among the ARV isolates, indicating that there were no obvious deletions or insertions in these regions. Fragments amplified from vaccine strains and field isolates were digested with five different restriction enzymes Bcn I, Hae III, Taq I, Dde I and Hinc II, respectively. Restriction fragment profiles observed on polyacrylamide gels showed heterogeneity between vaccine and Taiwanese isolates. All ARV isolates tested showed different restriction enzyme cleavage patterns and could be clearly distinguished. Strain typing based on the cleavage sites in the ARV sigmaC-encoding gene showed that viruses could be divided into four different groups. A phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the sigmaC-encoding gene revealed that Taiwanese ARV isolates were classified into four distinct groups, indicating that genotyping is consistent with typing based on the restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism of the sigmaC-encoding gene of ARV matches. Results suggested that polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme analysis provided a simple and rapid approach to characterize ARV isolates. It can also be used to determine if a new strain variant has been introduced into a flock or if a particular virus strain has spread from one flock to another.",,"Liu, H. J.;Lee, L. H.;Shih, W.

1205,Complete genome sequence of goose parvovirus Y strain isolated from Muscovy ducks in China,"goose parvovirus (GPV) Y strain was isolated from Muscovy ducks in Anhui Province, China. Its complete genomic sequence was determined by the polymerase chain reaction method to be 5,106 bp, consisting of 444 bp inverted terminal repeat, 1,844 bp nonstructural protein, and 2,199 bp capsid protein (VP) regions. Then its sequence was matched to the sequences of GPV and Muscovy Duck Parvovirus published in GenBank using the neighbor-joining method. The phylogenetic analyzes based on the VP3 gene sequences revealed that the GPV-Y strain belonged to subgroup IIb along with those from Taiwan, while other GPV strains of muscovy ducks belonged to subgroup Ib and most other GPV strains, isolated in mainland China were clustered in subgroup IIa. The absence of the deduced 703-705NRT glycosylation site in the VP region may explain the host specificity of the GPV Y strain.

1207,Interregional transmission of H2 influenza virus internal protein genes in migratory ducks from North America to Eurasia,"The H2 flu virus caused a pandemic in 1957 and has the potential to cause outbreaks in the future. To assess the evolutionary characteristics of H2 influenza viruses isolated from migratory ducks congregating in Hokkaido, Japan, on their migration route from Siberia in 2001, we examined the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and the avian and human viruses previously described. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the PB2 gene of Dk/Hokkaido/107/01 (H2N3) and the PA gene of Dk/Hokkaido/95/01 (H2N2) belonged to the American lineage of avian virus and that the other genes of the isolates belonged to Eurasian descent. These results indicate that the internal protein genes could be transferred from American to Eurasian bird hosts. Thus, it further confirms that interregional transmission of influenza viruses between North American and Eurasian birds occurred. The fact that reassortants could be generated in the migratory ducks between North American and Eurasian avian virus lineages further underscores the importance of global surveillance among migratory ducks.",,"Liu, J.;Okazaki, K.;Bai, G.;Shi, W.;Mweene, A.;Kida, H.",2004.0,,10.1023/B:VIRU.0000032791.26573.f1,0
1208,"Recombination in lineages 1, 3, 5 and 8 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses in China","Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most important viral swine diseases, causing immense economic losses in Chinese swine industry. There are currently four main lines circulating in China: Line 1 (NADC30-like), 3 (QYYZ-like), 5.1 (VR2332-like), and 8.7 (JXA1-like) of Type 2 PRRSV (North American Type) based on classification system that have raised concerns about the potential for viral recombination. In the present study, a novel variant of the PRRSV strain named FJLIUY-2017 was isolated from an abortion rate (25%) in pregnant gilts in Fujian Province, China, in 2017. To advance our knowledge of the novel virus strain, we characterized the full genome of FJLIUY-2017. Comparison with PRRS sequences in GenBank confirmed the absence of close relatives (<92%), but suggested that FJLIUY-2017 belonged to NADC30-like PRRSV. The full length of FJLIUY-2017 was determined to be 15017 nucleotides (nt), without the poly(A) tail, and shared 86.2-86.6% identity with JXA1-like strains (JXA1, TJ, and FJYR), 88 .9-90.6% with NADC30-like PRRSVs (NADC30, FJZ03 and CHsx1401), 86.4-86.5% with VR2332-like (VR2332, RespPRRS MLV and BJ-4) and only 60.8% with LV (European type). Recombination analysis revealed genomic breakpoints in structural (ORF3, ORF4, and ORF7) and nonstructural (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp6, Nsp9, Nsp11, and Nsp12) regions of the genome with evidence for recombination events between lineages 1, 3, 5.1, and 8.7. Overall, the results of our study provide further confirmation that PRRSV is susceptible to recombination events. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to monitor the development of PRRSV in China and to develop an effective strategy to control PRRS.",,"Liu, J.;Wei, C.;Lin, Z.;Fan, J.;Xia, W.;Dai, A.;Yang, X.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.12.006,0

METHODS: Two clinical specimens were obtained from HFMD patients taken in outpatient service, and then virus isolation was performed by inoculation of RD cells. The VP4-VP2 region from two viral isolates was amplified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods and then the PCR products were sequenced; molecular typing was used to identify the serotype of these two viral isolates. Finally, the phylogenetic tree was constructed between these two Gansu virus isolates and 16 CVA4 strains downloaded from GenBank database. RESULTS: Two viruses were isolated from clinical specimens collected from two HFMD patients by inoculation of RD cells and were identified as CVA4 using molecular typing methods. The homology of the nucleotide sequences in the VP4-VP2 region between the two Gansu CVA4 strains was 94.6% and the homology of the amino acid sequences was 100%. Compared with the prototype strain of CVA4 (Strain High Point/USA/1948), the homologies of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences were 85.5%-85.8% and 99.3%, respectively. Two Gansu CVA4 tribes were shown to lie within the independence group. CONCLUSION: Compared with CVA4 strains isolated in Japan and Mongolia downloaded from GenBank database, two Gansu CVA4 strains were found to have large differences in VP4-VP2 region, and phylogenetic analysis revealed, that they belong to an independent line of evolution.",,"Liu, J.

1210,Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of H9N2 viruses isolated from migratory ducks,"Genetic analyzes showed that wild waterfowl-derived strains of pandemic influenza harbor viruses of 15 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 antigenic neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. Surveillance studies have shown that H9N2 subtype viruses are present in domestic poultry worldwide and could infect mammalian species including humans. Here we genetically analyzed the HA and NA genes of five H9N2 viruses isolated from migratory ducks in Hokkaido, Japan, the migratory route from Siberia between 1997 and 2000. The results showed that the HA and NA genes of these viruses belong to the same lineages, respectively. Compared to those of A/Quail/Hongkong/G1/97-like and A/duck/Hongkong/Y280/97-like viruses, HA and NA of the migratory duck isolates were closely related to those of H9N2 viruses isolated from the chicken in Korea, suggesting that the Korea H9N2 viruses may have originated from the migratory ducks. The NA genes of the five isolates were in the same cluster as those of N2 viruses that caused a human pandemic in 1968, suggesting that the NA genes of the earlier pandemic strains are still circulating in waterfowl reservoirs. The present results further emphasize the importance of conducting molecular epidemiological surveillance of H9N2 viruses in wild ducks to provide more information for future human influenza pandemic preparedness.",,"Liu, J.

This study reports the identification and characterization of a swine bufavirus through a metagenomic approach and a limited epidemiological survey of bufavirus in six swine farms. A comparative genome analysis showed a similarity of 93% to a Hungarian porcine bufavirus. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyzes of genomic sequences revealed a close relationship of porcine bufaviruses to human and simian bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common ancestors supported a recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and swine populations, respectively. A real-time PCR method was developed to screen 60 fecal samples for porcine bufavirus DNA and eight positive samples were found in two neighboring farms, indicating a relatively low prevalence (13.3%). No direct transmission of porcine bufaviruses between two neighboring farms was detected, suggesting that bufaviruses may have spread widely in different geographic regions.",,"Liu, L.;Schwarz, L.;Ullman, K.;Ahola, H.;Qiu, Y.;Ma, Z.;Hennig-Pauka, I.",2016.0,,10.1099/jgv.0.000476,1

1213,Characterization of clade 7.2 H5 avian influenza viruses continuing to circulate in chickens in China,"The H5N1 avian influenza viruses emerged in Southeast Asia in the late 20th century and have evolved into multiple phylogenetic clades based on their genes encoding hemagglutinin (HA). Clade 7.2 viruses were first detected in chickens in northern China in 2006, and clade-specific vaccines have been developed and used in poultry in China since 2006-2014 carrying the clade 7.2 HA genes. Here we conducted extensive studies to understand how the clade 7.2 H5 viruses evolved in chickens in China. A full genome sequence analysis revealed that the seven viruses formed two subtypes (four H5N1 viruses and three H5N2 viruses) and four genotypes by deriving genes from other influenza viruses. All viruses had antigenically diverged from the clade 7.2 viruses isolated in 2006. Pathogenicity studies of four viruses, one from each genotype, showed that all viruses are highly pathogenic in chickens, but none of them could replicate in ducks. The four viruses bound exclusively to avian-type receptors and replicated only in mouse turbinates and/or lungs; none of them were lethal to mice at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> 50% egg infective doses (EID<sub>50</sub>). Our study shows that while vaccination has not eradicated clade 7.2 viruses from poultry, it has not become more dangerous to other animals (e.g. ducks and mice) and humans. IMPORTANT: Animal influenza viruses can acquire the ability to infect and kill humans. The H5N1 viruses have been of concern over the past few decades because of their clear pandemic potential. We have divided H5N1 influenza viruses into different phylogenetic classes based on their HA genes. The clade 7.2 viruses were detected in chickens in several provinces of northern China in 2006. Vaccines against these viruses were subsequently developed and have since been used to combat infection in poultry. Here we analyzed the genetic and biological properties of seven clade 7.2 viruses isolated from chickens between 2011 and 2014. We found that after nearly 9 years of circulation in chickens, clade 7.2 viruses still bind exclusively to avian-type receptors and are of low pathogenicity for mice, suggesting that these H5 viruses pose a low public health risk represent people.",,"Liu, L.;Zeng, X.;Chen, P.;Deng, G.;Li, Y.;Shi, J.;Gu, C.;Kong, H.;Suzuki, Y.;Jiang, Y.;Tian, G.;Chen, H.",2016.0,2001-11-01 00:00:00,,0

The complete gene of the NDV isolate was sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically. Pathogenicity experiments were performed on pigeons, chickens and ducks. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain clustered with the class II viruses is phylogenetically very similar to the NDV strains isolated from pigeons in China, but was far removed from the virus prevalence in chickens and the vaccine strains used in China. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion protein (F) confirmed that the isolate contained the virulent motif (112)RRQKRF(117) at the cleavage site, but it did not cause disease in chickens and ducks. However, the isolate was virulent in pigeons, resulting in severe nervous signs and high mortality. Pigeons have been considered a potential source of NDV infection and disease for commercial poultry flocks. Therefore, new vaccines should be developed as soon as possible to prevent the NDV infection in the pigeon flocks, and strict biosecurity measures should be taken to reduce the risk of Pigeon Newcastle Disease outbreaks.",,"Liu, M.;Qu, Y.;Wang, F.;Liu, S.;Sun, H.",2015.0,,10.3382/ps/pev106,0
1215,High reversal potential of a cell-adapted vaccine candidate against the highly pathogenic reproductive and respiratory syndrome in swine,"Modified live vaccine (MLV) based on the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) is prone to rapid reversion of virulence when circulating in host animals. The aim of this study was to assess the virulence reversion potential of HP-PRRSV MLV and to identify elements within the HP-PRRSV genome that contribute to this phenomenon. An attempt was made to attenuate an HP-PRRSV strain JX143 isolated during the atypical PRRS outbreak in 2006 using a blind passage cell adaptation strategy to balance safety and efficacy in 4-week-old piglets (unpublished data). Two studies were conducted in which candidates were tested for reversion to virulence by five reverse passages in susceptible piglets (age 21 +/- 3 days). Both study results showed a significant increase in clinical symptoms, fever and lung lesions, and reduced average daily weight gain from passage 3 in susceptible pigs, and indicated that both candidates regained virulence regardless of the level of passage. The increase in the corresponding parameters was accompanied by an increase in viraemia in piglets: JXM87 virus titer increased from passage 1 (P1) 4.40 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL to P4 5.75 Lg TCID<sub> 50</sub>/ml and the JXM105 virus titer increased from P1 3.78 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml to P4 6.42 Lg TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on clinical samples (serum, lung tissue) from P4 animals. Sequence analysis comparing P4 materials to their parental strains revealed 10 amino acid mutations in 4 proteins for JXM87 and 14 amino acid mutations in 9 proteins for JXM105, respectively. Interestingly, five amino acid mutations were identical in the two candidates located in the nsp1beta, GP5a and nsp10 coding regions, suggesting that nsp1beta, GP5a and nsp10 may contribute to virulence in HP-PRRSV.",,"Liu, P.;Bai, Y.;Jiang, X.;Zhou, L.;Yuan, S.;Yao, H.;Yang, H.;Sun, Z.",2018.0,Dec,,0
1216,Phylogenetic analysis of 626 hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates from humans and animals in China (1986-2011) showing genotype diversity and zoonotic transmission,"Hepatitis E is considered a public health problem in China. In order to determine the general molecular epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and to analyze the situation of cross-species transmission between humans and swine in China in the last 25 years (1986-2011), 626 complete and partial HEV sequences ( 89 isolates identified by our group) isolated from humans and animals in China were retrieved from GenBank and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. In China, three genotypes and 11 subgenotypes of HEV were predominant. In addition, rabbit HEVs, whose genotype is disputed, are also widespread in China. Genotype 1 was the most isolated genotype before 2000 and was mainly detected in Xinjiang, Beijing and eastern China. However, genotype 4, which has been identified in most regions of China over the past 10 years, has overtaken genotype 1 in frequency of isolation nationwide. HEV genotype 3 strains were only found in eastern China and were thought to have been imported from Japan. Both genotypes 3 and 4 have been found in humans and pigs, and cross-species transmission of the two genotypes from pigs to humans may have occurred in Northeast, Northwest, North, East, and South China. These results indicate that HEV strains with considerable genetic diversity are widespread and zoonotic transmission between pigs and humans appears to be ubiquitous in China. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Liu, P.;Li, L.;Wang, L.;Bu, Q.;Fu, H.;Han, J.;Zhu, Y.;Lu, F.;Zhuang, H.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2012.01.017,0

In the present study, an examination of the avian influenza virus was carried out in tree sparrows and an HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Tree Sparrow/Jiangsu/1/08) was isolated. The H5N1 virus was found to be a variant of genotype V belonging to strain 2.3.4 that emerged in southern China in 2005. Genetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A/Jiangsu/1/07 (H5N1), which was blamed in 2007 for likely limited person-to-person transmission in a family cluster in China. Pathogenicity studies showed that the virus was highly virulent when experimentally inoculated into chickens, tree sparrows and mice. Since clade 2.3.4, the genotype V variant of the H5N1 virus, was responsible for most of the human deaths in China between 2005 and 2008, the presence of such H5N1 variants in tree sparrows underscores the potential threat of this type of infection to wild birds veterinary medicine and public health. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Liu, Q.;Ma, J.;Kou, Z.;Pu, J.;Lei, F.;Li, T.;Liu, J.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2009.09.014,0

The SFTS virus (SFTSV) has been identified as the causative agent of the disease and recognized as a public health threat. This novel bunyavirus belongs to the genus Phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. This review also describes the various aspects of virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical symptoms based on the published article surveillance data and phylogenetic analyzes of large, medium and small segment virus sequences retrieved from the database using Mega 5.05, Simplot 3.5. 1, network 4.611 and epi information system 3.5.3 software. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and marked changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has a mortality rate of 10 to 15%, often due to multiple organ dysfunction. SFTSV is mainly reported in the rural areas of central and northeast China, with the seasonal occurrence from May to September mostly targeting individuals ≥50 years of age. A wide range of domestic animals including sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dogs and chickens have been shown to be seropositive for SFTSV. Ticks, especially Haemaphysalis longicornis, are suspected to be potential carriers, and they have a wide range of animal hosts worldwide. Further studies are needed to elucidate the vector-animal-human ecological cycle, pathogenic mechanisms in high-level animal models, and vaccine development. © 2013 The Authors.

1219,Identification of the avian infectious bronchitis coronaviruses with mutations in gene 3,"The sequence of a 6.0 kb fragment was compared in the 3″ coding region of the genome in 27 strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). All of these strains have the same S-3-M-5-N gene order as found in other IBVs. However, the sizes of the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs) of some genes varied between virus strains. Phylogenetic analyzes and sequence alignments indicated that recombination events occurred in the origin and evolution of strains CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I and that the putative recombinant junctions could be located at the 3c and M genes , respectively The normal product of ORF 3a is 57 amino acids long, while a 43 bp deletion was detected at the 3' end of the CK/CH/LSD/03I 3a gene, resulting in a frameshift event and a C-terminal truncated protein resulted in 47 amino acids. A comparison of the viability in embryos and the replication and pathogenicity in chickens with IBV carrying the normal 3a gene showed that this deleted sequence in the 3a gene of CK/CH/LSD/03I is not relevant either in vitro or in vitro for the viral pathogenesis and replication required was alive. The occurrence of a mutation at the corresponding position of the CK/CH/LLN/98I start codon in the 3a gene resulted in the absence of ORF 3a in this virus, resulting in a new genomic organization in the 3 coding regions: S -3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N. A comparison with other viruses carrying the normal 3a gene showed that CK/CH/LLN/98I had in vivo replication and pathogenic abilities similar to other IBVs; however, its viability in embryos was lower, although the relationship between the lower viability and the ORF 3a defect needs further confirmation. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Liu, S.;Zhang, Q.;Chen, J.;Han, Z.;Shao, Y.;Kong, X.;Tong, G.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2008.01.004,0
1220,Porcine epidemic diarrheal virus infection caused the imbalance of gut microbiota in piglets,"Epidemic swine diarrhea (PED) is a devastating disease in the livestock industry. Most previous studies related to PED have focused on the pathology and etiology of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV). Little was known about the status of the gut microbiota after PEDV infection in piglets. In this study, gut microbiota profiles in feces of viral diarrhea (VD) and viral control (VC) piglets were examined using metagenome sequencing technology. The results showed that the frequency of four dominant phyla (Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria) in faeces was strongly influenced by epidemic diarrhea in pigs. In particular, the frequency of Fusobacteria was higher in VD piglets (36%) than in VC piglets (5%). In contrast, verrucomicrobia was detected in lower distribution proportions in VD piglets (about 0%) than in VC piglets (20%). In addition, 25 genera differed significantly between VC and VD piglets at the genera level. Among the 25 genera, Leptotrichia belonging to Fusobacteria was remarkably rarer in VC piglets than in VD piglets. Akkermansia belonging to Verrucomicrobia was higher in VC piglets than in VD piglets. Our results implied that the gut microbiota associated with PED provided significant insight into the pathology and physiology of PED.",,"Liu, S.;Zhao, L.;Zhai, Z.;Zhao, W.;Ding, J.;Dai, R.;Sun, T.;Meng, H.",2015.0,,10.1007/s00284-015-0895-6,0
1221,Identification of natural recombination in duck hepatitis B virus,"Because of its close similarity to human hepatitis B virus (HBV), duck HBV (DHBV) is often used as an important model for HBV research. While intergenotypic recombination is common in HBV, it has not been reported in DHBV. In this study, 32 non-redundant full DHBV genomes were analyzed using phylogenetic methods and classified into two clusters corresponding to the Chinese and Westland branches previously reported based on geographic distribution. A ""Chinese"" branch tribe has been isolated in Australia and three ""western country"" branch tribes have been isolated in China, suggesting a geographical spanning distribution of both branches. Recombination analyzes of the 32 DHBV genomes identified two possible high-confidence intergenotypic recombination events. These recombination events occurred between the lineages represented respectively by Chinese isolate GD3 (AY536371, ""Chinese"" branch) and American isolate DHBV16 (K01834, ""Western country"" branch), resulting in two Chinese recombinant isolates CH4 (EU429324 ) led. and CH6 (EU429326).

This disease is most prevalent in southern, southeastern and eastern Asia. In this study, two JEV strains named JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 were isolated from aborted fetuses and semen of pigs in China. To determine the characteristics of these virus isolates, the virulence of two new JEV isolates was examined, the result showed that the JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 did not kill mice, while the JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 did became neurovirulence at 0.925log10 pfu/LD50. In addition, the full genome sequences of JEV were determined and compared to other known JEV strains. The results showed that the genomes of two JEV isolates were 10,976 nucleotides (nt) in length. Compared to the Chinese vaccine strain SA14-14-2, JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 showed 99.7% and 97.5% identity at the nucleotide level, 99.6% and 96, 7% identity at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome revealed that two JEV isolates were all assigned to genotype III compared to the reference strains. Furthermore, selection analyzes revealed that the dominant selection pressure acting on the JEV genome purges selection. Four sites under positive selection were identified: codon 521 (amino acid E-227), 2296 (amino acid NS4b-24), 3048 (amino acid NS5-521), and 3055 (amino acid NS5-528). Amino acid E-227 has been shown to be associated with neurovirulence. Taken together, the molecular epidemiology and function of positively selected amino acid sites of two new JEV isolates were fully understood, which could be helpful in predicting possible changes in virulence. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Liu, W.

In this study, we obtained the miRNA expression profiles of PCMV-infected porcine macrophages via high-throughput sequencing. The comprehensive analysis of the miRNA profiles showed that 239 annotated from the miRNA database and 355 novel porcine miRNAs were discovered. Of these, 130 miRNAs showed a significant differential expression between the PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine macrophages. The 10 differentially expressed porcine-encoded miRNAs were further determined by stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with high-throughput sequencing. Genontological analyzes of the target genes of miRNAs in PCMV-infected pig macrophages showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in immune and metabolic processes. This is the first report of the miRNA transcriptome in porcine macrophages and an analysis of miRNA regulatory mechanisms during PCMV infection.

Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive viral infection remain unclear. Methods: In this study, porcine small RNA transcriptomes from PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterized by high-throughput sequencing. The miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel porcine miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, a stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on 12 significant DE miRNAs. The physical and functional interactions between the immune-related target genes of the DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analyzed using the STRING database. Results: A total of 306 annotated and 295 new miRNAs from PCMV-infected and non-infected pig organs were identified by comparison with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. A total of 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs were significantly differently expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney and thymus after PCMV infection. According to the gene ontology enrichment analysis, target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs, which are related to processes of the immune system, the regulation of biological processes and metabolic processes, were enriched in each sample. An integrated expression analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that under the pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs, the significant differential expression of specific miRNAs disrupted the expression of genes involved in important immune-related signaling pathways, thereby promoting viral infection. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the responses of host small RNA transcriptomes to PCMV infection in porcine vital organs.

Pathogenicity experiments performed in this study indicated that the virus was highly pathogenic to chickens but low pathogenic to mammalian hosts, as evidenced by reduced infection of mice. Analysis of full genome sequences and genetic evolution indicated that A/Swan/Shanghai/10/09 (SW/SH/09) may have descended from strain A/silky chicken/Shantou/475/2004 (CK/ST/04). , which is homologous to the influenza viruses isolated in 2007 from chicken, duck, pika, egret, swan, mandarin duck and bar-headed goose in China Hunan, China Qinghai, Mongolia, Russia, Japan, Korea, Laos and Hong Kong. 2011, suggesting that the virus has retro-infected various wild birds from chickens and that significant spread of the virus through overlapping migration routes is ongoing.

1227,The response of the porcine microRNA transcriptome to transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection,"The transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; family Coronaviridae) causes enormous economic losses in the swine industry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infections and may be involved in mammalian immune responses. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected porcine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were compared to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs showed significantly different expression between the normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 44 were significantly downregulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples and the results were consistent with sequencing. Genetic ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes revealed that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks including cellular, metabolic, and immune system processes. This is the first report on the identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, revealing the molecular miRNA regulatory mechanisms for viral infection, viral gene expression, and immune-related gene expression.

1229,Phylogenetic diversity and genotypic complexity of H1N1 subtype swine influenza viruses isolated in mainland China,"Background: After the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, H1N1 subtype swine influenza viruses (H1N1-SIV) have received much attention from scientific circles in many countries. A large-scale sequence analysis of the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database was performed on H1N1 SIVs submitted between 1992 and 2011 mainly by scientists in China. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H1N1 SIVs, to identify and unify the lineages and genetic characteristics of the H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. Results: Most strains were isolated in Guangdong and Shandong provinces, China, in the period 2008-2010. Based on the phylogenetic and genotypic analyses, all H1N1 SIV strains can be classified into 8 lineages and 10 genotypes. All strains had the characteristics of low pathogenic influenza viruses. The viruses of different lineages are characterized by different amino acid residues at the receptor binding sites. Viruses containing PB2 genes from the classical pig, early seasonal human, and newer seasonal human lineages may be more infectious to humans. Some genotypes were directly related to human influenza viruses, including strains that contained human influenza virus-derived genes. Conclusions: Phylogenetic diversity and complexity existed in H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. These H1N1 SIV strains were closely related to other influenza virus subtypes, particularly human influenza viruses. In addition, it has been shown that new lineages and genotypes of H1N1 SIVs have recently emerged in mainland China. These results provided new and essential information for further understanding of the genetic and evolutionary traits and surveillance of H1N1 SIVs in mainland China. © 2012 Liu et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Liu, Y.;Wang, J.;Ji, J.;Chang, S.;Xue, C.;Ma, J.;Bi, Y.;Xie, Q.",2012.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-9-289,0
1230,Application of a molecular method to classify human enteroviruses and their correlation with clinical manifestations,"Background/Purpose: A new molecular classification scheme has recently been introduced that groups all enteroviruses into four types, designated human enterovirus A (HEV-A) through D. In this study, we attempted to show the correlation between this molecular classification scheme and clinical manifestations in patients. METHODS: We reclassified enterovirus clinical isolates from the previous 4.5 years in our virology laboratory using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and reviewed the clinical manifestations of 138 pediatric patients. Results: We reclassified 23 isolates from the five serotypes to the HEV-A group, 110 isolates from 16 serotypes to the HEV-B group, five isolates to the HEV-C group, and no isolate to the HEV-D group. HEV-A species caused significantly more hand, foot and mouth disease (p<0.001), herpangina (p=0.029), and myoclonic jerks (p<0.001) compared to HEV-B species. However, HEV-B species caused significantly more pharyngitis (p=0.043), respiratory tract infections (p=0.046), nausea and vomiting (p=0.007), and aseptic meningitis (p=0.001). The only death in our report was caused by coxsackievirus A16, which belonged to the HEV-A group. Conclusion: The relationship between the molecular classification of enteroviruses and related diseases is an important finding. We propose that under certain circumstances, such as B. limited availability of antisera or questionable serotyping results, could be used in a clinical laboratory as an alternative method to identify the untypable isolates.

1231,Origin and development of the Nipah virus,"Nipah virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 pathogen and a Category C priority pathogen. Nipah virus disease is endemic in South Asia and outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Singapore, India and Bangladesh. Bats of the genus Pteropus appear to be the natural reservoir of this virus. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic diversity of the Nipah virus, to estimate the date of origin and the spread of the infection. The mean evolution rate of the Nipah virus N gene was 6.5 x 10-4 substitution/site/year (95% HPD: 2.3 x 10-4-1.18 x 10-3). Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis showed that the root of the tree emerged in 1947 (95% HPD: 1888-1988) when the virus invaded Southeast Asian regions. The division of the sequences into two major clades (I and II) indicates that Nipah virus had two distinct introductions: one in 1995 (95% HPD: 1985–2002) corresponding to clade I, and the other in Year 1985 (95% HPD: 1985-2002). 1971-1996) corresponding to Clade II. The phylogeographic reconstruction showed that the epidemic followed two different routes to spread to the other locations. Trade in infected pigs may have played a role in spreading the virus. Bats of the genus Pteropus, which can travel great distances, may have helped spread the infection.

It is currently unknown whether this mode of infection of a host occurred once or many times during evolution. RESULTS: To answer this question, we performed a comparative genomic analysis on a panel of bacterial pathogens from seven genera - Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Coxiella and Bartonella, including species from three different host vectors - ticks, lice and fleas . The last set of 102 genomes used in the study encoded a total of 120,046 protein sequences. We found that no genes or metabolic pathways were present in all tick-borne bacteria. However, we found that some genes and signaling pathways were present in subsets of tick-borne organisms, while they were absent in bacteria transmitted by lice or fleas. Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that the ability of pathogens to be transmitted by ticks has evolved multiple times over the course of evolution.

1233,A universal protocol for generating consensus-level genome sequences for foot-and-mouth disease virus and other positive-sense polyadenylated RNA viruses using Illumina MiSeq,"BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is revolutionizing molecular epidemiology by providing new approaches to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) in diagnostic settings for a variety of human and veterinary pathogens. Previous sequencing protocols have been subject to biases such as those encountered during PCR amplification and cell culture, or are limited by the need for large amounts of starting material. We describe here a simple and robust method to generate whole genome sequences on the Illumina MiSeq. This protocol is specific for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) or other polyadenylated RNA viruses and circumvents both the use of PCR and the requirement for large amounts of initial template. RESULTS: The protocol was successfully validated using five FMDV positive clinical specimens from the 2001 UK epidemic and a panel of representative viruses of all seven serotypes. In addition, this protocol was successfully used to recover 94% of an FMDV genome previously identified as cell culture negative. Genomic sequences of three other non-FMDV polyadenylated RNA viruses (EMCV, ERAV, VESV) were also obtained with minor protocol changes. We calculated that a minimum depth of coverage of 22 reads was required to generate an accurate consensus sequence for FMDV O. This was achieved in 5 FMDV/O/UKG isolates and the type O FMDV from the serotype panel except for the 5' genome termini and region immediately flanking the poly(C) region. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a universal WGS method for FMDV and other polyadenylated RNA viruses. This method works successfully with a limited amount of starting material and eliminates the need for genome-specific PCR amplification. This protocol has the potential to generate consensus-level sequences within a routine high-throughput diagnostic environment.",,"Logan, G.;Freimanis, G. L.;King, D.

1234,Unbiased characterization of Anopheles mosquito blood meals by targeted high-throughput sequencing,"Understanding mosquito host choice is important to assess vector competence or identify disease reservoirs. Unfortunately, the availability of an unbiased method for comprehensively assessing the composition of insect blood meals is very limited, as most current molecular assays only test for the presence of a few preselected species. These approaches also have a limited ability to identify the presence of multiple mammalian hosts in a single blood meal. Here we describe a novel high-throughput sequencing method that allows the simultaneous analysis of 96 mosquitoes and provides a comprehensive and quantitative perspective on the composition of each blood meal. We have validated in silico that universal primers targeting the mammalian mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA) should amplify greater than 95% of the mammalian 16S rRNA sequences present in the NCBI nucleotide database. We applied this method to 442 female Anopheles punctulatus sl mosquitoes collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG). While human (52.9%), dog (15.8%) and pig (29.2%) were the most frequently identified hosts in our study, we also detected DNA from mice, a marsupial species and two bat species. Our analyzes also revealed that 16.3% of mosquitoes fed on more than one host. Analysis of human mitochondrial hypervariable region I in 102 human blood meals showed that 5 (4.9%) of the mosquitoes clearly fed on more than one individual. Overall, the analysis of PNG mosquitoes illustrates the potential of this approach to identify unexpected hosts and characterize mixed blood meals, and shows how this approach can be adapted to assess inter-individual differences between human blood meals. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to any disease-transmitting arthropod and easily adapted to study non-mammalian host sources.",,"Logue, K.;Keven, J. B.;Cannon, M.

The occurrence of PiCV infections in pigeons (Columba livia) has been documented worldwide over the last 20 years; However, there have not yet been any reports of PiCV detection in Brazil. This study identifies seven PiCV genomes obtained from domestic pigeons from southern Brazil by high-throughput sequencing and demonstrates a high frequency of PiCV infection by real-time quantitative PCR. The phylogenetic classification was performed by maximum likelihood analysis of the complete genomes ORF V1 (Rep) and ORF C1 (Cap). Results show that either full genome or Cap-based analysis allowed PiCV classification into five major clades (groups A to E), with Brazilian sequences classified as A, C, or D.

Similar to all avian influenza viruses, A/gull/Moscow/3100/2006 binds to Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal receptors, but in contrast to the duck viruses, it shows a higher affinity for fucosylated sialosugars (SLex), as shown in the receptor specificity assay and has been clarified for Modeling of uptake of SLex into the receptor-binding site of duck and gull influenza virus hemagglutinin.",,"Lomakina, N.

1240,Specificity of the antibody against the viral polymerase RD 114,"The use of antiserum against the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDP) of type C viruses has allowed these enzymes to be distinguished from cellular enzymes capable of using RNA templates for DNA synthesis. Such sera have also allowed some degree of subclassification of the viruses themselves and also discrimination between other RDP-containing viruses. Thus, within the type C family, viper, avian, and mammalian viruses are readily distinguished, while within the mammalian group, the polymerases of two recent primate isolates, woolly monkeys and gibbon monkeys, appear to be distinct from lower mammalian viruses. The newly described virus RD 114, which is currently being considered as a human candidate virus, could also be distinguished from viruses of lower mammals by polymerase inhibition tests. The main internal protein of the RD 114 virus differs from all other type C viruses both antigenically and because of a unique isoelectric point. In the absence of other criteria for species classification, it has been suggested that polymerase inhibition tests could provide evidence of a primate virus group that would hopefully include RD 114. If this were the case, it would provide strong circumstantial evidence for the human origin of RD 114. Experiments with a hyperimmune guinea pig antiserum raised against purified RD 114 RDP are described in this report. The RD 114 RDP appears to be more closely related to the RDP of two primate viruses than to the RDP of viruses from lower mammalian and non-mammalian species. The enzyme also differs from an RD cell activity that can use RNA templates.",,"Long, C.;Sachs, R.;Norvell, J.",1973.0,,,0

The virus has been tentatively classified as a member of the Picornaviridae family based on its physicochemical properties. Mink virus was not neutralized by antiserum against some known members of the calicivirus genus, which included nine serotypes of porcine virus vesicular rash, ten serotypes of San Miguel sea lion virus and feline calicivirus. Seroepidemiological studies showed that the incidence of mink virus infection was widespread in native mink populations.

1242,"Bacteria, phages and swine: The effects of in-feed antibiotics on the microbiome at different sites in the gut","Disruption of the beneficial microbial community in the gut is a potential side effect of antibiotics, which have many uses in animal husbandry (treating or preventing disease and improving feed efficiency). Understanding the effects of antibiotics on bacterial communities at different sites in the gut is critical to realizing the full benefits and consequences of antibiotics in feed. In this study, we defined the lumenal and mucosal bacterial communities from the small intestine (ileum) and large intestine (caecum and colon) plus feces and characterized the effect of antibiotics in the diet (chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine and penicillin (ASP250)) on these communities. 16S rRNA gene sequence and metagenomic analyzes of bacterial affiliation and functions revealed dramatic differences between small and large intestine localizations, including an enrichment of Firmicutes and phage-encoding genes in the ileum. The microbiota of the colon encoded numerous genes for breaking down components of the plant cell wall, and these genes were absent in the ileum. The mucosa-associated ileum microbiota harbored a greater bacterial diversity than the lumen but a similar affinity to the colon mucosa, suggesting that most gut microbes can associate with the mucosa and could serve as an inoculum for the lumen. Adverse effects on the microbiota of animals fed antibiotics differed from those of controls, with notable changes in the increase in ileal Escherichia coli populations, Lachnobacterium spp. in all intestinal localizations and resistance genes to non-administered antibiotics. Characterizing the different metabolic capacities and response to disturbances at different sites in the gut will inform strategies to improve gut health and food safety.",,"Looft, T.;Allen, H.

1244,Automated classification of tailed bacteriophages according to their neck organization,"Background: The genetic diversity observed in bacteriophages remains a major obstacle to homologue identification and comparison of their functional modules. Although several classes of homologous proteins contributing to head and tail structure can be identified, in structural module proteins of the head-to-tail junction (or neck) are generally more divergent. However, molecular analyzes of some tailed phages belonging to different morphological classes suggested that only a limited number of structural solutions are used to produce a functional virion. To challenge this hypothesis and analyze protein diversity at the virion neck, we developed a specific computational strategy to cope with sequence divergences in phage proteins. We searched for homologues of a set of proteins encoded in the structural module using a phage learning database. Results: We show that, using a combination of iterative profile-profile comparison and gene context analysis, we can identify a range of head, neck and tail proteins in most of the tail bacteriophages in our database. Classification of phages based on neck protein sequences describes 4 types corresponding to known morphological subfamilies. Further analysis of the most abundant Type 1 reveals 10 clusters characterized by consistent sets of head, neck, and tail proteins. We have developed Virfam, a web server that automatically identifies proteins of the phage head-neck-tail module and assigns phage to the closest related phage cluster. This server was tested against 624 new phages from the NCBI database. 93% of the tailed and unclassified phage could be assigned to our head-neck-tail based categories, underlining the high representativeness of the identified virion architectures. Types and clusters describe consistent subsets of Caudovirales that correlate with multiple virion properties. Conclusions: Our method and web server are able to automatically classify most tailed phages, recognize their structural module, assign a function to a set of their head, neck, and tail genes, provide their morphological subtype, and classify these phages within a "" It should allow the analysis of large sets of phage genomes. In particular, it should contribute to the classification of the numerous unknown viruses found on assembled contigs of metagenomic samples.",,"Lopes, A.;Tavares, P.;Petit, M.

1245,Mapping of the subset epitopes of the rotavirus protein VP6,"VP6, the most abundant protein of rotaviruses, contains epitopes that allow these viruses to be classified into four subgroups (SG) depending on the presence or absence of two epitopes called I and II. The subgroup-specific epitopes are conformational and appear trimeric but not monomeric VP6. We have identified some of the amino acids on VP6 that determine the reactivity of subgroup-specific mAbs 255/60 and 631/9. A single amino acid mutation at positions 172 (Met to Ala) or 305 (Asn to Ala) was sufficient to change the subgroup specificity of the human rotavirus Wa-VP6 protein from SGII to SGI/II, since each of these mutations alters the protein to be recognized by SGI mAb 255/60 while retaining its ability to interact with SGII mAb 631/9. In the case of the SGII epitope, mutation of two consecutive amino acids (Ala305 Asn306 to Asn305 Ala306) in the porcine rotavirus YM-VP6 protein (SGI) enabled the protein to be efficiently recognized by the SGII mAb 631/9, while simultaneously protecting the YM-VP6 protein to increase its ability to interact with mAb 255/60. These results suggest that both subset mAbs interact with an antigenic domain in VP6 consisting of at least two regions of the protein that, although distant in linear sequence, may be in close proximity in the VP6 structured trimer.",,"Lopez, S.;Espinosa, R.;Greenberg, H.

In October 2012 new outbreaks of BT were reported by BTV-1 and BTV-4. Almost 500 flocks were infected and 9238 sheep died from the infection. When sequenced, Seg-10 of both strains shared 99% similarity at the nucleotide level to BTV strains circulating in the Mediterranean basin in recent years. Similarly, the newly isolated Sardinian strains BTV-1 and BTV-4 have identical Seg-5 sequences and cluster together with the recently circulating Mediterranean basin BTV-1 and the BTV-4 strains isolated in Tunisia in 2007 and 2009.

The study of smallpox viruses continues to enrich the field of virology, as the worldwide eradication of smallpox provides a unique example of the effectiveness of effective immunization. Other poxviruses have since been developed as vaccine vectors for clinical and veterinary applications and include modified vaccinia virus strains such as modified vaccinia Ankara and NYVAC, as well as the avipox viruses, fowlpox virus and canarypox virus.

A further differentiation was possible by analysis of sequence data from the E2 region. The three sequencing-based methods were compared to monoclonal antibody (MAb) typing and restricted restriction enzyme (RE) mapping. Although both the MAb and RE methods confirmed the previous classification, the resolution was worse. We estimated an approximate rate of evolution for CSFV from an analysis of viral variation observed in a single geographic area over a 6-year period. Applying this proposed rate to each of our derived CSFV subgroups allowed us to calculate the approximate drift dates for each subgroup.",,"Lowings, P.;Ibata, G.;Needham, J.;Paton, D.",1996.0,,,0
1250,Evaluation of a monoclonal antibody panel for lyssavirus typing in Mexico,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a panel of eight antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies developed in Europe to identify different strains of rabies virus isolated from a variety of animal species from different geographical areas in Mexico. Fifty-one virus-positive brain tissue samples from various animal species and humans were examined. Material from these samples was used to infect mice whose brains were later probed by indirect immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibodies described above. Virus strains showing antigenic variations were sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris for confirmation of the results. No mouse brain sample showed a pattern of antigenic reactivity indicative of the presence of Lyssavirus other than classical rabies virus. However, four antigenic variations of classical rabies serotype 1 have been identified. The antibody panel was judged useful for rapid classification of rabies virus in Mexico. It is possible that autochthonous antigenic variations exist among the strains circulating in this country, a scenario that could explain some of the errors observed with certain vaccines. For this reason there is a need for the production of antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies with strains of rabies virus native to this area.",,"Loza-Rubio, E.;Vargas, R.;HernÃ¡ndez, E.;Batalla, D.;Aguilar-SetiÃ©n, A.",1995.0,,,0

1252,In vitro and in vivo identification of structural and sequence elements in the 5' untranslated region of Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus required for internal initiation,"Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoPV) is a newly described insect virus classified as a putative member of the genus Iflavirus. The virus possesses a large, positive RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that shares physicochemical properties with those of its members of the Picornaviridae family. The 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) plays an important role in the initiation of picornavirus translation as it contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation. To study translation in EoPV, a wide range of mutations were engineered within the 5'-UTR and the effects of these changes were studied in vitro and in vivo using a bicistronic construct. Results showed that deletions within the first 63 nt had little effect on IRES activity while core IRES function was contained in stem loops C and D, as their removal significantly abolished IRES activity. In contrast to these findings, removal of Stem-Loop G, which contained two cryptic AUGs, caused a remarkable increase in IRES activity, which was further probed by site-directed mutagenesis at these two positions. It was also confirmed that initiation of protein synthesis occurs at AUG6 (position 391-394) and not at the AUG immediately downstream of the polypyrimidine tract. Polypyrimidine tract mutation (CCTTTC) had a slight impact on EoPV IRES activity. Furthermore, mutations in the RAAA motif resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in IRES activity in vitro, but these results were not supported by in vivo experiments. In summary, this study shows that the EoPV IRES element is unique, although it shares features with the type II IRES.",,"Lu, J.;Zhang, J. M.;Wang, X. C.;Jiang, H.;Liu, C. F.;Hu, Y. Y.",2006.0,Dec,,0
1253,Phylogenetic analysis of eight genes of H9N2 subtype influenza virus: A mainland China strain possessing the genes of early isolates that were circulating,"The H9N2 subtype influenza virus is widespread worldwide and in China. Previous studies showed that at least three sublineages had been established in terrestrial fowl of Eurasian birds. In this presentation, eight full-length genes from an H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (Ck/SH/F/98), were obtained. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies were performed by comparing eight genes to those of all available GenBank H9N2 strains. The results showed that four genes (HA, NA, M and NS genes) of Ck/SH/F/98 were incorporated into the sublineage carried by early mainland China strain Ck/BJ/1/ 94 is represented. However, the other four RNP genes of Ck/SH/F/98 did not show a close relationship with those of the three known sublineage viruses. Therefore, Ck/SH/F/98 was a natural reassortant between different sublineages. In addition, the comparison indicated that Ck/SH/F/98 could be a putative progenitor of a later isolate from southern China, Dk/ST/1605/01, with at least six genes from both being closely related, suggesting genes from Ck /SH indicates /F/98 and early isolates were ever in circulation. Further comparison in terms of molecular markers of species specificity of HA1 revealed that DK/ST/1605/01 also resembled Ck/SH/F/98 more than a common earlier duck strain. The results supported the idea of cross-transmission between terrestrial and aquatic birds, which emphasized the importance of raising concerns about the natural evolution of all eight genes of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Lu, J.

1254,Microbial community structure and functional gene diversity of turkey feces revealed by 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequences,"The main aim of this study was to better understand the microbial composition and functional genetic diversity associated with turkey faecal communities. To achieve this, 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic clone libraries from turkey fecal samples were sequenced. Analysis of 382 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the most abundant bacteria were closely related to Lactobacillales (47%), Bacillales (31%) and Clostridiales (11%). Actinomycetales, Enterobacteriales and Bacteroidales sequences were also identified but represented a smaller part of the community. Analysis of 379 metagenomic sequences showed that most clones were similar to bacterial protein sequences (58%). Bacteriophage (10%) and avian virus (3%) sequences were also represented. Of all metagenomic clones potentially encoding bacterial proteins, most Gram-positive low G+C bacterial proteins were similar, particularly from Lactobacillales (50%), Bacillales (11%) and Clostridiales (8%). Bioinformatic analyzes indicated the presence of genes encoding membrane proteins, lipoproteins, hydrolases and functional genes related to the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds.

Capable of rapid growth, disease resistance and high liver fat storage capacity, geese can easily be fed roughage. Here we sequence and analyze the whole genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it to that of terrestrial bird species. Results: A draft sequence of the entire goose genome was obtained by shotgun sequencing, and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics show that there are significant differences between the goose genome and that of other terrestrial bird species, particularly with respect to the major histocompatibility complex, myxovirus resistance, retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other genes associated with disease resistance in geese. In addition, analysis of transcriptome data reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in geese's susceptibility to fatty liver disease and associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low cholesterol levels. The results of this study indicate that the deletion of the Gänselep gene could be the result of positive selection, allowing the liver to take over energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration.

1257,Beyond the Whole Genome Consensus: Unraveling PRRSV Phylogogenesis Using Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies Review,"The highly heterogeneous Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of an economically important swine disease with the characteristic symptoms of reproductive losses in breeding sows and respiratory diseases in young piglets. The virus can be roughly divided into European and North American genotypes 1 and 2, respectively. In addition to this intra-strain variability, the influence of coexisting viral quasi-species on disease development has recently attracted much attention; This is largely due to the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Genomic data derived from the vast sequencing capabilities of NGS has enabled the study of PRRSV with unprecedented speed and detail. In contrast to traditional sequencing methods that require knowledge of conserved regions, NGS allows de novo assembly of the entire viral genome. Evolutionary variations derived from different genotypic strains provide valuable insight into functionally important regions of the virus. Along with the advancement of sophisticated bioinformatics tools, ultra-deep NGS technologies enable the detection of co-evolving low-frequency quasi-species.

The causative agent of this disease is the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Accumulating evidence suggests that microevolution within a coexisting quasispecies population can result in high sequence heterogeneity in PRRSV. RESULTS: We developed a pipeline based on the ultra-deep next generation sequencing approach to first construct the full genome of a European PRRSV strain Olot/9 cultured on macrophages and then the rare variants to collect data that are representative of the mixed quasispecies population. Olot/91 differs from the Lelystad reference strain by about 5% and a total of 88 variants were detected in the mixed population with a frequency of only 1%. These variants included 16 nonsynonymous variants focused on the genes encoding structural and nonstructural proteins; including glycoprotein 2a and 5.

We conducted a prospective study encompassing serological, antigenic and genetic aspects of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) infections in different animal husbandry systems in far north Cameroon to gain insight into the natural ecology of the virus. We found serological evidence of FMD infection in over 75% of the animals sampled, with no significant prevalence differences observed between the sampled groups (ie market, sedentary, transboundary and mobile). In addition, we found antibodies reactive against five of the seven FMDV serotypes (A, O, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) in the examined animals. Finally, we were able to genetically characterize viruses derived from clinical and subclinical FMD infections in Cameroon. Serotype O viruses grouped into two topotypes (West and East Africa). SAT2 viruses grouped with viruses from Central and North Africa, particularly within the sublineage that caused the major North African epidemic of 2012, suggesting a common origin for these viruses.

Bat infection was supported by relatively high EV-G concentrations of 1.1 × 106 RNA copies per gram of feces. All other bat viruses belonged to either the bat-associated genus Mischivirus or to an unclassified Picornaviridae group distantly related to the genus Sapelovirus. Members of this unclassified sapelovirus-related group had RNA secondary structures in their 3-inch untranslated regions that were typical of enteroviruses and resembled structures found in bat-associated coronaviruses, suggesting ancient recombination events. Based on sequence distances, several picornaviruses from European and Chinese bats were likely conspecific, suggesting connectivity of virus populations.

1263,Evolutionary relationships between parvoviruses: virus-host coevolution between autonomous primate parvoviruses and links between adeno-associated and avian parvoviruses,"The current classification of parvoviruses is based on virus host range and dependence on helper viruses, while little data is available on evolutionary relationships between viruses. We identified and analyzed 472 parvovirus sequences, including (almost) complete genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the Parvoviridae family. Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes and open reading frames distinguished three evolutionary groups of vertebrate parvoviruses: (i) human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 through 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) the bovine, chipmunk and autonomic primate parvoviruses, including human viruses B19 and V9; and (iii) the parvoviruses of rodents (other than chipmunks), carnivores and swine. Each of these three evolutionary groups could be further subdivided, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and multiple cross-species transmissions in parvovirus evolutionary history. No invertebrate parvoviruses clustered with vertebrate parvoviruses. Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among parvoviruses, the independent evolution of their genes, and recombination between rodent parvoviruses. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of autonomous human and simian parvoviruses closely matched the topology of the primate phylogenetic tree based on analysis of mitochondrial primate DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were evolutionarily associated not with other palmate parvoviruses but with the parvoviruses of birds.

1264,Evolutionary relationships between Astroviridae,"To study the evolutionary relationships between astroviruses, all available sequences for members of the family Astroviridae were collected. The phylogenetic analysis distinguished two ingrained groups: one comprised mammalian astroviruses, with ovine astroviruses being an outlier, and the other comprised avian astroviruses. All virus species as well as human astrovirus serotypes represented individual lineages within the family tree. All human viruses cluster together and separately from non-human viruses, arguing for their common evolutionary origin and against sustained animal-to-human transmission. The branching order of mammalian astroviruses was exactly opposite to that of their host species, suggesting at least two cross-species transmissions involving pigs, cats and humans, possibly through intermediate hosts. Analysis of synonymous (Ds) versus non-synonymous (Da) distances revealed that negative selection is dominant in astrovirus evolution, with Ds:Da ratios as high as 46 for the comparisons of the most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of all open reading frames (ORFs) based on Ds resulted in the loss of tree structures, with viral species—and even human astrovirus serotypes in ORF2—branching from virtually a single node, suggesting their ancient separation. The strong selection against nonsynonymous substitutions, the small number of which is therefore not evidence of a recent interlineage separation, together with the position of the oldest available human Astrovirus strain (1971) far from the common node of its serotype 4 , suggest that the intraserotype diversification is from an earlier date.",,"Lukashov, V.

1265,In silico identification of plant miRNAs in exosomes from mammalian breast milk—a small step forward?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting protein translation or by targeting mRNA cleavage. They play many important roles in living organism cells; However, knowledge of the functions of miRNAs has increased following their identification in biological fluids and recent reports on the abundance of miRNAs of plant origin in human plasma and serum. Taking these results into account, we performed a rigorous bioinformatics analysis of publicly available raw data from high-throughput sequencing studies on miRNA composition in human and porcine breast milk exosomes to identify the proportion of food-derived miRNAs. Multiple processing and filtering steps have been applied to increase accuracy and avoid false alarms. Through the above analysis, 35 and 17 miRNA species were identified, belonging to 25 and 11 MIR families, respectively. In the human samples, ath-miR166a, pab-miR951, ptc-miR472a, and bdi-miR168 were found with the highest frequency, while in the pig breast milk exosomes, zma-miR168a, zma-miR156a, and ath-miR166a were identified in the largest amounts. The consensus prediction and annotation of potential human targets for selected plant miRNAs suggest that the above molecules can interact with mRNAs encoding multiple transcription factors, protein receptors, transporters, and immune-related proteins, and thus potentially affect the human organism. Taken together, the presented analysis demonstrates the detection of abundant plant miRNAs in exosomes of mammalian breast milk, while pointing to the new opportunities arising from this discovery.",,"Lukasik, A.;Zielenkiewicz, P.",2014.0,Jun,,0
1266,Infectious bursal disease virus: growth and characterization in cell cultures,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was adapted to chick embryo bursal (CEB) and kidney (CEK) cells. The virus did not replicate in the kidney cells until 4 serial passages of the virus were performed in bursal cells. The virus produced plaques in CEK cells within 3 to 5 days. Virus replication was not altered by 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, suggesting that it is a ribovirus. Virus infectivity was not destroyed with chloroform and was stable at 56°C for 90 min. Virus adhered to the CEK cell monolayer maximally in 75 min and had an eclipse period of 9-10 hours before virus maturation and release. Immunofluorescence studies on infected cells showed that the first antigen was detected 6 hours after infection and all fluorescent antigen was restricted to the cytoplasm. All of these properties support the classification of IBDV into the diplornavirus group of riboviruses.",,"Lukert, P. D.;Davis, R. B.",1974.0,,10.2307/1589133,0
1267,Phylogenetic position of an uncharacterized Brazilian bovine papillomavirus strain in the genus Xipapillomavirus based on L1 open reading frame sequencing,"The use of degenerate primer PCR assays has suggested the existence of numerous as yet uncharacterized bovine papillomaviruses (BPV). Despite the endemic nature of BPV infections, identification of BPV types in Brazilian cattle is still sporadic. However, in a recent analysis of a partial segment of the L1 gene, we observed a remarkable diversity among the detected BPV types. The aim of this study was to determine the phylogenetic position of the previously identified wild strain BPV/BR-UEL2, recorded in the state of Paraná, Brazil. Because previous analysis of the partial L1 sequence had shown that this strain was most closely related to BPV type 4, genus-specific primers were designed. Phylogenetic analysis using complete L1 ORF sequences revealed that BPV/BR-UEL2 was related to BPV types classified in the genus Xipapillomavirus and the highest L1 nucleotide sequence similarity to BPV type 4 (78% ) showed. This finding suggests that BPV/BR-UEL2 should be classified as a potential new BPV type in the genus Xipapillomavirus. © 2010, Sociedade Brasileira de Genetica.",,"Lunardi, M.;Claus, M.

1268,Outbreak of acute bovine viral diarrhea in Brazilian cattle: Clinicopathologic findings and molecular characterization of a wild-type BVDV strain subtype 1b,"When bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) was first described in 1946, it was characterized as an acute communicable disease associated with severe leucopenia, high fever, depression, diarrhea, gastrointestinal erosion, and bleeding. Recently, the severe acute form has only been associated with some hypervirulent BVDV-2 strains. This article reports the detection of BVDV-1b associated with an acute and fatal outbreak of BVD in a Brazilian cattle herd. Depression, anorexia, watery diarrhoea, sialorrhea and weakness were observed in six steers. One of these animals was examined for laboratory, clinical and pathological changes. Laboratory findings were nonspecific; clinically the animal was weak, with dehydration and erosive oral lesions. Pathologic changes were predominant in the tongue, esophagus, and rumen. An RT-PCR assay using primers to partially amplify the 5 inch untranslated region (5-UTR) of the BVDV genome was performed and BVDV was identified in all clinical samples analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of lymph node-derived BVDV revealed that this strain was clustered within BVDV subtype 1b. This differentiation was only possible by molecular characterization since both the clinical presentation and the pathological findings of BVDV-2 infection were similar. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1269,Hierarchical molecular tagging to resolve long continuous sequences through massively parallel sequencing,"Here we demonstrate the use of short-read massive sequencing systems to actually achieve longer read lengths through hierarchical molecular tagging. We demonstrate how indexed and PCR-amplified targeted libraries are mined, subsampled, and paused at timed intervals to obtain pools of different average lengths, each of which is indexed with a new tag. Through this process, indices of sample origin, molecular origin, and degree of degradation are integrated to achieve a nested hierarchical structure that is later used in data processing to organize reads over a longer distance than the sequencing system originally allows. With this protocol, we show how continuous regions beyond 3000 bp can be decoded by an Illumina sequencing system, and we illustrate the potential applications by naming variants of the lambda genome, analyzing TP53 in cancer cell lines, and targeting a canine mitochondrial variable region .",,"Lundin, S.;Gruselius, J.;Nystedt, B.;Lexow, P.;KÃ¤ller, M.;Lundeberg, J.",2013.0,,,0

The S1 glycoprotein genes of these strains were sequenced and analyzed with 38 strains published in GenBank. S1 genes of these isolated strains and the vaccine strains showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 65.2 to 82% and amino acid homologies ranging from 58.4 to 81.9%. Meanwhile, in this study, isolated Chinese IBV strains that were mainly nephropathogenic could be divided into six distinct lineages (CH I-CH VI), and the vaccine strains currently used in China formed a mass variant lineage evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates is. In addition, CK/CH/GD/NC10, CK/CH/GD/KP10 and our earlier isolates TC07-2 formed the CH VI lineage, which showed greater evolutionary distances from other strains. Taken together, these results suggest that while different variants of lineages are now co-circulating in China and appear to be constantly evolving, alternative native vaccines are indeed needed for effective control of IB in China. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",,"Luo, H.;Qin, J.;Chen, F.;Xie, Q.;Bi, Y.;Cao, Y.;Xue, C.",2012.0,,10.1007/s11262-011-0657-x,0

1273,Pathogenicity and genomic characterization of a pseudorabies virus variant isolated from a Bartha-K61 vaccinated pig population in China,"Pseudorabies (PR) or Aujeszky's disease (AD), caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV), is an economically important viral disease worldwide. Recently, PR outbreaks occurred in a large number of Bartha-K61 vaccinated pig herds in many regions of China. Here we isolated a PRV variant called TJ strain from a Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig farm in China, assessed the pathogenicity of the TJ strain in susceptible animals, and analyzed its complete genomic sequence obtained by 454 pyrosequencing. Vaccination challenge experiments in sheep showed that the classic Bartha-K61 vaccine could not provide complete protection against challenge with the PRV-TJ strain. In mice, the 50% lethal dose (LD<inf>50</inf>) of the TJ strain (10<sup>2.3</sup> TCID<inf>50</inf>) was lower than that of the classic PRV SC strain (10<sup>3.0</sup> TCID<inf>50</inf>). In addition, the TJ strain showed higher mortality for pigs compared to the SC strain. The genome of the PRV-TJ strain was determined to be 143,642 bp in length and encodes 67 open reading frames. The TJ strain, along with some recent PRV isolates in China, was grouped into an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree, relatively remote from earlier PRV isolates. The TJ strain displayed unique variations in the viral proteins that play key roles in the viral replication cycle. Taken together, the TJ strain is a highly pathogenic PRV variant with unique molecular signatures. Further studies are needed to investigate the relevance of the sequence differences for the virulence change of the PRV variant.",,"Luo, Y.;Li, N.;Cong, X.;Wang, C.

1274,A molecular epidemiological study based on VP2 gene sequences shows that a novel genotype of infectious bursal disease virus is predominant in Italy,"characteristic infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus (ITA) genotype was detected in live IBD vaccinated broilers in Italy with no clinical signs of IBD. It was isolated in specific pathogen-free eggs and molecularly characterized in the hypervariable region of viral protein (VP) 2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that ITA strains were obtained separately from other homologous reference sequences from IBDVs, either classic or very virulent GenBank or previously reported in Italy, and from vaccine strains. The new genotype exhibits unique molecular features affecting charged or potentially glycosylated amino acids at key positions in the hypervariable region of VP2, which are practically linked to important changes in viral properties. The characterization of 41 IBDV strains detected in Italy between 2013 and 2014 showed that ITA appears in densely populated poultry areas of Italy, accounting for 68% of IBDV detections during routine diagnostic activities over a two-year period, despite the immunity induced accounts for large-scale vaccination. In addition, four very virulent strains (DV86) and one classic strain (HPR2) as well as eight vaccine strains were detected. The currently available epidemiological and clinical data do not allow determining the degree of pathogenicity of the ITA genotype. Only experimental in vivo pathogenicity studies, carried out under safe isolation conditions, through the assessment of clinical signs and macro/microscopic lesions, will definitively clarify the virulence of the new Italian genotype.",,"Lupini, C.;Giovanardi, D.;Pesente, P.;Bonci, M.;Felice, V.;Rossi, G.;Morandini, E.;Cecchinato, M.;Catelli, E.",2016.0,,10.1080/03079457.2016.1165792,0

Based on a multiple sequence alignment, several characteristic point mutations in the open reading frames of the Chinese isolates were detected. In addition, two deletions and one insertion were identified at the junctions of the unique short region and the terminal short repeat region in Chinese isolates, and the insertion was a feature of the new Chinese isolates. According to a phylogenetic analysis, the GaHV-2 genome has diverged significantly in China over the past two decades. Based on the long region of internal repeat, the new isolates were closely related to very virulent or very virulent plus strains. In addition, the new Chinese isolates differed from the previously isolated strains J-1 and 814. Taken together, our results provide evidence that Chinese GaHV-2 strains contain distinctive sequences, particularly the new isolates. The observed genetic divergence in the new Chinese GaHV-2 strains over the past two decades may be related to observed changes in pathogenic properties and virulence.",,"Lv, H.;Zhang, Y.;Sun, G.;Bao, K.;Gao, Y.;Qi, X.;Cui, H.;Wang, Y.;Li, K.;Gao, L.;Pan, Q.;Wang, X.;Liu, C.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.027,0
1277,Gene expression analysis of porcine whole blood cells infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus using high-throughput sequencing technology,"Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. FMD infects cloven-hoofed animals such as swine, sheep, goats, cattle and various wildlife species and remains a major threat to livestock industries worldwide. In this study, a transcriptome analysis of whole blood from pigs infected with FMD was performed using the paired-end Illumina sequencing technique to understand the interactions between the pathogen and its host cells. A total of 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during infection with FMDV, including 110 upregulated genes and 10 downregulated genes. To further investigate the DEGs involved in the interactions between the virus and its host, annotations to gene ontology (GO) and an enrichment of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed. GO annotation showed that a number of DEGs were enriched in categories involved in host-virus interactions such as B. Response to stimulus, immune system process and regulation of biological processes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly involved in ribosome signaling and immune-related signaling pathways. Ten DEGs, including the immune-related genes BTK1, C1QB, TIMD4 and CXCL10, were selected and validated by quantitative PCR, showing that the expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the results of in silico expression analysis. In conclusion, this study represents the first transcriptome analysis of FMD-infected porcine whole blood cells, and the results obtained in this study advance our understanding of FMD-host cell interactions and diagnosis and control of FMD.",,"Lv, J.;Ding, Y.;Liu, X.;Pan, L.;Zhang, Z.;Zhou, P.;Zhang, Y.;Hu, Y.",2018.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0200081,0

About 90 viruses have been isolated, including 24 new to science. Newly recognized infections in vertebrates, including humans, have been described. Many unusual epidemic situations have been analyzed. Constant efforts have been made to prevent bioterrorist activities and their consequences. Large-scale epidemic outbreaks of West Nile fever (WNF; ie fever caused by West Nile virus) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) with unusually high mortality have occurred in southern Russia over the past four years. We have determined infection rates in humans, domestic and wild animals, mosquitoes and ticks from natural and synanthropic communities [Editor's note: ""Synanthropic"" roughly means all species living with (cf. lice, fleas) or in the vicinity of humans , e.g. in houses (cf. house mice), parks (cf. Rattus spp.), and the like, more like ""peridomestic"" but not strictly so; ""Biocenosis"" is the biome, the ""entirety of living populations in a given habitat, which is itself only a part of the ecosystem"".]. CCHF virus strains were phylogenetically similar to strains isolated in this area 35 years ago, but differed from Central-South Asian and African strains. Before the start of the current outbreak of the WNF epidemic, three genetic variants of this virus had been isolated in the USSR, two African and one Indian. Phylogenetic analysis of full genome sequences of disease strains showed considerable similarity with strains from USA and Israel and differences with strains isolated 20-30 years ago in the same areas of USSR. In addition to the genotype 1 strains, we isolated second and third lineage strains and one strain of a fourth genetic variant.

Since raw materials of animal origin such as cells, trypsin and serum can be a major source for introducing virus contamination into biological products, we have studied PCV1 in several cell lines obtained from ATCC and widely applied in research, diagnostics or vaccine development. It is assumed that these cell lines were exposed to bovine and porcine viruses during their establishment and passage history due to the use of serum and trypsin that were not qualified according to current test guidelines or processed with new virus inactivation methods.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed on Coxsackie virus B5 (CVB5) isolated during this outbreak. METHODS: Five throat swab, 21 stool, and 14 CSF samples were collected from 29 hospitalized patients during this outbreak. Virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR were then performed for all samples. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A 16 (CA16) and pan-Enterovirus (PE) viral nucleic acids were detected by real-time RT-PCR. A phylogenetic tree based on complete VP1 sequences was constructed among CVB5 isolates from 2 stool and 3 CSF samples from 5 inpatients and other published data retrieved from GenBank. Results: The real-time RT-PCR results showed that the PE nucleic acid positive rates of throat swab, stool and CSF samples were 60.0% (3/5), 61.9% (13/21) and 85, 7% (12/14) were . All of these samples were negative for EV71 and CA16. The isolation rates of throat swab, stool, and CSF specimens were 20.0% (1/5), 25.0% (5/21), and 29.0% (4/14), respectively. BLAST with both VP1 and 5' UTR sequences and molecular typing showed that CVB5 was the major pathogen. Analysis among the 5 positive isolates based on the complete VP1 sequences showed 97.9%-99.5% homology. Data from homologous comparisons showed that these isolates had the highest nucleotide acid identity with the Changchun CVB5 CC10/10/Changchun strain (97.1% - 98.1%) that caused the 2010 Changchun outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease ( HFMD) and lower identity (89.0% - 89.6% and 91.8% - 92.5%) with strain COXB5/Henan/2010 and 03001N isolated from Pingdingshan, Henan in 2010 and 2012, respectively became. The pedigree in the VP1 region showed that isolates from this outbreak belonged to genotype D, the same clade as the Changchun strain.

1285,A nanoparticle-assisted sensitivity-enhancing PCR assay for the rapid detection and differentiation of wild-type pseudorabies virus and gene-deleted vaccine strains,"Nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) is a novel method for rapid amplification of DNA and has been adopted for virus detection due to its simplicity, rapidity, and specificity. A nanoPCR assay was developed to detect and differentiate wild-type and gene-deleted pseudorabies virus (PRV). Three primer pairs for nanoPCR designed in this study were selected from conserved regions of PRV and produced specific amplicons of 431.bp (gB), 316.bp (gE), and 202.bp (gG).

1286,Completion of sequence analysis and comparisons of genome segment 2 (encoding the outer capsid protein VP2) from representative isolates of the 24 bluetongue virus serotypes,"Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious, arthropod-borne viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants. It is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), a double-stranded (ds) RNA virus classified in the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. There are at least twenty-four BTV serotypes worldwide, five of which (1, 2, 4, 9 and 16) have recently been identified in Europe. BTV infects ruminants and its spread in temperate and tropical regions of the world depends on the activity and abundance of certain vector-competent Culicoides mosquito species. The BTV outer capsid protein VP2 is an important protective antigen and the primary determinant of virus serotype. For the first time, the authors have completed the sequence analysis of full-length VP2 genes from the reference strains of each of the 24 BTV serotypes and deduced their amino acid sequences. Multiple alignment of VP2 gene (protein) sequences revealed that the degree of nucleotide (amino acid) sequence variation between serotypes ranged from 29% (23%) to 59% (73%), confirming that Segment 2/VP2 most variable is BTV gene/protein. The phylogenetic analysis of VP2 grouped the BTV types known to serologically cross-react. Little identity between the types was demonstrated for specific regions within the VP2 amino acid sequences that have been shown to be antigenic and play a role in virus neutralization. The sequence data marks the completion of an important step in the creation of a comprehensive BTV sequence database that will support faster molecular methods for diagnosing and identifying BTV 'types', as well as continuing molecular epidemiology and surveillance studies of BTV.",,"Maan, S.;Maan, N.

1287,Development of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction based assays and sequencing for typing of European bluetongue virus strains and differential diagnosis of field and vaccine strains,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a double-stranded (ds) RNA virus belonging to the genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and causes bluetongue disease (BT), an infectious non-contagious disease in ruminants. The virus exists in 24 different serotypes that are currently being identified by virus isolation and serum neutralization assays. The most variable outer capsid protein VP2 (encoded by genome segment 2) is the primary determinant of the BTV serotype. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays based on segment 2 amplification were used to identify the five European BTV types (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4, BTV-9 and BTV - 16). Primer pairs specific to each BTV serotype were designed. The resulting RT-PCR assay was both sensitive and specific, providing BTV typing within 24 h. Perfect agreement was recorded between the RT-PCR and virus neutralization assays. The primers for each serotype were able to successfully amplify the BTV isolates of that serotype from different regions and showed no cross-amplification of the most closely related BTV serotypes. RT-PCR primers were also developed for distinguishing field and vaccine strains of BTV serotypes currently circulating in Europe. The primer pairs, capable of amplifying field and vaccine strains of BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4 and BTV-9, were validated with multiple isolates of each serotype from different geographic origins around the world and their type specificity was retested with the closest related serotypes. Overall, these RT-PCR assays provide a rapid and reliable method for identifying and differentiating field and vaccine strains of different BTV types. The primers used in this study are listed on the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright website.",,"Maan, S.;Maan, N. S.;Singh, K. P.;Samuel, A. R.;Mertens, P. P.",2004.0,Oct-Dec,,0
1288,Genome-wide identification and quantification of cis- and trans-regulated genes that respond to Marek's disease viral infection by analysis of allele-specific expression,"Marek's disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpesvirus. Selection for increased genetic resistance to MD is a control strategy that can enhance vaccine control measures. To identify MD resistance candidates with high confidence, we performed a genome-wide allele-specific expression (ASE) screen among F(1) offspring from two inbred chick lines that differ significantly in MD resistance. High-throughput sequencing was initially used to profile transcriptomes from pools of uninfected and infected individuals 4 days post-infection to identify all genes displaying ASE in response to MDV infection. RNA sequencing identified 22,655 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 5,360 in 3,773 genes showed a significant allelic imbalance. Illumina GoldenGate assays were then used to quantify regulatory variations controlled at the gene (cis) and elsewhere in the genome (trans) by measuring differences in expression between F(1) individuals and artificial F(1 )-RNA pools were examined over six time periods in 1,536 of the most significant SNPs identified by RNA sequencing. Allelic imbalance resulting from cis-regulatory changes was confirmed in 861 of the 1,233 GoldenGate assays successfully tested. In addition, we identified seven genes that show transregulation only in infected animals and ~500 SNPs that show a complex interaction between cis and transregulatory changes. Our results demonstrate that ASE analyzes are a powerful approach to identify regulatory variations responsible for differences in transcript abundance in genes underlying complex traits. And the genes with SNPs showing ASE provide a strong basis to further study the causative polymorphisms and genetic mechanisms for MD resistance. Finally, the methods used here to identify specific genes and SNPs have practical implications for applying marker-assisted selection to complex traits that are difficult to measure in agricultural species when expression differences are expected to control some of the phenotypic variance.",,"Maceachern, S.;Muir, W.

1289,"Potential strategies to combat bluetongue, an emerging global Culicoides-borne viral disease of ruminant and wild animals","Bluetongue (BT) is a non-zoonotic arboviral disease of certain wild and domestic even-toed ungulate species. The causative agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), is spread by mosquitoes of the genus Culicoides in temperate and tropical regions of the world. Control of BTV infection is complicated by the variety of virus serotypes and the ubiquity and opportunistic feeding behavior of its mosquito vector. The global distribution of BTV infection has changed recently, possibly due in part to climatic influences on mosquito species living in different regions. The aim of this review is to assess realistic strategies that could be employed to control or prevent future outbreaks of BT and other Culicoides-borne diseases. Importantly, optimal control of emerging, rapidly evolving arbovirus diseases such as BT will require integrated countermeasures that mitigate all aspects of the virus' transmission cycle. This is best achieved through preventative rather than purely reactive strategies. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Maclachlan, N. J.;Mayo, C. E.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.04.021,0

Viruses were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing of the genomic region encoding open reading frames 2-7. During the ongoing investigation of Danish isolates of PRRSV using nucleotide sequencing, RT-PCR reactions and subsequent nucleotide sequencing, the presence of American-type PRRSV in Danish breeding herds was revealed. Most likely, these atypical viruses originated from boars vaccinated with live American-type vaccine (MLV RespPRRS), taken to artificial insemination centers and placed there with unvaccinated boars already in the centres. The nucleotide sequences of three Danish viruses of the American type PRRSV were compared with those of known PRRSV isolates. The nucleotide sequence identities of the atypical Danish isolates were between 99.299.5% with the vaccine virus RespPRRS and 99.0-99.3% with VR2332, the parent virus of the vaccine virus. Phylogenetic analysis, which included American-type field isolates, supports the conclusion that the introduction of American-type PRRSV into Denmark was due to vaccine virus spread.",,"Madsen, K.

1291,New molecular mechanisms of virus-mediated carcinogenesis: oncogenic transformation of cells by the retroviral structural protein envelope,"RNA tumor viruses, classified as retroviruses, have been isolated and identified to induce tumors in a variety of animals, including chickens, mice, and rats, or even humans, over the last 100 years since the first report was made in 1908. The RNA tumor viruses have historically been divided into two groups, acute transforming RNA tumor viruses and non-acute RNA tumor viruses. Acutely transforming RNA tumor viruses are inherently replication defective and rapidly induce tumors by expressing the captured viral oncogenes from the cellular genome in host cells. The first oncogene derived from Rous sarcoma virus was the src non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which was identified as playing the significant role in signal transduction. On the other hand, non-acute RNA tumor viruses, which consist only of gag, pro, pol, and env regions but do not carry oncogenes, are replication competent and could activate the cellular proto-oncogenes by inserting the viral long terminal repeat close to the Proto-oncogenes to induce tumors with a long incubation period, termed promoter insertion. These molecular mechanisms have been hypothesized to induce tumors. Recently, however, several reports have described that the retroviral structural protein Envelope could directly induce tumors in vivo and transform cells in vitro. These are very unusual examples of native retroviral structural proteins with transformational potential. In this review, we review the history of oncogenic retrovirus research and summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by retrovirus envelope proteins.",,"Maeda, N.;Yoshikai, Y.",2007.0,,10.2222/jsv.57.159,0

Here we provide serological and virological evidence of infection in various household animals in Bali, Indonesia in 2005 and 2006. Serum and swab samples from poultry, pigs, dogs and cats were collected using a stratified random sampling design. Antibodies to HPAIV-H5 were detected in sera using the standard haemagglutination inhibition assay and the presence of HPAIV-H5N1 in swabs was confirmed using an egg inoculation technique, haemagglutination assay and molecular methods. Phylogeny and virus distribution were inferred using BEAST and SPREAD software. Results showed that seroprevalence varied significantly (P<0.001) from village chickens to waterfowl, from poultry to pigs, and in the provincial study year. The seroprevalences in dogs and cats were 1.85% and 7.50%, respectively. In addition, HPAIV-H5N1 has been isolated from all species except cats. Isolation rates varied between species and also between monitoring years. Virus spread analysis showed that isolates from Bali were divided into two main groups with good statistical support.

1296,Introduction and history of foot and mouth disease virus,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been recognized as a major epidemic disease threatening the cattle industry since the 16th century and was shown in the late 19th century by Loeffler and Frosch to be caused by a submicroscopic, filterable transmissible pathogen . smaller than all known bacteria. The foot-and-mouth disease pathogen was thus the first vertebrate virus to be detected from plants shortly after the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus. It was not until 1920 that Waldmann and Pape established a convenient animal model for the study of FMD virus using guinea pigs, and with the later development of in vitro cell culture systems for the virus, the chemical and physical properties of FMD virus were studied throughout the remainder of the 20th Century elucidated, culminating in 1989 with a complete description of the three-dimensional structure of the virion. FMD virus is classified as a species in the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae. The virus is acid labile and the genome RNA contains a characteristic polyC stretch located about 360 nucleotides from the 5' end. Seven main serotypes and numerous subtypes exist worldwide. The World Reference Laboratory for FMD is based in Pirbright, Surrey, UK and monitors FMD epidemics by both serotyping and genotyping isolates of the virus. A major FMD epidemic occurred in the UK in 2001 and was caused by a virulent strain of FMD virus originating in Asia.

Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity of two of their surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. All bird flu viruses are type A viruses. While most avian influenza viruses are avirulent, viruses of a limited number of subtypes cause severe disease in birds. This difference in pathogenicity between avian influenza viruses is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence at the viral hemagglutinin cleavage site. Since 1997 there have been several reports of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Acquiring the ability to cause human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses will confront the human population with a pandemic influenza crisis.

This study examined cellular miRNA expression profiles acting in response to influenza virus at an early stage of infection, which could be useful for understanding and controlling viral infection. A549 cells were infected with different subtypes of influenza virus (pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). After 24 h post-infection, miRNAs were extracted and then used to construct a DNA library. All DNA libraries with different indices were pooled at the same concentration, followed by high-throughput sequencing based on the MiSeq platform. The miRNAs were identified and counted from the sequencing data using the MiSeq reporter software. The miRNAs expressions were classified into upregulated and downregulated miRNAs compared to those in uninfected cells. Most often, each subtype of influenza A virus elicited the upregulated responses in miRNA expression profiles. Hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-23b and hsa-miR-30e* were upregulated when infected with all three influenza A virus subtypes. The results of the target prediction showed that viral infection can trigger genes in cellular processes, metabolic processes, developmental processes and biological regulation. This study provided some insight into cellular miRNA profiling in response to different subtypes of influenza A viruses that are circulating and have caused outbreaks in the human population. The regulated miRNAs could be involved in virus-host interaction or host defense mechanism, which should be studied for effective antiviral therapeutic interventions.",,"Makkoch, J.;Poomipak, W.;Saengchoowong, S.;Khongnomnan, K.;Praianantathavorn, K.;Jinato, T.;Poovorawan, Y.;Payungporn, S.",2016.0,Feb,,0

Reverse line blot or traditional sequencing approaches have drawbacks in studying 18S rRNA diversity, and a next-generation 454 sequencing approach has been explored. The 18S rRNA gene was amplified using RLB primers coupled to 96 unique sequence identifiers (MIDs). Theileria positive specimens from African buffalo (672) and southern African cattle (480) were combined in batches of 96 and sequenced using the GS Junior 454 sequencer to generate 825711 informative sequences. Sequences were extracted based on MIDs and analyzed to identify Theileria genotypes. Genotypes observed in buffalo and cattle were confirmed in the current study, while no new genotypes were discovered. Genotypes showed specific geographic distributions, most likely associated with vector distributions. The host specificity of buffalo and bovine specific genotypes has been confirmed and prevalence data and relative parasitemia trends indicate a preference for different hosts. Mixed infections are common in African buffalo, which carry more genotypes compared to cattle. Associative or exclusive co-infection profiles were observed between genotypes, which may have implications for speciation and systematics: in particular, that there may be more Theileria species in cattle and buffalo than currently thought. Analysis of the primers used for Theileria parva diagnostics shows that no new genotypes are amplified by the current primer sets, confirming their specificity. T. parva SNP variants residing in the hypervariable region of 18S rRNA have been confirmed. A next-generation sequencing approach is useful to obtain comprehensive knowledge of 18S rRNA diversity and prevalence for Theileria, allowing for the evaluation of systematic and diagnostic assays based on the 18S gene.",,"Mans, B.

Many TSE agents are found in the environment, with infection controlled by public health measures. These include the disappearance of kuru with the end of ritual cannibalism, the dramatic reduction in epidemic bovine encephalopathy (BSE) from the removal of contaminated feed, and the absence of endemic scrapie in geographically isolated Australian sheep with susceptible PrP genotypes. While the modeling of prion proteins has generated an intense focus on common modes of protein misfolding and amyloid formation in various organisms and diseases, the biological properties of infectious TSE agents and their recognition by the host as foreign bodies raise several fundamental new directions for fruitful investigations such as: ( 1) unrecognized microbial agents in the environmental metagenome that can cause latent neurodegenerative diseases, (2) the evolutionary social and protective functions of various amyloid proteins in diverse organisms from bacteria to mammals, and (3) amyloid formation as a benefit of innate immune responses to stress (infectious and non-infectious ).

1311,Development of RT-qPCR assays for the specific identification of two major genotypes of infectious avian bronchitis virus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus, Coronaviridae) is a genetically variable RNA virus (27.6 kb) that causes one of the most intractable respiratory diseases in poultry. The virus is divided into genotypes with different epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. The present study reports on the development and validation of specific RT-qPCR assays for the detection of two important IBV genotypes: South America I (SAI) and Asia/South America II (A/SAII). The SAI genotype is an exclusive and widespread South American lineage, while the A/SAII genotype is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Both identification assays use TaqMan probes that hybridize to unique sequences in the spike glycoprotein gene. The assays successfully detected all assessed strains belonging to both genotypes and demonstrated high specificity and lack of cross-reactivity. Using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, we obtained acceptable detection coefficients, PCR efficiencies, and relatively low intra- and inter-assay variability. The assays showed a wide dynamic range between 101-107 and 102-107 RNA copies/reaction for SAI and A/SAII strains, respectively. The ability to characterize large numbers of samples quickly, sensitively and reproducibly makes these techniques suitable tools for routine testing, IBV control and epidemiological research in poultry.",,"Marandino, A.;TomÃ¡s, G.;HernÃ¡ndez, M.;Panzera, Y.;Craig, M.

1312,Whole genome characterization of Uruguayan strains of infectious avian bronchitis virus reveal extensive recombination between the two major South American lineages,"Infectious bronchitis virus (gammacoronavirus, Coronaviridae) is a genetically variable RNA virus that causes one of the most intractable respiratory diseases in poultry. The virus is divided into genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been widespread in South America for decades. GI-11 is an exclusive South American line, while the GI-16 line is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Here we obtained the entire genome of two Uruguayan strains of the GI-11 and GI-16 lines using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The strains sequenced here are the first to be obtained for the infectious bronchitis virus in South America and provide new insights into the origin, distribution and evolution of viral variants. The full genomes of the GI-11 and GI-16 strains are 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and share the same genomic organization. The phylogenetic mismatch analysis shows that both strains share a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Eurasian strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that retained the full S1 sequences of the parent lines but are extremely similar in the rest of their genomes. These recombinant viruses have been extremely successful and have existed for several years on the continent with a notoriously wide geographic distribution. Our results demonstrate unique viral dynamics and emphasize the importance of full genomic characterization to understand the emergence and evolutionary history of viral variants.",,"Marandino, A.;TomÃ¡s, G.;Panzera, Y.;Greif, G.;Parodi-Talice, A.;HernÃ¡ndez, M.;Techera, C.;HernÃ¡ndez, D.;PÃ©rez, R.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.07.009,0
1313,"A novel approach to study host-pathogen interactions in bovine digital dermatitis, a model of complex polymicrobial infection","BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial infections pose a major challenge for elucidating disease etiology and developing comprehensive diagnostic or therapeutic tools, especially for fastidious and difficult-to-cultivate bacteria. Using bovine digital dermatitis (DD) as a disease model, we present a new strategy to study the pathogenesis of complex infections. RESULTS: The strategy combines meta-transcriptomics with high-density peptide microarray technology to search for in vivo expressed microbial genes and host antibody response at the site of infection. Bacterial expression patterns supported the assumption that treponemes were the main DD pathogens, but also indicated the active involvement of other phyla (mainly Bacteroidetes). Bacterial genes involved in chemotaxis, flagellar synthesis, and protection from oxidative and acidic stress were among the major factors defining the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary diversity observed in bacterial expression, antigens and host antibody responses between individual cows suggested microbial variability as a hallmark of DD. Persistence of infection and DD reinfection in the same individual is common; Therefore, high microbial diversity may undermine the host's ability to mount an efficient immune response and maintain immunological memory against DD. The common antigenic markers identified here using a high-density peptide microarray address this issue and may be useful for future preventive measures against DD.",,"Marcatili, P.;Nielsen, M.

1316,A highly virulent infectious Bursa disease virus genotype predominantly associated with recurrent outbreaks of infectious Bursa disease in Tunisian vaccinated herds,"Outbreaks of infectious bursal disease (IBD) continue to plague the Tunisian poultry industry, even in flocks where the vaccination program is strictly applied. To characterize the viruses that evade protection by vaccination, field isolates of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) from vaccinated flocks that have experienced repeated episodes of IBDV outbreaks were isolated from bursal specimens by reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction and dideoxynucleotide sequencing , analyzes VP2 hypervariable region. Although sequence data was obtained from samples collected from three different flocks over a 3 year period, only limited variation in sequence was observed. The few nucleotide changes were silent and the deduced amino acid sequences were identical. Thus, the virus population predominant in the field appears to represent a homogeneous antigen pool. When compared to the VP2 sequences of several IBDV strains, this predominant pool was found to be closely related to the very virulent (vv) IBDV viruses described in Europe and Asia. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the precursor polyprotein coding sequence of a representative Tunisian isolate further confirmed its assignment to the vv genotype. The deduced amino acid sequence of the entire polyprotein of the Tunisian isolate was found to be identical to a South Korean IBDV strain. Alignment of the polyprotein amino acid sequence of 35 IBDV strains identified additional mutations outside of the VP2 variable domain that are common in vv strains. Based on this comparative analysis, the set of amino acid residues that should represent a typical vv profile includes Ala222, Ile242, Ile256, Ile294, Leu451, Tyr680, N685, Ser715, Asp751, Val990, and Ala1005.

1319,When African swine fever plays at home - description of an outbreak in Namibia,"Introduction - African swine fever (ASF) is considered the most serious public health threat to the global swine industry and is caused by a complex linear double-stranded DNA virus (ASF virus, ASFV) that is currently classified as the only member of the family Asfarviridae. Objective - To describe an ASF outbreak that occurred in Namibia and was managed during the international collaboration there conducted by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Experimentale dell'Abruzzo e Molise ""G. Caporale"" (Teramo, Italy). Materials and Methods - The ASF outbreak occurred in Omaruru District (Namibia) and affected a small pig herd of about 100 pigs. The herd belonged to a hunting farm and was very close to a small slaughterhouse where warthogs had recently been slaughtered. Clinical symptoms appeared suddenly and affected pigs of different age groups. Two pigs were autopsied for diagnostic purposes: histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. Results - At autopsy, all pigs examined showed generalized hemorrhagic lesions. Predominantly new haemorrhages were observed microscopically, together with severe lymphocytolysis in all lymphoid tissues. Laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis of ASF. The outbreak was eventually resolved by rooting out. Discussion - In Africa, ASFV infection is strictly dependent on the ""sylvatic cycle"" involving warthogs and ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex. Transmission mechanisms from wild animals and domestic pigs are still unclear, but ticks most likely play a key role. Therefore, the ASF outbreak described here could represent the prototype of ASF in southern Africa. ASFV eradication does not appear to be achievable in this region and ASF control should focus on biosecurity measures. As in the present report, acute ASF usually occurs with very high morbidity and mortality, at least in previously unexposed pigs. On the contrary, subclinical and chronic infections are more common in endemic areas. Pathological findings are extremely useful to diagnose and counteract ASF. A number of hemorrhagic diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Anamnestic and epidemiological data prove to be helpful to properly approach the diagnostic process. Conclusions - The recent outbreak in Eastern Europe further confirms that ASF is a serious transboundary disease that is still negatively impacting the swine industry worldwide. The epidemiological and pathological features described herein are of diagnostic value and are important to promptly counteract the spread and economic impact of the disease.",,"Marruchella, G.;Maseke, M.;Scacchia, M.",2014.0,Dec,,0
1320,Phylogenetic analysis of rabies viruses from Sudan provides evidence for a viral clade with a unique molecular signature,"Rabies is endemic to Sudan and remains a continuing public health threat as transmission to humans is primarily through dogs. In addition, large-scale livestock losses occur every year, creating economic and social dilemmas. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 143 rabies viruses circulating in Sudan collected from 10 different animal species between 1992 and 2006. Partial nucleoprotein sequence data (400 bp) were obtained and compared to available African classical rabies virus (RABV) sequence data. isolated. The Sudanese sequences formed a discrete cluster within the Africa 1a group, including a small number of sequences that clustered with sequences from Ethiopian RABV. These latter sequences share an aspartic acid at position 106 (Asp106) with all other members of the Africa 1a group, in contrast to the remaining Sudanese strains which encode glutamic acid at this position (Glu106). In addition, as representatives of other African and European lineages have been assimilated, Glu106 is unique to Sudan, supporting the concept of a single distinct virus strain circulating in Sudan. The high sequence identity in all Sudanese isolates examined indicates the presence of a single rabies virus biotype for which the main reservoir is the domestic dog.

1327,Pestivirus infections at the interface between wild and domestic ruminants in the French Southern Alps,"In the alpine pasture, transmission between species has recently been implicated in the epidemiology of pestivirus infection. The aim of this study was to investigate pestivirus infections in wild and domestic ruminants sharing pastures in the southern French Alps. Animal sera were screened for pestivirus antibodies to the pestivirus NS3 protein by a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All 38 household stock tested were positive for pestivirus-specific antibodies. Individual seroprevalence reached 76.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: [74.2-78.8%]) of the 1383 sheep tested. In wild ruminants, 38.7% (95% CI: [33.8-43.9%]) of the 369 chamois tested, 28.7% (95% CI: [17.4-38.1%]) of the 72 Roe deer and 22.2% (95% CI: [6.5-37.9%]) of the 27 mouflon were seropositive. Virus screening was performed on spleen samples from hunted wild animals (.n=.160) and from 15 domestic ruminants (clinically suspected persistently infected animals) by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Three pestivirus strains were isolated from the RT-PCR positive sheep samples. The viruses were divided into the genotypes BDV-3, BDV-Tunisia and BDV-6. For the first time, a strain (strain RUPI-05) was isolated from an alpine chamois and clustered in the BDV-6 genotype, showing 92% identity in the 5'UTR region with the sheep isolate from the same area.

1328,Recombination in eukaryotic single-stranded DNA viruses,"Although single-stranded (ss)DNA viruses that infect humans and their domesticated animals do not generally cause major diseases, arthropod-borne ssDNAviruses of plants do, and as a result severely limit food production in most temperate regions of the world. In addition to the well-known ssDNA viruses that infect plants and animals, recent metagenomic studies of ssDNA molecules have revealed that a large number of other diverse ssDNA viruses also exist in almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses likely span the tree of life and they are likely important components of global ecosystems. Various lines of evidence indicate that a key evolutionary process during the generation of this global ssDNA viral diversity was likely genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination, and reassortment of genome components are known to occur within and between different ssDNA virus species, and we consider here the different roles that these different types of recombination can play, both in everyday biology and the longer-term evolution of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical, and selective factors underlying the patterns of genetic exchange detectable between the ssDNA viruses and discuss how all of these should be considered when considering the adaptive value of recombination during evolution of the ssDNA virus is assessed. © 2011 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Martin, D.

Cases of illness and clinical findings from September 2002 to April 2003 were collected and evaluated. BVDV antibodies were detected using indirect antibody ELISA. BVDV antigens were detected using antigen ELISA and immunofluorescence flow cytometry. The viruses isolated were classified as BVDV-2 using monoclonal antibodies and PCR. Results: Six cows and one heifer developed haemorrhagic enteritis. Two of these cows were euthanized and one cow died during the course of the disease. Six cows aborted or calved prematurely. In addition, four calves died and three calves born weak or suffering from severe diarrhea were euthanized. Two calves remained persistently infected. An infection of the herd with BVDV-2 was diagnosed as the cause of the disease. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results show that the herd was BVDV-2 naïve prior to infection.

1332,Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus isolates vary in their susceptibility to neutralization,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity affects the antigenic composition of PRRSV and may result in differences in susceptibility to neutralization between isolates. Susceptibility to neutralization could be an important characteristic of PRRSV isolates, since neutralization-resistant isolates are likely to pose a significant challenge to the development of vaccines that elicit broad protective immunity. However, little information is available to understand or categorize the viral neutralization phenotype of PRRSV isolates. Consequently, the main purpose of this study was to determine whether PRRSV isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization and whether they can be classified into different categories based on their neutralization phenotype. For this purpose, a panel of 39 PRRSV isolates and a panel of 30 hyperimmune monospecific sera were used in cross-neutralization assays. The results of this study demonstrate that PRRSV isolates vary in their neutralization susceptibility, and the k-means cluster system allowed the isolates to be classified into four distinct categories according to their neutralization phenotype: highly susceptible, susceptible, moderately susceptible, and neutralization-resistant. Further analyzes with two other clustering systems, which considered individual data for the classification of the isolates, confirmed that the classification by k-means is correct in most cases and only less stringent in a few cases. Sequences of GP3, GP4 and GP5 were analyzed but no correlation could be found between the sequence of previously identified neutralizing epitopes or the number of N-linked glycosylation sites in different proteins and the neutralization phenotype of the isolates. These data provide the first systematic assessment of the overall neutralization susceptibility of a panel of different PRRSV isolates. Isolate classification provides a useful tool to facilitate the systematic characterization of neutralizing antibody production elicited by new vaccine candidates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"MartÃ­nez-Lobo, F.

In this study, we report the genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis of a strain of human genotype G8P[14], RVA/Human-wt/HUN/182-02/2001/G8P[14]. The entire genome constellation (G8-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3) of this strain was crossed with another Hungarian zoonotic G8P[14] strain, RVA/Human-wt, shared /HUN/BP1062/2004/G8P[14], although phylogenetic analyzes indicated that the two rotaviruses likely had different progenitors. Overall, our results indicate that the human G8P[14] rotavirus previously detected in Hungary originated from independent zoonotic events. Further studies are needed to assess the public health risk associated with infection from different animal rotavirus strains.",,"Marton, S.;DÃ³rÃ³, R.;FehÃ©r, E.;ForrÃ³, B.;IhÃ¡sz, K.;Varga-Kugler, R.;Farkas, S.

1334,Characterization of H9N2 influenza A virus isolated from chicken products imported to Japan from China,"We characterized eleven H9N2 influenza A viruses isolated from chicken products imported from China. Genetically, they have been classified into six different genotypes, including five known genotypes and one new genotype. This suggested that such multiple genotypes of the H9N2 virus may already be widespread and have become endemic in China. Two isolates have amino acid substitutions conferring resistance to amantadine in the M2 region and this supported evidence that this mutation could be a result of the widespread use of amantadine to treat avian influenza in China. These results underscore the importance of surveillance of avian influenza virus in this region and quarantine of imported chicken products as potential sources of influenza virus introduction. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",,"Mase, M.;Eto, M.;K, I.

IBV isolated in Japan have been classified into six distinct groups by phylogenetic analysis based on the S2 gene. However, the classification based on the S2 gene of the IBV isolated in Japan differed for some of the strains from that obtained with our previous analysis of the S1 gene. This indicated that genetic recombination between virus strains classified into different genetic groups had occurred in poultry and that recombinant viruses might be epidemic in Japan.",,"Mase, M.;Inoue, T.;Yamaguchi, S.;Imada, T.",2009.0,,10.1292/jvms.71.287,0

In the deduced amino acid sequences of the fusion protein, the 5 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites and 10 cysteine residues were all conserved in the NDV examined in this study. The major epitopes involved in virus neutralization are conserved in most of the NDV strains isolated in Japan, with the exception of a few strains. No major antigenic differences were observed between representative strains of each genotype in Japan in the virus neutralization test. All chickens vaccinated with the B1 strain survived without clinical signs after challenge with 2 NDV strains isolated in Japan (Velogen strains, JP/Ibaraki/2000 and JP/Kagoshima/91) which have amino acid substitutions involved in virus neutralization in the F protein gene involved.",,"Mase, M.;Murayama, K.;Karino, A.;Inoue, T.",2011.0,,10.1292/jvms.10-0281,0
1338,Viral metagenomics shows that domestic pigs are a potential reservoir for Ndumu virus,"Background: The increasing demand for pork has led to a massive expansion of pig production in Uganda. This has led to increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can serve as a reservoir for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, the identification of potential zoonotic agents is important for public health surveillance. In this study, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method during routine general surveillance for African swine fever. Results. Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions of Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Of the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% were assigned to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, torque tenoviruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses have been identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% sequence identity with Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads were identical to the class Insecta, suggesting that these sequences are unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. Conclusions: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had previously only been isolated from Culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic agent, especially given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact. © 2012 Masembe et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Masembe, C.;Michuki, G.;Onyango, M.;Rumberia, C.;Norling, M.;Bishop, R.

The cycle of infection,"Studies based on low-stringency hybridizations of radiolabeled swinepoxvirus (SPV) DNA to Southern blots containing DNA from representative members of the genera Orthopoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, and Avipoxvirus and the Entomopoxvirus subfamily have revealed no DNA homology at this level of resolution. Antigenic relatedness between SPV and vaccinia was also analyzed using immunoprecipitations and showed little if any cross-reactivity. The growth characteristics of SPV in tissue culture were examined by light microscopy and revealed both delayed and different cytopathology from that of vaccinia virus. SPV causes foci in pig kidney cells that are not evident until at least 4 days after infection, while vaccinia rapidly forms plaques on these cells. The kinetics of SPV DNA accumulation, protein expression, and RNA transcription have been examined and indicate that each of these facets of the SPV growth cycle is also significantly retarded compared to vaccinia virus. Our data show that swinepoxvirus is unique from other poxviruses characterized to date and supports the classification of swinepoxvirus into a separate genus, suipoxvirus, within the poxvirus family.",,"Massung, R.

1340,Identification of novel bovine rotavirus strain G15P[14] group A from animal disease diarrhea of adult cows by de novo sequencing with a next-generation sequencer,"There are few reports describing diarrhea in adult cattle caused by group A rotavirus. Here we report the identification of a novel group A bovine rotavirus from diarrhea in adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected in an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decline in milk production in Japan in 2013. The extensive genomic analyzes of fecal samples by viral metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an unreported genotype combination G15P[14]. The genome constellation of this strain, namely RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14], was G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 represents VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Each gene segment of Tottori-SG was most closely related to group A rotaviruses of Japanese cattle, suggesting that Tottori-SG may originate from multiple reassortment events of group A rotavirus strains circulating among Japanese cattle. No other diarrheal pathogen in adult cattle was detected by routine diagnostics and metagenomics.

1341,Whole genome analysis of a novel picornavirus related to the enterovirus/sapelovirus supergroup from pig feces in Japan,"novel virus related to the enterovirus/sapelovirus supergroup in the family Picornaviridae was identified in healthy pig feces in Japan using a metagenomic approach. The genome of the virus, named Sapelo-like Porcine Picornavirus Japan (SPPVJ) Pig/Isi-Im1/JPN/2016, had an internal ribosomal type IV entry site and carried a 6978 nucleotide single open reading frame encoding a 2326 amino acid (aa) Polyprotein precursor. The coding sequence region consisted of leader protein (68 aa), a structural protein region P1 (824 aa), and non-structural protein regions P2 (672 aa) and P3 (762 aa). Among the representative picornaviruses, the P1, 2C and 3CD regions of SPPVJ had the highest aa identities of 64.4%, 61.9% and 73.3%, respectively, with the corresponding regions of the sapelo-like bat picornavirus BtVs -PicoV/SC2013. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from the 5'-untranslated and 3D regions revealed the presence of SPPVJ in 17.8% (19/107) of faeces from healthy pigs and pigs with diarrhea in 12 farms in the years 2015-2016.

1342,Genomic integration of the lambda EG10 transgene in gpt-delta transgenic rodents,"Background: Transgenic gpt-delta mouse and rat models have been developed to perform gpt and Spi assays for in vivo mutagenicity testing. The animals were established by integrating lambda EG10 phage DNA as a transgene into the genome. The inserted position of the transgene on the chromosome was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot analyses; however, the exact position and sequence of the inserted compound were not known. To identify the site and pattern of genomic integration of the transgene copies, genomic DNAs extracted from C57BL/6J gpt delta mice and F344 gpt delta rats were applied to whole genome sequencing and partnered pair analysis. Results: The result confirmed that multi-copy lambda EG10 transgenes are inserted at a single position in mouse chromosome 17. The junction contains 70 bp of overlapping genomic sequences and shares short homology at both ends. Copy number analysis suggested that the inserted transgenes might contain 41 head-to-tail junctions and 16 junctions of other types, such as rearranged abnormal junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be a maximum of about 40. In the F344 gpt delta rats, transgenes are inserted at a single position in rat chromosome 4. The junction contains no overlapping sequence, but a 72 kb genomic sequence, including a gene, has been deleted. The inserted transgenes may contain 15 head-to-tail junctions and two rearranged junctions. It has been suggested that the number of intact copies could be a maximum of 14. A germline base substitution in the gpt gene derived from gpt-delta rats has been characterized. Conclusions: The exact inserted positions of the lambda EG10 transgene in the genome of gpt-delta transgenic rodents have been identified. Transgene copy number and location were analyzed.

1343,A new duck circovirus sequence detected in the velvet duck (Melanitta fusca) supports the high diversity of this virus species,"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of circoviruses in wild bird populations in Poland. Circoviruses possess immunosuppressive properties and can affect the health of wild birds. Method: 83 birds belonging to 23 species were tested by wide-range nested PCR. The resulting PCR products were sequenced and new primers designed to analyze the full-length viral genome. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to find a relationship to known circoviruses. Results: The circovirus DNA sequence was found in 4 birds. All samples were from the velvet duck (Melanitta fusca), a sea duck from the subfamily Merginae. Birds that tested positive for the circovirus have been found dead in fishing nets off the Baltic Sea coast. At autopsy, the carcasses of two scoters showed only slight emaciation, while the other two birds appeared healthy. The full-length circovirus sequence obtained showed 1,988 nucleotides and the presence of typical features (ie Cap, Rep and ORF3). The nucleotide similarity with other duck circoviruses was 84 to 86%. Phylogenetic analysis of the full genome and cap gene showed that the new circovirus is related to known duck circoviruses, specifically to subtypes sometimes referred to as duck circovirus genotype 1 but not genotype 2. Conclusions: In In this study, we reported a new duck circovirus sequence detected in the velvet duck, a species of sea duck. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the novel virus sequence supports previous reports that duck circovirus (DuCV) is a species with a high degree of diversity. The virus sequence obtained from the velvet duck suggests that DuCV can infect birds from the Anatinae subfamily. Further studies are needed to prove whether the velvet duck and other sea ducks act as a reservoir for DuCV.",,"Matczuk, A. K.;Krawiec, M.;Wieliczko, A.",2015.0,,10.1186/s12985-015-0352-y,0

African horse disease virus (AHSV) B-cell epitopes have previously been mapped to VP2, VP5, VP7 and NS1 using mouse, rabbit and chicken monoclonal antibodies. A comprehensive study of the humoral immune response of five vaccinated horses to AHSV-4 antigenic peptides was performed. A fragmented genome phage display library was constructed that expresses a repertoire of AHSV-4 peptides spanning the entire genome. The library was affinity selected for binding to immobilized polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from horse serum collected before and after immunization with an attenuated monovalent AHSV-4 vaccine. The DNA insert-binding phage were sequenced using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Data were normalized using preimmune IgG selected sequences. More sequences have been assigned to the genes encoding NS3, VP6 and VP5 than to the other genes. However, VP2 and VP5 each had more antigenic regions than any of the other proteins. This study identified a number of epitopes to which the equine humoral immune system responds during immunization with AHSV-4.",,"Mathebula, E. M.;Faber, F.

1345,"The human parvovirus 4 ""PARV4"" remains elusive despite decades of studies","Human parvovirus 4 ('PARV4') is a small DNA tetraparvovirus that was first reported in 2005. In some populations, PARV4 infection is uncommon and evidence of exposure is found only in individuals with risk factors for parenteral infection associated with other blood-borne viruses. In other settings, seroprevalence studies suggest an endemic, age-associated transmission pattern, independent of specific risk factors. The clinical implications of PARV4 infection remain uncertain, but reported disease associations include influenza-like syndrome, encephalitis, accelerated HIV disease and hydrops fetalis. In this review, we aim to report progress updates from the recent literature, focusing on examining cohorts in different geographic settings, now including insights from Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and discussing whether attributes of virus or host populations are present underpin the striking differences in epidemiology. We review advances in understanding viral phylogeny and biology, diagnostic approaches, and insights that could be gained from studies of closely related animal pathogens. Critical questions about pathogenicity remain unanswered, but we highlight new evidence supporting a possible association between PARV4 and encephalitis syndrome. The unequivocal evidence that PARV4 is endemic in certain populations should fuel ongoing research efforts to understand risk factors and modes of transmission, and to provide new insights into the impact of this virus on human health.",,"Matthews, P.

1346,Complete genome-based classification of rotaviruses reveals a common origin between human wa-like and porcine rotavirus strains and human DS-1-like and bovine rotavirus strains,"The group A rotavirus classification is currently based on the molecular properties of the two outer layer proteins, VP7 and VP4, and the middle layer protein, VP6. Because the rearrangement of all 11 rotavirus gene segments plays a key role in generating rotavirus diversity in nature, a classification system based on all rotavirus gene segments is desirable to determine which genes control rotavirus restriction, replication, and virulence. affect the host range, such as for the study of rotavirus epidemiology and evolution. To establish such a classification system, gene sequences encoding VP1 to VP3, VP6 and NSP1 to NSP5 were determined for human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to different G and P genotypes in addition to those available in databases and they have been used to phylogenetically define relationships between all rotavirus genes. Based on these phylogenetic analyses, appropriate identity cutoff values were determined for each gene. For the VP4 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff of 80% fully correlated with the 27 established P genotypes. For the VP7 gene, an 80% nucleotide identity cutoff was broadly consistent with the established G genotypes, but identified four additional distinct genotypes consisting of murine or avian rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analyzes of genes VP1 to VP3, VP6 and NSP1 to NSP5 revealed the existence of 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 5, 7, 11 and 6 genotypes, respectively, based on nucleotide identity cutoff values of 83%, 84% , 81%, 85%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85% and 91%, respectively. In accordance with these data, a revised nomenclature of rotavirus strains is proposed. The novel classification system allows for the identification of (i) distinct genotypes that likely followed separate evolutionary paths; (ii) interspecies transmissions and a plethora of rearrangement events; and (iii) certain gene constellations showing (a) a common origin between human Wa-like rotavirus strains and porcine rotavirus strains and (b) a common origin between human DS-1-like rotavirus strains and bovine rotaviruses .

Several new genotypes were identified and genotype numbers assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group: R9 (VP1), C9 (VP2), N9 (NSP2), T12 (NSP3), E14 (NSP4), and H7 and H11 (NSP5). The L338 genotype constellation was unique: G13-P[18]-I6-R9-C9-M6-A6-N9-T12-E14-H11. The six remaining RVA horse strains showed a largely conserved genotype constellation: G3/G14-P[12]-I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7, which differs greatly from others not known -equine RVA genotype constellations. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that the sequences of these equine RVA strains are distantly related to non-equine RVA strains and that at least three lineages exist within equine RVA strains. A small number of reassortment events were observed. Interestingly, the three RVA strains from Argentina possessed the E12 genotype, while the three RVA strains from Ireland and South Africa possessed the E2 genotype. The unusual E12 genotype has previously only been described in Argentina among RVA strains collected from guanaco, cattle and horses, suggesting a geographic isolation of this NSP4 genotype.

1350,Investigating the molecular evolution and epidemiological relationships of Newcastle disease virus isolates from 1995 to 2016 in Iran,"In the case of Newcastle disease virus, it has been suggested that multiple factors such as host adaptation, evasion of the immune response, and selective pressure lead to the evolution of viruses and the emergence of genetic variants. Several studies on virus classification and global epidemiological relationships have provided consistent data. Here we conducted a molecular analysis study on circulating Newcastle disease viruses in Iran (1995-2016). According to evolutionary divergences, isolates of the subgenotypes VIg, VIj, VIIj, VIId, XIIIa and XIIId have been circulating in the country for 21 years. Based on data analysis, VIg isolates shared the highest sequence identity with Russian and Polish VIg subgenotype isolates, while VIj subgenotype isolates (2012) were most similar to a virus isolated in 2015 in India. Analysis of the evolutionary divergence of the VIIj subgenotype suggests that Chinese and Ukrainian viruses may have played a crucial role in the emergence of VIIj isolates. Studies on evolutionary differences also indicated that XIIIa isolates circulating in Iran may have caused the emergence of adapted variants of subgenotype XIIId. Therefore, we propose that the evolutionary and epidemiological study of virulent Newcastle disease viruses could help provide accurate molecular data on variants circulating in the region, thus aiding the development of more efficient recombinant vaccines.",,"Mayahi, V.;Esmaelizad, M.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3536-5,0

Vaccination is used worldwide to control MD, but increasingly virulent field strains can overcome this protection, necessitating the development of new vaccines. Previous studies showed that insertion of the reticuloendothelosis virus (REV) long terminal repeat (LTR) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of a highly virulent MDV strain, Md5, resulted in a recombinant virus, rMd5 REV-LTR BAC fully attenuated in maternal antibody-positive (Mab+) chickens at passage 40. In the current study, the protective efficacy of rMd5 REV-LTR BAC was evaluated. First, passage 70 was identified as being fully attenuated in maternal antibody-negative chickens and selected as the optimal passage level for use in protective studies. Second, three protective efficacy studies were conducted comparing the rMd5 REV-LTR p70 BAC to the CVI988/rispens vaccine. Groups of Mab+ and Mab 15I5-71 chickens were vaccinated in ovo 18 days after embryonation or intra-abdominal on the day of hatch and challenged with vv+MDV strain 686 5 days after hatch. Vaccination on the day of hatch and in ovo with rMd5 REV-LTR p70 BAC protected chickens from MDV-induced bursal and thymic atrophy but did not provide the same level of protection against MD tumors as provided by the commercial vaccine CVI988/rispens .",,"Mays, J.

To demonstrate the utility of such a resource, 870 single-stranded M13 clones from a shotgun library of the Salmonella typhi Ty2 genome were sequenced. The sequence reads over 400 bases on average and the genome was scanned at an average spacing of once every 5,000 bases. A total of 339,243 unique sequence bases were generated (about 7% representation). The sample of 870 sequences was compared to the full genome of Escherichia coli K-12 and the rest of the GenBank database, which can also be viewed as a collection of sequence samples. Despite the incomplete S. typhi data set, interesting categories could be easily identified. Sixteen percent of the sequences determined from S. typhi had close homologues among known Salmonella sequences (P < 1e-40 in BlastX or BlastN), reflecting the proportion of these genomes that had previously been sequenced; 277 sequences (32%) had no apparent orthologs in the complete E. coli K-12 genome (P > 1e-20), of which 155 sequences (18%) did not show high similarity to any sequence in the database (P > 1e -5). Eight of the 277 sequences shared similarities with genes in other strains of E. coli or plasmids, and six sequences showed evidence of new phage lysogens or sequence residues from phage integrations, including a member of the lambda family (P<1e-15). Twenty-three sample sequences had significantly greater similarity to a sequence in the database from organisms other than the E. coli/Salmonella clade (which includes Shigella and Citrobacter). These sequences are novel candidates for lateral transfer events on the S. typhi lineage or deletions on the E. coli K-12 lineage. Eleven putative junctions of insertion/deletion events greater than 100 bp were observed in the sample, indicating that well over 150 such events can distinguish S. typhi from E. coli K-12.

Unclassified sequences from CHO cells represented cellular sequences that have not yet been submitted to the databases typically used for sequence identification. The sensitivity of MPS-based virus detection corresponded to theoretically expected limits based on the dilution of virus in cellular nucleic acids. The capsid preparation increased the number of viral sequences detected. Potential viral sequences were detected in several samples; in each case, these sequences were either artificial or (based on additional studies) shown not to be associated with replication competent viruses. Virus-like sequences were more likely to be identified in BLAST searches using virus-specific databases that did not contain cellular sequences. Viral sequences detected included previously described retrovirus and retrovirus-like sequences in CHO, Vero, MDCK and High Five cells, as well as nodavirus and endogenous bracovirus sequences in High Five insect cells. Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus, Bovine Hocovirus, and Porcine Circovirus sequences have been detected in some reagents. A recently described Parvo-like virus present in some nucleic acid extraction resins was also identified in cells and extraction controls from some samples. The present study helps to illustrate the potential of MPS-based strategies in assessing the presence of viral nucleic acids in different sample types, including cell culture substrates and vaccines.",,"McClenahan, S.

1354,Disruption of cytokine networks by poxviruses - lessons from the myxoma virus,"Myxomavirus is an infectious poxvirus agent that induces a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. The disease is rapidly and uniformly fatal in susceptible rabbits and is characterized by generalized dysfunction in cellular immunity and multiple disruptions in the host cytokine network. Viral genes are classified as virulence factors because viral constructs carrying targeted gene disruptions induce attenuated disease symptoms. Many of these genes encode proteins that directly interact with effector elements of the host immune system. These immunosubversive viral proteins include secreted mimetics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these myxomavirus-encoded immunomodulator proteins are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERF-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue; and (5) T7, an interferon gamma receptor homologue. The origin of viral strategies designed to subvert immune regulation by host cytokines is considered in the context of myxomavirus biology in immunocompetent hosts.",,"McFadden, G.;Graham, K.;Ellison, K.;Barry, M.;Macen, J.;Schreiber, M.;Mossman, K.;Nash, P.;Lalani, A.;Everett, H.",1995.0,May,,0

These strains were compared to four strains (A, B, C, and D) circulating 25 years previously by sequencing the gene encoding the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. Analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the eight strains from New Zealand are genetically related, sharing more than 82.8% nucleotide and 79% amino acid homology within the S1 region. Strains T6, K43 and K87 were more than 99% homologous to previously described strains C and D. A fourth new strain (K32) was most closely related to the previously described B strain. The phylogenetic analysis of the tribes revealed that New Zealand tribes were more closely related to Australian than European or North American tribes. The New Zealand A strain shared 99.5% nucleotide and 98.7% amino acid homology with the Australian Vic S strain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S1 glycoprotein showed differences between strains that were generally consistent with virus neutralization patterns. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"McFarlane, R.;Verma, R.",2008.0,,10.1007/s11262-008-0273-6,0
1356,Tracing the origins of Louping III virus through molecular phylogenetic analysis,"The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Louping III (LI) virus isolates collected from representative regions of the British Isles and Norway were determined for either the entire envelope gene (20 isolates) or for a portion of the envelope gene encompassing a hypervariable Region and contains a LI virus specific marker sequence (53 isolates). Phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of three major geographic populations of LI virus in the British Isles viz. Irish, Welsh and British LI viruses, all of which cause encephalomyelitis in animals, mainly sheep, and are found in the same tick population. British LI virus is found throughout Scotland, England, Ireland and Norway. Irish and Welsh LI viruses are only found in Ireland and Wales respectively. Phylogenetic analysis also predicts that LI virus originated in Ireland and that a descendant was introduced into Britain via Wales and then transported to the borders of Scotland, from where it was spread throughout Scotland, northern England and Norway. British LI virus has recently been reintroduced to Ireland and also to the south-west of England. Lineage data calculated from the synonymous substitution rate indicate that LI virus appeared in the British Isles less than 800 years ago and most of the LI virus spread occurred in the last 300 years. By combining this data with historical records, it appears that livestock movements may be linked to the spread of LI virus.",,"McGuire, K.;Holmes, E. C.;Gao, G. F.;Reid, H. W.;Gould, E.

1357,Type-specific antigenicity of avian reoviruses,"The type specificity of the neutralizing activity in chicken antiserum against avian reoviruses was influenced by the method of antiserum preparation. The neutralizing activity produced in response to viral infection had a higher type specificity than that produced by immunization with inactivated virus emulsified in an adjuvant. Using reassortant viruses, it has been shown that induction of a type-specific neutralizing activity is associated with the virion protein Sigma C (sigmaC). An antigenic classification of virus strains based on immunoprecipitation of the sigmaC protein by chicken antiserum was attempted and the results were similar to those obtained by reciprocal serum neutralization tests. A one-way immunoprecipitation of sigmaC protein by antisera against some heterologous viruses, similar to that reported in reciprocal neutralization assays, complicated the assignment of individual viruses to serogroups and indicated that the type specificity of sigmaC protein was not absolute. The neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies against the sigmaC protein of the RAM1 strain of avian reovirus suggested that there were separate type- and group-specific antigenic domains on the sigmaC protein and that the group-specific domains might be associated with the induction of antibodies against heterologous viruses.",,"Meanger, J.;Wickramasinghe, R.;Enriquez, C.

1361,Molecular epidemiological study and phylogenetic analysis of bovine influenza D virus in Japan,"Influenza D virus, a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is predominantly found in cattle. Although viral pathology and clinical disease appear mild in cattle, this virus plays an important role as a causative agent of bovine respiratory disease (FRD). BRD is a costly disease worldwide. Therefore, epidemiological surveys of the influenza D virus are necessary. Here we conducted a molecular epidemiological study for influenza D virus in healthy and respiratory diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of cattle were infected with influenza D. The cattle with and without respiratory symptoms had approximately equal virus levels. A complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the influenza D virus isolated in Japan formed an individual cluster distinct from the strains found in other countries. These results suggest that this virus may have evolved uniquely in Japan over a long period of time and that the viral pathology of Japanese strains may differ from strains found in other countries.

1365,Potential of Newcastle disease genotype VII viruses to cause differential infections in chickens and ducks,"Newcastle disease (ND), caused by ND virus (NDV), is one of the most contagious and economically significant diseases affecting the poultry industry worldwide. While infections have been reported in a variety of bird species, the pathogenicity of virulent chicken NDV isolates in ducks remains elusive. In this study, two strains of NDV were isolated from an outbreak in chickens and apparently healthy ducks and characterized biologically and genetically. Pathogenicity assessment indices, including mean time of death (MDT), intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), and cleavage motifs in the fusion protein (F), indicated that both isolates were velogenic in nature. Interestingly, while these isolates exhibited pathogenic properties, they displayed differential pathogenicity in ducks. The chicken-derived isolate caused high (70%) mortality, while the duck-derived virus caused low (20%) mortality in 4-week-old ducks. Interestingly, both isolates showed comparable disease pathologies in chickens. Complete genome sequence analysis showed that the viral genome contains 15,192 nucleotides and exhibits features characteristic of velogenic NDV strains. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that both isolates clustered in class II and genotype VII. However, there were multiple mutations in the functionally important regions of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) proteins that may account for the differential pathogenicity of these viruses in ducks. Taken together, these results suggest that NDV strains with the same genotype show different pathogenicity in chickens and ducks. In addition, virulent NDVs derived from chickens are more pathogenic to ducks than viruses derived from ducks. These results suggest that chickens play a role in the development of viral pathogenicity and potential genetic resistance of ducks to avian viruses.",,"Meng, C.;Rehman, Z.

Molecular methods were used to classify tick species, using next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-based analysis to assess tick viromes from four representative sampling sites in the Greater Khingan Mountains. Five species of Ixodid ticks have been identified, including Ixodes persulcatus, Dermacentor nuttalli, Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis concinna.

1367,Deep sequencing reveals significant diversity between dominant variants and evolutionary dynamics of avian leukosis viruses in two infectious ecosystems,"BACKGROUND: As a typical retrovirus, the evolution of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) in different infectious ecosystems is uncharacterized, what we do know is that there is a cloud of different variants, namely quasi-species with considerable genetic diversity. This study aims to investigate the selection of infectious ecosystems for dominant variants and their evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J between DF1 cells and specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. High-throughput sequencing platforms offer an approach to more fully discern the diversity of quasi-species. RESULTS: An average of approximately 20,000 valid reads were obtained from two variable regions of the gp85 gene and the LTR-U3 region from each sample in different infectious ecosystems. The top 10 dominant variants among ALV-J from chicken plasma, DF1 cells and liver tumor were completely different. Also, there was a difference between Shannon entropy and global selection pressure values (Ï‰) in different infectious ecosystems. In the plasmas of two chickens, a large fraction of the quasispecies contained a 3-peptide ""LSD"" repeat insertion that was only less than 0.01% in DF1 cell culture supernatants. In parallel studies, the LTR-U3 region of chick plasma ALV-J showed more variants with mutations in its transcriptional regulatory elements than that from DF1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data taken together suggest that the molecular epidemiology based on isolated ALV-J in cell culture may not represent the true evolution of the virus in chicken flocks in the field. The biological significance of the ""LSD"" insert and mutations in LTR-U3 needs further investigation.",,"Meng, F.;Dong, X.;Hu, T.;Chang, S.;Fan, J.;Zhao, P.;Cui, Z.",2016.0,,,0
1368,Analysis of Avain Leukosis Virus Subgroup J quasispecies using Sanger and high-throughput sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Avian leukosis viruses subgroup J (ALV-J) exist as a complex mixture of distinct but closely related genomes, termed quasi-species, which are subject to continuous change according to the principles of Darwinian evolution. METHOD: The present study attempts to compare conventional Sanger sequencing with deep sequencing using the MiSeq platform to examine the quasi-species dynamics of ALV-J. RESULTS: The accuracy and reproducibility of MiSeq sequencing was determined better than Sanger sequencing by performing each experiment in duplicate. According to the mutation rate of a single position and the ability to distinguish dominant quasispecies with two sequencing methods, the conventional Sanger sequencing technique showed high randomness due to fewer sequencing samples, while deep sequencing could more accurately reflect the composition of the quasispecies. Meanwhile, exploration of quasi-species was simulated by Sanger sequencing and analyzed using a resampling strategy replacing 1000-fold repeats from high-throughput sequencing data that indicated that the higher the antibody titer, the higher the sequence entropy, the more rigorous analysis with conventional Sanger sequencing resulted in lower ratios of dominant variants. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, deep sequencing is better suited to comprehensively detect rare variants. The simulation of Sanger sequencing proposed here will also help to standardize quasi-species research under different selection pressures based on next-generation sequencing data.",,"Meng, F.;Dong, X.;Hu, T.;Liu, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Lv, Y.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.;Cui, Z.",2016.0,06 27,,0
1369,Characterization of subgroup Java leukosis virus isolated from native Chinese chickens,"Background: Although the purification of laying hens and broilers from avian leukemia virus (ALV) has achieved remarkable success, infection with ALV in native Chinese chickens has still been severe. Methods: To assess the epidemic status of avian leukosis virus in domestic chickens in China, 10 new strains of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J), named JS16JH01 to JS16JH10, were isolated and analyzed by virus isolation and immunofluorescence antibody assays from a Chinese local breeding farm with sporadic occurrence of tumors. To further understand their virological properties, the proviral genome of ENV-LTR was sequenced and compared to the reference strains. Results: The gp85 gene homology between the ten ALV-J strains and NX0101 ranged from 89.7-94.8% at the nuclear acid level. In addition, their gp85 genes were quite different, with 92-98% identities with themselves at the nuclear acid level. There were multiple snp and indel sites in the amino acid sequence of gp85 genes when compared to other reference strains of ALV. Interestingly, a new insertion in the gp85 region was found in two strains, JS16JH01 and JS16JH07 compared to NX0101 and HPRS-103. Discussion: At present, due to the large-scale purification of ALV in China, laying hens and broilers with ALV infection are rarely detected, but ALVs are still frequently detected in the native chickens, suggesting that more efforts should be made in purification of ALV from native ones chickens.",,"Meng, F.;Li, Q.;Zhang, Y.;Zhang, Z.;Tian, S.;Cui, Z.;Chang, S.;Zhao, P.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12985-018-0947-1,0

1371,Porcine hepatitis E virus: cross-species infection and risk in xenotransplantation,"Porcine hepatitis E virus (porcine HEV), a ubiquitous pathogen recently discovered in pigs, is antigenically and genetically closely related to human HEV. Swine HEV infection generally occurs in pigs at about 2-3 months of age, and about 80%-100% of pigs on commercial farms in the US were infected. Pig HEV infections have now been identified in pigs in many other countries around the world. Interspecies transmission has been documented because porcine HEV infects nonhuman primates and some human HEV strains infect pigs. Recent seroepidemiological studies have shown that pig veterinarians and other pig farmers are at higher risk of HEV infection compared to normal blood donors. In addition, new human HEV strains obtained from hepatitis patients in the United States, Japan and Taiwan are genetically more closely related to porcine HEV strains from the respective countries than to other human HEV strains. The ubiquitous nature of the virus in pigs and the demonstrated ability to infect across species raises a potential concern for porcine HEV infection in porcine organ xenotransplantation.

The cDNA clones representing the 3'-terminal genomic RNA of the virus were isolated and sequenced. The genome is a positive-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with an estimated size of 15 kb. Analysis of the resulting sequence identified three complete open reading frames (ORFs) with the potential to yield polypeptides with predicted M(r)s of 22.2K (ORF 5), 19.1K (ORF 6), and 13.6K (ORF 7) to encode. ORF 7, closest to the 3' end, is proposed to encode a highly basic nucleocapsid protein that shares 58% amino acid identity with the corresponding protein of Lelystad virus (LV), a European PRRSV isolate. ORFs 6 and 5, which precede ORF 7, are predicted to each encode proteins containing multiple hydrophobic domains that are thought to be membrane-associated. The VR 2385 ORF 6 protein is the most highly conserved structural protein. It shares 78% amino acid identity with the equivalent LV protein and ORF 5 shares only 54% of its amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3'-coterminally nested set of six subgenomic RNAs in VR 2385 virus-infected CRL 11171 cells. Our results show that VR 2385, like LV, is a member of the newly proposed group of arteriviruses. However, the striking genetic variation and difference in pathogenicity between LV and VR 2385 suggest that the viruses causing PRRS in the US and Europe are highly variable and may represent distinct genotypes.",,"Meng, X.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this classification of viruses and their impact on cell morphology. Healthy adult guinea pigs were studied. The spiral ganglion was serially sectioned and examined by electron microscopy. All spiral ganglia examined from several guinea pig populations of different breeds showed intracytoplasmic viruses in some granular spiral ganglion cells. According to their localization and morphology, these viruses are assigned to the group of oncorna viruses, which does not agree with the classification of other authors. Apparently there is a latent virus infection in guinea pigs worldwide. The accumulation of lysosomal-like vacuoles around the virus indicates increased local lysosomal activity of the infected ganglion cells.

1375,"Characterization of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from chicken, wildfowl, pigeon and quail in Mexico","Velogenic Newcastle disease has threatened the Mexican poultry industry since 1946. Seven strains of velogenic Newcastle disease virus were isolated from poultry and other bird species in central and northern Mexico from 1998 to 2006 and subjected to phylogenetic analysis and biological characterization using standard pathogenicity assays and Challenge underwent trials. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all velogenetic strains belonged to genetic group V and are clearly divided into two lineages, since the phylogenetic similarities between the groups are only 93-94%. The 1998-2001 isolates are closely related to the strain responsible for the 2000-year outbreak in the La Laguna region (Torreon strain) and are phylogenetically distinct from the viruses isolated between 2004-2006, which are genetically linked to the Chimalhuacan strain isolated in 1973. All viruses from both the Chimalhuacan and Torreon groups contained a virulent fusion protein cleavage site represented by the motif ""GGRRQKRF"", indicating that evolutionary changes occurred at a different site. The mean time to death of chick embryos was shorter for the Chimalhuacan-like virus (43.9 hours) compared to the 1998-2001 average (54.3 hours). The mean ICPI value was higher (1.92) for viruses isolated between 2004 and 2006 than for viruses isolated before 2001 (1.74). Microscopic evaluation of Fabricius' bursa and thymus of 5 w-o broilers challenged with 106 LD50/0.2 ml showed that the Chimalhuacan-like isolate had more severe lesions at 48 hpi in bursa and 72 and 96 hpi in thymus caused as a Torreon-like isolate. Together with the MDT, ICPI and microscopic results, our results suggest that some selective pressure on the highly virulent Chimalhuacan strain isolated in the early 1970s led to the emergence of the still velogenous but less virulent new group (Torreon-like) might have led to the mid-1990s. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media BV",,"Merino, R.;Villegas, H.;Quintana, J.

1376,Evaluation of phenotypic markers in full genome sequences of avian influenza isolates from California,"We evaluated phenotypic markers in full genome sequences of avian influenza isolates to identify avian strains with increased potential for transmission and pathogenicity in mammals. Of 149 markers examined, 67 were positive in the consensus sequences of 206 bird isolates. Analysis of deep sequencing data in a subset of 24 isolates revealed that 344 subpopulations occurred at marker positions. Markers in subpopulations were significantly more likely to be negative (258/344) than positive (86/344), but almost all marker-positive subpopulations (78/86) were associated with marker-negative consensus sequences. Our analysis revealed significant differences in key markers among avian isolates and indicated that consensus sequences do not fully reflect an isolate's potential for increased transmissibility and pathogenicity in mammals.",,"Mertens, E.;Dugan, V.

1377,"The first ""virus hunters""","The history of virology is a history of conceptual and technological inventions and breakthroughs. The development of filters made of porcelain or diatomaceous earth towards the end of the 19th century that retained bacteria made it possible to identify infectious agents that were smaller than bacteria and could not be cultivated on the bacterial culture media known at the time. Even finer-grained filters led to the observation that the invisible novel infectious agents are actually particulate in nature. Plant and animal infections were the first to be attributed to these tiny creatures. Detection was by experimental infection of the natural hosts (including humans). Thus, of the first 30 viruses identified, 20 are veterinary viruses, ie infectious agents of poultry and livestock. The discovery that bacteria also have viruses in the 1910s expanded the viral universe that continues to this day. Filterability and ultravisibility remained a hallmark of viral identification until the advent of the electron microscope in the late 1930s, marking another technological breakthrough in virology. Cell culture techniques allowed the virus to multiply outside of the infected organism. In recent decades, the emergence and development of molecular biology has fueled further innovations that result in the rapid and accurate determination of the genomic material of a wide variety of living things, including viruses, at a speed and depth previously unknown, using next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analyzes culminated. It is therefore not surprising that new viruses are constantly being discovered, including specimens of unprecedented size and shape.

1378,Transmission of influenza virus between species,"Influenza is an infection of humans and several animal species. It is caused by influenza viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Type A influenza viruses are the most important because they cause serious epidemics and are responsible for important pathological problems. Type A influenza viruses are divided into different subtypes depending on the nature of their surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The nature of the genome and mode of replication of influenza viruses explains the high variability of these two proteins responsible for immunity against the virus. The continuous occurrence of point mutations in the gene coding for the H protein leads to the progressive emergence of new virus strains. This event, known as antigenic drift, makes it necessary to review the composition of the human influenza vaccine annually. Genetic reassortment is another mechanism of antigenic variation. If the gene coding for the H protein, or if both genes coding for H and N proteins are involved in the genetic rearrangement, a new viral subtype emerges, replacing the precedent. This event, called the antigenic shift, occasionally occurs every 10 to 30 years and is responsible for the major human pandemics. The role of animals and in particular the importance of pigs and poultry in the emergence of these new viruses is discussed.",,"Meulemans, G.",1999.0,,,0

1380,Characterization of proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 of Lelystad virus,"The genome of Lelystad virus (LV), a positive-strand RNA virus, is 15 kb in length and contains 8 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative viral proteins. ORFs 2 through 7 were cloned into plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and translation of in vitro generated transcripts yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were grown in rabbits. Antisera were obtained which immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected lung alveolar macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and the porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a 15 kDa nucleocapsid protein (N), an 18 kDa unglycosylated membrane protein (M) and a 25 kDa glycosylated membrane protein (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6 and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, monkey hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.",,"Meulenberg, J.

A more detailed comparison of the isolates by restriction endonuclease mapping using HindIII and XhoI showed a close relationship between all the isolates and confirmed them as vaccinia viruses. However, some minor differences between isolates were noted, which turned out to be of epidemiological value. A panel of five closely related isolates contained a unique 4.0 kb HindIII fragment. In a Southern blot, this fragment did not hybridize to other vaccinia virus isolates, including the reference strain.",,"Meyer, H.;Schay, C.;Mahnel, H.;Pfeffer, M.",1999.0,,10.1007/s007050050520,0
1382,Comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions of African swine fever virus: Proposal for a new classification and molecular dating of the virus,"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly fatal disease of domestic swine caused by the only known DNA arbovirus. It was first described in Kenya in 1921 and since then many isolates have been collected worldwide. Although several phylogenetic studies have been conducted to understand the relationships between the isolates, molecular dating analyzes have not been performed to date. In this article, extensive phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using newly generated, publicly available sequences from hundreds of ASFV isolates over the past 70 years. The analyzes focused on the genes B646L, CP204L and E183L from 356, 251 and 123 isolates, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes were performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian coalescence methods. A new lineage-based nomenclature is proposed to denote 35 distinct clusters. In addition, dating of the ASFV origin was performed from the molecular datasets. To avoid bias, diversity due to positive selection or recombination events was neutralized. Molecular clock analyzes showed that the currently circulating ASFV strains evolved over 300 years, with a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in the early 18th century. © 2013 Michaud et al.",,"Michaud, V.;Randriamparany, T.;Albina, E.",2013.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0069662,0

1384,Rotavirus Vaccines: An Overview,"The development of rotavirus vaccines has focused on the oral route of administration of live attenuated rotavirus strains. The initial ""Jennerian"" approach with candidate bovine (RIT4237, WC3) or rhesus (RRV) rotavirus vaccines showed that these vaccines were safe, well tolerated and immunogenic, but induced very different levels of protection against rotavirus diarrhea. The goal of a rotavirus vaccine is to prevent serious diseases that can cause dehydration in infants and young children in both developed and developing countries. These studies led to the concept that a multivalent vaccine representing each of the four epidemiologically important VP7 serotypes may be required to induce protection in young infants, the target population for vaccination. Human-animal rotavirus reassortants whose gene encoding VP7 was derived from their human rotavirus parent but whose remaining genes were derived from the animal rotavirus parent were developed as vaccine candidates. The greatest experience with a multivalent vaccine to date has been gained with the quadrivalent preparation containing RRV (VP7 serotype 3) and human RRV reassortants of specificity VP7 serotypes 1, 2 and 4. Preliminary results from efficacy studies in the United States have been promising, while a study in Peru has shown limited protection. Human bovine reassortant vaccines, including a candidate containing the VP4 gene of a human rotavirus (VP4 serotype 1A), are also being investigated.",,"Midthun, K.;Kapikian, A. Z.",1996.0,,,0

Although these viruses have been repeatedly cultured from cattle egrets, seabirds and their ticks, attempts to classify them taxonomically using conventional serological and electron microscopy approaches have utterly failed. We used a random shotgun sequencing strategy to define the genomes of NYMV and MIDWV. Contigs of 11,631 and 11,752 nucleotides representing the complete NYMV genome and the nearly complete MIDWV genome, respectively, were assembled. Each viral genome was predicted to carry six open reading frames (ORFs). BLAST analysis showed that only two of the ORF proteins of each virus, the putative nucleocapsid and the polymerase, shared any detectable sequence similarity to known viral proteins. The phylogenetic analysis of these ORF proteins showed that the closest relatives of NYNV and MIDWV are negative-strand RNA viruses in the order Mononegavirales. Because of their very limited sequence similarity to known viruses, we propose that NYMV and MIDWV define a new genus, Nyavirus, in that order. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

1387,A first look at the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer,"Oxford Nanopore's third-generation single-molecule sequencing platform promises to reduce reagent and instrument costs. After a two-year hiatus from the initial announcement, the first devices were released as part of an Early Access program. We examine the performance of this platform by resequencing the genome of lambda phage and amplicon from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the MinION portable sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads are assigned to the reference, with less than an average of 10% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors or appears dissimilar to the original. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per matched read could be matched to the reference without soft truncation. Over the course of a 36 hour run on the MinION it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16x coverage. Significantly larger projects could not currently be implemented with the MinION. Without an increase in the fidelity required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current usefulness of the MinION seems limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory and is of similar complexity and cost to other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, although it will require a dramatic reduction in error rates before it delivers on its promises.",,"Mikheyev, A.

1389,Different interactions between isolates of peanut stunt cucumovirus and its satellite RNA,"The interactions of seven isolates of peanut stunt cucumovirus (PSV) originating from North America, Europe and Africa and two variants of PSV satellite RNA (sat RNA) were analyzed. Electrophoretic and immunoblot analysis of the Coat Protein (CP) and Northern blot hybridization analysis of the viral RNAs showed that isolates PSV F352, 1339 and 1507 belonged to subgroup I and isolates PSV W, Su and B to subgroup II. The seventh isolate , Robinia mosaic virus (RoMV), clustered with subgroup isolates by CP analysis, but was related to both subgroups by RNA hybridization analysis. The ability to support the accumulation of two newly described sat RNA variants, P4 and P6 sat RNAs, was unrelated to the classification of PSV isolates: neither PSV W nor RoMV were helper viruses for these PSV sat RNAs. Symptom modulation by both sat RNAs was the same: the presence of sat RNA did not modify the symptoms induced by subgroup I isolates, but exacerbated the symptoms induced by subgroup II isolates in both tobacco and cowpea. The sat RNAs P4 and P6 contained 393 nucleotides and differed only in three nucleotide substitutions. This resulted in marked differences in infectivity, level of accumulation, and relative encapsulation between the two sat RNAs. Accumulation levels and relative encapsulation of sat RNAs were also affected by the helper virus isolate.",,"MilitÃ£o, V.;Moreno, I.;RodrÃ­guez-Cerezo, E.;GarcÃ­a-Arenal, F.",1998.0,,,0
1390,Newcastle disease: evolution of genotypes and associated diagnostic challenges,"Since the discovery of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in 1926, nine class I virus genotypes and ten class II virus genotypes have been identified, representing a diverse and constantly evolving group of viruses. The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global animal diseases and the observed year-to-year changes in the genomic sequence of low and high virulence NDV suggest that different genotypes of NDV are evolving simultaneously in different geographic locations around the world. This tremendous genomic diversity may be favored by the wide variety of bird species susceptible to NDV infection and the availability of highly mobile wild bird reservoirs. The genomic diversity of NDV increases the possibility of diagnostic failures leading to unidentified infections. Constant epidemiological surveillance and proactive characterization of circulating strains are required to ensure that the immunological and PCR reagents are effective in identifying NDV circulating worldwide. For example, in the United States, the widely used real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) matrix gene test used to identify NDV frequently fails to detect low-virulence APMV-1 from aquatic birds, while the RRT-PCR Fusion genetic testing used to identify virulent isolates often fails to detect specific virulent NDV genotypes. A new matrix polymerase multiplex test has recently been developed that detects most viruses currently circulating worldwide and a modified fusion test to identify virulent pigeon viruses circulating in the US and Europe. For newly isolated viruses with unknown sequences, recently developed random priming sequencing methods need to be added to the diagnostic arsenal. In addition, the current system for classifying NDV into genotypes or lineages is inadequate. Here we review the molecular epidemiology and recent diagnostic problems related to viral evolution of NDV and explain why a new system based on objective criteria is needed to categorize genotypes.",,"Miller, P.

1391,Common evolutionary origin of hepatitis B virus and retroviruses,"Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been classified as a double-stranded DNA virus, it has recently been shown to replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. The putative viral polymerase was also found to share amino acid homology with retroviral reverse transcriptase. Using computational DNA and protein sequence analysis, we examined the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine humans, two ducks, one woodchuck, and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology with corresponding regions of the hepadnavirus genomes of type -C-retroviruses and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. In particular, the most highly conserved sequence of the HBV genome, positioned at or near the site of initiation for first strand HBV DNA synthesis, is over 67 nucleotides homologous to the U5 region, a comparable region in long terminal repeats of retroviruses. Within a highly conserved (ie, 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence, a heptanucleotide sequence CCTTGGG is 97% homologous between 27 virus isolates. In addition, we found that the highly conserved HBV core or nucleocapsid protein shares 41% homology over 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, as with the previously reported polymerase homology, HBV is most homologous to the murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses share a common evolutionary origin, with HBV arising by a deletion process from a retrovirus or retrovirus-like progenitor.",,"Miller, R.

RT-PCR had a 100-103 fold higher sensitivity than the dipstick. NGS using thirteen RT-PCR negative stool samples revealed that all samples gave RVA reads and in particular that two of them covered all 11 genome segments.

1395,Conservation of gene cassettes among different human intestinal viruses,"Viruses are a crucial part of the human microbiome, but large population sizes, high sequence diversity, and high abundance of new genes have hampered genome analysis by high-throughput sequencing. Here, we examine metagenomic assembly approaches to probe genome structure in a sample of 5.6 GB of viral gut DNA sequence from six individuals. Tests showed that a new pipeline based on the DeBruijn graph assembly delivered longer contigs that could recruit more reads than the corresponding unoptimized single-pass approach. To characterize gene content, the database of viral RefSeq proteins was compared to the assembled viral contigs, creating a bipartite diagram with functional cassettes linking viral contigs together, revealing a high degree of connectivity between different genomes at which multiple genes of the same functional class were involved. In a second step, open reading frames were grouped according to their co-occurrence on contigs in a database-independent manner, revealing conserved cassettes with co-oriented ORFs. These methods show that free-living bacteriophage, although they usually differ at the nucleotide level, often share significant similarity at the level of encoded amino acid motifs, gene order, and gene orientation. These results thus link contemporary metagenomic analysis with classical studies of bacteriophage genomic cassettes.

We determined EV-71 sequences at loci 1D (VP1 capsid protein) and 3CD (nonstructural proteins) in 86 strains derived from Austria, France and Germany and performed an evolutionary genetic study of existing virus populations. Phylogenetic analyzes positioned 78 of the 86 sequences within two clades under subgenogroups C1 and C2. A minor sequence cluster has been assigned to subgenogroup C4. Analyzes involving the available sequences estimated the substitution rate in genogroup C to be 3.66 × 10-3 and 4.46 × 10-3 substitutions per Year-1 site for loci 1D and 3CD, respectively, using a relaxed molecular clock model for sequence evolution was accepted.

Estimates of divergence times for site 3CD agreed with those measured for site 1D. The interconnectedness between clades representing EV-71 subgenogroups and clades corresponding to other enterovirus types (particularly early coxsackievirus A prototype strains) in 3CD phylogeny is a strong indication of ancestral recombination events. Incongruent phylogenetic patterns estimated for loci 1D and 3CD indicate that a single tree cannot model the epidemic history of circulating EV-71 populations.

1397,Genetic diversity of bovine diarrhea and mucosal disease virus,"Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) is classified as a member of the pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens affecting ruminants worldwide, causing severe economic losses. Infection leads to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory diseases to fetal death and mucosal diseases. The virus particles are small and contain a single-stranded, positive RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb with a large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5'UTR and 3'UTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases, resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well known that BVDV strains exhibit considerable genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified into two types: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. A new putative species, BVDV-3, was recently discovered. The viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or non-cytopathic based on their activity in cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR and Npro region has revealed at least 21 distinct subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2.

Nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect BVDV-2 in one of 1561 blood samples randomly collected from 78 flocks of sheep in 11 states of India. Antigenic characterization of the isolated pestivirus using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies typed the isolate as BVDV-2. When analyzed at the genetic level in Npro (N-terminal autoprotease) and the entire gene region encoding structural proteins, namely capsid (C) protein and envelope proteins Erns (ribonuclease secreted), the genomic organization of E1 and E2 for all pestiviruses was the same, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences showed the highest similarity to those of BVDV-2. When compared to the BVDV-2 isolate 890, the sequence homology was 83.7% for C, 84.6% for Erns and E1, and 81.5% for E2. The C/Erns cleavage site was found to be fully conserved, while Npro/C was conserved only from the C-terminus of Npro, the Erns/E1 site was conserved only from the C-terminus of Erns, and the E1/E2 site was conserved only from the C -terminus of E1 has been conserved.

This was supported by the presence of unique mutations in the structural protein coding regions adjacent to NS3 and NS5B. To our knowledge, this is the first report of sequence analysis of the entire structural gene coding region of a BVDV-2b isolate. This is also the first occurrence of BVDV-2 subtype b in sheep, providing evidence that this subtype may also occur in species other than bovine. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Mishra, N.;Rajukumar, K.;Vilcek, S.;Tiwari, A.;Satav, J.

1402,The metagenomic characterization of the virome associated with bovine respiratory disease identified new viruses and suggests an etiological role for influenza D virus,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease affecting the cattle industry. The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental, and animal management factors. In this study, we used viral metagenomic sequencing to examine virome of nasal swab specimens obtained from April to October 2015 from beef cattle with acute BRD and asymptomatic stallmates at six and four fattening farms, respectively, in Mexico and the United States. Twenty -one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7%) and B (23.7%) virus and bovine coronavirus (24.7%) being identified most frequently. Emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) associated with the disease, while viruses commonly associated with BRD, such as 3 viruses, were less frequently detected . The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E have been identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, has been characterized. To our knowledge, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America. These results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and underscore the need for further research on the contribution of other viruses to BRD pathogenesis.",,"Mitra, N.;Cernicchiaro, N.;Torres, S.;Li, F.;Hause, B.

1403,Molecular characterization of Indian isolates of broiler infectious bursa disease virus,"The present study was performed to characterize recent field isolates of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and partial sequencing of the VP2 gene. The virus was detected in 17 out of 20 field samples from broilers in the Indian state of Haryana and in all four vaccine strains. Nucleotide sequences of four field isolates and one vaccine strain were compared to 10 reported IBDV strains from different parts of the world. Nucleotide substitutions at 795G, 827T, 833C, 857C, 897A, 905T, 908T, 1011A and 1094G specific for very virulent (vv) strains were retained in all four field isolates. However, unique nucleotide substitutions at 806A-G, 851C-T, 1010 TC, 1019T-C and 1082T-C revealed further divergence of these isolates from previously reported vvIBDVs. Derived amino acid substitutions at 222P-A, 256V-I, 279N-D, 294L-I and 299N-S specific for vvIBDV strains were also present in all four isolates. The vaccine strain exhibited an amino acid change 279D-N, a feature of attenuated vaccine strains. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all field isolates in the present study were closely related to the reported field isolates from Great Britain (UK661) and Japan (OKYM). All four field IBDV strains of the present study were closely related but distinct from previously reported vvIBDVs from India. Based on nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, it is very likely that strains causing IBD in this part of India are very virulent in character and are still undergoing changes at the genetic level. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.",,"Mittal, D.;Jindal, N.;Gupta, S.

1406,Pestiviruses: a review review,"Pestiviruses comprise a group of economically important animal pathogens, namely swine cholera, bovine viral diarrhea and border disease viruses. The viruses are closely related serologically and share a common host range, namely pigs and numerous domestic and wild ruminants. Transmission between species is common. Despite some commonalities in their natural hosts, the pathogenesis of pestivirus-induced disease is complex; in particular, some aspects of the highly fatal bovine mucosal disease remain enigmatic. Pestiviruses are among the smallest enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid. They are currently classified as Togaviridae. However, due to recent advances in the molecular characterization of the viruses, their taxonomic relocation seems inevitable. Viral RNAs studied to date have a large open reading frame and no subgenomic RNA is detectable in infected cells. Structural proteins are encoded by genes located at the 5' end of RNA. Most of the genome encodes 2-3 nonstructural proteins. Virions consist of a major and a minor envelope glycoprotein with molecular weights of 53 and 48 kD, respectively. The core consists of a small protein with a molecular weight of 20 kD. Analysis of viral proteins with monoclonal antibodies has revealed detailed information about the antigenic composition of both structural and non-structural proteins.

1408,Detection and genetic characterization of bovine kobuvirus in calves in Egypt,"Kobuviruses are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that are likely to cause diarrhea in cattle and swine. Since its discovery in 2003, few studies have looked at bovine kobuvirus (BKoV; a species of Aichivirus B) infection. BKoV has been reported in Europe, Asia, and South America, indicating a global distribution. To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal samples from diarrhea calves in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were analyzed by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete BKoV genomic sequence. Compared to the single recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the strain examined showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions throughout its polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide (nt) insertion and one nt deletion in the 2B gene and 4 nt deletions in the UTRs (2 each). In addition, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other samples using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, with the Egyptian VP1 sequences being classified as a separate cluster within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), which also contained strains from Britain, Brazil and Japan. While the Cairo 3D sequences were related to those of Chinese tribes, in contrast to those of Sharkia, which were closer to Korean tribes.

1409,Effect of phylogenetic diversity of velogenous Newcastle disease virus challenge on virus shedding after homologous and heterologous DNA vaccination in chickens,"Newcastle Disease (ND) is an extremely devastating disease for the poultry industry as it causes high economic losses. In this present study, a DNA vaccine containing the F and HN surface antigens of a highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), NDV/1/Chicken/2005 (FJ939313), was successfully prepared. The cell transfection assay showed that the vaccine expressed the F and HN genes in Hep-2 cells. The main aim of this study was to compare the level of protection induced by DNA vaccination after homologous and heterologous NDV challenge, as determined by the amount of NDV shedding after challenge. NDV antibody-negative chickens were vaccinated either once, twice or three times intramuscularly at 7, 14 and 21 days of age and 14 days post-vaccination with one of the two homologous viruses (vaccine-matched velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus (vvNDV ) strain, FJ939313). , phylogenetically related to group VII, or a phylogenetically divergent heterologous virus (unmatched vvNDV strain, AY968809) belonging to genogroup VI and showing 84.1% nucleotide similarity to the NDV sequences of the DNA vaccine. Our data show that birds that received a single dose of the DNA vaccine were poorly protected and only 30-40% of these birds survived after challenge with a high titer of virus shedding. Multiple administrations of the DNA vaccine induced high protection rates of 70-90% with reduced virus shedding compared to the unvaccinated and the challenged birds. In general, the homologous challenge resulted in decreased tracheal and cloacal detachment compared to the heterologous vvNDV strain. This study offers a promising approach for the control of ND in chickens using DNA vaccines that are phylogenetically closely related to the circulating field strains.",,"Mohamed, M. H.;Abdelaziz, A.

Using the dot blot hybridization technique, a cDNA probe derived from genome segment 6 of EHDV-2 (Alberta strain) hybridized with RNA of EHDV-318. Application of serogroup-specific EHDV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to EHDV-318 RNA resulted in specific amplification of a 387 bp PCR product. The amplification product was visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by chemiluminescence hybridization with a non-radiolabeled internal probe. No amplification product or hybridization signal was detected when the serotype-specific EHDV-1 or EHDV-2 PCR-based assays were applied to EHDV-318 RNA.

1412,Analysis of the leader proteinase (Lpro) region of foot-and-mouth disease virus type A with due emphasis on the phylogeny and evolution of the nascent VP359 deletion lineage from India,"The genotype-inclusive grouping of Indian type A isolates as observed in the 1D region-based phylogeny was skewed throughout the Lpro region, where the VP359 deletion group lineages of genotype VII differ from both genotypes VII and VI removed grouped, which confirms its uniqueness and independent evolution from Lpro and 1D area. Similar to the 1D region, even in the L region, this deletion group gradually diverges genetically, forming a larger number of lineages, and the distance between the lineages in the L region is considerably larger than that in the 1D region. The deletion group is restricted to India only, as none of the exotic sequences cluster within this group. Notably, L protein showed variability comparable to external capsid proteins, as evidenced by its high dN/dS ratio (0.105), number of variable amino acid positions (41%), low Ts/Tv ratio (3.47), and the Alignment shows that the N-terminal region, β2-sheet and C-terminal extension are highly variable. Basic residues on P1, P3 and only leucine on P2 were predicted to provide an optimal autocatalytic cleavage site on the L/P1 junction. All eight sites identified as positively selected displayed aa substitutions with different physicochemical properties, and lineage-specific signatures were observed at two positions, supporting the claim that lineages evolve under different selection pressures to adapt to the different ecological adapt environment. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Mohapatra, J.

1413,"Genetic variability of group H porcine rotavirus VP6, VP7, VP4 and NSP4 genes detected in Brazil","Rotavirus (RV) is a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Despite the seven groups/species of RV (AG), the creation of a new RV group/species H (RVH) based on VP6 sequence analysis has recently been proposed. In this study, we determined the VP6, VP7, VP4, and NSP4 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of 6 (BR59-BR64) RVH-positive stool samples obtained from piglets with diarrhea in Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West Region of Brazil were 2012, using the RT-PCR assay. Based on the high sequence identities (>99%) of the VP6, VP4, VP7, and NSP4 genes in 5 of the stool samples examined (BR59-BR63), they are considered to be the same local rotavirus strain, designated RVH/BRA-1 . In contrast, the stool sample BR64, as soon as it showed a relatively high difference (81.6% nt identity and 83.4% aa identity) in the VP7 sequence compared to the other 5 samples, was classified as RVH/BRA- 2-stem denoted. Comparative phylogenetic analyzes showed that the 6 RVH strains do not group together with any available sequences from members of the established RV groups (RVA-RVG), but appear to be related to RVB and RVG.

1415,The genome of the chicken bursal lymphoma cell line DT40,"The chicken DT40 cell line is a widely used model system in the study of multiple cellular processes due to the efficiency of homologous gene targeting. The cell line was derived from a bursal lymphoma induced by an avian leukosis virus infection. In this study, we characterized the genome of the cell line using whole genome shotgun sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array hybridization. The results show that wild-type DT40 has a relatively normal karyotype, except for the increase in copy number throughout the chromosome, and no intra-herd variability in karyotype. Comparing two domestic chicken genomes and the Gallus gallus reference genome, we found no unique mutational processes shaping the DT40 genome, except for a slight increase in insertion and deletion events, particularly deletions at tandem repeats. We mapped coding sequence mutations unique to the DT40 genome; Mutations that inactivate the PIK3R1 and ATRX genes likely contributed to oncogenic transformation. In addition to a known avian leukosis virus integration into the MYC gene, we discovered additional integration sites that likely deregulate gene expression. The new findings support the hypothesis that DT40 is a typical transformed cell line with a relatively intact genome; hence, it is well suited to the role of a model system for DNA repair and related processes.

Although replication was found in certain cell lines derived from cold-blooded species, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was absent or minimal, and growth was less than or equal to that in mammalian cells. These observations appear to limit the value of poikilothermic cells for the primary isolation of viruses from field-collected cold-blooded vertebrates or arthropods that feed on them. The four reptilian viruses turned out to be naturally occurring, temperature-sensitive pathogens with a growth optimum of around 30°C. Electron microscopic studies showed that three of the viruses (Marco, Chaco and Timbo) are new members of the Rhabdoviridae family. Marco virus particles were conical in shape and resembled bovine ephemeral fever virus and two lyssaviruses (Kotonkan and Obodhaing). Chaco and Timbo viruses were cylindrical viruses resembling other rhabdoviruses with particle lengths longer than the prototype VSV.

1419,Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous infectious bronchitis virus strains,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each containing a 64 nucleotide (nt) leader sequence derived by a discontinuous process from the 5 inch end of the genome. Several putative functional domains such as a papain-like proteinase (PLpro), major protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for viral replication. We sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5-terminal sequence, PLpro, Mpro, and RdRp domains of 20 heterologous IBV strains and compared them to previously published coronavirus sequences. All of the coronavirus 5-termini and PLpro domains were distinct, in contrast to the Mpro and RdRp domains, which were highly conserved with 28% and 48% residues conserved, respectively. In the IBV strains, the 5'' untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas the N-terminal coding region and PLpro domains were highly variable, ranging from 84.6% to 100% and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV Mpro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% residues conserved, respectively. The BJ strain differed most from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was identical to antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three groups. However, IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses, regardless of serotype, suggesting that either genetic material was exchanged between vaccine and field isolates or that there was convergent evolution to a particular replicase genotype gave . There was no correlation between genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1422,Immunomodulatory effects of heat stress and lipopolysaccharide on the bursal transcriptome in two different chicken lines,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to heat stress suppresses the immune response of poultry, which may increase susceptibility to infectious diseases and thereby amplify the negative effects of heat on poultry welfare and performance. Identifying genes and signaling pathways that are affected by high temperature, particularly heat-induced changes in immune response, could provide targets for improving disease resistance in chickens. This study used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to examine the transcriptome responses in Fabricius bursa, a primary immune tissue, after exposure to acute heat stress and/or subcutaneous immune stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a 2 x 2 factorial design: Thermoneutral + Saline, Heat + Saline, Thermoneutral + LPS, and Heat + LPS. All treatments were studied in two chicken lines: a relatively heat and disease resistant Fayoumi line and a more susceptible broiler line. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis revealed that heat + saline had a limited effect on gene expression (N=1 or 63 genes) in broilers or Fayoumi bursa. However, Thermoneutral + LPS and Heat + LPS produced many expression changes in Fayoumi Bursa (N=368 and 804 genes). It was predicted that thermoneutral + LPS would increase immune-related cell signaling and cell migration, while heat + LPS would activate mortality-related functions and decrease expression in WNT signaling pathways. Further comparisons between treatments in the Fayoumi line showed that heat stress prevented many of the expression changes caused by LPS. Although less significant expression changes were observed in the broiler bursa after exposure to either thermoneutral + LPS (N = 59 genes) or heat + LPS (N = 146 genes), both treatments were predicted to increase cell migration. Direct comparison between the lines (broilers with Fayoumi) confirmed that each line had different responses to the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptome analysis identified genes and signaling pathways involved in bursal responses to heat stress and LPS and revealed that these effects were greatest with the combined treatment. The interaction between estrus and LPS was lineage dependent, with suppressive expression changes mainly in the Fayoumi lineage. Potential target genes, particularly those involved in cell migration and immune signaling, may inform future research on heat stress in poultry and prove useful to improve disease resistance.",,"Monson, M.

Five out of twelve isolates were grouped into Massachusetts genotypes and the remaining seven viruses were grouped into four different genotypes: A(2), B(2), C(2), or D(1). Such genotyping classification was consistent with previous immunological analyzes for most of these viruses, highlighting the occurrence of relevant variability among IBV strains circulating in Brazilian commercial poultry flocks.",,"Montassier, M.

1425,Detection and genetic identification of pestiviruses in Brazilian batches of fetal bovine serum collected from 2006 to 2014,"The present study performed a genetic identification of pestiviruses contaminating the genome of fetal bovine serum (FBS) batches produced in Brazil from 2006 to 2014. Thirty-nine lots (53.4%) were positive for pestivirus RNA and one contained infectious virus. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR identified 34 lots (46.6%) containing bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) RNA, namely 23 BVDV-1a (5'-UTR identity 90, 8-98.7%), eight BVDV-1b (93.9-96.7%) and three BVDV-1d (96.2-97.6%). Six batches (8.2%) contained BVDV-2 (90.3-100% UTR identity), two of which were BVDV-2a; three BVDV-2b and one undetermined. Four FBS lots (5.5%) were contaminated with HoBi-like virus (98.3 to 100%). Five batches (6.8%) contained more than one pestivirus. The high frequency of contamination of FBS with pestivirus RNA reinforces the need for systematic and updated guidelines to monitor this product to reduce the risk of biological agent contamination and introduction of contaminants into vacant areas.",,"Monteiro, F.

1426,Circulation of hepatitis E virus in Italy: phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis,"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major cause of acute viral hepatitis in developing countries, has been classified into four major genotypes and a number of subtypes. New genotypes have recently been identified in various mammals, including HEV genotype 3, which is distributed worldwide. It is widespread among pigs in developed countries. Aims: This study investigated the genetic diversity of HEV in humans and pigs in Italy. The emergence date and demographic history of the HEV were also estimated. Materials and Methods: A total of 327 porcine and human HEV sequences from Italy were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Three different data sets were created. The first and second sets of data were used to confirm the genotype of the analyzed sequences. The third dataset was used to estimate the mean evolutionary rate and to determine time-scaled phylogeny and demographic history. Results: The Bayesian maximumclade credibility tree and the time of the most common estimates of the most recent ancestors showed that the root of the tree dates back to 1907 (95% HPD: 1811 - 1975). Two main clades were found, divided into two subclades. Skyline plot analysis, performed separately for human and pig sequences, showed the presence of a bottleneck only in the skyline plot of the pig sequences. The selective pressure analysis revealed only negatively selected areas. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that humans are likely to become infected after exposure to porcine sources. The results underline the importance of verifying the country of origin of pigs and improving sanitary control measures from a veterinary point of view in order to prevent the spread of HEV infection in Italy.",,"Montesano, C.;Giovanetti, M.;Ciotti, M.;Cella, E.;Lo Presti, A.;Grifoni, A.;Zehender, G.;Angeletti, S.;Ciccozzi, M.",2016.0,,10.5812/hepatmon.31951,0

1428,Sequence comparison of S1 glycoproteins of Florida serotype infectious avian bronchitis virus and five variant isolates from Georgia and California,"The spike glycoprotein S1 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is required to initiate infection and contains virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the S1 gene for strain Florida 18288 and isolates GA-92, CV-56b, CV-9437, CV-1686 and 1013 are reported. These sequences were compared to previously published gene sequences from IBV strains . and phylogenetic relationships are reported. The SI amino acid sequence of Florida 18288 was 94.9% similar to strain Connecticut and GA-92 was 92.8% similar to strain Arkansas 99. The S1 amino acid sequences of Californian variants CV-56b, CV-9437 and CV -1686 were 97.6-99.3% similar and only 76.6-76.8% similar to the Arkansas-type strains. Isolate 1013, also from California, was 84.0% similar to Ark DPI and 77.9% similar to CV-56b. When comparing 19 viruses isolated from the United States, sequence variations were observed between amino acids 55-96, 115-149, 255-309 and 378-395. Similar regions are reported to be involved in virus neutralizing and/or serotype specific epitopes.

All 12 isolates displayed similar sequences at the RSSF/GLF cleavage site, bearing eight potential glycosylation sites and sharing the characteristic deduced amino acid residues alanine-190, glutamine-226 and glutamine-227 at the receptor binding site. Ten of these 12 isolates had leucine at position 226, which predominates in the sequences found in human H2 and H3 strains. Overall, the presence in these Iranian avian animals of H9N2 viruses of the sequence known to bind to human-type receptors and the presence of antibodies to H9N2 in the human population of Iran indicated that it is possible that in the Iran circulating H9N2 avian influenza viruses infect humans. Therefore, comprehensive surveillance of H9N2 in this country is strongly recommended. © 2010 American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Moosakhani, F.;Shoshtari, A. H.;Pourbakhsh, S.

1430,Detection and molecular characterization of porcine Astrovirus strains associated with swine diarrhea,"Astrovirus has been reported to be associated with diarrhea in pigs. The current study was performed to detect and molecularly characterize astroviruses in diarrheal pigs submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The intestinal contents of 269 pigs were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 62% were found positive for astrovirus. Of the positive specimens, 20% were positive for astrovirus only, while astrovirus with rotavirus was detected in 58% of the specimens. The remaining 22% showed the presence of astrovirus along with porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or porcine circovirus-2. Capsid gene sequencing of 56 randomly selected samples confirmed that they were porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV-4) with 58-100% nucleotide identity within these viruses. The phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 possible subgroups. The results show that PAstV is present on swine farms in the United States and can be associated with diarrhea either alone or in combination with other enteric viruses. Further studies are needed to determine strain diversity among porcine astroviruses so that appropriate control strategies can be developed and implemented. © 2012 The author(s).",,"Mor, S.

1431,Molecular characterization of L-class genome segments of a newly isolated turkey arthritis reovirus,"Seven strains of turkey arthritis reovirus (TARV) isolated from turkey arthritis cases were characterized based on their class L genomic segment sequences, which were then compared to those of enteric turkey reovirus (TERV) and chicken reovirus (CRV) were compared. All three L-class gene segments of TARVs and TERVs and their encoded proteins ΔA, ΔB and ΔC were similar in size to those of the CRV reference strain S1133. The conserved motifs such as C2H2 zinc binding motif and conserved polymerase region were present in κA and κB, respectively. A conserved motif for the ATP/GTP binding site and an S-adenosyl-. l-Methionine (SAM) binding pocket for methyltransferase were observed in the κC protein of TARVs and TERVs with only one substitution compared to CRV. We propose a new genotype classification system for avian reoviruses (ARVs) based on the nt identity cutoff for each of the L classes. Based on this new genotype classification, all ARVs have been grouped into six, seven, and eight genotypes in L1, L2, and L3 genes, respectively. Interestingly, TARVs and TERVs with three CRVs (two arthritic strains from Taiwan and one enteric strain from Japan) in the L1-I genotype clustered and formed a different genotype (L2-I, L3-I) than CRVs in the L2 and L3 genes Maximum nucleotide divergence was observed in the genotypes of the L1 and L2 genes, but less at the amino acid level indicates that most of the changes were of the synonymous type. Compared to the L1 and L2 genes, the non-synonymous changes were more in the L3 gene. Point mutations and possible reassortments between TARVs, TERVs and CRVs have also been observed. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Mor, S. K.;Sharafeldin, T. A.;Porter, R. E.;Goyal, S.

1433,Concise and broadly applicable method for determining the genomic sequences of North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses in different clusters,"We have developed a concise and broadly applicable method for the accurate genomic sequencing of North American genotype (NA-type) porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSVs) that overcomes the high genetic variability of the viruses. The method, termed ""combination consensus oligonucleotide reverse transcription and multiple displacement amplification"" (CORT-MDA), involves reverse transcription of viral RNA followed by post-amplification shotgun sequencing using only 11 degenerate oligonucleotide primers ; these primers were designed against consensus regions within the open reading frames of the 124 NA-type PRRSV strains with reported full-length genomic sequences. Sequencing of the 192 shotgun clones generated per virus showed 80% to 94% coverage of the reported PRRSV genomic sequence, leaving only 2 or 3 unread regions to be resequenced after PCR amplification using custom primers. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products confirmed the absolute agreement between the sequences determined by the CORT-MDA method and those from RT-PCR. These results suggest that our method is applicable to various NA-type viruses.",,"Morozumi, T.;Iseki, H.;Toki, D.;Takagi, M.;Tsunemitsu, H.;Uenishi, H.",2014.0,,,0
1434,"Genomic evolution, recombination, and diversity between strains of Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 from Florida and Hawaii green sea turtles with fibropapillomatosis","Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is a herpesvirus associated with fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles worldwide. Single locus typing has previously demonstrated differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific strains of this virus, with little variation within each geographic group. However, a lack of genomic sequence data for multiple loci hampers understanding the rate and mechanisms of ChHV5 evolutionary divergence and how these genomic changes may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. To assess genomic variation in ChHV5 in five Hawaiian and three Florida green sea turtles, we used high-throughput short-read sequencing of long-range PCR products amplified from tumor tissue using primers derived from the only available ChHV5 reference genome was developed from a Hawaiian Green Sea turtle. This strategy recovered sequence data from both geographic regions for approximately 75% of the predicted ChHV5 coding sequences. The average nucleotide divergence between geographic populations was 1.5%; Most substitutions were fixed differences between regions. Protein divergence was generally low (mean 0.08%), ranging from 0 to 5.3%. Several atypical genes originally identified and annotated in the reference genome have been confirmed in ChHV5 genomes from both geographic locations. Clear recombination events have been identified between geographic regions, and the accumulation of private alleles indicates the prevalence of recombination in ChHV5 evolutionary history. This study significantly increased the amount of available sequence data of ChHV5 strains, allowing informed selection of loci for future population genetic and natural history studies and suggesting the (possibly latent) co-infection of individuals by well-differentiated geographic variants.",,"Morrison, C.

1436,"A next-generation, universal sequencing protocol for generating non-infectious barcode cDNA libraries from high-containment RNA viruses","Several biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) pathogens are single-stranded RNA viruses of high consequence, and their genomes are infectious when introduced into permissive cells. In addition, many of these viruses are Select Agents (SAs) and their genomes are also considered SAs. For this reason, cDNAs and/or their derivatives must be tested for the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA prior to transfer from the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This severely limits the capacity to conduct viral genomics research, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here we present a sequence-independent method to rapidly amplify viral genomic RNA while abolishing both viral and genomic RNA infectivity across multiple single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA+) virus families. The method generates barcoded DNA amplicons ranging in length from 300 to 1,000 bp that cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable for transport at room temperature. Our barcode approach allows up to 288 barcode samples to be pooled into a single library and run on different NGS platforms without potential viral genome reconstitution. Our data demonstrate that this approach yields full-length genomic sequence information not only from high-titer virion preparations, but also recovers specific viral sequences from samples with limited starting material in the cellular RNA background and can be used to identify pathogens from unknown samples. In summary, we describe a rapid, standard, universal working procedure that generates high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA. IMPORTANT This report establishes and validates a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for selected Active Substances (SAs) and other Biosafety Level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) RNA viruses to rapidly generate barcoded non-infectious cDNA used for the next-generation sequencing (NGS). This removes the burden of testing all processed samples derived from high-consequence pathogens before transferring them from high-containment labs to low-containment facilities for sequencing. Our established protocol can be scaled up for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can drastically reduce the cost and effort of NGS library creation. NGS data from this SOP can provide full genome coverage from viral stocks and also detect virus-specific reads from limited starting material. Our data suggest that the procedure can be implemented by institutional biosafety committees in research laboratories and can be easily validated.",,"Moser, L.

1437,RNA2DMut: a web tool for the design and analysis of RNA structural mutations,"With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing, new RNA sequences are being discovered at amazing speeds. However, the analysis of the function lags behind. Secondary structure (2D base pairing) plays an essential regulatory role in both the cis and transregulatory functions of RNA. To test RNA function, it is important to be able to design and analyze mutations that can affect structure. This was the motivation for the development of the web tool RNA2DMut. RNA2DMut allows users to input RNA sequences for analysis, restrict mutations to specific residues, or limit changes to purines/pyrimidines. The sequence is analyzed at each base to determine the impact of each possible point mutation on the 2D structure. The metrics used in RNA2DMut are based on the calculation of the Boltzmann structure ensemble and do not require a robust 2D model of RNA structure to design mutations. This tool can facilitate a wide range of applications involving RNA: for example, designing and evaluating mutants for biological assays, querying RNA-protein interactions, identifying key regions to alter in SELEX experiments, and improving RNA Folding and crystallization properties for structural biology. Additional tools are available to help users introduce other mutations (e.g. indels and substitutions) and assess their impact on RNA structure. Example calculations are shown for five RNAs that require a 2D structure for their function: the MALAT1 mascRNA, an influenza virus splicing regulatory motif, the viral EBER2 non-coding RNA, the Xist lncRNA repA region, and the human YRNA 5.

In addition, chronic HEV infection and associated cirrhosis have been described in severely immunocompromised patients. However, few studies worldwide have focused on pediatric HEV infection, and only four autochthonous cases in children in developed countries have been reported. We describe here acute hepatitis E in three immunocompromised children. Case #1 was a 9-year-old girl who received a liver transplant who was diagnosed with 2009 H1N1 influenza concomitantly with hepatitis E. case no. 2 was a 12-year-old boy with early medullary relapse of type B lymphoblastic leukemia and HEV RNA detected for 29 weeks. Case #3 was a 9-year-old boy with a rare primary immunodeficiency due to XIAP deficiency. HEV infections were all autochthonous and involved different viruses classified as subtypes f, c and e of genotype 3, which have been described in autochthonous cases in Europe.

The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A and C (RVA and RVC), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) in the population of free-ranging wild boar in the Czech Republic members of the Coronaviridae family ( Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus - TGEV, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus - PEDV, Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus - PRCV and Porcine Hemagglutination Encephalomyelitis Virus - PHEV) and Picornaviridae, (Teschovirus A - PTV, Sapelovirus A - PSV and Enterovirus G - EV-G). In our study, faecal samples from 203 wild boar culled during the 2014–2015 hunting season (October to January) were analyzed by RT-PCR. RVA was detected in 2.5% of the samples tested.

The prevalence of RVC in the wild boar population reached 12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9% and EV-G in 2.5% of the samples. Neither PRRSV nor coronaviruses were detected during our study.

1442,Defining an emerging disease,"Defining an emerging disease is not easy as there are different types of disease occurrence. For example, there may be a 'real' emergence of a brand new disease, like the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the 1980s, or a geographic emergence in a previously unaffected area, like the emergence of bluetongue in northern Europe in 2006. In addition, there may be Diseases occur in species not previously thought to be affected, e.g. B. the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis in wildlife species since 2000 in France. There may also be an unexpected increase in the incidence of disease in a known area and species, or there may simply be an increase in our knowledge or awareness of a particular disease. What all of these emerging diseases have in common is that human activities often play a role in their development. For example, bovine spongiform encephalopathy is likely to have arisen as a result of changes in the manufacture of meat and bone meal, bluetongue was able to spread to cooler climes due to the uncontrolled trade in animals, and relaxation of controls and surveillance for bovine tuberculosis allowed the resurgence of the Disease in areas where the number of cases has been drastically reduced. Globalization and population growth will continue to influence the epidemiology of diseases in the years to come, and ecosystems will continue to evolve. In addition, new technologies such as metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing are constantly identifying new microorganisms. Change is the only constant and diseases will continue to occur and we must consider the causes and different modes of occurrence when dealing with these diseases in the future.",,"Moutou, F.;Pastoret, P.

1443,Stem loop recognition by DDX17 facilitates miRNA processing and antiviral defense,"DEAD box helicases play an essential role in RNA metabolism across species, but new data suggest they have additional roles in immunity. Through RNAi screening, we identify an evolutionarily conserved and interferon-independent role for the DEAD-box helicase DDX17 in limiting Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus of the Bunyavirus family that occurs in Causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. Loss of Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies enhanced RVFV infection. Similarly, depletion of DDX17, but not the related helicase DDX5, increased RVFV replication in human cells. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation high throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds the stem loops of the host pri-miRNA to facilitate its processing and also an essential stem loop in bunyaviral RNA to restrict infection. Thus, DDX17 has a dual role in stem loop recognition: in the nucleus for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and in the cytoplasm for surveillance against non-self structured elements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,"Moy, R.

In this study, the ancestry of rabies virus (RABV) in Zambia was determined by phylogenetic analysis of nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) gene sequences. Total RNA was extracted from 87 DFAT brain samples, of which only 35 (40%) were nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for each gene and 26 were positive for both genes. Positive samples for genes N (n=33) and G (n=35) were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene revealed two phylogenetic clusters in Zambia belonging to the Africa 1b lineage, found in eastern and southern Africa. While one cluster included exclusively Zambian strains, the other was more heterogeneous in terms of RABV origins and included strains from Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene revealed similar RABV strains in different hosts and regions of Zambia. We designed primers for the RT-LAMP (Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) assay from the consensus sequence of the N gene to improve the molecular diagnosis of RABV in Zambia. The specificity and reproducibility of the RT-LAMP assay has been confirmed using actual clinical specimens.

Empty capsid shells with buoyant densities of 1.31 g/mL are similar in size and shape but lack DNA and histone-like polypeptides. Virus replication in chick embryo cells leads to cytopathic changes characterized by rounding and enlargement of the nucleus and formation of intranuclear inclusion bodies. All of these properties justify the classification of the virus as polyoma-like.",,"Muller, H.;Nitschke, R.",1986.0,,,0
1448,Genomic characterization of feline sarcoid-associated papillomavirus and proposed classification as Bos taurus papillomavirus type 14,"Feline sarcoids are rare mesenchymal neoplasms of domestic and exotic cats. Previous studies have consistently identified short DNA sequences of a papillomavirus (PV) termed feline sarcoid-associated papillomavirus (FeSarPV) in these neoplasms. The FeSarPV sequence has never been detected in a non-sarcoid specimen from cats, but has been amplified from bovine skin, suggesting that feline sarcoids are caused by cross-species infection with a bovine papillomavirus (BPV). The aim of the present study was to determine the genome of the PV containing the FeSarPV sequence. Taking advantage of the circular nature of PV DNA, four specially designed ""outward"" primers were used to amplify two approximately 4,000 bp segments of DNA from a feline sarcoid. The two PCR products were sequenced using next-generation sequencing, and the complete genome of the PV, consisting of 7,966 bp, was assembled and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the PV was closely related to species 4 delta BPVs-1, -2, and -13, but distantly related to any carnivorous PV genus. These results are consistent with feline sarcoids being caused by a BPV type, and we propose a classification of BPV-14 for this novel PV. Preliminary analysis suggests that the BPV-14 E5 protein, like other delta-BPVs, might cause mesenchymal proliferation by binding to the beta-receptor of platelet-derived growth factor. Interestingly, BPV-14 was not detected in any equine sarcoid, suggesting that BPV-14 has a host range restricted to bovines and felids.",,"Munday, J. S.;Thomson, N.;Dunowska, M.;Knight, C.

1450,Transcriptional response of avian cells to infection with Newcastle disease virus,"Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) causes widespread disease in poultry and wild birds around the world. cDNA microarray analysis was used to study the effect of NDV infection on host cell transcription. The results indicate that NDV infection causes apparent repression of interferon response genes during the early stages of infection. In addition, the results demonstrate transcriptional silencing of cytoskeletal proteins such as the α-, β- and β-types of actin and down-regulation of the thioredoxin gene, a likely mediator of apoptosis with possible implications for NDV pathogenesis. Comparative analyzes show that a majority of the genes transcriptionally regulated during infection with another common respiratory pathogen of poultry, avian pneumovirus, remained unaltered during NDV infection, suggesting that even phylogenetically related viruses have unique or ""characteristic"" Patterns of host transcriptional profiles evoke during infection of host cells. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Munir, S.;Sharma, J.

1451,Molecular epidemiological study of infectious Bursa disease viruses in broiler farms raised in different vaccination programs,"Over a period of almost 4 years, 246 bursa tissue samples were collected from commercial Brazilian broiler flocks (Gallus gallus) nationwide and printed on sample collection cards (Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards). A total of 75 strains of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were successfully detected from the FTA map prints and submitted for further identification and molecular characterization. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the IBDV surface protein VP2 were used to identify virus strains and place them into phylogenetic groups. The amino acids in the hypervariable region of VP2 in this study varied, but approximately half of all positive specimens were classified as vaccine virus. The IBD viruses fell into 3 categories: IBDV variant, classic IBDV (vaccine) and very virulent (vv) IBDV. The samples were collected according to the 3 different vaccination strategies used in broilers: vector vaccine, antigen-antibody complex vaccine and conventional live vaccine. The genetic profile and frequency of strains recovered from the herds were highly dependent on the vaccination program. This information helps us better understand the current IBD landscape in Brazil and provides additional scientific data to support the selection of the most effective vaccination strategies, products and practices to prevent disease.",,"Muniz, E.

1452,Classical swine fever virus vs. classical swine fever virus: the superinfection exclusion phenomenon in experimentally infected wild boar,"Two groups of three wild boars each were used: group A (animals 1 to 3) served as controls and group B (animals 4 to 6) were persistently infected postnatally with the Cat01 strain of CSFV (primary virus). The six-week-old and clinically healthy animals were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). A specific qRT-PCR assay was developed for the exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, which showed no cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. The feral pigs persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swab and tissue samples. Furthermore, only the primary infecting viral RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected in PBMCs, a known target for CSFV viral replication, even after isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, data analysis of Margarita qRT-PCR using calculated ΔCt values supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were essentially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to spread to infect naïve PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α levels were undetectable in the sera of animals in group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralizing antibodies) or cellular (relative to IFN-γ-producing cells) immune responses after vaccination with the second virus. Finally, sequence analysis failed to detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the Group B samples tested. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in virus evolution and phylogeny, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first to show effective suppression of superinfection in animals, particularly in the absence of IFN-α, which could be related to the lack of innate immune mechanisms.",,"MuÃ±oz-GonzÃ¡lez, S.;PÃ©rez-SimÃ³, M.;Colom-Cadena, A.;CabezÃ³n, O.;BohÃ³rquez, J.

1454,Variations in the viral genome and biological properties of wild-type bovine leukemia virus strains,"The bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), which causes enormous economic losses in livestock farming worldwide. In order to reduce the economic loss caused by BLV infection, it is important to clarify the characteristics associated with BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis in cattle. In this study, we focused on viral characteristics and investigated spontaneous mutations in the virus and viral properties through analysis of whole genome sequences and BLV molecular clones derived from cows with and without EBL. Genome analysis showed that all 28 strains contained limited genetic variation but no deletion mutations allowing classification into three groups (A, B and C), with the exception of one strain. Some nucleotide/amino acid substitutions were specific for a particular group. On the other hand, these genetic variations were not associated with the host bovine leukocyte antigen DRB3 allele, which is known to be related to BLV pathogenesis. Viral replication activity in vitro was high, moderate, and low in groups A, B, and C, respectively. In addition, the proviral load associated with BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis was high in cows infected with group A strains and low in cows infected with group B/C strains. Therefore, these results suggest that limited genetic variation might affect viral properties related to transmissibility and pathogenesis of BLV.",,"Murakami, H.;Uchiyama, J.;Suzuki, C.;Nikaido, S.;Shibuya, K.;Sato, R.;Maeda, Y.;Tomioka, M.;Takeshima, S.

1456,Molecular and biophysical characterization of the TT virus: evidence for a new family of viruses infecting humans,"The recent isolation of a new DNA virus from the serum of a Japanese patient (TT) has provided the latest possible candidate virus implicated in cryptogenic hepatitis. In the present study, we report the full nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African man. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and susceptibility to mung bean nuclease digestion, the vital genome is circular and negative-stranded and comprises 3,852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation showed banding of virus at 1.31-1.34 g/ml; Filtration studies showed that TTV had a particle size of 30-50 nm. These results suggest that the virus is similar to the Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (eg, birds and pigs); However, sequence similarity searches of available databases revealed no identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of a 260 nt region from 151 globally distributed isolates revealed the existence of three major TTV genotypes. Several individuals at high risk of infection with parenterally transmitted viruses were infected with more than one genotype. There was no correlation between genotype and geographical origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; No biochemical or histological evidence of hepatitis was obtained. The distinct biophysical and molecular properties of TTV suggest that it is a member of a new family of viruses that we have tentatively named Circinoviridae.",,"Mushahwar, I. K.;Erker, J.

1457,Avian influenza virus surveillance of wild birds in the Azov and Black Sea regions of Ukraine (2010-2011),"The Azov and Black Sea basins are part of the transcontinental migratory routes of wild birds from northern Asia and Europe to the Mediterranean, Africa and Southwest Asia. These regions form a transit area, stopping during migration and nesting for many different species of birds. A wild bird surveillance study was conducted in these regions from September 2010 to September 2011 to identify avian influenza viruses. Biological samples, consisting of cloacal and tracheal swabs and faecal samples, were collected from wild birds of various ecological groups, including waterfowl and seabirds and terrestrial birds, at sites of mass aggregation of birds in Sivash Bay and the Utlyuksky and Molochniy estuaries. The sampling included the following biological cycles of wild birds: autumn migration, wintering, spring migration, breeding season and post-breeding period. A total of 3634 samples from 66 different bird species were collected. During the autumn migration, 19 haemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 14 of which were identified as low pathogenicity avian influenza virus subtypes H1N?, H3N8, H5N2, H7N?, H8N4, H10N7 and H11N8. 45 haemagglutinating viruses were isolated from the overwintering samples, 36 of which were classified as LPAI virus subtypes H1N1, H1N? H1N2, H4N?, H6N1, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, H8N2, H9N2, H10N7, H10N4, H11N2, H12N2 and H15N7. Only three viruses were isolated during spring migration, nesting and post-nesting seasons (serotypes H6, H13 and H16). The HA and NA genes were sequenced from the isolated H5 and N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecological links between the Azov and Black Sea regions and Europe. The LPAI viruses were mainly isolated from mallards, but also from ducks, shovelers, teals and pale-fronted geese. The rest of the 14 isolated hemagglutinating viruses were identified as different serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1, APMV-4, APMV-6 and APMV-7).

1458,Prevalence and molecular characterization of hepatitis E virus in pork products marketed in Canada,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are very common worldwide. HEV causes acute viral hepatitis with approximately 20 million cases per year. While HEV genotypes 1 and 2 cause large waterborne and foodborne outbreaks with significant mortality in developing countries, genotypes 3 and 4 are more common in developed countries with transmission being primarily zoonotic. HEV has been increasingly detected in pigs in North America and Europe, and exposure to pigs and pork products is considered the main source of infection. Therefore, we set out to investigate the prevalence of HEV in retail pork products available in Canada by examining meal-sized portions of pork pies, raw pork sausages, and raw pork liver. The presence of the HEV genomes was determined by RT-PCR and viral RNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR. Overall, HEV was detected in 47% of the sampled pork pies and 10.5% of the sampled raw pork livers, but not in the sampled pork sausages, and sequencing confirmed that all HEV strains belonged to genotype 3. Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that all but one isolate clustered with subtype 3d belonged to subtype 3a. Amino acid variations between isolates were also observed in the sequenced capsid region. In conclusion, the prevalence of HEV in pâté and raw pork liver observed in this study is consistent with the current HEV distribution in pork products reported in other industrialized countries.",,"Mykytczuk, O.;Harlow, J.;Bidawid, S.;Corneau, N.;Nasheri, N.",2017.0,,10.1007/s12560-017-9281-9,0
1459,Single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA) combined with next-generation sequencing provides complete coverage of the bovine coronavirus genome and greater sequence depth compared to sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA),"Corona viruses are of great importance for human and animal health. With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for rapid genome characterization becomes more important. In addition, techniques for deep sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed to understand the impact of quasi-species of these viruses in terms of biology. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) and single-primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing to to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169-284,944), only 0.07% of SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0-249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study, we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the datasets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV in relation to Ovation vs. SISPA, however fewer sequences were mapped to BRBV due to a lower abundance of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study yielded full BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) coverage and high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for whole genome sequencing when low copy number viral RNA is expected and when high sequence depth is desired.",,"Myrmel, M.;Oma, V.;Khatri, M.;Hansen, H.

Japanese BVDVs have been subdivided into BVDV1, subdivided into six subgroups, and BVDV2. One isolate, So CP/75, isolated in 1975 and previously proposed as subgroup 1e based on its 5-NCR sequence, was quite unique and formed an independent lineage in each region's pedigree. Another isolate, 190CP, obtained from an experimental case of mucosal disease, was classified as subgroup 1e, defined by Becher et al. in the 5-NCR, Npro and E2 regions, while in the NS5B-3 NCR region it was classified as subgroup 1a. The genomic sequences of the American isolates ILLC and ILLNC obtained from the GenBank database have been assigned to subgroup 1b in the 5'NCR, Npro, E2 and NS5B-3'NCR regions, while in the NS3 region of the subgroup 1a were assigned. suggesting that recombination between the virus strains classified into different subgroups had occurred in one animal.

The 5 inch untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the nucleotide sequences from 244 to 247 bases were determined. The serological properties were also characterized by the cross-neutralization test using antisera against the representative strain of the classified genotype. Using pedigree analysis, BVDV 1 was divided into two major clusters, BVDV-1a (29 isolates) and BVDV-1b (27 isolates). In group 1a, 3 differed from the other viruses and were placed in a branch assigned as 1a"". However, 4 isolates (So CP/75, 190 CP, 190 NCP and KS86-1-NCP) could not be assigned to group 1a or 1b. Compared to the published sequence data, KS86-1-NCP, 190 CP and 190 NCP were similar to the Southern African isolates recently proposed as BVDV 1c. The 5-UTR sequence of So CP/75 was unique among those of BVDV 1, suggesting that the isolate should be assigned to a new genotype. Only 2 of 62 isolates collected in 1989 and 1990 were identified as BVDV 2. The results of the cross-neutralization test strongly supported these data, indicating a close correlation between the 5-UTR sequence and the antigenicity of BVDV.",,"Nagai, M.;Ito, T.;Sugita, S.;Genno, A.;Takeuchi, K.;Ozawa, T.;Sakoda, Y.;Nishimori, T.;Takamura, K.;Akashi, H.",2001.0,,10.1007/s007050170139,0
1462,Identification and full genome analysis of a novel bovine picornavirus in Japan,"We identified novel viruses in the faeces of cattle with diarrhea collected in 2009 in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, using a metagenomic approach and determining the (almost) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyzes revealed that they had a standard organization of the picornavirus genome, i.e. 5' untranslated region (UTR) - L-P1 (VP4-VP3-VP2-VP1) - P2 (2A-2B-2C) - P3 (3A-3B -3C -3D) - 3'UTR-poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; Group 1-3 bat picornaviruses, feline picornavirus and canine picornavirus, 45.4-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2) and 49.6-53.3, respectively % (P3) share amino acid identities. The phylogenetic analyzes and detailed genomic characterization showed that they clustered together with the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses for the P1, 2C, 3CD, and VP1 coding regions. These viruses had conserved features (eg, predicted protein cleavage sites, presence of a leader protein, functional 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D domains) suggesting that they share a common ancestor.

Of the various viral pathogens detected, read counts revealed nearly complete Astrovirus-related RNA sequences in 15 of the 146 stool samples collected in three different areas (Hokkaido, Ishikawa, and Kagoshima prefectures) between 2009 and 2015. Due to the lack of genetic information on bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to Chinese BoAstVs and grouped into one lineage (tentatively named Lineage 1) in all phylogenetic trees. Three of 15 strains were phylogenetically distinct from lineage 1, showing low sequence identities, and instead clustered with an American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively named lineage 2). Interestingly, two out of 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b regions, while clustering with lineage 2 in the ORF2 region.

1464,"GiRaF: Robust, computational identification of influenza resorts by graph mining","Reassortments in the influenza virus - a process by which strains exchange genetic segments - have been implicated in two out of three pandemics of the 20th century and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. While advances in sequencing have led to an explosion in the number of available whole genome sequences, an understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in viral evolution is still lacking. A key factor here is the lack of automated tools to reliably identify reassorts from sequence data due to the challenges of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. We describe here a novel computational method called GiRaF (Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder) that reliably identifies reassortments in a fully automated manner, taking into account uncertainties in the derived phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sample trees for groups of incompatible splits using a fast biclique enumeration algorithm coupled with multiple statistical tests to find groups of taxa with different phylogenetic placement to identify. GiRaF correctly finds known rearrangements in human, avian, and swine flu populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent ""swine flu"" outbreak. GiRaF also identifies several previously unreported resorts across whole genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine influenza isolates. © The author(s) 2010.

We examined the phylogenetic relatedness of 46 serotype A FMDV isolates of Indian origin collected in the period 1968-2005 and eight vaccine strains using neighbor joining tree and Bayesian tree methods. The viruses have been divided into three main groups - Asian, European-South American and European. The Indian isolates formed a distinct genetic group among the Asian isolates. The Indian isolates were further classified into different genetic subgroups (<5% variation). Post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups, while some isolates originating from Andhra Pradesh in 2005 formed a separate group. These isolates were closely related to the 1970s isolates. The FMDV isolates appear to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution, with sequences identical to the ancestors being present in the circulating isolates. The eight vaccine strains included in the study were unrelated and belonged to different genetic groups. Recombination was detected in the Lpro region in one isolate (A IND 20/82) and in the VP1-encoding 1D region in another isolate (A RAJ 21/96).

Group 2.3.4.4b H5 virus infections affect wild bird and poultry populations. Clade 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a H5 viruses were previously detected in Europe in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic to Egypt and West Africa, respectively, and have caused human deaths. There is evidence of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Low pathogenicity H5 subtype (LPAI) viruses are endemic to migratory wild bird populations. They may mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes after transmission to poultry farms.

Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene revealed a close relationship to the QX-like genotype previously undetected in Sudan. Whole genome analysis of isolate IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 by next-generation sequencing revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides with 13 open reading frames: 5'-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c- 5a-5b-N-6b-3'. The highest 93% nucleotide sequence identity for the whole genome was found with the Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, the Italian IBV isolate ITA/90254/2005 and the vaccine strain 4/91. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene revealed that isolate IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 was clustered with viruses of the GI-19 lineage. The recombination analysis revealed different patterns of origin of the RNA in the Sudanese isolate in several genes. Multiple recombination sites were scattered throughout the genome, suggesting that the Sudan-QX-like strain emerged as a unique recombinant from multiple recombination events from parental viruses of genotypes 4/91, H120, and ITA/90254/2005. The Sudanese QX-like isolate is plausibly genetically distinct from IBV strains previously reported in Africa and elsewhere.",,"Naguib, M. M.;Hoper, D.;Arafa, A. S.;Setta, A.

1469,Sequence analysis of the porcine adenovirus serotype 5 fiber gene: evidence for recombination,"The nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence of the fiber gene of the HNF-61 strain of porcine adenovirus serotype 5 (PAdV-5) was determined and compared to that of the HNF-70 strain of the same serotype (Nagy et al., J Gen Virol 82, 525-529, 2001) and also to adenovirus fiber genes from the genera Mastadenovirus and Atadenovirus. The putative HNF-61 and HNF-70 proteins were similar to each other with 90% amino acid identity. Conserved amino acid sequences described for mastadenovirus fiber shafts were identified in the shaft regions of both PAdV-5 fibers, with the exception of the so-called TLWT motif. The head regions of the PAdV-5 fiber did not resemble any of the known mastadenovirus fiber heads, but they did show features of the fiber head protein sequences of viruses grouped in the proposed genus Atadenovirus (Benko et al., Virus Taxonomy, Seventh Report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, Academic Press, New York, San Diego, 2000, pp. 227-238).

1470,Dynamic evolution of endogenous retrovirus-derived genes expressed in bovine conceptions during the time of placentation,"In mammalian evolution, it is known that some of the essential genes for placental development are retroviral in origin, since syncytin-1, derived from an envelope gene (env) of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV), promotes cell fusion of the human placenta. Although the placenta performs the same function in all placental mammals, env-derived genes responsible for trophoblast cell fusion and maternal immune tolerance differ between species and remain largely unidentified in bovine species. To comprehensively investigate env-derived genes that play a role in bovine placental development, we determined the transcriptome profiles of bovine concepts during three crucial implantation windows using a high-throughput sequencer. The sequence reads were mapped into the bovine genome, where ERV candidates were annotated with RetroTector© (7,624 and 1,542 for ERV-derived and env-derived genes, respectively). Theming reads showed that approximately 18% (284 genes) of the env-derived genes in the genome were expressed during placental formation and approximately 4% (63 genes) were detected on all days examined. We have verified three env-derived genes expressed in trophoblast cells by polymerase chain reaction. Of these three, the sequence of the env-derived gene with the longest open reading frame (termed BERV-P env) showed high levels of expression in trophoblastic cell lines and was similar to that of the syncytin-Car1 genes found in dogs and cats, despite their different origins. These results suggest that placentation depends on various retrovirus-derived genes that may have replaced endogenous ancestors during evolution. © 2013 The author(s).",,"Nakagawa, S.;Bai, H.;Sakurai, T.;Nakaya, Y.;Konno, T.;Miyazawa, T.;Gojobori, T.;Imakawa, K.",2013.0,,10.1093/gbe/evt007,0
1471,Identification of isolates of European-type hepatitis E virus subtype 3e in Japanese wild boar: molecular tracking of HEV from swine to wild boar,"Nucleotide sequences of hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates infecting wild boar in Mie Prefecture, which is located in the central region of Japan and far from the most prevalent regions of HEV infection in Japan, have been determined and characterized . Of 144 wild boar serum samples collected in Mie Prefecture, 7 were positive for HEV RNA. The nucleotide sequence of almost the entire genome was determined for 4 of the 7 positive samples. Pedigree analysis showed that among the 7 isolates, 6 samples were subtype 3e and 1 subtype 3a. We identified indigenization of subtype 3e isolates in Japanese wild boar. In addition, 5 subtype 3e isolates were closely related and located in the peripheral branch of subtype 3e isolates from European countries in the pedigree. The structure showed that the ancestor of the 5 subtype 3e isolates came from Europe. The phylogenetic structure and coalescence analyzes suggested that the subtype 3e isolates entered Japan around 1966 through the importation of large breed pigs from Europe. The results also showed that several lineages of subtype 3e spread to a wide area of Japan around 1992 and 1 of the lineages was settled in wild boar in Mie Prefecture between 1992 and 2009. The occurrence of a wild boar cluster in the peripheral branch in the phylogenetic lineage may indicate the direction of gene flow of HEV subtype 3e from swine to wild boar. Clarifying the direction or route of transmission should be helpful in preventing future endemic or epidemic HEV infection. © 2013 Elsevier BV.",,"Nakano, T.;Takahashi, K.;Arai, M.;Okano, H.;Kato, H.;Ayada, M.;Okamoto, H.;Mishiro, S.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2013.06.004,0
1472,Dysfunction of the endogenous bovine retroviral K2 envelope glycoprotein is related to unsuccessful intracellular transport,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the remnants of retroviral infection of ancestral germ cells. Mutations introduced into ERVs halt production of infectious agents, but their impact on retroviral protein function is not fully understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are used in membrane fusion during virus entry, and we recently identified intact coding sequences for endogenous bovine retrovirus K1 (BERV-K1) and BERV-K2 envs. The amino acid sequences of BERV-K1 Env (also called Fematrin-1) and BERV-K2 Env are similar and both viruses are classified in the genus Betaretrovirus. While fematrin-1 plays an important role in cell-to-cell fusion in bovine placenta, the BERV-K2 envelope gene is poorly expressed in vivo and its recombinant Env protein is low due to inefficient surface (SU) cleavage of membrane fusion defective. and transmembrane subunits. Here, we performed chimeric analyzes of fematrin-1 and BERV-K2 envs and showed that defective maturation of BERV-K2 env contributed to failed intracellular transport. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis indicated that, unlike fematrin-1 env, BERV-K2 env could not be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network, where cellular proteases required for processing retroviral envs are located . We also identified that one of the responsive regions of this phenomenon was within a 65 amino acid region of BERV-K2 SU. This is the first report identifying that retroviral Env SU is involved in the regulation of intracellular transport and it may help elucidate the maturation process of fematrin-1 and other related Envs. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Nakaya, Y.;Miyazawa, T.",2014.0,,10.1128/jvi.00288-14,0

Most of the sequenced rumen reads resembled those of phage, which are critical to keeping rumen microbial populations below carrying capacity. Although identified in the rumen, most of these viruses have also been reported in other environments. Improvements in the viral DNA enrichment and isolation protocol are required to obtain data that are more representative of the rumen vioma.

1474,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis E virus in a Canadian swine production network,"Virus contamination along the production chain is a significant problem for both food safety and animal health. Pigs have been reported to act as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, sometimes emerging, and epidemiological studies have shown direct links between consumption of undercooked pork offal and cases of hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 in humans will. The presence of HEV in pig herds has been reported, but its prevalence in pork production environments is still unknown. To investigate viral sources of contamination in the swine industry, 452 environmental and faecal samples, including samples from livestock transport vehicles, were collected from ten farms and one slaughterhouse over a period of 11 months, which together represent a single production network. Hepatitis E virus RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in 32 samples both inside and outside farm buildings, on trucks and mainly from germ carriers collected at the slaughterhouse yard, e.g. B. on a commercial vehicle. Phylogenetic analysis showed a high diversity of genotype 3 HEV strains, similar to previously found human and pig strains. According to the results of this study, the movements of trucks and commercial vehicles could play an important role in the spread of HEVs on a slaughterhouse site and throughout the network.",,"Nantel-Fortier, N.;Letellier, A.;Lachapelle, V.;Fravalo, P.;Lâ€™Homme, Y.;Brassard, J.",2016.0,,10.1007/s12560-016-9252-6,0
1475,Genetic predisposition to acquire a polybasic cleavage site for the highly pathogenic avian influenza hemagglutinin,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with H5 and H7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes evolve from low pathogenic progenitors by acquiring multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been observed to occur naturally only in these HA subtypes, little is known about the genetic basis for acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that consecutive adenine residues and a stem-loop structure commonly found in the viral RNA region encodes amino acids around the cleavage site of low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses isolated from waterfowl reservoirs for nucleotide -Insertions in this are important RNA region. A reporter assay to detect non-template nucleotide insertions and deep sequence analysis of viral RNAs revealed that increased number of adenine residues and enlarged stem loop structure in the RNA region accelerated multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions leading to Formation of codons required for basic aminos are acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were mainly not observed in the viral RNA of other subtypes tested (H1, H2, H3 and H4). Our results suggest that RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide insertions, providing a clue as to why acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to the specific HA subtypes.<b>IMPORTANT< /b> Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H1 to -16) maintained in aquatic bird reservoirs of influenza A viruses, H5 and H7 viruses often become highly pathogenic by acquiring multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980s, the genetic basis for nucleotide insertions has remained unclear. This study shows the potential role of viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and demonstrates a key mechanism that explains why acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site in nature is restricted to specific HA subtypes. Our results will contribute to a better understanding of influenza A virus ecology and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines against H5 and H7 influenza A viruses with increased stability.",,"Nao, N.;Yamagishi, J.;Miyamoto, H.;Igarashi, M.;Manzoor, R.;Ohnuma, A.;Tsuda, Y.;Furuyama, W.;Shigeno, A.;Kajihara, M.;Kishida, N.;Yoshida, R.;Takada, A.",2017.0,02 14,,0
1476,Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of a novel picornavirus from pig feces in Japan,"study of fecal porcine viruses using a metagenomic approach identified a novel picornavirus in the faeces of a healthy two-month-old pig. This virus, named Porcine Picornavirus Japan (PPVJ), had a standard picornavirus genome organization, including the L protein region. The 5' untranslated region contained a type II internal ribosomal entry site. This virus was most closely related to lesavirus 1 (amino acid sequence identity: 38.2%) in P1, equine rhinitis A virus (25.8%) in P2 and the lesavirus 2 (40.9%) in P3. According to the genus delineations for the family Picornaviridae (less than 40%, 40%, and 50% amino acid sequence identity in P1, P2, and P3, respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. PPVJ was detected in 23.3% of faecal samples (from 58.3% of farms in a large area) from pigs under four months of age by reverse transcription PCR using specific primers designed from the 3D sequence followed by a sequencing.

1477,Six-year surveillance of Newcastle disease virus in wild birds in north-eastern Spain (Catalonia),"As Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the main threats to the poultry industry, testing for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in fatalities in wild birds (passive surveillance) has been carried out in Catalonia since 2010. The aim is to provide an early warning system to prevent infection of poultry. Since 2010, 35 wild bird deaths have been attributed to NDV infection. During this time, NDV gradually spread to new areas, with an increase in deaths, although it is not clear whether they were the result of the spread of the virus or improved surveillance. Phylogenetic analyzes indicate that two distinct sublineages of NDV, 4a and 4b, circulated in Catalonia. Both sublineages appear to be endemic in the wild bird population, affecting mainly Eurasian collared pigeons with a clear pattern in terms of their spatial distribution (consistent with the distribution of this species) and temporal distribution (with most cases falling between September and February). To date, endemicity in wild birds has not resulted in outbreaks of ND in poultry. However, there are still many uncertainties as to whether NDV can expand to new areas of Catalonia (with higher poultry densities), for example, or what threat the seemingly novel subline 4a could pose. Therefore, efforts should be made to promote measures to prevent infection of poultry farms (especially in high-risk areas and times) and to maintain surveillance.",,"Napp, S.;Alba, A.;Rocha, A.

1479,Long-term evolution of viruses: A Janus-faced equilibrium,"The popular textbook image of viruses as harmful and selfish genetic parasites grossly underestimates the beneficial contribution of viruses to the biosphere. Given viruses' critical dependence on reproducing in an intracellular environment, viruses that kill excessively (lyse) may cause their cellular hosts to become extinct and not survive. The lytic mode of viral replication must therefore be mitigated and balanced by non-lytic modes of viral latency and symbiosis. Here we review current bioinformatics and metagenomic studies to argue that viral endogenization and domestication may be more common mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangle diagram to explain the three main virus persistence strategies that explain the global scope of virus-cell interactions, including lysis, latency, and virus-cell symbiosis. This paradigm may help identify new directions in virology research where scientists could artificially gain control over switching between lytic and beneficial viral lifestyles.",,"Nasir, A.;Kim, K.

1480,Biological and molecular characterization of chicken anemia virus isolates of Indian origin,"In the present study, four isolates of chicken anemia virus (CAV) (CAV-A, -B, -E and -P) from different geographic regions of India were characterized. The CAV genome of a 1766 bp nucleotide region containing the entire coding region of the VP2 and VP3 proteins and a partial coding region of the VP1 protein were sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the Indian CAV isolates were aligned and compared to CAV isolates of European, Asian, American and Australian origin. A phylogenetic analysis of the Indian CAV isolates was also performed based on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. The results showed that Indian isolates were genetically engineered from different parts of the world. The Indian isolate CAV-A was found to be closely related to the European Cux-1 strain, CAV-B and -P were closely related to the Bangladeshi BD-3 strain, and CAV-E was closely related to the Australian strain 704. The pathogenicity of the four CAV isolates was investigated in day-old chicks that were specifically pathogen-free (SPF). One day old SPF chicks (n=50) were divided into five groups consisting of 10 chicks in each group. Group 1 was kept as a control and groups 2-5 were infected with each CAV isolate separately. The chicks were infected intramuscularly at a dose of 1 ml cell culture fluid (104.5 TCID50/0.1 ml) per bird. Clinical symptoms, mortality and packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight gain were recorded on days 5, 10 and 15 post-infection. On day 15, all birds were sacrificed and various organs, namely thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver and bursa were examined for gross and microscopic changes. The pathogenicity study showed that all CAVs except CAV-B were capable of inducing clinical disease and immunosuppression in young chicks, while isolate CAV-B did not induce clinical disease but only induced immunosuppression, which was confirmed by microscopic examination of the lymphatic organs was revealed.

1481,Comparison of exosomes purified by ultracentrifugation (UC) and Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) reagent from serum of Marek's disease virus (MDV) vaccinated and tumor-bearing chickens,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a collective term for microparticles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies produced by a variety of cells and released into interstitial spaces and body fluids. Serum exosomes can serve as invaluable biomarkers containing m/miRNAs, lipids and proteins indicative of various conditions. There are currently limited studies on the characterization and mutual consensus of biomarker profiles of serum exosomes purified by different methods. Here we compared the advantages and disadvantages of two commonly used serum exosome purification methods, including ultracentrifugation (UC) and Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) reagent, by analyzing exosome size distribution, concentration, morphology, and miRNA expression profiles. Serum was obtained from Marek's disease virus (MDV) infected chickens that were either vaccinated against Marek's disease (MD) and thus protected, or unvaccinated and bearing MDV-induced tumors. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to assess particle size, concentration, and morphological integrity, respectively. Our results show that the size distribution of the particles purified by both methods is consistent with that of exosomes (30-150 nm). The TEI reagent produced higher yields and co-isolated additional EV populations that are slightly larger (ca. 180 nm). Based on the miRNA expression profiles from a previous high-throughput sequencing experiment with small RNAs from exosomes, we selected six cellular and four MDV1 miRNAs to validate their expression in UC- and TEI-purified exosomes. The miRNA expression profiles showed relative correlation between the two methods, but marked differences were observed aplenty in TEI-purified exosomes, which showed higher miRNA expression consistent with higher yield than those purified by UC. TEI-purified exosomes from vaccinated chickens showed higher expression of tumor suppressor miRNA, gga-mir-146b, and the lowest expression of oncomiR, gga-mir-21 compared to those obtained from tumor-bearing chickens. We propose that gga-mir-146 and -21 may serve as serum exosome biomarkers for vaccine-induced protection and MD tumors, respectively.",,"Nath Neerukonda, S.;Egan, N.

The isolates showed a close antigenic relationship to the current vaccine strain (IND 17/77) in the microneutralization test using a vaccine strain (IND 17/77) antiserum and a peptide (aa 136-151 of the VP1 protein of the A22/Azerbaijan/65 strain) antiserum. However, the isolates showed minor antigenic differences in their reactivity with three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize trypsin-sensitive conformation-independent epitopes of the vaccine virus strains. The phylogenetic relationship between the isolates was performed using a portion of the ID gene (168 nucleotides at the 3' end). An additional seven Type A Indian field isolates previously reported were included in the analysis. The percentage similarity between the Indian isolates varied from 82.7% to 99.4% at the nucleotide level and from 83.9% to 100% at the amino acid level. These observations clearly show the genetic heterogeneity of the field isolates. The current vaccine strain IND 17/77 showed a deviation of 9.7% at the nucleotide level and 5.6% at the amino acid level from isolate A22 Iraq 24/64. The field strains deviated from the vaccine strain IND 17/77 by 5.6%-14.6% and 3.7%-13.7% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively.

Viral integration sites that contribute to oncogenesis are selected in tumor cells. Deep sequencing analysis of B-cell lymphoma DNA confirmed that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter is a common ALV integration target. Twenty-six unique proviral integration sites have been mapped between 46 and 3,552 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the TERT transcription start site, predominantly in the opposite transcriptional orientation to TERT from TERT in the opposite orientation, suggesting that the TERT promoter is bidirectional. This transcript appears to be an uncharacterized antisense RNA. We have previously shown that TERT expression is upregulated in tumors with integrations into the TERT promoter region. We now report that the viral promoter drives expression of a chimeric transcript containing viral sequences spliced to exons 4 to 7 of this antisense RNA. Clonal expansion of cells with ALV integrations driving overexpression of TERT antisense RNA suggests that it may play a role in tumorigenesis.

1486,Molecular biology of bovine viral diarrheal virus,"Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is arguably the most important viral agent of ruminants worldwide and can cause severe economic losses. Clinical symptoms of disease caused by BVDV range from subclinical to severe acute hemorrhagic syndrome, with disease severity being strain dependent. These viruses are classified as members of the pestivirus genus Flaviviridae. BVDV are thought to be primarily cattle pathogens but can infect most ruminant species. The virus particle consists of a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding the encapsulated genomic RNA. Inserted into the outer membrane are two virus-encoded glycoproteins that contain the virus' major antigenic determinants, as well as receptor-binding and cell-fusion functions. A third glycoprotein is weakly associated with the virion but also possesses unique features that play an important role in suppressing innate immunity. The viral proteins are encoded in a single, large open reading frame. The viral proteins are proteolytically cleaved from the polyprotein by various proteases. The structural proteins are processed by cellular signal peptidases, while the nonstructural proteins are processed by the viral serine protease. The virus is assembled and matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies of the cell.

However, these studies have been hampered by the difficulty, time, and expense of individually generating full-length sequences from each archived sample. Next-generation sequencing technologies have been used to analyze clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new, uncharacterized viruses from a range of virus families. The use of these sequencing technologies would be beneficial in studying viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing method was used to simultaneously and rapidly sequence multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This method used primers consisting of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3' end, which also served as an identifying barcode allowing differentiation of each viral library after pooling and sequencing. This conferred sequence independence through random priming of both first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a nuclease cocktail to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by double-stranded cDNA synthesis with single-tube random priming. The resulting cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size-fractionated, and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. The individual virus genomes were readily assembled by both de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This method consistently resulted in near full-length, if not full-length, genomic sequences and has been used to sequence multiple rinderpestivirus and coronavirus isolates simultaneously.",,"Neill, J.

1488,Genetic relationship of caliciviruses: San Miguel sea lions and porcine virus vesicular rash form a single genotype within the Caliciviridae,"San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSV) and swine vesicular rash (VESV) are morphologically and antigenically related, but little has been done to determine their genotypic relationship to each other and to other caliciviruses. To examine this relationship, reverse transcriptase PCRs were performed using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the 2C RNA helicase-like and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as die were developed. The 2C RNA helicase primers directed amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer captures amplified products from all but one of these viruses. The phylogenetic comparison of the caliciviruses showed that SMSV, VESV and four related viruses are closely related but distinct from feline calicivirus, human caliciviruses (small round-structured viruses) and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and should be classified as one virus only genotype within the Caliciviridae.",,"Neill, J.

Based on the need for immunosuppression in xenotransplantation, procedures developed to increase safety in allotransplantation may be applied in future xenotransplantation clinical trials. Standardized approaches can be developed to guide the evaluation of common infectious syndromes in xenograft recipients. The opportunity created by the screening of pigs intended as xenograft donors is equally applicable to allografts - particularly broader screening strategies for allograft donors, such as: Treatment considerations for allograft and xenograft-associated infections are largely the same. Experience in xenotransplantation will continue to inform thinking about donor infections in allotransplantation. We anticipate that experience in managing complex allograft recipients will be similarly incorporated into xenotransplantation clinical trials.",,"Nellore, A.;Fishman, J.

To describe the evolution of swine influenza A viruses in Mexico and to evaluate strains for vaccine development, we sequenced the genomes of 59 viruses and performed antigenic mapping on strains from 5 regions. We found that genetic and antigenic diversity was particularly high in southeastern Mexico, as viruses were repeatedly introduced to other regions of Mexico from humans and pigs. We identified novel reassortant H3N2 viruses with genome segments derived from two different viruses introduced independently into pigs from humans: pandemic H1N1 viruses and seasonal H3N2 viruses. The Mexican swine viruses are antigenically distinct from US swine lines. US viral vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against these viruses and would require the development of new vaccines specifically targeting these different strains.",,"Nelson, M.

1491,Evolutionary pathways of N2 neuraminidases from porcine and human influenza A viruses: origin of the neuraminidase genes of two reassortants (H1N2) isolated from pigs.,"The complete nucleotide sequences of the neuraminidase (NA) genes of two reassortants (H1N2) and two H3N2 influenza A viruses isolated from pigs were determined, and phylogenetic relationships between these and previously reported N2 NA genes were examined . Based on pairwise nucleotide sequence identity, the NA genes of two reassortants, A/sw/Kanagawa/2/78 and A/sw/Ehime/1/80, were most closely related to those of the human influenza A virus strains encoded in were isolated in 1972 or the earliest available swine H3N2 influenza A viruses. Pedigrees showed that the NA genes can be divided into three groups, including lineages for (i) porcine strains, (ii) the earliest human strain, and (iii) more recent human strains. The evolutionary tree for the 11 nucleotide and amino acid sequences suggested that the NAs of A/sw/HK/4/76 and A/sw/Kanagawa/2/78 belong to the lineage for newer human viruses. In contrast, the NA genes of the A/sw/HK/3/76 and H1N2 reassortant A/sw/Ehime/1/80 viruses were found to be of porcine origin. The porcine virus NA genes were further characterized by the co-circulation of two distinct lineages. Although the rates of synonymous (silent) substitutions for the porcine and human viruses were nearly identical (0.00946 to 0.00884 per site per year), the rate of non-synonymous (amino acid altering) substitutions for porcine virus NA- About 60% of the genes for the human virus.",,"Nerome, K.;Kanegae, Y.;Yoshioka, Y.;Itamura, S.;Ishida, M.;Gojobori, T.;Oya, A.",1991.0,,,0
1492,"Approved and experimental countermeasures against pestivirus diseases: bovine viral diarrhea, classical swine fever and border disease","The pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), classical swine fever (CSFV) and border disease virus, are important pathogens affecting livestock in many countries, but current vaccines do not completely prevent the spread of infection. Control of pestivirus diseases is particularly difficult due to the constant viraemia and viral shedding of persistently infected (PI) animals, which must be identified and eliminated to prevent disease transmission. Existing vaccines are limited by the delay between vaccination and the onset of protection, the difficulty in distinguishing serologically between vaccinated and naturally infected animals, and the need for broad vaccine cross-protection against different virus strains. Antiviral therapy could potentially complement vaccination by providing immediate protection in the event of an outbreak. Numerous compounds with in vitro antiviral activity against BVDV have been identified through its role as a surrogate for the hepatitis C virus. Fewer drugs active against CSFV have been identified, but many compounds active against BVDV are likely to inhibit CSFV due to their similar genomic sequences. While in vitro research has been promising, the lack of animal efficacy studies has hampered the commercial development of effective antiviral drugs against the pestiviruses. In this article, we summarize the clinical syndromes and transmission routes of BVD, CSF, and border disease, discuss currently approved vaccines, review efforts to develop antiviral therapies for use in outbreak control, and suggest promising directions for future research. © 2013 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Newcomer, B.

1493,Characterization of a rotavirus,"Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of disease in children, calves and piglets and causes severe economic losses in domestic animals. Although some outbreaks of gastroenteritis are associated with bacterial pathogens, particularly Escherichia coli, until recently no known pathogens had been isolated from a significant proportion of outbreaks, other than viruses with a distinct morphology and antigen similarity associated with diarrhea in piglets, calves and children were found . These viruses are important pathogens and viruses isolated from humans have also been shown to be contagious to pigs. Originally, these viruses were described as reovirus-like, but the names rotavirus and duovirus were later proposed. They differ morphologically and antigenically from both reoviruses and orbiviruses, and also differ from them in some of their physicochemical properties. Studies on the structure of rotaviruses have been limited to the nucleic acid of calf virus and related infant mouse epizootic diarrhea virus (EDIM). Both viruses have been shown to contain RNA, and it has been suggested that calf virus RNA may be double-stranded. The results of the experiments described here indicate that calf rotavirus possesses some of the features characteristic of the Reo and bluetongue viruses and should be classified with them. Although calf rotavirus has a smaller sedimentation coefficient and differs morphologically from the Reo and bluetongue viruses, the segmented and double-stranded nature of its RNA and the number and molecular weight of the RNA and polypeptides suggest that it should be considered a member of the group of Reo and bluetongue viruses. However, its exact relationship to the other members of the group will require extensive cross-hybridization studies of the viral RNAs.",,"Newman, J. F. E.;Brown, F.;Bridger, J. C.;Woode, G.

1494,"Oral papillomatosis caused by Enhydra lutris papillomavirus 1 (ElPV-1) in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) in California, USA","The southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) is an endangered marine warden. During postmortem examinations of stranded sea otters from 2004 to 2013 in California, USA, papillomas in the oral cavity of at least seven otters were detected by autopsy and histopathology. Next-generation sequencing of virus particles purified from a single papilloma revealed a novel papillomavirus, Enhydra lutris papillomavirus 1 (ElPV-1). The genome of ElPV-1 was obtained, representing the first fully sequenced southern sea otter viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire L1 gene, as well as a diagram of the chained protein identities of all papillomaviral genes, revealed that ElPV-1 is a β-papillomavirus related to a raccoon papillomavirus (Procyon lotor papillomavirus type 1) and a canine oral papillomavirus is. Immunohistochemical staining using a bovine papillomavirus cross-reactive antibody suggested that ElPV-1 is present in intranuclear inclusions and intracytoplasmic keratin grains. Virus-infected cells were scattered throughout the granular and spinal stratum of the gingival and buccal papillomas. Using ElPV-1 specific PCR, we confirmed viral DNA in oral papillomas from all seven-stranded sea otters with identical L1 sequences.

Metagenomics revealed a novel seal anellovirus (SealAV) that phylogenetically aggregates with anelloviruses from California sea lions and domestic cats. Using specific PCR, SealAV was identified in lung tissue from two out of five animals involved in the 2000 fatality and in one out of 20 seal samples examined postmortem in 2008. The identification of SealAV over several years shows that this virus is persistent in the seal population. SealAV is the second anellovirus to be reported in the lungs of pinnipeds, suggesting that anellovirus infections are common in marine mammals and that more research is needed to understand the role of these viruses in marine mammal health and disease.",,"Ng, T.

1496,A metagenomics and case-control study to identify viruses implicated in bovine respiratory disease,"Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a common health problem for both dairy and beef cattle, resulting in significant economic losses. To identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomic approach to enrich for and sequence viral nucleic acids in nasal swabs from 50 young dairy cows with symptoms of BRD. Numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified after deep sequencing, de novo assembly, and similarity searches for translated protein sequences. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and several bovine rhinitis B virus genotypes have been identified . The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses have also been partially or fully sequenced. Real-time PCR was used to compare the detection rates of the eight viruses generating the most reads in the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 site-matched healthy controls. Viruses were detected in 68% of the BRD-affected animals compared to 16% of the healthy control animals. 38% of the sick animals compared to 8% of the control animals were infected with several respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (P<0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P=0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (P=0.006), which either Animals with BRD were detected alone or in combination in 62% of cases.

1497,Discovery of a novel single-stranded DNA virus from a sea turtle fibropapilloma using viral metagenomics,"Viral metagenomics, consisting of viral particle purification and shotgun sequencing, is a powerful technique for discovering viruses associated with diseases without a definitive etiology, viruses that share limited homology with known viruses, or viruses that cannot be cultured . Here, we used viral metagenomics to study viruses associated with sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating neoplastic disease affecting sea turtles worldwide. A novel single-stranded DNA virus, sea turtle tornovirus 1 (STTV1), was discovered by purification and shotgun sequencing of the viral community directly from the fibropapilloma of a Florida green sea turtle. The single-stranded, circular genome of Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl was approximately 1,800 nucleotides long. Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl shows only weak identities at the amino acid level (25%) with the chicken anemia virus in short regions of its genome; therefore STTV1 could represent the first member of a new virus family. A total of 35 healthy turtles and 27 turtles with FP were tested for STTV1 by PCR, and only 2 turtles severely affected by FP were positive. The affected turtles were systemically infected with Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl since STTV1 was found in the blood and all major organs. Sâ€²lâ€²lâ€²Vl exists as a quasi-species, with multiple genome variants identified in the fibropapilloma of each positive turtle, suggesting rapid evolution of this virus. The STTV1 variants were identical over most of their genomes but contained a hypervariable region with strong divergence. This study demonstrates the potential of viral metagenomics to discover novel viruses directly from animal tissue, which may improve our understanding of viral evolution and diversity.

This study identified a novel California sea lion anellovirus (ZcAV) with 35% amino acid identity in the ORF1 region to feline anelloviruses. The double-stranded replicative form of ZcAV has been detected in lung tissue, suggesting that ZcAV replicates in sea lion lungs. Specific PCR showed the presence of ZcAV in the lung tissue of all three sea lions involved in the fatality, but not in three other sea lions from the same zoo. In addition, ZcAV has been detected at low frequency (11%) in the lungs of wild sea lions. The higher prevalence of ZcAV and the presence of the double-stranded replicative form in sea lion lungs due to fatality suggests that ZcAV has been associated with the death of these animals.",,"Ng, T.

1500,"Development and evaluation of a non-ribosomal random PCR and next-generation sequencing-based assay for the detection and sequencing of hand, foot and mouth disease pathogens","BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has become a major public health problem in Asia-Pacific and is commonly caused by enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6), CV -A10 and created CV-A16. Generating entire genome sequences of pathogens is essential for understanding their evolutionary biology. The frequent exchange between EV serotypes and a limited number of available whole genome sequences hinder the development of overlapping PCRs for whole genome sequencing. We have developed and evaluated a next-generation non-ribosomal randomized PCR (rPCR) and sequencing-based assay for sequence-independent whole genome amplification and sequencing of HFMD pathogens. A total of 16 EV-A71/CV-A6/CV-A10/CV-A16 PCR-positive rectal/pharyngeal swabs (Cp values: 20.9-33.3) were used for the assay interpretation. RESULTS: Our assay apparently outperformed conventional rPCR in terms of total number of EV-A71 reads and percentage of EV-A71 reads: 2.6% (1275/50,000 reads) vs. 0.1% (31/50,000 ) and 6% (3008/50,000) vs. 0.9% (433/50,000) for two samples with Cp values of 30 and 26, respectively. In addition, the assay was able to detect genomic sequences with 94-100% coverage from 4 different Generate enterovirus serotypes in 73% of the samples tested, representing the first full genome sequences of CV-A6/10/16 from Vietnam, and was able to correctly assign serotyping results in 100% of the 24 samples tested. For all but three, the consensus results obtained from two replicates of the same sample were 100% identical, indicating that our assay is highly reproducible.

1502,Identification and genomic characterization of a novel porcine parvovirus (PPV6) in China,"Background: Parvoviruses are divided into two subfamilies based on their host range: the Parvovirinae, which infect vertebrates, and the Densovirinae, which mainly infect insects and other arthropods. In recent years, a number of new parvoviruses belonging to the subfamily Parvovirinae have been identified in various animal species and humans, including human parvovirus 4 (PARV4), porcine hokovirus, ovine partetravirus, porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4) and porcine Parvovirus 5 (PPV5). Methods: A novel parvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae, distinct from all known parvoviruses, was identified by sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) and five full-length genomic sequences were determined and analyzed. Results: A novel porcine parvovirus, tentatively named PPV6, was originally identified in aborted pig fetuses in China. Retrospective studies showed that the prevalence of PPV6 appeared to be higher in aborted pig fetuses and piglets (50% and 75%, respectively) than in finishers and sows (15.6% and 3.8%, respectively). In addition, the prevalence of PPV6 in finishers in affected and unaffected herds was similar (ie 16.7% vs. 13.6%-21.7%). This finding indicates that the age of the animals, possibly due to increased innate immune resistance, strongly influences the level of PPV6 viremia. Whole genome sequencing and multiple alignments have shown that the nearly complete genome sequence was approximately 6,100 nucleotides in length and shared 20.5%-42.6% DNA sequence identity with other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PPV6 was significantly different from other known parvoviruses and was most closely related to PPV4. Conclusion: Our results and review of published parvovirus sequences suggested that a novel porcine parvovirus is currently circulating in China and could potentially be placed in the novel genus Copiparvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. However, the clinical manifestations of PPV6 are still unknown as the prevalence of PPV6 was similar in a retrospective epidemiological study between healthy pigs and diseased pigs.

SVDV is the causative agent of a highly contagious (though rarely fatal) vesicular disease in pigs. We report a rapid method suitable for sequencing the complete protein coding sequences of SVDV isolates in which the RNA is relatively intact. The approach couples a single PCR amplification reaction, using only a single set of PCR primers to amplify the nearly complete SVDV genome, with deep sequencing using a small fraction of the capacity of a Roche GS FLX sequencing platform. Sequences were initially verified by one of two criteria; either a match between a de novo array and a reference map, or a match between all five different reference maps performed against a fixed set of starting reference genomes with significant genetic distances within the same virus species. All reference assignments used an iterative method to avoid bias. Further verification was achieved through phylogenetic analysis using published SVDV genomes and additional enterovirus B sequences.

Although the VP7, VP4, and VP6 gene sequences of Japanese swine RVCs are currently available, there are no whole genome sequence data from Japanese RVCs. In addition, only one to three sequences are available for porcine RVC VP1-VP3 and NSP1-NSP3 genes. Therefore, we determined almost complete genome sequences of nine Japanese porcine RVCs from seven piglets with diarrhea and two healthy pigs and compared them to published RVC sequences from a database. The VP7 genes of two Japanese RVCs from healthy pigs differed greatly from other known RVC strains and were tentatively classified as G12 and G13 based on the 86% nucleotide identity cutoff. Pairwise sequence identity calculations and phylogenetic analysis revealed that candidates for novel Japanese swine RVC genotypes were identified in the genes encoding NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3, respectively. Furthermore, VP3 of Japanese pig RVCs was shown to be closely related to human RVCs, suggesting gene rearrangement between pig and human RVCs and earlier interspecies transmission. The present study demonstrated that porcine RVCs exhibit greater genetic diversity among strains than human and bovine RVCs.",,"Niira, K.;Ito, M.;Masuda, T.;Saitou, T.;Abe, T.;Komoto, S.;Sato, M.;Yamasato, H.;Kishimoto, M.;Naoi, Y.;Sano, K.;Tuchiaka, S.;Okada, T.;Omatsu, T.;Furuya, T.;Aoki, H.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Shirai, J.;Taniguchi, K.;Mizutani, T.;Nagai, M.",2016.0,10,,1
1509,Different RNA splicing mechanisms contribute to different infection sequences of classical swine fever viruses of different virulence: insights from deep sequencing data in porcine umbilical vein endothelial cells,"Molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of RNA splicing in response to viral infection are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in porcine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV using both Shimen and C strains. The number of clean tags obtained from the control and both CSFV-infected libraries was 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493, respectively. When comparing between the control, CSFV-C and CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158 and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analyzes showed that many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signaling pathway, etc., with processes differing between CSFV strains of different virulence. To further elucidate important mechanisms related to differential infection by the CSFV-shimen and -C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess the significantly expressed genes only by the CSFV-shimen or CSFV-C strain . GO analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and C strains disrupted SUVEC 'RNA splicing', resulting in differential 'gene expression' in SUVEC. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant response regulator contributing to the impact on SUVEC function for CSFV shimen. This computational study suggests that CSFV of different virulence could induce changes in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to alter cellular metabolism, leading to acute bleeding and pathologic damage or infectious tolerance.",,"Ning, P.;Zhou, Y.;Liang, W.;Zhang, Y.",2016.0,,10.7717/peerj.2113,0
1510,Whole genome analysis of fifteen torque teno midi virus variants classifiable in a third group of the genus Anellovirus,"Recently, we identified a novel human virus with a 3.2 kb circular DNA genome, tentatively named torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a genomic organization similar to that of torque teno virus ( TTV) of 3.8-3.9 kb and Torque-Teno-Mini resembles virus (TTMV) of 2.8-2.9 kb. To examine the extent of genomic variability of TTMDV genomes, the full-length sequence was determined for 15 TTMDV isolates obtained from viremic individuals in Japan. The 15 TTMDV isolates ranged in length from 3175-3230 bases and shared 67.0-90.3% identities with each other and were only 68.4-73.0% identical to the 3 reported TTMDV isolates across the entire genome. TTMDV possessed a four open reading frame (ORF1-ORF4) genomic organization with characteristic sequence motifs and stem and loop structures with high GC content, similar to TTV and TTMV. The total of 18 TTMDV genomes differed in the amino acid sequence of ORF1 (658-677 amino acids) by up to 60.7% from each other, but phylogenetically separated into the same cluster distantly related to the TTVs and TTMVs. These results show that TTMDV, with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, has an extremely high degree of genomic variability and is classifiable into a third group in the genus Anellovirus.",,"Ninomiya, M.;Takahashi, M.;Shimosegawa, T.;Okamoto, H.",2007.0,Oct,,0
1511,Monoclonal antibodies against the HN glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus. Biological characterization and use for strain comparisons,"We have isolated nine hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies directed against the HN glycoprotein of the D26 strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and divided them into three groups based on their biological reactivities. Group I antibodies from six clones had high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization titers and demonstrated neuraminidase inhibition (NI) activity with substrates, both bovine fetuin and N-acetylneuramine lactose, although levels of maximal inhibition were greater with the former substrate . Group II antibodies from two clones also had high HI activity, but displayed a highly substrate-dependent NI with efficient inhibition against fetuin and a complete lack of inhibition against neuraminactose. These antibodies had neutralizing capacity, but the titers were much lower than those of group I antibodies. One clone (Group III) secreted antibodies showing HI and NI with each substrate but no detectable neutralizing activity. The frequency of isolation of antigenic variants and competitive binding assays have shown that group I and group II antibodies can recognize different regions that do not overlap, whereas antibodies placed in each of the two groups go to the same overlapping regions belong. The group III site appeared close to or overlapping the group I determinant but distinct from the group II region. Using the isolated monoclonal antibodies, we compared seven heterologous strains by HI and neutralization assays and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results indicated that the regions recognized by group I antibodies were conserved among strains, while those of the other two antibody groups could undergo considerable variation.",,"Nishikawa, K.;Isomura, S.;Suzuki, S.",1983.0,,,0

1515,"Epidemiological study of H9 avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, Tembusu virus, goose parvovirus and goose circovirus infection in geese in China","To deepen the knowledge of epidemic prevalence in the field of goose farming, a triplex PCR assay was developed and 478 samples were collected from Chinese goose farms in 11 provinces in China. The results of this epidemiological survey showed that the incidence rates of H9 avian influenza and goose circovirus were highest among the five infectious diseases studied. In addition, the triplex PCR assay has demonstrated remarkable sensitivity, speed, and versatility compared to other diagnostic methods. Dual infections accounted for a large fraction of co-infections in the field, with the combinations of H9/Tembusu, H9/goose circovirus, and goose circovirus/tembusu co-infected cases occurring more frequently. Epidemics were more severe in winter and spring. In addition, significant differences in the prevalence of these infectious diseases associated with different age groups were observed. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis determined by the neighbor joining method was performed to examine the evolution of these viruses during the study period. For the most part, the virus strains isolated during the study were consistent with most strains from geese origins isolated from mainland China in recent years. However, mutations between isolated H9 avian influenza virus strains and sequences available from GenBank have been observed that should attract much attention.",,"Niu, X.;Wang, H.;Wei, L.;Zhang, M.;Yang, J.;Chen, H.;Tang, Y.;Diao, Y.",2018.0,Apr,,0

Although it was first isolated in 2001, serological evidence suggests that hMPV has been present in the human population since the 1950s.

1518,Pestivirus infection in cattle dairy farms: E2 glycoprotein ELISA demonstrates the presence of bovine viral diarrheal virus type 2 in north-western Italy,"Background: Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2 are members of the pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. This genus also includes the HoBi-like virus, tentatively classified as BVDV type 3. BVDV-1 is widespread in Italy despite the extensive use of BVDV-1 based vaccines, while BVDV-2 and HoBi-like pestivirus have been occasionally detected. Monitoring for the emergence of sporadic or atypical pestiviruses is a useful approach to assessing the need for additional vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control programs. Results: In this study we developed a multiwell antibody ELISA based on the recombinant E2 protein of the three bovine pestiviruses. We evaluated the applicability of the assay for monitoring purposes using pooled milk samples each prepared from a maximum of 35 lactating cows and collected from 176 dairy herds. As expected, the majority of the pooled samples reacted more strongly against the BVDV-1 E2 antigen. However, all three milk pools from a single farm reacted to the BVDV-2 antigen. Further analysis using spot testing, antigen detection and 5' UTR region sequence analysis confirmed the presence of five persistently infected calves carrying a BVDV-2a strain. Conclusions: This study underscores for the first time that sporadic circulation of BVDV-2 can be predicted by immunoenzymatic methods without specific vaccination.",,"Nogarol, C.;Decaro, N.;Bertolotti, L.;Colitti, B.;Iotti, B.;Petrini, S.;Lucente, M.

1521,Differential Expression of Porcine MicroRNAs in African Swine Fever Virus-Infected Pigs: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Background: African swine fever (ASF) is a re-emerging devastating viral disease that is currently threatening the swine industry worldwide. MicroRNAs are a class of 17-25 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that have been shown to have critical functions in a variety of biological processes, such as B. cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, regulation of immunity and virus infections by cleavage or translational repression of mRNAs. However, there is no information on miRNA expression in ASFV infection. Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, we analyzed miRNAs expressed in spleens and submandibular lymph nodes of experimentally infected pigs with a virulent (E75) or a derived attenuated (E75CV1) ASFV strain and at various time points post-infection were expressed -infection with the virulent strain by high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries. Results: In ASPV infection, the spleen showed a more differentiated expression pattern than the lymph nodes. Of the most abundant miRNAs, 12 were differentially expressed in both tissues at two different time points in animals infected with the virulent strain. Of these, miR-451, miR-145-5p, miR-181a and miR-122 showed upregulation late in time after infection, while miR-92a, miR-23a, miR-92b-3p, miR-126-5p , miR-126-3p, miR-30d, miR-23b and miR-92c showed downregulation. Of the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs identified at the same time post-infection in animals infected with the virulent strain compared to animals infected with its attenuated strain, miR-126-5p, miR-92c, miR-92a, miR-30e-5p and miR-500a-5p showed upregulation, while miR-125b, miR-451 and miR-125a were downregulated. All of these miRNAs have been shown to be associated with cellular genes involved in signaling pathways related to immune response, virus-host interactions, as well as several viral genes. Conclusion: Studying miRNA expression will contribute to a better understanding of African swine fever virus pathogenesis, which is essential for the development of any disease control strategy.",,"NÃºÃ±ez-HernÃ¡ndez, F.;PÃ©rez, L.

1522,Identification of microRNAs in pigs subclinically infected with PCV2 by high-throughput sequencing,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the major etiological infectious agent of PCV2 systemic disease and has been associated with other swine diseases, all collectively known as porcine circovirus diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miRNAs play an increasing role in many biological processes. The study of miRNA-mediated host-pathogen interactions has evolved over the past decade because of the important role miRNAs play in antiviral defense. The aim of this study was to identify the miRNA expression pattern in pigs subclinically infected and uninfected with PCV2. For this purpose, an experimental PCV2 infection was performed and small RNA libraries were constructed from tonsils and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) of infected and uninfected pigs. High-throughput sequencing determined differences in miRNA expression in MLN between infected and uninfected, while a highly conserved pattern was observed in tonsils. In MLN, miRNA 126-3p, miRNA 126-5p, let-7d-3p, mir-129a, and mir-let-7b-3p were upregulated, while mir-193a-5p, mir-574-5p, and mir-34a were upregulated down regulated. Functional analysis prediction indicated that these miRNAs may be involved in signaling pathways related to the immune system and in processes related to PCV2 pathogenesis, although functional assays are needed to support these predictions. This is the first study of miRNA gene expression in PCV2-infected pigs using a high-throughput sequencing approach in which multiple host miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to PCV2 infection.",,"NÃºÃ±ez-HernÃ¡ndez, F.;PÃ©rez, L.

1523,African swine fever virus does not express viral microRNAs in experimentally infected pigs,"Background: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF), a recurrent devastating and highly fatal hemorrhagic viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The discovery of virus-specific miRNAs has increased in both number and importance in recent years. We recently described the differential expression of several porcine miRNAs during in vivo infection with attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here we extended these studies to identify the presence of viral miRNAs encoded by ASFV in swine infection in vivo. Results: Sixteen small RNA libraries were analyzed from spleens and submandibular lymph nodes obtained from eight pigs, seven of which were infected with either the virulent E75 ASFV strain or its attenuated counterpart E75CV1, or from pigs infected with the E75CV1 Survived infection and challenged with BA71 (heterologous challenge) with an uninfected negative control. Samples were taken at different time points after infection. Libraries were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. First, some viral miRNA candidates that did not correspond to the porcine miRNAs were identified. Further structural analysis was performed to confirm whether they met the conformational requirements to be considered viral miRNA. Conclusions: Analysis of sixteen small RNA libraries prepared from two different tissues from pigs experimentally infected with E75, E75CV1, or with E75CV1 plus BA71 revealed the presence of six potential miRNA sequences, but none of them matched the requirements to be considered viral miRNAs. From this we can conclude that ASFV does not express miRNAs in vivo, at least under the experimental conditions described here.",,"NÃºÃ±ez-HernÃ¡ndez, F.;Vera, G.;SÃ¡nchez, A.;RodrÃ­guez, F.;NÃºÃ±ez, J.

The genus Teschovirus contains a single species Teschovirus A, which currently includes 13 serotypes. In the present study, we identified novel PTVs distantly related to Teschovirus A found in fecal samples from pigs with and without diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid (aa) sequences of the entire coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses were not clustered with PTV strains or other strains within picornavirus supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not have belonged to Teschovirus A or either other genus belong to the family Picornaviridae. These novel PTVs share an internal Type IV ribosomal entry site and conserved characteristic motifs in the coding region, but exhibit 62.2-79.0%, 86.6-92.8%, 77.1-81.0% and 84.3-86.7%. aa identities with PTV strains in P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D regions, respectively.

We obtained a partially complete genome of 15,114 nucleotides. The phylogenetic relatedness based on the fusion gene and genomic sequence grouped our isolate as genotype VI class II, a group of viruses commonly isolated from wild birds but potentially lethal to chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). The fusion gene isolate clustered with PPMV-I strains from pigeons (Columbidae) in Nigeria. The full genome showed a basal and highly divergent ancestry to American, European, and Asian phyla, indicating a divergent evolutionary pathway.

1530,Molecular evolution of human enteroviruses: correlation of serotype with VP1 sequence and application to picornavirus classification,"Sixty-six human enterovirus serotypes have been identified by serum neutralization, but the molecular determinants of the serotypes are unknown. Since the picornavirus VP1 protein contains a number of neutralization domains, we hypothesized that the VP1 sequence should correspond to the neutralization (serotype) and thus to the phylogenetic ancestry. To test this hypothesis and analyze the phylogenetic relationships among human enteroviruses, we determined the full length VP1 sequences of prototype strains of 47 human enterovirus serotypes and 10 antigenic variants. Our sequences, together with those available from GenBank, form a database of complete VP1 sequences for all 66 human enterovirus serotypes plus additional strains of seven serotypes. Phylogenetic trees constructed from full VP1 sequences produced the same four major clusters as published trees based on partial VP2 sequences; however, in contrast to the VP2 trees, strains of the same serotype were always monophyletic in the VP1 trees. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1 sequences, enteroviruses of the same serotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous serotypes, and the limits of intraserotypic divergence appeared to be around 25% nucleotide sequence difference or 12% amino acid sequence difference. Pairwise comparisons suggested that coxsackieviruses A11 and A15 should be classified as strains of the same serotype, as should coxsackieviruses A13 and A18. Pairwise identity scores also discriminated between enteroviruses of different clusters and enteroviruses of picornaviruses of different genera. The data suggest that VP1 sequence comparisons may be valuable in enterovirus typing and in picornavirus taxonomy, aiding in genus assignment of unclassified picornaviruses.",,"Oberste, M.

1531,Genomic evidence that simian virus 2 and six other simian picornaviruses represent a new genus of Picornaviridae,"Analysis of the VP1 capsid protein coding region of simian virus (SV) 2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45 and SV49 shows that they are distinct from members of the enterovirus genus and from members of other existing picornavirus genera. To further characterize this group of viruses and clarify their classification within the Picornaviridae, we determined the complete genomic sequence of SV2 (8126 nucleotides). The genome was typical of members of the Picornaviridae and encoded a single open reading frame. The putative polyprotein contained typical picornavirus protease cleavage sites, resulting in mature proteins homologous to each of the known picornavirus proteins. SV2 contained an amino-terminal extension of the reading frame analogous to the leader protein of members of the genera Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus and Teschovirus, but there was no significant amino acid homology with any of these known leader proteins. The 2A protein also matched poorly with the 2A proteins of other picornaviruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of the structural and non-structural SV2 proteins were related to, but phylogenetically distinct from, those of enteroviruses and human rhinoviruses. The key distinguishing features of SV2 were the presence of a type 2 internal ribosomal entry site in the 5-NTR, a putative leader protein encoded upstream by the structural proteins, and an unusually large 2A protein. Based on the molecular analysis, we propose that SV2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, SV49 and porcine enterovirus 8 be classified as members of a new genus in Picornaviridae and that SV2 (strain 2383) be designated as the species strain . © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

All viruses examined in this study belonged to the species BVDV-1 with BVDV-1a as the prominent subtype (97%). Also the subtypes BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1e were first identified in Ireland. Pairwise alignments of 225 viruses with complete sequences for the 5-UTR and the Npro region were performed to determine a low conflict threshold for viral strain differentiation. One hundred and seventy seven unique viral strains have been identified. The study found a significant level of herd aggregation of strains, but no geographic or temporal aggregation. Similar virus strains have been identified in different counties, provinces and years, indicating the potential to study the epidemiology of the disease by combining sequence analysis with animal movement data.",,"O'Brien, E.;Garvey, M.;Walsh, C.;Arkins, S.;Cullinane, A.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.rvsc.2016.10.017,0
1533,High-throughput genome sequencing of bioaerosols in broiler production facilities,"Chronic inhalation exposure to agricultural dust promotes the development of chronic respiratory diseases in poultry workers. Poultry dust consists of dander, chicken feed, litter and microbes. However, the microbial composition and abundance has not been fully elucidated. Genomic DNA was extracted from settled dust and personal inhalable dust collected while performing garbage sampling or collection tasks. DNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using a paired-end sequencing-by-synthesis approach. < 2% of all reads). Staphylococcus sp. AL1, Salinicoccus carnicancri and Lactobacillus crispatus were the most abundant bacterial species in personal exposure samples of inhalable dust. Settled dust showed moderate relative abundances of these species, as well as Staphylococcus lentus and Lactobacillus salivarius. There was a statistical difference between the microbial composition of aerosolized and settled dust. In contrast to the composition of the deposited dust, the composition of the aerosolized dust showed minor deviations between the samples. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of the microbial composition and relative abundance of personal inhalable poultry dust and deposited poultry dust.",,"O'Brien, K. M.;Chimenti, M.

The prevalence of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 infections and their genotypes in Mongolian animals have not been studied. In this study, we investigated BVDV infection in dairy cattle and yaks from Bornuur and Bulgan counties by RT-PCR, and the average infection rate at the sampling sites was 15.8% and 20.0%, respectively. In addition, molecular features of the 5'-UTR region of the BVDV genome in Mongolian cattle and yaks have been identified as belonging to subtypes BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a, respectively.

1535,Characterization and spread of a potyvirus associated with passion fruit wood disease in Uganda,"This article describes the incidence and etiology of a passion fruit viral disease in Uganda. Symptoms, including those characteristic of passion fruit wood disease (PWD), were observed in 32% of crops in growing areas. Electron microscopic observations of infected tissue showed flexible filaments of approximately 780 nanometers. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicated a serological relationship to cowpea aphid mosaic virus (CABMV) and passion fruit ringspot virus (PFRSV). In host range studies, only species of the families Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae were susceptible, and neither Vigna unguiculata nor Phaseolus vulgaris were infected. Coat protein (CP) gene sequences from eight isolates showed typical potyvirus characteristics and were very similar (88 to 100% identity). However, the sequences shared limited sequence identity with CP genes from two of the three potyviruses reported to cause PWD: East Asian Passiflora Virus and Passion Fruit Woodiness Virus (PWV). Deduced amino acid sequences for the CP from Uganda isolates had the highest identity with Bean Common Mosaic Necrosis Virus (BCMNV) (72 to 79%, with evolutionary divergence values between 0.17 and 0.19) and CABMV (73 to 76%, with divergence values between 0.21 and 0.25). Based on these results and in accordance with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for species differentiation in the family Potyviridae, we conclude that a previously unreported virus causes viral disease in passion fruit in Uganda. The name ""Ugandan Passiflora virus"" is proposed for this virus.",,"Ochwo-Ssemakula, M.;Sengooba, T.;Hakiza, J. J.;Adipala, E.;Edema, R.;Redinbaugh, M. G.;Aritua, V.;Winter, S.",2012.0,May,,0
1536,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus genomic associations in mucosal disease, enteritis, and generalized dermatitis outbreaks in Argentina","The aim of the present work is to describe outbreaks caused by Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) in commercial cattle ranches in Argentina. Genetic affiliation and its association with clinical manifestation were analyzed using five BVDV isolates from an outbreak of mucosal disease (MD) (outbreak #1), acute enteritis (outbreaks #2 and #3), and generalized dermatitis (outbreaks #4 and #5). On genetic analysis, the CP-BVDV isolate from Outbreak #1 was too closely clustered with BVDV Oregon (genotype 1). BVDV isolates from outbreaks of generalized dermatitis (outbreaks #4 and #5) were within genotype 1 near BVDV Osloss. Immunohistochemical identification of BVDV in exudative dermatitis indicates the epithelial cell tropism of the virus. Phylogenic characterization of BVDV from outbreaks #2 and #3 locates them as BVDV-2. The 5-UTR sequence of these viruses showed 88% and 90% homology with BVDV-890 (genotype 2) and 77% and 75% with BVDV-SD1 (genotype 1), respectively. The association of BVDV-2 with severe disease indicates the presence of highly virulent strains. Data from natural outbreaks in which BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were isolated showed that the pathology overlaps and does not allow unequivocal differentiation between genotypes based on gross or microscopic lesions. Therefore, further virological and molecular studies are necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, the results of this work focused on the origin and consequences of genetic variations of BVDV in terms of pathogenesis and suggest the association between genotype and a defined clinical syndrome. © 2003 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"OdeÃ³n, A.

1537,African Swine Fever Virus Georgia 2007 with a deletion of the virulence-associated gene 9GL (B119L) results in viral attenuation in swine when administered at low doses and induces potent protection against homologous challenges,"WITHOUT LABELING: The African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of an often fatal disease in domestic pigs. Disease control strategies have been hampered by the unavailability of vaccines against ASFV. Since its introduction in the Republic of Georgia, a highly virulent virus, ASFV Georgia 2007 (ASFV-G), has caused an animal disease that quickly spread to Eastern European countries. No vaccines to combat ASFV-G are currently available or under development. In the past, genetically engineered ASFVs harboring deletions of virulence-associated genes have been shown in pigs to be attenuated, inducing protective immunity against challenge with homologous parental viruses. The deletion of the gene 9GL (open reading frame [ORF] B119L) in the highly virulent ASF Malawi-Lil-20/1 resulted in an attenuated phenotype even when pigs were administered 10(6) 50% doses of hemadsorption (HAD50). Here we report the construction of a genetically modified ASFV-G strain (ASFV-G-DELTA9GLv) containing a deletion of the 9GL (B119L) gene. Like Malawi-Lil-20/1-DELTA9GL, ASFV-G-DELTA9GL showed limited replication in primary porcine macrophages. However, intramuscular vaccination of pigs with 10(4) HAD50 of ASFV-G-DELTA9GL produced a virulent phenotype which, in contrast to Malawi-Lil-20/1-DELTA9GL, induced a fatal disease like the parental ASFV-G in pigs. Interestingly, lower doses (10(2) to 10(3) HAD50) of ASFV-G-DELTA9GL did not induce a virulent phenotype in pigs and protected pigs from the disease when challenged. A dose of 10(2) HAD50 of ASFV-G-DELTA9GLv conferred partial protection when pigs were challenged at either 21 or 28 days post-infection (dpi). An ASFV-G-DELTA9GL HAD50 of 10(3) provided partial and full protection at 21 and 28 dpi, respectively. The information provided here supplements our recent report on the first trials of experimental ASFV-G vaccines. IMPORTANT: The main problem in combating ASF is the lack of vaccines. Studies on ASFV virulence led to the production of genetically engineered attenuated viruses that are protective in pigs, but only against homologous virus challenges. Here we produced a recombinant ASFV lacking the virulence-associated gene 9GL in an attempt to produce a vaccine against the virulent ASFV-G, a highly virulent virus isolate discovered in the Caucasus region in 2007 and now spreading to the Caucasus region and Eastern Europe . Unlike other ASFV isolates, the 9GL deletion did not completely attenuate ASFV-G. However, when administered once at low doses, recombinant ASFV-G-DELTA9GL induces protection in pigs against parental ASFV-G. Protection against ASFV-G is highly effective at 28 days post-vaccination, while at 21 days post-vaccination the animals survived the lethal challenge but showed signs of ASF. Here we report the design and development of an experimental vaccine that induces protection against virulent ASFV-G.",,"O'Donnell, V.;Holinka, L. G.;Krug, P. W.;Gladue, D.

1543,Foot-and-mouth disease in Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus),"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, debilitating, and globally important viral disease that typically affects hoof hosts. The diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease in bears in Vietnam is described. The current study describes a confirmed case of foot-and-mouth disease in a bear species and clinical signs consistent with foot-and-mouth disease in a Malaysian sun bear. Apparently 13 Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) and 1 Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) were affected. In August 2011, an adult bear became lethargic and developed footpad blisters. Within 15 days, 14 out of 17 bears developed similar signs; the remaining 3 co-housed bears and another 57 resident bears did not. All affected bears developed blisters on all footpads and most were lethargic for 24-48 hours. Nasal and oral lesions were noted in 6 and 3 cases, respectively. Within 1 month everything looked normal. Foot and mouth disease virus (FMD) was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, classified as serotype O, and isolated by virus isolation procedures. Phylogenetic analysis showed an accumulation of 3 bear isolates in a branch distinct from other FMD type O isolates. The outbreak likely occurred through indirect contact with livestock and was favored by the high density of bear captures. It showed that Asiatic black bears are capable of contracting foot-and-mouth disease and developing clinical disease, and the virus spreads easily between bears in close contact.",,"Officer, K.;Lan, N.

1544,Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS) that are particularly abundant in the marine environment,"MutS proteins are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and play an important role in the repair or recombination of DNA mismatches. In the viral world, it is known that the amoeba-infecting Mimivirus, as well as the recently sequenced Cafeteria roenbergensis virus, encode a MutS related to the homologues found in octocorall and epsilon proteobacteria. To investigate the presence of MutS proteins in other viral genomes, we performed a genomic study of four giant viruses (""girus"") (Pyramimonas orientalis virus (PoV), Phaeocystis pouchetii virus (PpV), Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV) and Heterocapsa circularisquama by DNA virus (HcDNAV)) infecting unicellular seaweed. Our analysis revealed the presence of a close homologue of mimivirus MutS in all giraffes analyzed. These viral homologues possess a specific domain structure, including a C-terminal HNH endonuclease domain, that defines the new MutS7 subfamily. We confirmed the presence of conserved mismatch recognition residues in all members of the MutS7 subfamily, suggesting their role in DNA mismatch repair rather than DNA recombination. PoV and PpV were found to contain an additional type of MutS, which we propose to be MutS8. The MutS8 proteins in PoV and PpV were found to be closely related to homologues of 'Candatus Amoebophilus asiaticus', an obligate intracellular amoeba symbiont belonging to the Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that MutS7 and MutS8 are abundant in marine microbial metagenomes and that a large majority of these environmental sequences are likely to be of Girus origin. Giruses therefore appear to represent a major source of the understudied diversity of the MutS family in the microbial world.

1545,Remarkable sequence similarity between the dinoflagellate-infecting marine girus and the terrestrial African swine fever pathogen,"Heterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus (HcDNAV; previously referred to as HcV) is a giant virus (girus) with a 356 kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. HcDNAV lytically infects the mussel-killing marine dinoflagellate H. circularisquama and is currently the only DNA virus isolated from dinoflagellates, one of the most abundant protists in marine ecosystems. Its morphological characteristics, genomic type, and host range previously suggested that HcDNAV might be a member of the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs) family Phycodnaviridae, although no supporting sequence data was available. NCLDVs currently include two families found in aquatic environments (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae), one that mainly infects terrestrial animals (Poxviridae), another that is isolated from fish, amphibians and insects (Iridoviridae), and the last (Asfarviridae ), which is represented exclusively by the animal pathogen African swine fever virus (ASFV), the causative agent of a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs. In this study, we determined the complete sequence of the HcDNAV type B DNA polymerase (PolB) gene. The viral PolB was transcribed at least 6 h after inoculation (hpi), indicating its critical role in viral replication. Most unexpectedly, the HcDNAV PolB sequence was found to be closely related to the ASFV PolB sequence. In addition, the amino acid sequence of HcDNAV PolB revealed a rare amino acid substitution within a motif containing a highly conserved motif: YSDTDS was found in HcDNAV PolB instead of YGDTDS in most dsDNA viruses. Together with the previous observation of ASFV-like sequences in the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic datasets, our results support the assumption that terrestrial ASFV has its evolutionary origin in marine environments. © 2009 Ogata et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Ogata, H.;Toyoda, K.;Tomaru, Y.;Nakayama, N.;Shirai, Y.;Claverie, J.

The E6 protein contained a mismatched CxxC(x)33CxxC and a matched CxxC(x)29CxxC zinc binding domain, and the E7 protein lacked the LxCxE motif. The nucleotide sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) was most closely (57-58%) related to the L1 ORF of members of the genera Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus and Pipapillomavirus.

Although MV is widespread in many countries, it has not been reported in Japan. However, in 2011, three sheep in northern Japan were reported as seropositive to the MVV antigen, indicating persistent MVV infection. In the present study, we isolated MVV from a sheep to confirm MVV infection and performed genomic classification of the virus. Co-culture of leukocytes from a seropositive sheep with fetal goat lung cells resulted in the formation of syncytial cells and the amplification of a long terminal repeat of MVV by polymerase chain reaction. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the gag gene sequence, the isolate was confirmed to be MVV and not caprine arthritis encephalitis virus. Although the sheep was asymptomatic, nonsuppurative meningitis and demyelination were found in the spinal cord. These were considered to be early lesions associated with pathogenic MVV infection.

1550,Evidence of an antigenic shift between orbiviruses of the palyam serogroup,"The Japanese isolates of viruses of the palyam serogroup isolated from 1985 to 2001 were examined for the genome sequence of segments 2 and 7 and analyzed phylogenetically in comparison to Australian and African isolates of the same serogroup. Segment 7 nucleotide sequences were highly conserved within Japanese isolates (95.1 to 100%) and between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates (96.0 to 100%), while identities were fairly conserved between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates and Australian and African isolates (84.2 to 100%). 92.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 7 revealed three clusters by geographic origin. As a result of nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 2 encoding a serotype-specific antigen, Japanese isolates were divided into two groups according to genome length and nucleotide identity. Four of the nine Japanese isolates were placed in the same group as Chuzan virus prototype strain K-47, and the remaining isolates were placed in the same group as D'Aguilar virus and Nyabira virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 2 revealed two clusters, the cluster with Chuzan virus and the cluster with D'Aguilar and Nyabira viruses. To examine the antigenic relationship between viruses classified into different clusters, we performed a cross-neutralization assay. KSB-29/E/01 isolated in Japan in 2001 was neutralized by antiserum not only against D'Aguilar virus strain B8112 but also against Chuzan virus. These results indicated that the genetically and antigenically unique properties of KSB-29/E/01 were attributed to a segment 2 genetic rearrangement between Chuzan virus and D'Aguilar virus.",,"Ohashi, S.;Matsumori, Y.;Yanase, T.;Yamakawa, M.;Kato, T.;Tsuda, T.",2004.0,Oct,,0
1551,Sequence analysis of an Asian isolate of canine minutevirus (canine parvovirus type 1),"Minute virus of canines (MVC), also known as canine parvovirus (CPV) type 1, is an autonomous parvovirus that infects domestic dogs worldwide and is responsible for clinical problems in newborns and pregnant bitches. It has been tentatively described that MVC differs both antigenically and genetically from the later developed type 2 CPV. However, much of MVC is still unclear as only a limited number of MVC isolates were available for study. MVC infections in Japanese and Korean dogs were epidemiologically investigated in the previous study, and several MVC isolates could be cultured in vitro. In the present study, an almost complete nucleotide sequence of a Korean MVC strain HM-6 was obtained and analyzed in comparison to that of the recently characterized American MVC strain GA3. The genome structure of the HM-6 strain was similar to that of the GA3 strain, showing 96.4% identity in nucleotide sequence. Each of the deduced amino acid sequences of NS1, NP-1 and VP1/2 showed 96.5%, 92.5% and 97.5% homology between strains HM-6 and GA3. Compared to other parvovirus species, the HM-6 strain was most closely related to bovine parvovirus (BPV) as described for the GA3 strain.

They show a high diversity. A SaV genome typically encodes seven nonstructural proteins (NSs), including the RNA polymerase protein NS7, and two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2). We classified human and animal SaVs into 15 genogroups (G) based on available VP1 sequences, including three newly characterized genomes from this study. We sequenced the full-length genomes of a novel genogroup V (GV) porcine SaV, a GVII, and a GVIII using long-range RT-PCR, including newly designed forward primers located in the conserved motifs of the putative NS3, and also 5-RACE methods. We also determined the 5″ and 3″ ends of sea lion GV-SaV and canine GXIII-SaV. Although the full genomic sequences of GIX-GXII and GXV-SaVs are not available, common features of the SaV genomes include: 1) ""GTG"" at the 5' end of the genome and a short (9-14 nt) 5-inch ²-untranslated area; and 2) the first five amino acids (M[A/V]S[K/R]P) of the putative NS1 and the five amino acids (FEMEG) surrounding the putative cleavage site between NS7 and VP1 were conserved in the chimpanzee, two from five genogroups from pigs (GV and GVIII), sea lions, dogs and human SaVs. In contrast, these two amino acid motifs were markedly different in three genosets of porcine (GIII, GVI, and GVII) and bat SaVs. Our results indicate that several animal SaVs share genetic similarities with human SaVs. However, the ability of SaVs to be transmitted between humans and animals is uncertain.",,"Oka, T.;Lu, Z.;Phan, T.;Delwart, E. L.;Saif, L. J.;Wang, Q.",2016.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0156373,0

These calves and their dams were not vaccinated against rotavirus. One hundred forty-two bovine rotaviruses were isolated on MA-104 cell cultures and detected by a latex agglutination test. They were divided into 18 G6P[1] (11.2%), 53 G6P[5] (37.3%), 15 G6P[11] (10.6%), 12 G10P[5] (8.5%) , 42 G10P[11] (29.6%) and 1 G8P[11] (0.7%) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A G8 serotype virus was not typable for the P genotype, indicating a new type of bovine origin. The least common G8 serotype viruses were isolated from samples from farms in Niigata and Tokushima prefectures. The VP7 gene sequences of the two isolates showed a high degree of homology as previously reported G8 viruses with 93.3-98.8% identity of the deduced amino acids.

These viruses have been classified as G27P[3] and G27P[36] genotypes, with G27 and P[36] being new genotypes assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. To characterize Sugar Glider RVA in detail, a strain, RVA/SugarGlider-tc/JPN/SG385/2012/G27P[36] (SG385-tc), was isolated. All genes of the strain were classified as new genotypes (G27-P[36]-I19-R10-C10-M9-A20-N11-T13-E17-H12). The enterotoxin domain in NSP4, which is important for diarrhea induction, was conserved between SG385-tc and previously described mammalian strains, suggesting the potential of sugar glider RVA to cause diarrhea in mammalian species. Indeed, seven out of nine lactating mice orally vaccinated with 3.9 x 10(4) ffu of SG385-tc strain had diarrhea, and the 50% diarrhea-inducing dose (DD50) of SG385-tc strain in lactating mice was 1.2 x 10( 4) ffu Our results suggest that Sugar Glider RVA is infectious and possibly pathogenic to other mammalian species.",,"Okadera, K.;Abe, M.;Ito, N.;Mitake, H.;Okada, K.;Nakagawa, K.;Une, Y.;Tsunemitsu, H.;Sugiyama, M.",2016.0,May,,0
1556,"The genetic and antigenic diversity of avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic ducks, musk ducks and chickens in North and South Vietnam, 2010-2012","To estimate the prevalence of avian influenza virus infection in Vietnam, domestic and wild birds from households, live bird markets, slaughterhouses and bird sanctuaries in Vietnam were monitored between October 2010 and October 2012. Of the 4,550 samples collected, 226 influenza A virus isolates were obtained from domestic ducks, musk ducks and chickens. Of these, 25 and 22 highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) were isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks at live bird markets and slaughterhouses in North and South Vietnam, respectively. The HA genes of H5 viruses isolated from birds in North Vietnam belonged phylogenetically to genetic class 2.3.2.1 and those in South Vietnam belonged to genetic class 1.1. In addition, 39 H3, 12 H4, 1 H5, 93 H6, 2 H7, 18 H9, 3 H10 and 11 H11 viruses were isolated. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyzes of the H6 and H9 viruses revealed that they are closely related to the isolates obtained from domestic poultry in China. Phylogenetic analysis of internal gene segments from these isolates revealed that these viruses circulated in both domestic and wild birds in Asia and that rearrangements had occurred frequently. Therefore, it is important to continue surveillance and strict controls on the movement and trade of poultry and poultry products to eradicate H5N1 HPAIV from Asia. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Okamatsu, M.;Nishi, T.;Nomura, N.;Yamamoto, N.;Sakoda, Y.;Sakurai, K.;Chu, H.

1558,Genetic variability and evolution of hepatitis E virus,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the only member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. HEV is mainly transmitted via the faecal-oral route, and waterborne epidemics are characteristic of hepatitis E in many developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America where sanitary conditions are suboptimal. Evidence is accumulating that HEV-associated hepatitis also occurs domestically in individuals in industrialized countries, that there are animal reservoirs of HEV such as domestic and wild pigs, and that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease. Based on the extensive genomic variability among HEV isolates, HEV sequences have been classified into four genotypes: genotype 1 consists of epidemic strains in developing countries in Asia and Africa; Genotype 2 has been described in Mexico and several African countries; Genotype 3 HEV is widespread and has been isolated from sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E and/or domestic pigs in many countries around the world, with the exception of countries in Africa; and genotype 4 contains strains isolated from humans and/or domestic pigs exclusively in Asian countries. This paper provides an overview of the current knowledge on the genomic variability, geographic distribution and zoonotic aspects of HEV, as well as on the clinical significance of HEV genotype and evolution. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Okamoto, H.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.002,0
1559,Characteristics of hepatitis E virus infection in Japan,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis in many developing countries. HEV is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route, and waterborne epidemics are characteristic of hepatitis E. Recently, there is increasing consensus that HEV-associated hepatitis also occurs in individuals in developed countries who have had no prior travel to endemic areas . A zoonotic spread of HEV was suspected since human and porcine HEV strains are genetically closely related and experimental cross-species infection of porcine HEV to a chimpanzee and that of human HEV to pig has been demonstrated. This review describes the clinical, epidemiological and virological features of domestic HEV infection in Japan, the genetic relationship of Japanese human and swine HEV strains and possible transmission routes of HEV, emphasizing that HEV is considered in the diagnosis of acute or fulminant hepatitis should be non-A, non-B, non-C etiology even in patients who have not traveled abroad.",,"Okamoto, H.;Takahashi, M.;Nishizawa, T.",2003.0,,,0
1560,"Characterization of sporadic acute hepatitis E and comparison of hepatitis E virus genomes in patients with acute hepatitis and edible pork liver in Mie, Japan","Aim: To characterize hepatitis E in Mie Prefecture and to investigate whether raw pork liver sold as food in Mie is contaminated with hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains similar to those obtained from patients. METHODS: Seventeen patients with sporadic acute hepatitis E treated from 2004 to 2012 were studied. A total of 243 packages of raw pork liver from local grocery stores were tested for the presence of HEV RNA. The partial genomic sequences of human and porcine HEV isolates were determined and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Results: The HEV isolates obtained from the 17 patients were separated into genotype 3 (n=15) and genotype 4 (n=2), and 15 genotype 3 isolates were further separated into 3e (n=11) and 3b (n=4) separately. Pig liver samples from 12 (4.9%) of the 243 packs had detectable HEV RNA. All 12 porcine HEV isolates were grouped into genotype 3 (3a or 3b). Although no 3e strains were isolated from porcine liver samples, two porcine 3b strains were 99.5-100% identical within 412 nt partial sequences to two HEV strains obtained from hepatitis patients. Conclusion: 3e-HEV was widespread in hepatitis E patients. HEV RNA has been detected in approximately 5% of pork liver sold as food. The presence of identical HEV strains between hepatitis patients and pig liver indicated that pigs play an important role as a reservoir for HEV in humans in Mie. Further studies are needed to clarify the source of 3e-HEV in animal and environmental reservoirs.",,"Okano, H.;Takahashi, M.;Isono, Y.;Tanaka, H.;Nakano, T.;Oya, Y.;Sugimoto, K.;Ito, K.;Ohmori, S.;Maegawa, T.;Kobayashi, M.;Nagashima, S.;Nishizawa, T.;Okamoto, H.",2014.0,,10.1111/hepr.12216,0
1561,Application of antisense molecules in poultry production,"Antisense molecules, which are single-stranded nucleic acids complementary to a specific mRNA, target and bind to the mRNA, interfering with and preventing translation of mRNA encoding a specific protein. Recently, phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, originally developed as nuclease-resistant alternatives to phosphodiester oligomers, and protein nucleic acids have been used to prevent antisense molecules from nucleases. The delivery system for antisense molecules is basically the same as the DNA delivery system. Traditionally, DNA delivery systems have been classified as viral vector-mediated systems and non-viral vector-mediated systems. Because the importance of current methodology is attributed to the limitation of viral vector-mediated delivery, non-viral vector-mediated systems, particularly synthetic DNA delivery systems, have become increasingly desirable. The possibility of using antisense protein nucleic acids against leptin mRNA was discussed to stimulate the appetite of poultry. Antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide against insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 mRNA successfully repressed its hepatic gene expression in chicken. Protein synthesis of chick embryo myoblasts was decreased by administration of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide against myostatin mRNA, indicating the reduction of protein degradation by antisense administration.",,"Okumura, J.;Kita, K.",2001.0,Dec,,0
1562,Distribution of gene segments of the 2009 pandemic virus line A(H1N1) in swine populations,"Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) are not only important for pig farming, but also for public health. Indeed, the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic viruses [A(H1N1)pdm09] were derived from SIVs. Therefore, timely characterization of locally circulating SIVs is necessary to understand the global status of SIVs. To genetically characterize SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations, we isolated 24 SIVs of three subtypes (17 H1N1, four H1N2, and three H3N2 strains) from 14 pig farms in Japan from 2013 to 2016. Genetic analyzes revealed that hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from 17 H1N1 and the HA gene from one H1N2, A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2), SIVs belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09- Line. More importantly, all remaining six gene segments (i.e., PB1, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) of the 24 SIVs, regardless of HA and NA subtype, were also classified as belonging to A(H1N1)pdm09 ancestry. These results demonstrate that gene segments from the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage are widely distributed in SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations. In addition, the NA gene of A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2) shared less than 88.5% nucleotide identity with that of the closest relative A/swine/Miyagi/5/2003 (H1N2), which isolates in Japan in 2003 became. These results indicate the continued circulation of classic H1N2-derived SIVs with remarkable NA gene diversity in Japanese pig populations. These results underscore the need for both intensive biosecurity systems and active SIV surveillance in swine populations worldwide for animal and public health.",,"Okuya, K.;Matsuu, A.;Kawabata, T.;Koike, F.;Ito, M.;Furuya, T.;Taneno, A.;Akimoto, S.;Deguchi, E.;Ozawa, M.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12887,0

To fill this knowledge gap, we used RT-PCR to examine fresh feces from several African carnivores. We have detected kobuvirus RNA in samples from domestic dogs, golden jackals, side-striped jackals, and spotted hyenas. Using next-generation sequencing, we obtained a complete kobuvirus genomic sequence from each of these species. Our phylogenetic analyzes revealed canine kobuvirus (CaKV) infection in all four species and placed CaKVs from Africa together and separately from CaKVs from other countries. Wild carnivore tribes were more closely related to each other than to those of domestic dogs. We found that the secondary structure model of the IRES of the Aichivirus-like IRES subclass was similar and conserved among African strains.

1564,Characterization of infectious US laryngotracheitis virus isolates by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism of multiple genomic regions,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute viral respiratory disease primarily in chickens. Economic losses attributable to ILT are affecting many poultry producing areas in the United States (USA) and around the world. Despite efforts to control the disease through vaccination, ongoing ILT epidemics remain a threat to the poultry industry. Previous epidemiological and molecular evidence suggested that outbreaks in the US are caused by vaccine-related strains. In this study, polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of four genomic regions were used to characterize 25 isolates from commercial poultry and backyard flocks from the US. Combinations of PCR-RFLP patterns classified the ILT virus isolates into nine groups. Backyard herd isolates were divided into three separate groups. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) ILT virus reference strain and tissue culture derived (TCO) vaccine strain were divided into two separate groups. Twenty-two isolates from commercial poultry were divided into four groups: one group of six isolates showed patterns identical to the chick embryo (CEO) vaccines; a second group of nine isolates differed from the CEO vaccines in only one pattern; a third group consisting of two isolates differed from the TCO vaccine in only one pattern; a fourth group consisting of five isolates differed in six and nine patterns from the CEO and TCO vaccines, respectively. The results obtained from this study clearly showed that most commercial poultry isolates (17 out of 22 isolates) were closely related to the vaccine strains. However, isolates other than the vaccine strains have also been identified in commercial poultry. © 2007 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Oldoni, I.;GarcÃ­a, M.",2007.0,,10.1080/03079450701216654,0
1565,Epidemiological study in flocks of single species from Poland shows extended genetic and antigenic diversity of small ruminant lentiviruses,"Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) are widespread in Poland and circulating subtypes A1, A12, A13, B1 and B2 have been identified. The present work aimed to extend previous studies based on the analysis of larger numbers of animals from single-species herds. Animals were selected for genetic analysis based on serological reactivity to a panel of recombinant antigens derived from viral Gag and Env proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of subtypes B2 and A12 in both goats and sheep, and subtypes A1 and B1 only in goats. In addition, two new subtypes, A16 and A17, were found in goats. Coinfections with strains of different subtypes within the A and B groups were detected in 1 sheep and 4 goats from four flocks. Although the reactivity of serum samples towards the recombinant antigens confirmed the immunological relatedness between Gag epitopes of different subtypes and the cross-reactive nature of Gag antibodies, eleven serum samples did not react with antigens representing all subtypes detected in Poland to date, which is worth emphasizing The borders of serological diagnostics. These data demonstrated the complex nature of the SRLV subtypes circulating in sheep and goats in Poland and the need to improve SRLV-related diagnostic capacities.",,"Olech, M.;Valas, S.;KuÅºmak, J.",2018.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0193892,0
1566,Porcine B cells recognize epitopes conserved between the structural proteins of American and European-type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses,"By selecting phage display libraries with immune sera from experimentally infected pigs, porcine B cell epitopes in the open reading frame (ORF) 2, 3, 5 and 6 proteins of the European type of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were identified . The sequences of all epitopes were well conserved in European-type PRRSV and even between European- and American-type PRRSV. Accordingly, sera from pigs infected with American-type PRRSV cross-reacted with the European-type epitopes. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time the presence of highly conserved epitopes in the matrix protein and envelope glycoproteins of PRRSV. ORF5 and 6 epitopes localized to protein portions predicted to be latent in PRRSV virions. In contrast, ORF2 and 3 epitopes localized to putative protein ectodomains. Due to the interesting localization, the sequence around the epitopes ORF2 and 3 was examined in more detail. A heptad motif, VSRRIYQ, present in a single copy in ORF2 and 3 proteins has been identified; this arrangement is fully conserved in all available European-type PRRSV sequences. The VSRRIYQ repeat motif closely colocalizes with one of the ORF2 epitopes, and secondary structure modeling indicated that this segment of the ORF2 protein could form an amphipathic helix. Interestingly, a mutation associated with the virulence/attenuation of an American vaccine strain of PRRSV also localized this ORF2 protein segment and affected the hydrophobic face of the predicted amphipathic helix. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings delineate a functional domain in the ORF2 protein of PRRSV.",,"Oleksiewicz, M. B.;BÃ¸tner, A.;Normann, P.",2002.0,,,0
1567,Determination of the sequence of the complete open reading frame and the 5'NTR of the Paderborn isolate of the classical swine fever virus,"The classical swine fever (CSF) epidemic in the Netherlands lasted 14 months in 1997-1998, killing 429 infected and 1300 vulnerable herds at an estimated economic cost of US$2 billion. Despite the overwhelming scale of the animal disease, the strain of CSF virus (CSFV) that caused the outbreak has remained largely uncharacterized. The Dutch animal disease is epidemiologically linked to a small outbreak of CSF in 1997 in Paderborn, Germany. E2 and partial 5-NTR sequencing has shown that the Index Paderborn isolate and several Dutch isolates taken during the 1997-1998 epizootic are virtually identical, confirming that the Paderborn isolate caused the Dutch outbreak and moreover shows that this single isolate was stable throughout the Dutch outbreak (the above reviewed in [C. Terpstra, AJ de Smit, Veterinary Microbiol. 77 (2000) 3-15]). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5'NTR (by 5'RACE) and the complete open reading frame of the Paderborn isolate (GenBank AY072924). Our sequence was identical to previously published partial 5-NTR and E2 sequences for Index isolates Paderborn 1997 and Dutch 1997 (Venhorst), confirming the identity of the virus we sequenced. Phylogenetic analyzes based on the full open reading frame showed that Paderborn is genetically very different from common European laboratory reference strains. Neutralization studies showed that Paderborn is also antigenically very different from common laboratory strains such as Alfort 187. Paderborn is the only recent European CSFV field isolate for which a complete sequence is available, and given Paderborn's genetic and antigenic uniqueness, the Paderborn sequence may be of practical use for the development of diagnostic and vaccine antigens. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Oleksiewicz, M.

The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array Version 2 (LLMDAv2) in combination with whole genome amplification and sequencing for screening for viral EAs in live attenuated vaccines and specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs. We detected positive microarray signals for the avian endogenous retrovirus EAV-HP and several viruses of the genus Alpharetrovirus in all vaccines and SPF eggs analyzed. We used a microarray probe mapping approach to assess the presence of intact retroviral genomes which, in addition to PCR analysis, revealed that several of the positive microarray signals were most likely due to cross-hybridization with EAV-HPDELTApol and ALV-E ev1, ev3 and were due to ev6 loci sequences derived from the chicken genome. Sequencing of the vaccines on a MiSeq instrument confirmed the microarray results and showed similar cross-hybridization.

Therefore, the surveillance and characterization of porcine influenza viruses is important to the veterinary community and should be part of human pandemic preparedness planning. Studies in 1976/1977 and 1988/1989 showed that pigs in the US were commonly infected with classic swine H1N1 viruses, while human H3 and avian influenza virus infections were very rare. In contrast, human H3 and avian H1 viruses have been frequently isolated from pigs in Europe and Asia over the past two decades. From September 1997 to August 1998, we isolated 26 influenza viruses from swine in the north-central United States at the point of slaughter. All 26 isolates were H1N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes of 11 representative viruses indicated that they were classic porcine H1 viruses. However, monoclonal antibody analyzes revealed antigenic heterogeneity between the HA proteins of the 26 viruses. Serologically, 27.7% of 2,375 pigs tested had anti-haemagglutination antibodies to classical swine H1 influenza virus. Of particular importance, however, the seropositivity rates for avian H1 (7.6%) and human H3 viruses (8.0%) were significantly higher than in previous studies.",,"Olsen, C.

Genetic analyzes showed that this duck virus has the same human/classical swine/avian reassortant genotype as the H1N2 viruses isolated from swine and turkeys in the United States since 1999. Phylogenetic analysis of each gene segment further confirmed that Dk/NC virus is closely related to domestic H1N2 isolates. In particular, Dk/NC is most closely related to a porcine H1N2 virus also isolated in North Carolina. These two viruses and a phylogenetically defined subset of other porcine H1N2 viruses share a common mutation in the Sb antigenic site of the hemagglutinin protein.

The pathogenesis of PPMV-1 infection in poultry is largely unclear. It is known that PPMV-1 requires a series of passages in chickens before being adapted to broilers. Material and methods: Alterations in the genome of PPMV-1 were analyzed after serial passages in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens using high-throughput sequencing. In addition, histopathological lesions induced by PPMV-1 in experimentally vaccinated pigeons, chickens and turkeys were evaluated. Results: After six passages of PPMV-1 in chickens, 10 non-synonymous substitutions were found, including one (in the NP protein) that dominated the viral quasi-species genetic pool. Histopathological changes induced by the post-passaged PPMV-1 strain were more prominent than the changes induced by the pre-passaged PPMV-1 strain, and the lesions were most intense in pigeons, followed by chickens and turkeys. Conclusion: PPMV-1 is highly adapted to pigeons, and passage through chickens leads to the acquisition of new amino acids in the polymerase complex that may alter the virus' pathogenic potential.",,"Olszewska-Tomczyk, M.;Dolka, I.;ÅšwiÈ©toÅ„, E.;Åšmietanka, K.",2018.0,,10.2478/jvetres-2018-0059,0

Similarly, insect cells are proving valuable for the production of virus-like particles and subunit vaccines, but they can harbor a range of latent viruses. We show that after MP-Seq of the Trichoplusia ni transcriptome (High Five cell line) we were able to detect a contaminating latent nodavirus and identify an expressed errantivirus genome. Overall, these studies have strengthened the role of MP-Seq as an integral tool for identifying contaminating agents in vaccine cell substrates.",,"Onions, D.;Cote, C.;Love, B.;Toms, B.;Koduri, S.;Armstrong, A.;Chang, A.;Kolman, J.",2011.0,2022-09-01 00:00:00,,0
1579,"Revealing vector, parasite, blood meal and microbiome patterns from mixed DNA samples of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata","Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization, is caused by the protozoal parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted by >140 triatomic species across the Americas. In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic bloodmeal feeder that inhabits both native and Sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, the vector, the vector's gut microbiome, and the blood meal source would facilitate the identification of important biotic factors associated with disease risk are associated with T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to examine mixed DNA species extracted from the abdomen of T. dimidiata. To assess the effectiveness of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design ranging from individual villages in Guatemala to large biogeographical regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to determine the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and the predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the genetic population structure of T. dimidiata, the microbial diversity in the gut and to evaluate the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads per sample were obtained, with approximately 1% attributed to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we discovered nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: TcI and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector samples were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs in all samples, sufficient to demonstrate geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than in uninfected ones. The Unifrac analysis suggests a co-aggregation of bacteria associated with infection occurring along with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five abdomens of T. dimidiata, including chicken, dog, duck and human; However, additional detection methods would be required to reliably identify blood meal sources from most samples. Overall, our study shows that this method is effective to simultaneously generate genetic data on vectors and associated parasites, along with ecological information on feeding patterns and microbial interactions, which can be followed up with complementary approaches such as PCR-based parasite detection, 18S eukaryotes, and can be 16S bacteria barcoding.",,"Orantes, L.

1580,Host-independent evolution and a genetic classification of the hepadnavirus family based on nucleotide sequences,"molecular phylogeny analysis was performed to investigate whether the evolution of the hepadnavirus family is host dependent. Using the nucleotide sequences of 18 strains, we constructed pedigrees. The trees obtained show that all 12 hepatitis B virus strains can be divided into four subgroups that are not compatible with conventional subtypes. We estimated the rate of synonymous (silent) substitution for hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10-5 per site per year. Applying this rate to the phylogenetic tree, we estimated that duck hepatitis B virus split from a common ancestor about 30,000 years ago at the earliest, woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus about 10,000 years ago years and the hepatitis B virus within the last 3000 years. Since these viral divergence times are much younger than those of the host species, this suggests that the hepadnavirus family evolved independently of host species divergence.",,"Orito, E.;Mizokami, M.;Ina, Y.;Moriyama, E.

1581,Degenerate primers for PCR amplification and sequencing of the avian influenza A neuraminidase gene,"This study describes the design of degenerate primers and their use for full-length avian influenza A-neuramindase (NA) synthesis. Each reaction was performed using either two forward primers and one reverse primer or one forward primer and one reverse primer. Both primer combinations had comparable amplification efficiencies for all NA subtypes (1-9). A total of 115 virus strains, including both field isolates and reference strains, were successfully amplified using these degenerate primer sets. Of the amplified sequences, 108 strains (93.9%) gave rise to nearly full-length NA cDNAs after two reads with one forward primer and one reverse primer. Of the remaining sequences, five strains (4.3%) provided reads with sufficient information for subtype categorization by BLAST, although they were of insufficient quality for assembly. One strain (0.9%) yielded different subtypes from both sequence reads, while the other (0.9%) could not be assembled and subtyped. This successful demonstration of these degenerate primers for the amplification and sequencing of all avian NA subtypes suggests that these primers could be used in the avian influenza surveillance program, as well as in studies of antiviral resistance, virus ecology, or viral phylogeny.",,"Orozovic, G.;Latorre-Margalef, N.;Wahlgren, J.;Muradrasoli, S.;Olsen, B.",2010.0,Dec,,0
1582,In vitro surrogate models to support the development of antivirals to contain foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly pathogenic member of the Aphthovirus genus (family Picornaviridae) that is restricted to manipulation in high-security facilities, making research and discovery of antiviral strategies against the virus difficult. Bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) and equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), which are phylogenetically most closely related to FMD, have been investigated as surrogates for FMD in antiviral studies. Although no efficient cell culture system for BRBV has been reported to date, we show that infection of primary bovine kidney cells resulted in extensive but rather poorly reproducible induction of the cytopathic effect (CPE). Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, on the other hand, supported viral replication in the absence of CPE. Antiviral assays were developed for ERAV in Vero A cells using a viral RNA reduction assay and a CPE reduction assay; the latter has a Z' factor of 0.83. ±. 0.07. The BRBV and ERAV models were next used to assess the anti-aphthovirus activity of two broad-spectrum antiviral agents, 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) and ribavirin, and the enterovirus-specific inhibitor enviroxim. The effects of the three compounds in the CPE reduction (ERAV) and viral RNA reduction assays (BRBV and ERAV) were comparable. Similar to 2CMC, Compound A, a recently discovered non-nucleoside pan-serotype FMDV inhibitor, also inhibited replication of both BRBV and ERAV, while enviroxime had no activity. The BRBV and ERAV surrogate models described here can be manipulated in BSL-2 laboratories and could facilitate studies to elucidate the mechanism of action of new FMDV inhibitors. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Osiceanu, A.

1583,"The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 subtype) clades in Bangladesh, 2010 and 2011","Since the global spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu in 2005-2006, control programs have been successfully implemented in most affected countries. HPAI H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in 2007 and since then 546 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The disease has apparently become endemic in Bangladesh. Spatiotemporal information on 177 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks that occurred in Bangladesh between February 2010 and April 2011 and 37 of those outbreaks in which isolated H5N1 viruses were phylogenetically characterized as a clade were analyzed. Three clades were identified, 2.2 (21 cases), 2.3.4 (2 cases) and 2.3.2.1 (14 cases). Clade 2.2 was identified throughout the period and was widespread in a southeast-northwest orientation. Clade 2.3.2.1 appeared later and was generally confined to central Bangladesh in a north-south orientation. Based on a directional test, Clade 2.2 viruses spread in a southeast-northwest direction, while Clade 2.3.2.1 spread in a west-east direction. The extent of clade 2.3.2.1 spread was greater compared to clade 2.2 (angular concentration 0.2765 versus 0.1860). In both cases, the first outbreaks were identified as early outliers, but in addition, early outbreaks (one each) of clade 2.2 in central Bangladesh and north-west Bangladesh at considerable distances from each other were also identified. The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Bangladesh is characterized by reported long-distance translocations. This poses a challenge to disease control efforts. Increased biosecurity enforcement and control of movements between affected farms and susceptible farms, as well as better monitoring and reporting are needed. Although movement of poultry and equipment seems a more likely explanation for the patterns identified, the relative contribution of trade and the market chain compared to wild birds in the spread of the disease needs further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Osmani, M.

It is important for the veterinarian to know which diseases can be transmitted from these animals to humans. From the viral zoonoses. Rabies poses a threat to humans where dogs and, to a lesser extent, cats provide a link between humans and free-roaming wildlife. Another viral zoonosis that has been the focus of interest in recent years is lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), which is caused by a virus that is often latent in mice but can also be detected in young hamsters. A human disease caused by a pathogen that should not be attributed to viruses is chlamydiosis (psittacosis, ornithosis), which is usually transmitted to humans by parrots or pigeons. The pathogens, the symptoms in humans and animals, the transmission path and possible preventive and therapeutic measures are discussed.

1585,Epidemiology and molecular characterization of chicken anemia virus from commercial and domestic chickens in Taiwan,"Chick infectious anemia (CIA) is a disease with significant economic impact in the poultry industry. The infected chickens are characterized by aplastic anemia and extreme immunosuppression, followed by increased susceptibility to secondary infectious agents and suboptimal immune responses for vaccination. Commercially available CIA vaccines are routinely used by breeders in Taiwan to protect their offspring with maternal-derived antibodies. However, CIA cases still occur and little is known about the genetic properties of Taiwanese chicken anemia viruses (CAVs). In this study, CAV DNA was detected in 72 out of 137 flocks collected between 2010 and 2015. Among the PCR-positive samples, the coding regions of 51 CAVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene revealed that although most Taiwanese CAVs belonged to genotypes II and III, some isolates have been clustered into a new genotype (genotype IV). In addition, a Taiwanese isolate in this new genotype IV appeared to be derived from a recombination event between genotypes II and III viruses. Five Taiwanese CAV isolates were very similar to vaccine strains 26P4 or Del-Ros. Taken together, these results indicate that the sequences of CAVs are variable in Taiwan and intergenotypic recombination between viruses of different genotypes has occurred. In addition, vaccine-like strains could induce clinical signs of CIA in chickens. Our results could be useful to understand the evolution of CAVs and design a better control strategy for CIA.",,"Ou, S. C.;Lin, H. L.;Liu, P. C.;Huang, H. J.;Lee, M. S.;Lien, Y. Y.;Tsai, Y.

Genetic analyzes of the H5N6 HPAIV isolates revealed previously unreported phylogenetic variations in the PB2, PB1, PA, and NS gene segments and allowed us to propose two new genotypes for today's H5N6 HPAIVs. Furthermore, analysis of the four gene segments identified close phylogenetic relationships between our three LPAIV isolates and the contemporary H5N6 HPAIV isolates. Our results implicated the co-circulation and co-evolution of HPAIVs and LPAIVs within the same wild bird populations, thereby underscoring the importance of avian influenza surveillance targeting not only HPAIVs but also LPAIVs.",,"Ozawa, M.;Matsuu, A.;Khalil, A.

1588,Genetic and epidemiological insights into the origin of the Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) in Asia and Africa,"Small ruminants are an important part of the livelihood of millions of households in many parts of the world. The spread of the highly contagious plague of small ruminants (PPR) caused by an RNA virus, PPRV, in Asia and Africa remains a major concern. The present study investigated the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of PPRV by analyzing partial N gene and F gene sequences of the virus. All four previously described PPRV lineages (I-IV) diverged from their common ancestor during the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Among the four lineages, PPRV-IV showed distinct genetic patterning across the region; however, the sharing of haplotypes between geographic regions, together with the presence of multiple genetic clusters within a country, points to the possibility of frequent mobility of diseased individuals within the region. The gradual decline in effective infection numbers suggests limited genetic variation, which may be due to effective vaccination practiced since the 1990s. However, movement of infected animals in the region likely contributes to the spread of PPRV-IV. There was no evidence of positive selection from this study.",,"Padhi, A.;Ma, L.",2014.0,,10.1038/srep07040,0
1589,Time-dependent selection pressure on two arthropod-transmitted RNA viruses of the same serogroup,"Understanding the genetic basis of viral adaptation to taxonomically distinct groups of host species living in different ecoclimatic zones is critical to discovering factors underpinning the successful establishment of these infectious pathogens in new hosts/environments. To gain insight into the dynamics of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) and the relationship between the two (Ï‰ = dN/.dS), we analyzed the full nucleotide-coding sequence data of the M segment, the Glycoproteins of encode two negative-sense RNA viruses, Akabane virus (AKV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV), which belong to the same serogroup. While AKV is relatively older, having been circulating in ruminant populations since the 1970s, SBV was first reported in 2011. The Ï‰ has been estimated at 1.67 and 0.09 for SBV and AKV, respectively, and the estimated mutation rate of SBV is at least 25 times higher than that of AKV. Given the different evolutionary stages of the two viruses, most of the mildly deleterious mutations were likely removed from the AKV genome or kept at low frequency, while positive selection along with the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations could contribute to such an inflated mutation rate in SBV. Evolutionary distance (d) is nonlinear and negatively correlated with Ï‰ but positively correlated with dN and dS. Overall, the different patterns in Ï‰, dN, dS, and d between AKV and SBV identified in this study provide empirical evidence for a time-dependent selection pressure.",,"Padhi, A.;Ma, L.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.019,0

Aujeszky's disease (AD) was first serologically confirmed in 2001 in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS); However, there was no viral confirmation. The aim of this study was to examine antibodies against SuHV-1 in the sera of wild boar in the examined areas, to detect SuHV-1 by PCR and to classify the viral genome. Of the 218 animals examined, 186 were analyzed by ELISA, resulting in 88 (47.3%) reactive samples. In the serum neutralization test (SN), 57/179 (31.8%) samples showed antibodies against the AD virus (SuHV-1). Nested PCR extracted 104 DNA samples for analysis and confirmed by amplification of a fragment of glycoprotein B (gB) in five samples. The SuHV-1 was detected in 12 samples using glycoprotein E (gE) primers and the viral genome was classified as type I by partial ul44 sequencing. The amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in the fetuses of seropositive sows indicates that vertical transmission helps maintain SuHV-1 in a free-roaming wild boar population. The origin of AD in the wild boar populations of the Pantanal is unknown, however, determination of viral latency, vertical transmission of the antigen through amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in the fetuses of seropositive sows, and genome typing help elucidate the epidemiology of this disease in the Wetlands of MS, Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Paes, R.

1592,Cardiac and skeletal muscle inflammation in farmed salmon is associated with infection with a novel reovirus,"Mariculture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) has been linked to epidemics of infectious diseases, threatening not only local production but also wild fish coming near and fish escaping from sea enclosures. Inflammation of the heart and skeletal muscle (HSMI) is a frequently fatal disease of farmed Atlantic salmon. HSMI was first identified on a farm in Norway in 1999[1] and has subsequently been implicated in outbreaks on other farms in Norway and the UK[2]. Although pathology and disease transmission studies have suggested an infectious basis, efforts to identify an active ingredient have been unsuccessful. Here we provide evidence that HSMI is associated with piscine reovirus (PRV) infection. PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high-throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide abundance and sequence alignment and motif analysis. The formal implication of PRV in HSMI requires isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's postulates or prevention or modification of the disease through the use of specific drugs or vaccines. However, since our data suggest that a causal relationship is plausible, action needs to be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens domestic salmon production but also because of the possibility of transmission to wild salmon populations. © 2010 Palacios et al.",,"Palacios, G.;Lovoll, M.;Tengs, T.;Hornig, M.;Hutchison, S.;Hui, J.;Kongtorp, R.

Turkey astroviruses were found in 83.67% of cases and turkey astrovirus 2 (TAst-2) in 26.53% of cases. The studies directly demonstrated the high prevalence of turkey parvovirus (TuPV) in 23 flocks (46.9%) with evidence of ED, making this pathogen the second most commonly identified pathogen after astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of a 527 base pair region of the NS1 gene revealed two major clusters, a chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and a TuPV group, but also the presence of a divergent branch of strains tentatively named ""TuPV-like ChPV"".

While twelve cowpea-infecting viruses have been reported from Africa, only three of them have so far been reported from Burkina Faso. Here we use a virion-associated nucleic acid (VANA)-based metagenomics method to screen plants collected from the three agroclimatic zones of Burkina Faso for the presence of cowpea viruses. In addition to the three cowpea-infecting virus species previously reported from Burkina Faso (cowpea aphid Borne mosaic virus [family Potyviridae], blackeye cowpea mosaic virus - a strain of common bean mosaic virus - [family Potyviridae] and cowpea mottle virus [family Tombusviridae]), five other viruses have been identified: southern cowpea mosaic virus (genus Sobemovirus), two previously uncharacterized polerovirus-like species (family Luteoviridae), one previously uncharacterized tombusvirus-like species (family Tombusviridae), and one previously uncharacterized mycotymovirus-like species (family Tymoviridae).

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus termed porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical symptoms. The PCV3 capsid and replicase proteins are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 107 genome copies/ml) and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of sow tissue specimens identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung and lymph node specimens localized in typical PDNS lesions including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further examination of archival PDNS tissue samples negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 positive for PCV3 by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with 60% of a subset also testing positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis . qPCR analysis of 271 samples for the diagnosis of porcine respiratory disease identified 34 PCV3 positive cases (12.5%) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples revealed that 46 (55 %) of 83 samples tested positive were positive.

DNA sequence analysis revealed that a 714 bp DEV open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 237 amino acid polypeptide is homologous to the herpesvirus UL4 family of proteins and was therefore characterized as a DEV UL4 gene. Alignment of the DEV-UL4 protein sequence with that of other alphaherpesviruses showed that 10 amino acid residues are completely conserved. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the seventeen alphaherpesviruses analyzed were divided into four major groups, and duck enteritis virus was separately branched, closely related to the mardivirus group, the gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2), gallid herpesvirus 3 (GaHV-3) and includes meleagrid herpesvirus 1 (MeHV-1). The present study showed that the evolutionary relatedness of the UL4 protein could be used to classify alphaherpesviruses.

1599,Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of the glycoprotein GP85 of ALV-J isolates from mainland China between 1999 and 2010: coexistence of two extremely different subgroups in strata,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), first isolated in 1989, preferentially infects meatfowl. However, laying hen flocks in China have seen outbreaks of this virus since 2008. To understand the genetic diversity of ALV-J in Chinese laying hens, we compared and analyzed the GP85 gene sequences of 106 ALV-J isolates isolated between 1999 and 2010 in mainland China. The GP85 gene sequences from 41 laying hen isolates collected in 9 provinces of China between 2008 and 2010 belonged to two separate, very different subgroups and were distinguished from meaty chicken isolates. Compared to all meaty isolates from China, subgroup 1 contained only current layer isolates and appeared to be dominant; All of the isolates in this subgroup displayed gene diversity and many unique amino acid mutations were present. In contrast, the viruses in subgroup 2 were perfectly conserved and shared high identity with the meat-type prototype chicken ALV-J strain HPRS-103. The two subgroups contained only two simultaneous mutations at the same position. Furthermore, most of the isolates in subgroup 1 had two additional glycosylation sites (at positions 101 and 191) compared to those in subgroup 2. Our study provides evidence for the coexistence of two extremely different ALV-J subgroups in Chinese layers from 2008 to 2010 to support the need to develop vaccines and cleanup measures to prevent ALV-J infection in laying hens in China. © 2011.",,"Pan, W.;Gao, Y.;Qin, L.;Ni, W.;Liu, Z.;Yun, B.;Wang, Y.;Qi, X.;Gao, H.;Wang, X.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.10.019,0
1600,Modulation of the host miRNAs transcriptome in the lungs and spleen of sheep and goats infected with ruminant plague des petits virus,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is one of the highly contagious viral diseases characterized by fever, mouth soreness, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis and pneumonia, affecting mainly sheep and goats. Reports indicate a variable host response in goats and sheep, and this host response to the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has not been studied. Here, miRNAs were sequenced and proteomics data generated to identify the role of differentially expressed miRNA (DEmiRNA) in PPR virus (PPRV)-infected ovine and caprine lung and spleen tissues. In lungs, 67 and 37 DEmiRNAs were identified in goats and sheep, respectively. Similarly, in the spleen, 50 and 56 DEmiRNAs were identified in goats and sheep, respectively. A total of 20 and 11 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in both species in PPRV-infected spleen and lung, respectively. Six DEmiRNAs—miR-21-3p, miR-1246, miR-27a-5p, miR-760-3p, miR-320a, and miR-363—were selected based on their role in viral infection, apoptosis, and fold change. Target prediction analysis of these six selected DEmiRNAs from the generated proteomic data revealed the involvement of a greater number of genes in goat lungs and spleen than in sheep. Genome analysis of host target genes revealed that these DEmiRNAs regulate multiple signaling pathways of the immune response. It was observed that the pathways i.e. T cell receptor signaling, Rap1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling and B cell receptor signaling controlled by DEmiRNAs were more disrupted in goats than in Sleep. The data suggest that PPRV-induced miR-21-3p, miR-320a and miR-363 could act cooperatively to enhance viral pathogenesis in the lung and spleen of sheep by downregulating multiple immune response genes. The study provides important insight into the molecular pathogenesis of PPR by identifying that the PPRV Izatnagar/94 isolate elicits a stronger host response in goats than in sheep.",,"Pandey, A.;Sahu, A.

1601,Genomic diversity and adaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium from the analysis of six genomes of different phage types,"Background: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (or simply Typhimurium) is the most common serovar in both human and livestock infections in Australia and many other countries. Typhimurium is a broad host-range serovar, but has also evolved into host-adapted variants (i.e. isolated from a specific host such as pigeons). Six Typhimurium strains of different phage types (defined by patterns of susceptibility to lysis by a panel of bacteriophage) were analyzed using Illumina high-throughput genomic sequencing. Results: Between-strain variations were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average of 611 SNPs per strain ranging from 391 SNPs to 922 SNPs. There were seven insertions/deletions (indels) with full or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to an IS200 insertion, and 15 pseudogenes due to premature termination. Four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be related to virulence. Nine prophages or prophage residues were identified in the six strains. Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2 and the phage residues sopE2 and sspH2 were present in all six genomes, while Fels-1, Fels-2, ST64B, ST104 and CP4-57 were differentially present. Four strains carried the 90 kb plasmid pSLT, which contains several known virulence genes. However, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. In addition, one strain had a new plasmid similar to plasmid pHCM2 from Typhi strain CT18. Conclusion: The genomic data suggest that between-strain variations are mainly due to the accumulation of SNPs, some of which led to gene silencing. Unique genetic elements common between host-adapted phage types were not found. This study advanced our understanding of Typhimurium evolution and adaptation at the genomic level. © 2013 Pang et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Pang, S.;Octavia, S.;Feng, L.;Liu, B.;Reeves, P.

1602,Detection of a mammalian-like astrovirus in European roller (Coracias garrulus),"Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. The Astroviridae family includes two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which, to the best of our knowledge, infect mammals and birds, respectively. However, a recent seroprevalence study showed that humans with contact with turkeys can develop serological reactions to turkey astrovirus and mink may have been infected with avastrovirus. These data suggest that the ""host species/astrovirus genus"" association should be permeable; However, mamastrovirus infection has not yet been reported in bird species. In this study, a novel astrovirus was identified by viral metagenomics and RT-PCR methods in 2 (11%) of 19 fecal samples collected from a wild, carnivorous bird species, the European roller (Coracias garrulus) from two breeding sites in Hungary. The complete genome sequence of Astrovirus Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 (KP663426) was 7025 nt in length and exhibited some unique genomic features, including an unusually long spacer between the subgenomic RNA promoter and the ORF2 initiation codon. Using the BLASTp Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011, the highest AS identities were 35%, 61% and 34% to MAstV 32 (JF713710, host: pig), to MAstV 23 (JF729316, host: rabbit) and to unclassified porcinem Astrovirus ( JX684071) in ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. The same proteins from Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had 25%, 66% and 33% aa identities with the corresponding proteins of murine astrovirus (JX544743) as the closest strain. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 represents the first member of a new mamaztrovirus species. The data suggest that both mammals and birds may have been exposed to mamastroviruses and avastroviruses, offering opportunities for cross-species infection and viral adaptation with cross-class astroviruses, particularly in carnivorous animals. Further investigation is needed to determine the origin, natural host range, distribution, and vertebrate distribution of Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011.",,"Pankovics, P.;Boros, A.;Kiss, T.;Delwart, E.;Reuter, G.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.020,0
1603,First detection of Nebovirus (Caliciviridae) in a faecal sample from calves suffering from diarrhea in Hungary,"Neboviruses are the youngest members of the family Calicivirdae in the genus Nebovirus, which can be etiological agents of diarrhea and intestinal diseases in calves (Bos taurus). The genus has two prototypes: the viruses Newbury-1 (Bo/Newbury1/1976/UK, DQ013304) and Nebraska (BEC/NB/80/US, AY082891). Based on the viral capsid protein (VP1), neboviruses are divided into 4 phylogenetic lineages (lineage 1-4). The authors' aims were the detection, genetic characterization and phylogenetic classification of neboviruses from 1-1 faecal samples from diarrheal calves living on two different cattle farms in Hungary. After routine bacteriological and virological diagnostics, the nebovirus was detected and the complete genome determined using molecular biological methods (454 pyrosequencing, RT-PCR, 5'/3' RACE RT-PCR and Direct Chain Terminated Sequencing). Using the pyrosequencing method, the contigs of the nebovirus sequences from one of the faecal samples were aligned and the complete viral genome was expanded using an additional 4 RT-PCR reactions. The genome of Nebovirus strain Bo/M3641/2011/HUN (JX018212) - 5'UTR (74nt)/ORF1 (6630nt)/ORF2 (677nt)/3'UTR(67nt) - was 7453nt long and is almost 95 in length % nucleotide match with strain Bo/BEC/Penrith140/2000/UK virus. Strain Bo/M3641/2011/HUN virus can be classified phylogenetically in lineage 1; Newbury-1-like phylogenetic group. In this study, the authors report the first detection, characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of Nebovirus in Hungary, which are alleged to be pathogenic agents, were already present in Hungarian cattle herds, and may contribute to calf diarrhea of unknown origin.",,"Pankovics, P.;Boros, A.;Nemes, C.;Delwart, E.;Reuter, G.",2013.0,Jan,,0
1604,Molecular characterization of a novel picobirnavirus in a chicken,"Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are bipartite viruses with a wide geographic and host species distribution. The number of new PBV sequences has increased with the help of viral metagenomics. A new strain of picobirnavirus, pbv/CHK/M3841/HUN/2011, was identified by viral metagenomics; the complete sequences of segment 1 (MH327933) and 2 (MH327934) were obtained by RT-PCR from a cloacal sample of a diseased broiler breeder in Hungary. Although the conserved nucleotide (e.g. ribosome binding site) and amino acid motifs (e.g. ExxRxNxxxE, S-domain of the viral capsid and motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) were identifiable in the chick picobirnavirus genome, this was demonstrated putative segment 1 shared low (<30%) amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding proteins of marmot and dromedary PBVs, while segment 2 exhibited higher (<70%) amino acid sequence identity with a wolf PBV protein sequence. This is the first full genome picobirnavirus sequence from a broiler breeder chicken, but the pathogenicity of this virus is still in question.",,"Pankovics, P.;Boros, Ã;Nemes, C.;Kapusinszky, B.;Delwart, E.;Reuter, G.",2018.0,,10.1007/s00705-018-4012-6,1

The complete genome of finch picornavirus strain Waxbill/DB01/HUN/2014 (MF977321) showed the highest amino acid sequence identity of 38.9%, 61.6%, 69.6% in P1cap, 2Chel and 3CproDpol, respectively, with Passerivirus A1 (GU182406 ). A high viral load (6.58 × 1010 genomic copies/ml) was measured in a cloacal sample and in the tissues (spinal cord, lung and gut) of two other affected finches. In addition to intestinal symptoms (diarrhea), the presence of extraintestinal viruses suggests a generalized infection in this deadly disease, for which Passerivirus could be a causative agent.",,"Pankovics, P.;Boros, Ã;Phan, T.

1606,Enteric viruses detected by molecular methods in commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the United States between 2005 and 2006,"Gut samples collected in 2005 and 2006 from 43 commercial broiler and 33 commercial turkey flocks from all regions of the United States were analyzed for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for the presence of Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Reovirus and Coronavirus tests for the presence of group 1 and 2 adenovirus by PCR. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to further characterize the viruses and to assess species association and geographic patterns. Astroviruses were identified in samples from 86% of chicken flocks and 100% of turkey flocks. Both chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis virus (ANV) have been identified in chicken samples, and often both viruses have been detected in the same flock. Turkey astrovirus type 2 and turkey astrovirus type 1 were found in 100% and 15.4% of turkey flocks, respectively. In addition, 12.5% of the turkey flocks were positive for ANV. Rotavirus was present in 46.5% of chicken flocks tested and 69.7% of turkey flocks tested. Chicken and turkey rotaviruses were species-sorted based on the NSP4 gene sequence of rotavirus. The rotaviruses originating from Turkey are also sorted by geographic location. Reoviruses were identified in 62.8% and 45.5% of chicken and turkey flocks, respectively. Based on the reovirus S4 gene segment, the chicken and turkey-derived viruses were sorted separately and they differed from all previously reported avian reoviruses. Corona viruses were detected in the intestinal contents of chickens, but not turkeys. Adenoviruses were not detected in any chicken or turkey flock. Of a total of 76 chicken and turkey flocks tested, only three chicken flocks were negative for all viruses targeted in this study. Most herds were positive for two or more of the viruses, and overall no clear pattern of geographic virus distribution was evident. This study provides updated enteric virus prevalence data for the United States using molecular methods and confirms that enteric viruses are widespread in poultry in the United States, although the clinical significance of most of these viruses remains unclear.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M.

1607,Regular monitoring of commercial turkeys for enteric virus indicates the continued presence of astrovirus and rotavirus in the farms,"Using molecular detection methods, a longitudinal study was carried out on the detection of enteric viruses in the intestinal contents of turkeys in eight commercial farms and one research facility. Intestinal contents were collected from turkeys prior to placement, with each flock being resampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks of age. Samples were screened for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and for adenovirus groups 1 and 2 by PCR. Rotavirus was the only virus detected prior to placement (7 out of 16 samples examined). All commercial flocks were positive for rotavirus and astrovirus from 2 to 6 weeks of age and most were intermittently positive until 12 weeks of age when the birds were processed. Of the 96 samples collected from birds on the farms, 89.5% were positive for astrovirus and 67.7% positive for rotavirus. All flocks were negative for TCoV, reovirus and adenovirus group 1 at all time points and positive for adenovirus group 2 (hemorrhagic enteritis virus) at 6 weeks of age. All monitored flocks were assessed as healthy or normal by field personnel. Turkeys reared in experimental facilities that had been vacant for months and thoroughly cleaned had higher body weight and lower feed conversion rates than turkeys reared in commercial farms at 5 weeks of age. Intestinal samples taken from these turkeys at 1, 2 and 3 weeks of age were free of enteric virus. This report shows that astrovirus and rotavirus can be present throughout the life of a turkey flock. Comparison of infected birds with a group of turkeys negative for enteric virus by the methods used here suggests that astrovirus and/or rotavirus may affect production. The full impact on herd performance remains to be determined.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M. J.;Spackman, E.;Day, J. M.;Rives, D.",2007.0,,10.1637/0005-2086(2007)51[674:Pmoctf]2.0.Co;2,0
1608,Molecular characterization and typing of chicken and turkey astroviruses circulating in the United States: diagnostic implications,"Avian astroviruses were detected by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction in gut contents collected from commercial chickens and turkeys in the United States in 2003-2005. Astroviruses have been detected in birds from both healthy and underperforming flocks, with or without enteric disease. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using polymerase (ORF-1b) gene sequence data from 41 Turkey-derived astroviruses and 23 chicken-derived astroviruses. All currently available avian astrovirus sequence data and selected mammalian astrovirus sequence data were included in the analysis. Four groups of avian astroviruses were observed by phylogenetic analysis: turkey astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1)-like viruses, turkey astrovirus type 2 (TAstV-2)-like viruses, both detected in turkeys; Avian nephritis virus (ANV)-like viruses identified in both chickens and turkeys; and a new group of chicken astroviruses (CAstV). For these four groups, amino acid identity ranged from 50.1% to 73.8% and was a maximum of 49.4% for all avian isolates compared to the mammalian astroviruses. There were several phylogenetic subgroups within the TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV groups based on 9% nucleotide sequence divergence. Phylogenetic analysis did not result in a clear sorting by geographic region or isolation date. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the detection of a specific astrovirus and the presence of intestinal disease or poor performance. Based on these data, a revision of the current taxonomic classification for avian astroviruses within the Avastrovirus genus is warranted.",,"Pantin-Jackwood, M. J.;Spackman, E.;Woolcock, P.

1609,Two oncogenes in avian carcinoma virus MH2: myc and mht,"The 5.2 kilobase (kb) RNA genome of the avian carcinoma virus MH2 has the genetic structure 5'-delta gag (0.2 kb)-mht (1.2 kb)-myc (1.4 kb)-c(0 ,4kb)-poly (A)(0.2kb)-3'. delta gag is a partial retroviral core protein, mht and myc are cell-derived MH2-specific sequences, and c is the 3'-terminal retroviral vector sequence. the following results were obtained from the complete nucleotide sequences of the mht and myc genes in MH2. (i) delta gag-mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides ending with a stop codon near the 3' end of the mht gene. The 3,969 nucleotides from mht to the stop codon are 80% sequence related to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (MSV 3611) (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc coding region in MH2 is preceded by 181 nucleotides derived from the intron immediately upstream of the second exon of the cellular chicken protomyc gene, followed by an RNA splicing acceptor site shared with the protomyc gene, followed by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the protomyc beyond which it is collinear up to a 3' termination codon and 40 noncoding nucleotides with the myc sequences of avian retrovirus MC29 and chicken protomyc. Thus, myc forms a second MH2-specific gene together with a 5' retroviral exon. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the delta-gag-mht gene, which is closely related to the delta-gag-raf transforming gene of MSV 3611 and the myc gene related to the transforming gene of MC29. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the cellular proto-onc genes, which become viral onc genes upon sequence transduction, are a small group, since out of the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses, from to which the mht/raf homology is so far closest.",,"Papas, T.

Over the past 10 years, influenza vaccination has declined in both the general population (from 15.7% in 2004-2005 to 11.7% in 2013-2014) and in the vaccine target population of persons aged ≥ 65 years (from 65.3% in 2004-2005 to 48.6% in 2013-2014) and is well below the planned minimum threshold (75%). The highest rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) were recorded during the 2004-2005 and 2009-2010 epidemics (peak incidence: 12.04 and 13.28, respectively). Both seasons were marked by the introduction of new virus strains: A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) (a drifted hemagglutinin variant) and A/California/7/2009(H1N1) pandemic virus (a quadruple reassortant from pigs), respectively. . Since antigenic agreement between vaccine and circulating strains was good in both seasons, a relevant proportion of cases could have been prevented by vaccination. A different situation was observed during the 2011-2012 season, when ILI morbidity rates in individuals aged ≥ 65 years were 1.5 to 6 times higher than in the other epidemics studied. The higher morbidity resulted from the circulation during the 2011-2012 season of an A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like variant that showed lower genetic similarity to the A(H3N2) strain included in the 2011-2012 vaccine composition was included.

The probes were P-type specific (VP4) and showed little or no cross-reactivity with double-stranded RNA from heterologous rotavirus P-types. Our studies indicate that among the seven BRV isolates tested, at least three P-types, as defined by polymerase chain reaction-derived VP4 gene probes from the UK, NCDV and Cr strains, are present.",,"Parwani, A.

1619,Complete genome sequence analysis of chicken astrovirus isolate from India,"Objective: Chicken astroviruses are known to cause severe disease in chickens, resulting in increased mortality and the ""white chick"" condition. Here we want to characterize the causative agent of visceral gout with suspected astrovirus infection in broiler breeders. Methods: Total RNA isolated from allantoic fluid of SPF embryos passaged with infected chicken samples was sequenced by whole genome shotgun sequencing using an Ion Torrent PGM platform. The sequence was analyzed for the presence of coding and non-coding features, its similarity to reported isolates, and an epitope analysis of the capsid structural protein. Results: The consensus length of the 7513 bp genomic sequence of the Indian isolate of chicken astrovirus was obtained after assembling 14,121 high quality reads. The genome consisted of 13 bp 5-UTR, three open reading frames (ORFs) including ORF1a encoding serine protease, ORF1b encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF2 encoding capsid protein, and 298 bp 3- UTR containing two coronavirus stem loop II-like ""s2m"" motifs and a 19 nucleotide poly-A stretch. The genetic analysis of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 showed the highest sequence similarity of 86.94% with the chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011, followed by 84.76% with CAstV/4175 and 74.48% with CAstV/Poland /G059/2014 isolates. The capsid structural protein of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 showed 84.67% similarity to the chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011, 81.06% to CAstV/4175 and 41.18% to CAstV/Poland/G059/2014 -Isolates. However, the capsid protein sequence showed a high degree of sequence identity at the nucleotide level (98.64-99.32%) and at the amino acid level (97.74-98.69%) with reported sequences from Indian isolates, indicating their common origin and limited sequence divergence . Epitope analysis by SVMTriP identified two unique epitopes in our isolate, seven common epitopes among Indian isolates, and two common epitopes among all isolates except the Polish isolate, which all carried different epitopes.",,"Patel, A.

1620,Metagenome of clinically diseased and healthy broilers affected by respiratory disease,"In the recent past, respiratory infection has become a major challenge for poultry farmers. Various pathogens including avian pneumovirus (APV), avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Avibacterium paragallinarum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG ) and avian pathogen Escherichia coli (APEC) are involved in the avian respiratory disease complex [1], [2] (Bradbury, 1984; Roussan et al., 2008). Therefore, respiratory disease complex is the most serious disease affecting poultry, causing severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide [3] (Murthy et al., 2008). In recent years, metagenomics has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for detecting pathogens directly from clinical samples without prior knowledge of the organism in a given sample [4], [5] (Schuster, 2008; Pereira et al., 2010). High-throughput next-generation sequencing technology was used to sequence the isolated genomic DNA. These data provide insight into the taxonomic and functional status of microorganisms responsible for causing respiratory infections in broilers. Data from these metagenomes are available on the BioSample Submission Portal as Bioproject PRJNA339659 and SRA accession numbers SRR5997823, SRR5992854, SRR6037376, SRR6024702, SRR6012248 and SRR6008913.",,"Patel, J.

1621,"Equine Herpesviruses 1 (EHV-1) and 4 (EHV-4) - Epidemiology, Disease and Immunoprophylaxis: A Brief Review","This review article focuses on the epidemiology, latency and pathogenesis, and approaches to control equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and 4 (EHV-4) infection in horses. Although both viruses can cause febrile rhinopneumonitis, EHV-1 is the leading cause of abortion, paresis and neonatal death. The lesion central to these three conditions is necrotizing vasculitis and thrombosis resulting from lytic infection of endothelial cells lining blood capillaries. The initiation of infection in these lesions is probably due to reactivated EHV-1 from latently infected leukocytes. However, the host factors responsible for reactivation are still poorly understood. While the development of vaccines against these important equine viruses using classical and modern approaches has been ongoing for over five decades, progress has been slow compared to other alpha-herpesviruses of veterinary importance affecting cattle and swine. However, recent data with a temperature-sensitive live EHV-1 vaccine are promising. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,"Patel, J. R.;Heldens, J.",2005.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2004.04.018,0

Reactivity was used to construct epitope similarity maps for all viruses. Four major virus subgroups have been identified. One subgroup corresponded to classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and included most porcine pestiviruses but none from ruminants. A second subset contained viruses mainly of bovine origin, including reference bovine viral diarrhea (BVDV) viruses such as NADL; but viruses from pigs and sheep were also represented. A third subgroup, represented by border disease virus (BDV) reference strains, comprised mainly ovine isolates but also porcine viruses. The fourth and last defined subgroup contained no reference strains of CSFV, BVDV or BDV, but included atypical viruses from bovine, ovine and porcine. The subgrouping scheme was supported by genetic comparisons between representative viruses from the 4 subgroups and by virus neutralization with polyclonal sera.",,"Paton, D. J.;Sands, J.

1624,"Foot and Mouth Disease Control Options: Knowledge, Skills and Policy","Foot-and-mouth disease can be controlled by zoosanitary measures and vaccination, but this is difficult due to the existence of multiple serotypes of the causative virus, multiple host species including wild animals, and extreme contagiousness. Although the disease is unbearable for modern high-production livestock systems, it is not usually fatal and is often not a priority for control in many developing countries, which remain a reservoir for virus spread. The phylogenetic analysis of viruses circulating worldwide reveals seven main reservoirs, each requiring a tailored regional control strategy. Countries that eradicate the disease reap significant trade benefits, but in addition to regional cooperation, achieving and maintaining that status with current tools takes a lot of time, money and effort. Therefore, a progressive approach is needed that can provide intermediate benefits on the way to ultimate eradication. Research is needed to understand and predict patterns of virus persistence and emergence and to improve vaccine selection. Better diagnostic methods and, above all, better vaccines could significantly improve control in both free and affected parts of the world. In particular, vaccines with improved thermostability and longer immunity would facilitate control and make them less dependent on advanced veterinary infrastructure. © 2009 The Royal Society.",,"Paton, D.

1625,Genetic heterogeneity of Indian field isolates of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O as shown by partial sequencing of the 1D gene,"The sequence of 165 nucleotides at the 3' end of the 1D gene determined from RT-PCR amplified cDNA fragments of 25 type O strains isolated between 1987 and 1995 from different parts/regions of India and the vaccine strain (R2/75) currently used in India have been subjected to a phylogenetic analysis. An isolate from neighboring Nepal was also included in the study. The virus/field strains showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity among themselves with a percentage divergence in the nucleotide sequence ranging from 1.2 to 19.4%. The Indian strains were far removed (13.3-20.6%) from the exotic type O strains of O1BFS, O1K, and O1Campos. The type O strains analyzed were classified into three genotypes based on the degree of observed divergence in nucleotide sequence. The vaccine virus type O (R2/75) differed >7% (7.3-15.2%) from the field strains, demonstrating significant (>5%) genetic heterogeneity between the two. The phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct lineages, namely (i) lineage 1, represented by the exotic tribes, (ii) lineage 2, represented by 25 of the field tribes, grouped into seven subgroups/sublineages (2a-2g), and (iii ) line 3, represented by a unique field isolate that shared the branch/origin with the vaccine strain. Lineage 2, consisting of 25 of the 26 type O field strains analyzed, was placed almost equidistant to lines 1 and 3 in the phylogenetic tree. The vaccine strain was closer to the viruses in line 2. Although there was no specific distribution pattern of sequences in different geographic regions of India, the viruses/sequences in subgroup 2f appeared to be restricted to the southern states. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence in the immunodominant regions 133-160 and 200-208 of the 1D gene product (VP1) showed that the two lineage 3 viruses had unique amino acid residues at positions 138 (D), 139 (G). , 144 (I) and 158 (A) compared to the rest of the tribes, including the exotic ones. Comparison of the amino acid residues at critical positions 144, 148, 149, 151, 153, 154 and 208 showed similarity between the type O strains analyzed. The virus stocks showed a variation (V/L/I) at position 144. One field strain showed a replacement of Q149â†'E and another of P208â†'L. Thus, the study found that the FMD type O virus populations circulating and causing disease outbreaks in India are genetically very heterogeneous but related in the immunodominant region of the VP1 polypeptide, and that it is present in almost every region of the There is more than one genetically distinct virus population in the country, which is possible due to the unrestricted movement of animals in the country. The involvement of the vaccine virus in disease outbreaks was excluded since the field strains (with the exception of strain 3) were phylogenetically distinct.

1626,Isolation of a bovine rotavirus with a “super short” RNA electrophoresis pattern from a calf with diarrhea,"rotavirus with a ""super short"" RNA electropherotype was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and designated the VMRI strain. Segments 10 and 11 of this rotavirus migrated more slowly than those of bovine rotavirus strains NCDV, B641 and B223. The electrophoretic pattern of the VMRI strain was similar to that reported for rotavirus with supershort RNA electropherotypes from humans and rabbits. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization showed that gene 11 of the VMRI strain was altered and migrated between gene segments 9 and 10. The subgroup of the VMRI strain was shown to be subgroup I. The VMRI strain of bovine rotavirus was neutralized by polyclonal antisera, antibodies against rotavirus serotype 6 (bovine serotype I) strains NCDV and B641, and by ascites fluid containing monoclonal antibodies directed against VP7 of rotavirus serotype 6. The VMRI strain was not neutralized by either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against strain B223 (bovine rotavirus serotype II). Accumulated data on neutralization of the VMRI strain with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies suggests that this virus is a member of the NCDV group (serotype 6) of rotaviruses (bovine rotavirus serotype I).",,"Paul, P.

Here we describe the full-length genomic sequences and organization of the prototype strains of VSIV-2 cocal virus (COCV) and VSIV-3 alagoas virus (VSAV). These viruses displayed similar genomic organization to VSIV field isolates, except that the nonstructural C'/C proteins, which were markedly conserved in all vesiculoviruses, were absent in VSAV.

1628,Genetic and antigenic relationships of vesicular stomatitis viruses from South America,"Vesicular stomatitis (VS) viruses have been classified into two serotypes: New Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV). Here we have characterized field isolates causing vesicular stomatitis in Brazil and Argentina over a 35-year period. Cluster analysis based on either serological relatedness as derived from virus neutralization and complement fixation assays or nucleotide sequences from two separate genes (phosphoprotein or glycoprotein) grouped the field isolates into two distinct monophyletic groups within the Indiana serogroup. One group included seven viruses from Brazil and Argentina that were serologically classified as Indiana-2 and Cocal virus (COCV). The other group contained three viruses from Brazil serologically classified as Indiana-3 and the prototype of this group, Alagoas virus (VSAV). Interestingly, two vesiculoviruses isolated from insects but which do not cause disease in animals, one from Brazil (Maraba virus; MARAV) and the other from Colombia (CoAr 171638), have been divided into two separate genetic lineages within the Indiana serotype. Our data support the classification of viruses causing clinical VS in livestock in Brazil and Argentina into two distinct groups: Indiana-2 (VSIV-2) and Indiana-3 (VSIV-3). We recommend using a nomenclature for these viruses that includes serotype, year and site of emergence, and affected host.

1629,Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for enterally transmitted acute hepatitis in humans with two distinct epidemiological patterns. Large waterborne epidemics affecting thousands of people have been observed in endemic areas, while sporadic cases have been described in non-endemic areas. Although contaminated water is well documented as a source of infection in endemic areas, the transmission pathways in non-endemic areas are much less known. HEV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae with at least four known major genotypes (1-4) of mammalian HEV and one avian HEV. HEV is unique among known hepatitis viruses in that it has an animal reservoir. Unlike humans, pigs and other mammalian species infected with HEV generally remain asymptomatic, whereas chickens infected with avian HEV can develop a disease known as hepatitis splenomegaly syndrome. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are found exclusively in humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 are found in both humans and other mammals. Several lines of evidence indicate that animal-to-human transmission occurs in some cases with HEV genotypes 3 and 4. In addition, people who have direct contact with animals are at a higher risk of HEV infection. Cross-species infections with HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been demonstrated experimentally. However, not all sources of human infection have been identified to date, and in many cases the origin of HEV infection in humans is unknown. © INRA, Computational Sciences, 2010.",,"Pavio, N.;Meng, X.

1632,Limited evidence for transhemispheric movement of avian influenza viruses among contemporary North American shorebird isolates,"Migration routes of gulls, terns and shorebirds (Charadriiformes) are known to cross hemispheric boundaries and intersect with outbreak areas of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Previous assessments of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in species of this taxonomic order have provided some evidence of transhemispheric movement of viral genes. Specifically, to clarify the role of shorebird species in the transhemispheric movement of influenza viruses, to assess the temporal variation in Eurasian lineages previously observed in North American shorebirds, and to assess the need for continued sampling of these birds for HPAI in North America, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of >700 contemporary sequences isolated between 2000 and 2008. Evidence for transhemispheric rearrangement among North American wader LPAI gene segments was less (0.88%) than previous assessments and occurred only in eastern North American isolates. In addition, half of the reassortment events occurred in only two isolates. The unique phylogenetic placement of these specimens suggests secondary infection and/or involvement of other migratory species such as gulls. Eurasian lineages observed in North American shorebirds before the year 2000 have not been detected in contemporary samples, suggesting temporal variation in LPAI lineages.",,"Pearce, J. M.;Ramey, A.

1633,Viral recombination blurs taxonomic boundaries: studying single-stranded DNA viruses in a sewage treatment plant,"Understanding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities, especially those of economic interest, is of paramount importance for maintaining healthy and efficient microbial communities on agricultural sites and large industrial crops, including bioprocessors. Sewage treatment plants are large bioprocessors that receive water from multiple sources and become reservoirs for the accumulation of many virus families that infect a wide range of hosts. To study this complex collection of viruses, full genomes of circular ssDNA viruses were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant using a combination of sucrose gradient sizing and rolling circle amplification and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Single-stranded DNA viruses are among the least understood groups of microbial pathogens due to genomic biases and difficulties in cultivation, especially when compared to the larger, more commonly studied dsDNA viruses. However, the group contains several notable, well-studied examples, including agricultural pathogens that infect both livestock and crops (Circoviridae and Geminiviridae) and model organisms for genetic and evolutionary studies (Microviridae). Examination of the collected virus DNA provided evidence for 83 unique genotypic groupings that were genetically distinct from known virus types and showed great diversity within the community. In addition, although these genomes share similarities with known viral families such as Circoviridae, Geminiviridae, and Microviridae, many are so diverse that they may represent new taxonomic groups. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the protocol in separating bacteria and large viruses from the targeted ssDNA viruses and the ability to use this protocol to obtain an in-depth analysis of the diversity within this group.",,"Pearson, V.

Aminoff et al. described. [2] and was later used by Van Deusen et al. modified to a microtiter plate method (micro-NI). [4]. The micro NI method reduces the amount of reagents required, allows for antigenic classification of many isolates simultaneously, and eliminates spectrophotometric interpretation of results. Although the macro NI has proven to be more sensitive than the micro NI, the micro NI test is very useful for testing sera for the presence of NA antibodies and has proven to be a convenient and rapid method for virus classification.

Discovering its origin and when it becomes transmissible between humans is a global priority. We present here an interdisciplinary method to trace the origin of the H7N9 virus in China and to establish an evolutionary dynamics model for its human-to-human transmission through mutations. After comparing influenza viruses from China since 1983, we constructed an evolutionary phylogenetic tree of A/H7N9/2013 China virus and found that the human viral infections were avian in origin and coalesced into an independent lineage. Comparing hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of A/H7N9/2013 China virus with all human-to-human, avian and swine flu viruses in China over the past 30 years, we found that A/H7N9/ 2013 China viruses originated from Baer's Pochard H7N1 virus of Hu Nan province 2010 (HA gene, EPI: 370846, similarity with H7N9 is 95.5%) and duck influenza virus of Nanchang city 2000 (NA gene , EPI: 387555, similarity to H7N9 is 97%) by genetic rearrangement. Comparison of the HA and NA gene sequences showed that A/H7N9/2013 China virus was dissimilar to human-to-human influenza viruses. To simulate the evolutionary dynamics required for human-to-human transmission mutations of the H7N9 virus, we used the Markov model. The result of this calculation showed that the virus would acquire characteristics for human-to-human transmission in 11.3 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2-11.3, HA gene). © 2014 Peng et al.",,"Peng, J.;Yang, H.;Jiang, H.;Lin, Y.

1640,"Whole genome analysis of thirteen TT virus variants, classified into fourth and fifth genetic groups, isolated from viremic infants","TT virus (TTV) DNA in serum samples obtained from 24 TTV-infected infants was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with inverse primers derived from the untranslated region. The amplified PCR products were molecularly cloned; six clones each were analyzed. Seventy-six (53%) of the 144 TTV clones were classified into Group 4 (YONBAN isolates) and 22 (15%) into a new genetic group (Group 5). The TTV clones in group 4 were classified into 9 types and those in group 5 into 4 types. The entire nucleotide sequence of each representative clone from the 13 types was determined; they were 3570-3770 nucleotides long and had low homology to group 1-3 TTVs (TA278, PMV and SANBAN isolates). A phylogenetic tree based on the entire nucleotide sequence of open reading frame 1 confirmed the presence of five distinct clusters separated by a bootstrap value of 100%. Analysis of 13 TTV variants showed conservation of genomic organization and transcriptional profile in all TTV groups. TTV group 4 was detected in 54% and 72% of 7- to 12-month-old infants in Japan and China, respectively, which is comparable to that in adults in each country, indicating early and frequent acquisition of this TTV group in infancy.",,"Peng, Y.

1641,Maedi Visna virus infection in sheep: a review,"Maedi Visna virus (MVV) is classified as a lentivirus in the Retroviridae family. The MVV genome comprises three genes: gag, which encodes group-specific antigens; pol, which encodes reverse transcriptase, integrase, RNAse H, protease, and dUTPase, and env, the gene that encodes the surface glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and entry of the virus into its host cell. Like other lentiviruses, the genome also contains genes for regulatory proteins, ie vif, rev and tat. The coding regions of the genome are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs), which play critical roles in viral genome replication and provide binding sites for cellular transcription factors. The target organs of MVV are, in descending order of importance, the lungs, mammary glands, joints and brain. In these organs, the virus replicates in mature macrophages and induces slowly progressive inflammatory lesions containing B and T lymphocytes. The clinical signs of MVV infection, ie dyspnea, weight loss, mastitis and arthritis, are related to the location of these lesions. Infection with MVV induces the formation of antibodies that can be detected by agar gel immunodiffusion, ELISA and the serum neutralization assay. With no antiviral treatment or vaccine available, diagnostic testing forms the backbone of most measures to prevent the spread of MVV. However, since today's serological assays still lack sensitivity and specificity, molecular biological methods are being developed that enable the detection of viruses in peripheral blood, milk and tissue samples. Future research must focus on both the development of new diagnostic tests and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MVV infection.",,"PÃ©pin, M.;Vitu, C.;Russo, P.;Mornex, J.

1643,Avian influenza virus isolated in wild aquatic birds in Argentina: Evidence of a possibly unique phylogenetic lineage in South America,"Avian influenza (AI) viruses have been isolated sporadically in South America. The most recent reports come from an outbreak in commercial poultry in Chile in 2002 and its putative ancestor in a wild bird in Bolivia in 2001. Extensive surveillance of wild birds was carried out in Argentina between 2006 and 2007. Using RRT-PCR, 12 AI positive detections were made from cloacal swabs. One of these positive samples yielded an AI virus isolated from a wild kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) caught off the south Atlantic coast of Argentina. Further characterization by nucleotide sequencing shows that it belongs to the H13N9 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 viral genes suggests that the 6 internal genes are related to the Chilean and Bolivian isolates. The analysis also suggests that a cluster of phylogenetically related AI viruses from South America may have evolved independently and with minimal gene sharing from influenza viruses at other latitudes.

1644,Isolation and complete genomic characterization of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza viruses from Cuban swine herds,"The emergence of the H1N1/2009 pandemic influenza virus poses a potential global threat to human and animal health. In this study, we performed pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus surveillance in pig herds in Cuba to determine whether the virus spread among pig populations circulated. As a result, we describe for the first time the detection of the pandemic influenza virus H1N1/2009 in pig herds in Cuba. In addition, phylogenetic analyzes and molecular characterizations of three viral isolates were performed. Phylogenetic relationships confirmed that all eight genes from the three isolates originate from the H1N1/2009 pandemic virus. The Cuban isolates formed an independent cluster within the pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza strains.

1645,Hepatitis E: An Emerging Disease,"Infection with the hepatitis E virus is currently the most common cause of acute hepatitis and jaundice worldwide. According to WHO estimates, around two billion people, which corresponds to one third of the world's population, live in HEV-endemic areas and are therefore at risk of infection. In developed countries, the circulation of the virus has been confirmed in both human and animal (pig, wild boar, deer) sewage; However, the incidence rate is low compared to developing countries, where faecal-oral transmitted outbreaks of acute hepatitis originate, more often in the flood season or after natural disasters associated with poor sanitation conditions. There are currently 4 known genotypes of HEV. Genotypes 1 and 2 are isolated in all human epidemic outbreaks in developing countries, while genotypes 3 and 4 are isolated not only in humans but also in animals in both developing and developed countries. These data support genotypes 3 and 4 to be zoonotic in nature. The diagnosis of this disease is based on the detection of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in blood serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent methods. However, the best confirmation of diagnosis is RT-PCR, which detects HEV RNA in blood serum and also provides the genotype. The clinical course is generally that of acute hepatitis, which in some cases may require hospitalization and may progress to chronic hepatitis in transplant recipients or HIV-infected people. In addition, the virus poses a significant risk to pregnant women. Hepatitis E can present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, from a subclinical case to a chronic liver disease with extrahepatic manifestations. For this reason, the diagnosis is demanding if no differential diagnosis is made. There is no specific antiviral drug for hepatitis E, but satisfactory results have been observed in some patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa2a and/or ribavirin.",,"PÃ©rez-Gracia, M.

During the 2012/13 epidemic season in Spain, two A(H1N1)-pdm09 viruses with the specific Y155H substitution in the NA were detected and isolated from two patients diagnosed with severe respiratory syndrome and pneumonia who were susceptible to exposure to the intensive care unit was required. In contrast to what was observed with the seasonal A(H1N1) viruses, none of the Y155H A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses described here showed a phenotype of reduced inhibition by NAIs, as determined by the neuraminidase enzyme inhibition assay (MUNANA) definitely. High-throughput sequencing of the NA of both Y155H viruses showed that they consisted of >99% H155 variants. We believe that this report may contribute to a better understanding of the biological significance of amino acid substitutions in the neuraminidase protein in terms of influenza virus susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors.

1649,Utilization and tropism of the henipavirus receptor,"Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are the deadliest human pathogens within the Paramyxoviridae family, which includes human and animal pathogens of global biomedical importance. In humans, NiV and HeV infections cause respiratory and encephalitic diseases with high mortality rates. Henipaviruses (HNV) are the only paramyxoviruses classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens due to their extreme pathogenicity, potential for bioterrorism, and lack of approved vaccines and therapeutics. HNV use ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, highly conserved proteins, as viral entry receptors. This likely explains their unusually broad species tropism and also provides opportunities to study how receptor utilization, cellular tropism, and end-organ pathology are related to the pathobiology of HNV infection. The clinical and pathological manifestations of NiV and HeV virus infections are discussed in the chapters by Wong et al. and Geisbert et al. in this matter. Here we will discuss the biology of the HNV receptors and how receptor utilization is related to HNV cell tropism in vitro and in vivo. © 2012 Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Pernet, O.;Wang, Y.

1650,Biological and phylogenetic characterization of the virulent Newcastle disease virus circulating in Mexico,"In 2002-2003, outbreaks of velogenic Newcastle disease virus, closely related to the Mexican isolates, were confirmed in the United States (USA) in southern California, Arizona, Nevada and Texas. In this report, virulent NDVs isolated in Mexico between 1998 and 2006 were subjected to biological characterization using standard pathogenicity assays and phylogenetic analysis. Test results for mean time to death (MDT) of chick embryos ranged from 39.7 to 61.5 hours, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 1.59 to 1.94, compared to a possible maximum of 2.0. These isolates displayed a dibasic amino acid motif at the fusion protein cleavage site sequence required for host systemic replication. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that the Mexican virulent NDVs belong to the class II genotype V viruses and can be clearly divided into two groups as follows: isolates from 1998 to 2001 with close epidemiological relationship to the recent NDV outbreaks in the US and phylogenetically distinct viruses isolated from 2004 to 2006 that exhibited higher virulence. Assessing the evolution of viruses from Mexico and other neighboring countries will assist US surveillance efforts to early detect highly virulent NDV.",,"Perozo, F.;Merino, R.;Afonso, C.

1651,The antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response in mice is suppressed by infection with pathogenic lyssaviruses,"The responsiveness of T cells (RTC) was examined in BALB/c mice infected intramuscularly with various lyssaviruses. After infection by this peripheral route, two types of viruses could be classified according to their effects: 1) pathogenic viruses, including the fixed rabies Pasteur virus (serotype 1) and wild viruses belonging to serotype 1 (from a rabid fox in France and from a cow infected by a vampire bat in Brazil) or serotype 5 (European bat Lyssavirus 1); and 2) non-pathogenic viruses, including Mocola virus (serotype 3). RTC was tested by analyzing in vitro the ability of spleen T cells from infected BALB/c mice to produce cytokines after antigenic (purified lyssavirus antigens) or polyclonal (concanavalin A) stimulation. Cytokine production was followed by examination of interleukin-2 biological activity and assays for interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interferon-γ (IL2, IL4 and IFNγ) messenger RNAs (mRNA) by transcription into complementary DNA and amplification through the polymerase chain reaction. Initial production of biologically active IL2 and cytokine mRNA was observed in mice infected with pathogenic or non-pathogenic lyssaviruses. Only symptomatic mice (infected with pathogenic viruses) lost the ability to produce cytokines in vitro after antigen-specific stimulation. No such loss was observed after polyclonal stimulation. No loss was observed in mice peripherally infected with non-pathogenic viruses after stimulation with lyssavirus antigens. Thus, infection with pathogenic lyssaviruses peripherally in BALB/c mice induces a loss of T-cell responsiveness after antigen activation, but not after polyclonal activation.",,"Perrin, P.;Tino De Franco, M.;Jallet, C.;Fouque, F.;Morgeaux, S.;Tordo, N.;Colle, J.

1652,Conserved presence of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the lentivirus long terminal repeat promoter,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures of nucleic acids that epigenetically regulate cellular processes. In human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s reside in the unique viral LTR promoter. The folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; Stabilization by G4 ligands enhances this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We have here extended our investigation into the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5'LTR-U3 region were fully conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a bovine infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses showed evidence of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the ability to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR-G4 sequences were very similar in phylogenetically related primate viruses, while becoming increasingly different in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFκB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by a polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentivirus 5'-LTR-G4 region as a control center of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure can occur.",,"Perrone, R.;Lavezzo, E.;PalÃ¹, G.;Richter, S.

1653,To compare and contrast genes and biological signaling pathways responsive to Marek's disease virus infection using allele-specific expression and differential expression in broilers and layers,"Background: Marek's disease (MD) is a commercially important neoplastic disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), a naturally occurring oncogenic alphaherpesvirus. Improving genetic resistance to MD is desirable to improve current vaccines and other interventions to combat MD. High-throughput sequencing was used to profile spleen transcriptomes from single F1 offspring infected with MDV at 4 days of age, from both outbred broiler (meat-type) and inbred layer (egg-type) chicken lines that were migrating differentiated in genetic MDV resistance. The resulting information was used to identify SNPs, genes, and biological signaling pathways that exhibit allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection in each chicken species. In addition, we compared and contrasted the results of pathway analyzes (ASE and differential expression (DE)) between chicken types to provide information on the biological response to MDV infection. Results: With 7 high-performing individuals per line and treatment group, we identified 6,132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4,768 genes and 4,528 SNPs in 3,718 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, showing ASE in response to MDV infection. In addition, it was found that 548 and 434 genes showed DE in broilers and layers, respectively, after MDV infection. Comparing the datasets, only 72 SNPs and 850 genes for ASE and 20 genes for DE were shared between the two bird species. Although the chicken types used in this study were genetically distinct, at the signaling level, both TLR receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were enriched and showed a high proportion of ASE genes, especially at the beginning of the two regulatory pathways mentioned above. Conclusions: RNA sequencing using adequate biological replicates is a powerful approach to identify with high fidelity SNPs, genes, and signaling pathways associated with the transcriptional response to MDV infection. In addition, the SNPs exhibiting ASE in response to MDV infection provide a strong basis for determining the extent to which variation in expression affects MD incidence and provide genetic markers for genomic selection. However, given the low overlap between ASE-SNP sets (broilers vs. layers), it is likely that separate screens will need to be integrated for each population. Finally, comparison of gene lists obtained between these two different chicken types shows that TLR and JAK/STAT signaling are conserved when responding to MDV infection and can be altered by selection of genes affecting ASE exhibit found at the beginning of each signaling pathway. © 2013 Perumbakkam et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Perumbakkam, S.;Muir, W.

1655,Natural reservoirs for hepatitis C virus homologues,"The hepatitis C virus is recognized as a major public health problem, infecting 2 to 3% of the human population. Infection with hepatitis C virus causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation, and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus exhibits narrow host species tropism and naturally infects only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence of an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to the hepatitis C virus, which may have crossed species barriers to cause disease in humans and led to the current pandemic. In fact, due to this limited host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering the mechanistic analysis of viral pathogenesis, immune control, and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies have discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals that live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). The genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses that infect various mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of the hepatitis C virus in humans and improve our ability to predict pathogenesis and immune responses using manageable animal models to investigate. In this review article, we begin with an introduction to the genetic diversity of the hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses that are closely related to the hepatitis C virus.

The 5,049 base long genome contained two major ORFs encoding a 553 amino acid nonstructural protein and a 965 amino acid structural protein, which have the closest amino acid identities of 25 and 25 cows, respectively. Given the low degree of similarity, Sesavirus could be considered a prototype for a new genus with a proposed name Marinoparvovirus in the subfamily Parvovirinae.",,"Phan, T.

1662,The faecal viral flora of wild rodents,"The frequent interactions of rodents with humans make them a common source of zoonotic infections. To obtain a first unbiased measure of viral diversity in the intestinal tract of wild rodents, we sequenced partially purified, randomly amplified viral RNA and DNA in the feces of 105 wild rodents (mouse, vole, and rat) collected in California and Virginia. We identified sequences of decreasing frequency related to the mammalian virus families Circoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Adenoviridae and Coronaviridae. Seventeen small circular DNA genomes containing one or two replicase genes distantly related to the Circoviridae and representing several potentially novel virus families have been characterized. Two new candidate genera and a close genetic relative of the human pathogenic Aichi virus have been characterized in the Picornaviridae family. Fragments of the first murine sapelovirus and picobirnaviruses have been identified and the first murine astrovirus genome has been characterized. A mouse papillomavirus genome and fragments of a novel adenovirus and adenovirus-associated virus have also been sequenced. The second largest fraction of rodent fecal viromes was related to insect viruses in the families Densoviridae, Iridoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Bromoviridae, and Virgaviridae, followed by plant virus-related sequences in the Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Secoviridae, Partitiviridae, Tymoviridae, Alphaflexiviridae, and Tombus -Families reflecting the mainly insect and plant diet of rodents. Phylogenetic analyzes of complete and partial viral genomes therefore revealed many previously unreported viral species, genera, and families. The close genetic similarities found between some rodent and human viruses may reflect previous zoonoses. This study advances our understanding of viral diversity in wild rodents and highlights the large number of yet uncharacterized viruses in mammals.",,"Phan, T. G.;Kapusinszky, B.;Wang, C. L.;Rose, R.

1663,A third species of gyrovirus in human feces,"Until 2011, the genus Gyrovirus in the family Circoviridae consisted of a single virus (chicken anemia virus or CAV) that caused a common immunosuppressive illness in chickens, when a second gyrovirus (HGyV) was reported on the skin of 4% of healthy humans. HGyV is very closely related to a recently described chicken gyrovirus, AGV2, suggesting that they belong to the same virus species. During a viral metagenomic analysis of 100 human feces from children with diarrhea in Chile, we identified several known human pathogens (adenovirus, enterovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, norovirus, parechovirus, and rotavirus) and a new gyrovirus species that we named GyV3 and the one Similarity of <63% shows other gyrovirus proteins with evidence of recombination with CAV in their UTR. Consensus PCR of Gyroviridae showed a high prevalence of CAV DNA in diarrhea and normal faeces from Chilean children and faeces from US cats and dogs, which may reflect consumption of CAV-infected/vaccinated chickens.

1664,New astrovirus in human feces from Burkina Faso,"Background: A significant proportion of cases of diarrhea, one of the leading causes of child mortality worldwide, remain unexplained. Objectives: Identify viruses in unexplained cases of diarrhea using an unbiased metagenomic approach. Study design: Viral nucleic acids were enriched from the faeces of 48 cases of unexplained diarrhea from Burkina Faso, sequenced and compared to all known viral genomes. Results: The entire genome of a highly divergent Astrovirus was sequenced in a sample co-infected with Parechovirus 1. RT-PCR identified a single Astrovirus infection in these 48 patients, indicating a low prevalence. Human astrovirus BF34 was most closely related to human Mamastrovirus species 8 and 9, with which it shared 62%, 74%, and 57% of amino acid identities via its protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and capsid proteins, respectively.

During a viral metagenomic analysis of feces from children with acute diarrhea in Burkina Faso, we identified nucleic acids from anelloviruses, dependoviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses, bocaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, cosavirus, astroviruses and hepatitis B virus in decreasing prevalence. Also detected was sequences from a highly divergent parvovirus, tentatively named bufavirus, whose NS1 and VP1 proteins shared <39% and <31% identities to those of previously known parvoviruses. Four percent of the stool samples were PCR positive for this new parvovirus, including a related bufavirus species that showed only 72% identity in VP1. The high degree of genetic divergence of these related genomes from those of other parvoviruses indicates the presence of a proposed new Parvoviridae genus containing at least two species.

Virus particles were enriched from the faeces of 51 feral city pigeons (Columba livia) from Hong Kong and Hungary, their nucleic acids were randomly amplified and then sequenced. We identified sequences of known and new species from the virus families Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Adenovirus, Astroviridae and Caliciviridae (listed in decreasing number of reads), as well as plant and insect viruses likely derived from ingested foods. The nearly complete genome of a new species of a proposed parvovirus genus, tentatively named Aviparvovirus, contained an unusually long intermediate ORF that bears faint resemblance to an ORF of unknown function from an avian adenovirus. Picornaviruses found in both Asia and Europe, distantly related to turkey megrivirus and containing a highly divergent 2A1 region, have been termed mesiviruses.

1667,Nucleotide sequence analysis of a novel canary circovirus and its relationship to other members of the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae,"The circular, single-stranded DNA genome of a new canary circovirus, tentatively named canary circovirus (CaCV), has been cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that the genome was 1952 nucleotides (nt) in size and had the potential to encode three viral proteins including the putative capsid and replication-associated (Rep) proteins. The CaCV genome shared the greatest sequence similarity (58.3% nt identity) with the newly characterized columbid circovirus (CoCV) and was more distant with the two porcine circovirus strains PCV1 and PCV2, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) and a recently isolated virus related goose circovirus (GCV) isolate (46.8-50.9% nt identity). As with other members of the circovirus genus, several nt structures and amino acid motifs have been identified on the putative viral strain that are thought to be involved in viral replication. Phylogenetic analysis of both the capsid and Rep protein coding regions provided further evidence that CaCV is more closely related to CoCV and BFDV and more distantly to GCV, PCV1 and PCV2.",,"Phenix, K.

1669,Complete genome sequence-based comparative study of wild-type and vaccine strains of infectious laryngotracheitis virus from Italy,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens caused by an alphaherpesvirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Complete genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have recently been determined worldwide, but none originated in Europe. The aim of this study was to determine and analyze the complete genome sequences of five ILTV strains. The sequences were also compared to reveal strain similarity over time and to distinguish between wild-type and vaccine strains. Genomes of three ILTV field isolates from outbreaks that occurred in Italy in 1980, 2007 and 2011, and two commercial vaccines of chick embryo origin (CEO) were sequenced using 454 Life Sciences technology. Comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed across the five genomes. A total of 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes were identified. The similarity between field strains and between field and seed strains ranged from 99.96% to 99.99%. The phylogenetic analysis also revealed a close relationship between them. This study provided data on genomic variation among Italian ILTV strains, showing that although genome genetic variability is well conserved over time and between wild-type and vaccine strains, some mutations help differentiate between them and possibly at the ILTV -Virulence involved /dampening. The results of this study may contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of ILTV pathogenicity and provide genetic markers to distinguish between wild-type and vaccine strains.",,"Piccirillo, A.;Lavezzo, E.;Niero, G.;Moreno, A.;Massi, P.;Franchin, E.;Toppo, S.;Salata, C.;PalÃ¹, G.",2016.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0149529,0
1670,Evidence for a putative feline origin of sporadic G6P[9] rotaviruses in humans,"Rotaviruses of species A are very diverse and have a significant impact on human and animal health. Transmission between livestock, companion animals, and humans is commonly observed, but the distribution of animal-like rotaviruses within the human population is limited. During ongoing surveillance of rotavirus strains in Germany, an unusual G6P[9] rotavirus strain was detected in a child's feces. The complete rotavirus coding sequences revealed a unique G6-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E2-H3 genotype constellation. The virus was phylogenetically related to feline G3P[9] strains and other human G6P[9] rotaviruses presumably of zoonotic origin. Analysis of the primer binding sites of G6-specific genotyping provided further evidence for a feline G6P[9] reservoir. In addition, significant shortcomings of conventional semi-nested PCR genotyping approaches in detecting contemporary G6P[9] have been revealed. The GER29-14 rotavirus strain most likely resulted from direct or recent interspecies transmission from a cat to a human. Further studies could evaluate feline rotavirus nucleic acid sequences and genotype constellations to confirm the likely feline origin of sporadic human G6P[9] strains.",,"Pietsch, C.;Liebert, U.

1671,The low pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) is the precursor to the highly pathogenic A/Turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9),"The first confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) infection in North America was caused by A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9); However, the phylogeny of this virus is largely unknown. This study performed genomic sequence analysis of 11 avian influenza isolates from 1956 to 1979 for comparison to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Phylogenetic and genetic analyzes have included these viruses in combination with all known complete genome sequences of avian viruses isolated before 1981. A low pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1), was shown to have been isolated 3 months earlier and was the closest known genetic relative, with six genome segments of common ancestry encoding the polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA encode nucleoprotein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA), and nonstructural (NS) proteins. The lineages of these genome segments included a resort with other North American turkeyviruses, all rooted in North American wild waterfowl, with the HA gene derived from the H5N2 serotype. The phylogenies showed adaptation of North American wildfowl to turkeys with possible involvement of native waterfowl. The turkey isolate A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9) was the second closest related avian isolate after A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9) and shared five common lineage genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA and neuraminidase). Virus A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was more virulent than A/turkey/Wisconsin/68 (H5N9) to chick embryos and mice, indicating greater biological similarity to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 ( H5N9). Thus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) has been identified as the closest known ancestral relative of HPAI A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), which will serve as a useful reference virus for characterizing early genes and biological Properties associated with the occurrence of pathogenic avian influenza strains. © 2012 SGM.",,"Ping, J.;Selman, M.;Tyler, S.;Forbes, N.;Keleta, L.;Brown, E.

1672,Evaluation of a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction format for DNA copy number quantification,"Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a new technology that has recently been commercialized to enable accurate quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample. ddPCR measures absolute amounts by counting nucleic acid molecules encapsulated in discrete, volumetrically defined water-in-oil droplet partitions. This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating a highly stable partition of DNA molecules. In this study, we evaluated the key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% to 99.6% saturation in a 20,000 droplet assay, corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two different loci in the lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a microfluidic chamber-based digital PCR (cdPCR ) were obtained with lower density. Using ddPCR, a relative extended uncertainty below 5% was achieved for the copy number concentration. This level of uncertainty is much lower than the values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Pinheiro, L.

1673,Development of generic Taqman-PCR and RT-PCR assays for the detection of DNA and mRNA of β-actin coding sequences in a variety of animal species,"As a member of the European Virus Archive (EVA) consortium, our laboratory develops and maintains a large collection of viruses. This collection implies the use of a panel of cell lines derived from different animal species. To facilitate handling of such a large panel of cell lines, broad-spectrum real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were developed to allow detection and quantification of DNA and mRNA of β-actin, one of the most commonly used eukaryotic ones household genes. Using two degenerate primers and a unique probe, these two assays have been shown to detect nucleic acids from a range of vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines commonly used in animal virology. This panel included human, monkey, rodent, canine, porcine, fish, Batrachia, mosquito, and tick cell lines. Furthermore, the two assays successfully amplified β-actin coding sequences from sand flies. The sensitivity assessment performed on synthetic DNA and RNA sequences showed that the two assays were very sensitive and suitable for accurate quantification. The two assays together form a convenient method that is suitable for multiple purposes. For example, they can be used to estimate the amount of contaminating cellular genetic material prior to sequence-independent amplification of viral genomes, which is achieved prior to high-throughput sequencing, to assess the efficiency of DNase and/or RNase treatments performed on cell extracts, and to check nucleic acids, acid extraction using β-actin coding sequences as an endogenous control.

1674,Transmission of pestivirus infection in a population of Pyrenean chamois,"Outbreaks of a previously unknown disease have recently affected populations of the Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) across the mountains. A pestivirus has been hypothesized to be the cause of this emerging disease, and this type of virus can cross the species barrier and be transmitted to or from wild animals. We have characterized the virus and analyzed its transmission through an epidemiological survey carried out in Orlu, France, from 1995 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences and virus neutralization tests showed that the virus belonged to the newly described border disease virus 4 group. The increase in seroprevalence with age showed that infection can occur at any age and resulted in lifelong immunity. A total of 70.3% of 323 specimens were positive for anti-p80 antibodies and 10.2% of 167 specimens demonstrated viraemia as determined by either a positive ELISA antigen test or RT-PCR. The infection has therefore been widespread in this population since 1995, with no mass mortality or clinical symptoms observed. Incidence and seroprevalence varied seasonally and with the number of individuals under 2 years of age in the population, so virus transmission was dependent on the age structure of the host population. We propose that the virus is now endemic in this population and is likely to be harmful to reproduction and hatchlings. Further research is needed to assess the impact of the pestivirus on host population dynamics and the risk of cross-transmission to farm animals. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Pioz, M.;Loison, A.;Gibert, P.;Dubray, D.;Menaut, P.;Le Tallec, B.;Artois, M.;Gilot-Fromont, E.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.09.001,0
1675,Influenza A viruses detected in pigs in southern Germany after the H1N1 pandemic in 2009,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are widespread in swine populations and stable co-circulation of at least three lineages was well documented in European pigs – up until 2009. However, since the emergence of the human pandemic pdmH1N1 virus in 2009, the world's ( again) was introduced into individual pig herds, the situation has changed. These variations in the respective IAV pools within swine populations are of great interest and the zoonotic potential of putative emerging viruses needs to be assessed. Since data on recent IAV in pigs from southern Germany were relatively sparse, the aim of this study was to determine the main IAV subtypes actually occurring in this region. For this purpose, 1417 nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with respiratory diseases were examined for IAV genomes from 2010 to 2013. In total, IAV genomes were detected in 130 farms using real-time RT-PCR against the matrix protein gene. For further analysis, several PCR protocols were adapted to quickly subtype between H1, pdmH1, H3, N1 and N2 sequences. Taken together, the co-circulation of the three stable European IAV lines for Bavaria was confirmed. H1N1 sequences were diagnosed in 59, H1N2 genomes in only 14 and H3N2 in 9 of the analyzed farms. However, pdmH1 was detected in combination with N1 in 2010, 2012 and 2013, confirming the presence, albeit at low prevalence, of pdmH1N2 reassortant viruses as well. Interestingly, isolated cases of coinfection with more than one subtype have been diagnosed. Partial genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. In contrast to the human population, classically circulating IAVs were not displaced by pdmH1N1 in Bavarian pigs. However, some interesting viruses have been discovered. Further monitoring of these viruses in the Bavarian pig population will be of great importance to monitor future developments.",,"Pippig, J.;Ritzmann, M.;BÃ¼ttner, M.;Neubauer-Juric, A.",2016.0,,10.1111/zph.12264,0

1677,High turnover leads to longer persistence of influenza in managed pig herds,"Pigs have long been thought to play a central role in the emergence of novel human influenza A virus (IAV) strains by serving as mixing vessels for mammalian and avian variants. However, the key issue of viral persistence in swine populations at different scales is poorly understood. We close this gap using epidemiological models calibrated using seroprevalence data from Dutch fattening pigs to estimate the 'critical herd size' (CHS) for IAV persistence. We then examine the viral phylogenetic evidence for persistence by comparing human and porcine IAV. Models indicate a CHS of around 3000 pigs, above which influenza would likely persist, ie orders of magnitude lower than the persistence thresholds for IAV and other human acute viruses. At national and regional levels, we found much stronger empirical signatures of prolonged persistence of IAV in pigs compared to human populations. This remarkable persistence in small populations is driven by the high recruitment rate of susceptible piglets and has significant implications for pig management and for overall patterns of IAV genetic diversity.",,"Pitzer, V.

The aim of the study was to determine the BVDV infection status in a dairy herd vaccinated against BVD. Before vaccination began in 2008, there was no prior identification or removal of the possible source of infection (persistently infected animals). It was expected that vaccination itself would allow elimination of virus shepherds in the long term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serological screening for antibodies to BVDV with determination of antibody titers, BVDV antigen and presence of the viral genome with phylogenetic analysis of positive specimens in the flock was performed, although no clinical problems indicated the possible presence of BVDV infection. Results: 19 individuals persistently infected with BVDV were identified in calves and heifers, but not in adult cattle. All virus shepherds were antibody negative and the genotype of the virus isolated was BVDV-lb, indicating a single source of infection. The vaccine used in the herd consisted of the BVDV-Ia strain. In each of the stables tested, the antibody titers against BVDV-lb were higher than against BVDV-la (median values). Conclusion: Despite a long-term vaccination program and a relatively high sequence homology of vaccine and field strains of BVDV (83.6%), it was not possible to avoid transplacental infections of fetuses and the birth of persistently infected calves from vaccinated heifers despite protection from clinical disease was completed.",,"Polak, M.

METHODS: Forty patients with acute symptomatic HEV infection were recruited between 2009 and 2013. Clinical, demographic and laboratory data were collected. Diagnosis was made by detecting anti-HEV IgM and/or HEV RNA in serum or stool. HEV genotypes were classified by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The high-risk group, consisting of immunocompromised patients with liver cirrhosis and very old (>80 years) patients (17 cases), had higher serum alkaline phosphatase values at presentation than the low-risk group. Two fatal cases resulted from acute hepatitis E in the high-risk group. The initial clinical presentation showed no statistically significant differences. In six cases (6/40) the virus could be detected in the serum or stool by means of RT-PCR and sequencing. On molecular characterization, the viruses were classified as HEV genotype 3f and were in the same cluster as Thai swine HEV. Conclusions: Our data showed that acute HEV infection has diverse clinical presentations and outcomes. Higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase have been observed in high-risk patients.

Therefore, our main goal was to determine the HEV prevalence in the wild boar population and to characterize the HEV strains circulating in Romania. Using the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay, we analyzed the presence of RNA-HEV in 45 liver samples and five spleen samples from 50 wild boar. Samples were collected during the 2013–2015 hunting season. Nine out of 50 samples tested positive for HEV RNA, resulting in an overall prevalence of 18%. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates clustered into different monophyletic HEV-3 groups depending on the country of sampling.

1683,The basis of arbovirus classification,"The biologically defined group of arboviruses contains well over 300 separate viruses that have been divided into approximately 40 serological groups based on antigenic cross-reactivity. More than three quarters of all arboviruses can now be classified into one of the following five major taxonomic genera based on the basic characteristics of the virion: Alphavirus, Flavivirus, Orbivirus, Rhabdovirus, Bunyavirus. There are 20 alphaviruses representing serological group A and 57 flaviviruses in serological group B; both of these genera fall into the family Togaviridae. The 40 orbiviruses of the family Reoviridae include about 8 serological groups, and the 8 rhabdoviruses of the family Rhabdoviridae include another 3 groups. About 160 bunyaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, can be divided into 20 serological groups, 10 of which cross-react within the group in the Bunyamwera supergroup. One arbovirus contains DNA, namely African swine fever virus; this is classified as an iridovirus or icosahedral cytoplasmic deoxyvirus. Nodamura virus, which was classified as a picornavirus, needs to be reclassified based on evidence that it has a divided genome. A number of arboviruses remain taxonomically unclassified.

Differences in pathogenicity between HPAIV and LPAIV could potentially be related to specific characteristics of strains and tissues, tropism and host responses. METHODS: To investigate differences in disease development between HPAIV and LPAIV, we examined the initial appearance and eventual load of viral RNA in multiple organs, as well as host responses in the brain and gut of chickens infected with two closely related H7N1 HPAIV or LPAIV strains were infected. Results: Both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV spread systemically in chickens after a combined intranasal/intratracheal inoculation. In the brain, large differences in host viral RNA load and gene expression were found between H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV infected chickens. Brain cell culture studies using chick embryos showed that both HPAIV and LPAIV could infect cultured embryonic brain cells, but consistent with the lack of the necessary proteases, LPAIV replication was limited. In addition, the TUNEL assay only demonstrated apoptosis in the brains of HPAIV-infected chickens. In the gut, where endoproteases are available that cleave HA from LPAIV, we found minimal differences in the amount of viral RNA and a large overlap in transcription responses between HPAIV- and LPAIV-infected chickens. Interestingly, the brain and ileum differed markedly in the cellular pathways that were regulated during AI infection. Conclusions: Although both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV RNA have been detected in a wide range of tissues beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, our observations indicate that differences in pathogenicity and mortality between HPAIV and LPAIV are due to differences Vital organs such as the brain could be due to viral replication and resulting host responses.",,"Post, J.;Burt, D.

1685,Classical swine fever virus isolates from Cuba form a novel subgenotype 1.4,"The identification and classification of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) based on nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has become an important tool to study the epidemiology and control of CSF disease. After phylogenetic analyzes of short sequences from the 5' untranslated region (150nt) and the E2 (190nt), most CSFV isolates from South and Central America were assigned to subgenotypes 1.1 and 1.3, while CSFV isolates from Cuba were assigned to subgenotype 1.2. Here we show that the determination and comparison of full-length E2 sequences and sequences encoding Npro, C, Erns, E1 and E2 (3361nt) do not support segregation of Cuban CSFV isolates to subgenotype 1.2. Indeed, our analysis showed that the Cuban isolates are more divergent from other previously known CSFV subgenotype 1 isolates, forming a new separate subgenotype to be termed subgenotype 1.4. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Postel, A.;Schmeiser, S.;Perera, C.

1687,Cowpea mosaic virus: effects on host cell processes,"SUMMARY Taxonomy: Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a type member of the Comoviridae and bears a strong resemblance to animal picornaviruses, both in gene organization and in the amino acid sequence of replication proteins. Little systematic work has been done to compare isolates of the virus from different parts of the world. Physical Properties: Purified virus preparations contain three centrifugal components; empty protein shells without RNA (T) and two nucleoprotein components (M and B) containing 24% and 34% RNA, respectively. The icosahedral particles have a diameter of 28 nm, consist of 60 copies of two envelope proteins and are heat-stable. Hosts: CPMV causes one of the most commonly reported viral diseases of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), in which it produces chlorotic spots with diffuse borders in inoculated primary leaves. Trifoliate leaves develop a light yellow or light green mosaic of increasing severity in younger leaves. The host range is fairly limited and few hosts are known outside of the Leguminosae. The virus is transmitted by various beetles with biting mouthparts. Reported in Africa, the Philippines and Iran. Apparently absent in North and South America.

1688,Development of an epitope-blocking ELISA for the universal detection of antibodies against human H5N1 influenza viruses,"Background: Human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have generally been confirmed by molecular amplification or culture-based methods. Serological surveillance has potential benefits that have not yet been realized because rapid and specific serological tests to detect H5N1 infection are not widely available. Methodology/Main Results: Here we describe an epitope-blocking ELISA for the detection of specific antibodies against H5N1 viruses in human or animal sera. The assay relies on a novel monoclonal antibody (5F8) that binds to an epitope spanning amino acid residues 274-281 (CNTKCQTP) in the HA1 region of H5-hemagglutinin. A database search analysis of publicly available sequences revealed that this epitope is conserved in 100% of the 163 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans. The sensitivity and specificity of the epitope-blocking ELISA for H5N1 were evaluated using chicken antisera against multiple virus clades and other influenza subtypes and serum samples from individuals naturally infected with H5N1 or seasonal influenza viruses. The epitope-blocking ELISA results were compared to those of hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays. Antibodies to H5N1 were readily detected in sera from immunized animals or convalescent humans by the epitope-blocking ELISA, while samples containing antibodies to other influenza subtypes gave negative results. The assay showed higher sensitivity and specificity compared to HI and microneutralization. Conclusions/Relevance: The epitope-blocking ELISA based on a unique 5F8 mAb enabled highly sensitive and 100% specific detection of antibodies against H5N1 influenza virus in human sera.",,"Prabakaran, M.;Ho, H.

1689,New crane hepatitis B virus with an unexpectedly broad host range,"All hepadnaviruses known to date have a very limited host range, restricted to their natural hosts and a few closely related species. This is believed to be mainly due to sequence variations in the large coat protein and species-specific differences in host components essential for virus replication. Here we report infection of cranes with a novel hepadnavirus, termed CHBV, which has an unexpectedly broad host range and is evolutionarily only distantly related to avihepadnaviruses of related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA, as well as sequencing of cloned viral genomes, revealed that CHBV is most closely related to, although distinct from, Ross goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV), and somewhat less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). . Phylogenetically, cranes are very distant from geese and ducks and are most closely related to herons and storks. Naturally occurring hepadnaviruses of the latter two species differ greatly in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not or only slightly infect ducks. In contrast, CHBV from crane sera and recombinant CHBV produced from LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as DHBV. This is the first report of a fairly broad host range of an avihepadnavirus. Our data implicate either the use of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors by DHBV and CHBV, unusual host and viral adaptation mechanisms, or differential evolution of the host genomes and cellular components required for viral replication.",,"Prassolov, A.;Hohenberg, H.;Kalinina, T.;Schneider, C.;Cova, L.;Krone, O.;FrÃ¶lich, K.;Will, H.;Sirma, H.",2003.0,,10.1128/jvi.77.3.1964-1976.2003,0
1690,Genomic characterization of pestiviruses isolated from lambs and kids in southern Italy,"nested polymerase chain reaction was used to identify 13 pestivirus strains isolated from small ruminants in several mixed flocks (sheep and goats) in southern Italy and for classification as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1, BVDV type 2 and Border disease virus (BDV) genotypes. Of the nine sheep isolates, two were characterized as BVDV type 1 and seven as BVDV type 2. The four pestiviruses isolated from children belong to BVDV type 1. None of the pestivirus strains tested could be classified as “true” BDV (genotype 3). Although BVDV type 2 has been rarely described in Europe, the characterization of strain BD/90-1M as BVDV type 2, isolated in Italy in 1990, shows that this genotype has been circulating in Italy since the 1990s. © 2001 Elsevier Science BV",,"Pratelli, A.;Martella, V.;Cirone, F.;Buonavoglia, D.;Elia, G.;Tempesta, M.;Buonavoglia, C.",2001.0,,10.1016/s0166-0934(01)00277-4,0
1691,"Isolation and comparative study ""in vitro"" of five strains of contagious ecthyma in sheep","Five scab specimens from sheep bred in different countries clinically affected by contagious ecthyma revealed infectious agents that caused a cytopathic effect on primary cultures of lamb kidney cells. The 5 ""in vitro"" infectious agents showed similar stability properties in the presence of different physical and chemical agents. These properties relate to viruses of the poxvirus group and identify them as ecthymaviruses. The study of the 5 agents by serum neutralization made it possible to express quantitatively their respective kinship and dominance characters. Applying to these characteristics the proposed serological definition of strains, types and subtypes for foot-and-mouth disease viruses, it appears that 4 of the pathogens can be classified within the same antigenic subtype, while the 5th is very close to the other 4 , since it may be borderline classified as another subtype. The 5 active substances are very close to each other serologically, but their different dominance properties could be interesting when choosing one as a vaccine.",,"Precausta, P.;Stellmann, C.",1973.0,,,0
1692,Host response to probiotics determined by nutritional status of rotavirus-infected neonatal mice,"Aims: Beneficial microbes and probiotics are promising tools for prevention and treatment of enteric and diarrheal diseases in children; however, little is known about their in vivo mechanisms of action. We used a neonatal mouse model of rotavirus diarrhea to gain insight into how probiotics relieve acute gastroenteritis. Methods: Rotavirus-infected mice were treated with 1 of 2 strains of human-derived Lactobacillus reuteri. We assessed gut microbiome composition using 16S metagenome sequencing, enterocyte migration and proliferation using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and antibody and cytokine levels using multiplex analysis of gut explant cultures. Results: Probiotics reduced diarrhea duration, improved gut histopathology, and increased gut microbiome richness and phylogenetic diversity. The extent to which probiotics reduced diarrhea was strain-specific and influenced by nutritional status. L reuteri DSM 17938 reduced the duration of diarrhea by 0, 1 and 2 days in underweight, normal weight and overweight puppies, respectively. The magnitude of reduction in diarrhea duration correlated with increased enterocyte proliferation and migration. ATCC PTA 6475 strain reduced diarrhea duration by 1 day in all mice without increasing enterocyte proliferation. Both probiotic strains decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein I alpha a and interleukin-I beta, in all animals and increased rotavirus-specific antibodies in all but the underweight animals. Body weight also influenced the host response to rotavirus in terms of diarrhea duration, enterocyte turnover, and antibody production. Conclusions: These data suggest that probiotic enhancement of enterocyte proliferation, villus repopulation and virus-specific antibodies may contribute to resolution of diarrhea and that nutritional status influences host response to beneficial microbes and pathogens.",,"Preidis, G.

1693,Whole genome of a novel genotype 3 hepatitis E virus strain obtained from domestic pigs in Japan,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute or chronic hepatitis in humans and can be transmitted faecal-orally. Pigs are one of the main reservoirs for this infection. Sixty pigs aged 4 to 5 months in a herd in Japan had detectable anti-HEV IgG antibodies, and five (8.3%) of them had persistent infection with HEV genotype 3. Five HEV strains that obtained from the viremic pigs shared 98.8-100% nucleotide identity, and a representative strain (swHE1606845) whose entire genomic sequence was determined in this study differed by 14.1-19.6% from the reported HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and by 14.7-19.1% from other HEV genotype 3 strains whose subtypes have not yet been assigned. swHE1606845 showed a higher nucleotide p-spacing value of ≤0.143 in HEV strains of genotype 3 subtypes 3a-3k and ≤0.152 in other genotype 3 strains of unassigned subtypes. A SimPlot analysis revealed a lack of recombination events. These results indicate that swHE1606845 is a candidate member of a novel genotype 3 subtype. Further efforts to identify the swHE1606845-like new strain are warranted to clarify the origin of this strain and to determine the full nucleotide sequences of two additional swHE1606845-like strains for assignment of a new subtype.",,"Primadharsini, P.

In addition, a single isolate from a broiler was categorized as Massachusetts type and an isolate from a layer belonged to type 4/91 virus. Interestingly, both IBV groups I and II were isolated from native chickens (62.5%) and caused a range of symptoms.

1697,Wild bird migration across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: A transmission route for the highly pathogenic H5N1,"Background: Lake Qinghai in central China has been the focus of debate over whether wild birds play a role in the circulation of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. In 2005, an unprecedented wildlife outbreak at Lake Qinghai killed more than 6,000 migratory birds, including over 3,000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa and reappeared several times in the following years in wild birds along the migration route in Central Asia. METHODS/MAIN RESULTS: To better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we analyzed the movements of GPS satellite-tagged bar-headed geese at Lake Qinghai in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migratory trail between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley in Tibet, where 93% of the 29 geese tagged wintered. From 2003 to 2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and most were within geese migratory routes. The spatial and temporal correspondence between geese movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive striped-head goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak sites) indicated that there were numerous opportunities for viral spread and infection of migratory geese in the wintering grounds. Its potential as an H5N1 vector was supported by the rapid migratory movements of some geese and the genetic relatedness of the H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Lake Qinghai. Conclusions/Importance: This is the first study to compare the phylogenetics of the virus with the spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would be enhanced with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.",,"Prosser, D.

Our study aimed to determine the genotype of isolates and genetic relatedness to other Indonesian NDVs published on GenBank. Four NDV isolates were recovered from vaccinated flocks in West Java, Indonesia in 2011, 2014, 2015. Two NDVs belong to the virulent strain and the other two belong to the avirulent strain.

1701,The ecology and age structure of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreak in wild mute swans,"The first UK outbreak of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 influenza in wild birds occurred in 2008 in a population of mute swans, which have been the subject of ornithological studies for decades. Here we use an innovative combination of ornithological, phylogenetic, and immunological approaches to study the ecology and age structure of HP H5N1 in nature. We screened swan and waterfowl samples by PCR and sequenced HP H5N1 positive samples. The origin of the outbreak was investigated by linking bird count data with molecular clock analysis of virus sequence samples. We used ringing records to reconstruct the age structure of onset mortality and we estimated the age distribution of past exposure to avian influenza. The onset mortality was low and all HP H5N1 positive mute swans in the affected population were < 3 years old. Only the youngest age groups contained a significant number of subjects with no detectable antibody responses to viral nucleoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the outbreak strain circulated locally for about a month before it was discovered, arriving when the immigration rate of migratory waterfowl was highest. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that HP H5N1 plagues in wild swans have limited mortality due to the immune protection resulting from previous exposure.

1702,Molecular characterization of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from raccoon dogs in China,"Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 can infect a wide range of animals and poses a continuing threat to human and animal health. While many genotypes of the H5N1 virus can be found in chickens, few are associated with infecting mammals . Characterizing the genotypes of viral strains in animal populations is important to understand the distribution of different viral strains in different hosts. This also facilitates the monitoring and detection of possible emergence of highly pathogenic strains of specific genotypes from unknown hosts or hosts not previously reported to be carriers of these genotypes. METHODS/MAIN RESULTS: Two H5N1 isolates were obtained from lung samples from two raccoon dogs that had died of respiratory disease in China. Pathogenicity tests showed that the isolates were highly pathogenic for chickens. In order to characterize the genotypes of these viruses, their genomic sequences were determined and analyzed. The genetic contents of these isolates are virtually identical and they may have originated from the same progenitor virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates were genetically closely related to the H5N1 genotype V virus, first isolated in China in 2003, and distinct from the dominant virus genotypes (eg, genotype Z) of recent years. The isolates also contain a polybasic amino acid motif at their HA cleavage sites and have an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein, similar to the avian viruses previously identified. Conclusions/Relevance: This is the first report that the H5N1 genotype V virus has been found to be associated with a mammalian host. Our results strongly suggest that genotype V H5N1 virus has the ability to cross species barriers to infect mammals. These results further underscore the risk that the H5N1 avian influenza virus poses to mammals and humans, who can be infected by specific genotypes not known to infect these hosts. © 2009 Qi et al.",,"Qi, X.;Li, X.;Rider, P.;Fan, W.;Gu, H.;Xu, L.;Yang, Y.;Lu, S.;Wang, H.;Liu, F.",2009.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0004682,0

The HA1 proteins of the three isolates were identical to those of A/Swine/Guangdong/1/01, a virus isolated in China in 2001, although three nucleotide differences were observed.

Viral infection can trigger the alteration of the cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which plays an important post-transcriptional regulatory role in gene expression and can profoundly affect viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we used deep sequencing technology to determine the cellular miRNA expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from goats infected with Nigeria 75/1 vaccine virus, a widely used vaccine strain for mass vaccination programs against Peste des petits ruminants . Expression analysis showed that PPRV infection can elicit 316 significantly differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, including 103 known and 213 novel miRNA candidates, in infected PBMC at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) compared to a sham control. Target prediction and functional analysis of this DEmiRNA revealed significant enrichment for multiple signaling pathways including TLR signaling, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, viral carcinogenesis, and JAK-STAT signaling.

Here we used a high-throughput method based on a novel gene expression analysis, RNA-Seq, to give a global picture of differential gene expression by primary human macrophages from 10 healthy donors infected with WNV in vitro. From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1,514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel gene changes were discovered, as were gene isoforms, and while many of the genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Degrading genes previously not known to be associated with WNV resistance identified their critical role in controlling viral infections.

1706,Molecular characterization of glycoprotein genes and phylogenetic analysis of two porcine paramyxoviruses isolated from the United States,"Two porcine paramyxoviruses (SPMV)-(81-19252 (Texas-81) and 92-7783 (ISU-92)) were isolated from pigs with encephalitis in the United States in 1981 and 1992. Antigenic, morphological, and biological properties of these two viruses were essentially similar to members of the Paramyxoviridae family. Antigenic analysis by indirect fluorescent antibodies, immunoblot, and one-way cross-neutralization assays associated these viruses with bovine parainfluenza 3 (BPIV3) viruses. Purified virions were 50 in size -300 nm and morphologically indistinguishable from other paramyxoviruses. These two viruses hemagglutinated red blood cells and had neuraminidase activity intergenic trinucleotide regions similar to other Paramyxoviridae. The F gene of ISU-92 was longer than Texas-81 due to the insertion of a 24 nucleotide ""U""-rich 3 untranslated gene region. Structure-based sequence alignment of glycoproteins of these two SPMVs showed that they are essentially similar in structure and function to parainfluenza viruses. The Texas-81 strain was closely related to the BPIV3 Shipping Fever (SF) strain at the nucleotide and amino acid level, while the ISU-92 strain was more closely related to the BPIV3 910N strain. The envelope glycoproteins of ISU-92 shared only about 92% and about 96% identity with the BPIV3-SF strain at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The high sequence identities to BPIV3 indicated a cross-species infection in pigs. Phylogenetic analyzes based on both the F protein and the HN protein suggested the classification of these viruses into the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Respirovirus and genotype A of BPIV3. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Qiao, D.;Janke, B.

1707,"Viral communities associated with respiratory diseases in pigs in intensive commercial farms in Sichuan Province, China","Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes significant economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were analyzed using metagenomics. Deep sequencing and de novo assembly identified 17 viruses in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses included small linear and circular ones DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets with 38 clinically healthy controls with matched positions. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque tenosus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in PRDC-affected piglets and highlight associated candidate viruses.",,"Qin, S.;Ruan, W.;Yue, H.;Tang, C.;Zhou, K.;Zhang, B.",2018.0,2006-09-01 00:00:00,,1

1709,A tick-borne segmented RNA virus contains genome segments derived from unsegmented viral ancestors,"Although segmented and unsegmented RNA viruses are commonplace, the evolutionary links between these two very different forms of genome organization are unclear. We report the discovery and characterization of a tick-borne virus—Jingmen tick virus (JMTV)—that reveals an unexpected association between segmented and unsegmented RNA viruses. The JMTV genome comprises four segments, two of which are related to the nonstructural protein genes of the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), while the remaining segments are unique to this virus, have no known homologs and contain a number of features pointing to a structure indicate protein genes. Notably, the homology search revealed that JMTV-related sequences were present in the Toxocara canis (dog roundworm; Nematoda) cDNA library and that they shared strong sequence and structural similarities. Epidemiological studies showed that JMTV is widespread in tick populations across China, particularly in Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis spp., and that host switching and genomic reassortments occur frequently. To our knowledge, JMTV is the first example of a segmented RNA virus with a genome derived in part from unsegmented viral ancestors.",,"Qin, X. C.;Shi, M.;Tian, J. H.;Lin, X. D.;Gao, D. Y.;He, J.

1710,Animal influenza virus subtyping using general multiplex RT-PCR and Liquichip high-throughput (GMPLex),"This study developed a multiplex RT-PCR integrated with Luminex technology to rapidly subtype multiple influenza viruses simultaneously. Primers and probes were designed to amplify the NS and M genes of influenza A viruses HA genes of subtypes H1, H3, H5, H7, H9 and the NA gene of subtypes N1 and N2. Universal superprimers were introduced to establish multiplex RT-PCR (GM RT-PCR). It involved three stages of RT-PCR amplification, and then the RT-PCR products were further tested with a LiquiChip probe, which was combined to yield a rapid, high-throughput influenza virus (IV) subtyping test, known as called GMPLex. The IV GMPLex High Throughput Rapid Subtyping Test has the following characteristics: High throughput, capable of subtyping 9 target genes in subtypes H1, H3, H5, H7, H9, N1 and N2 of influenza A virus to determine at the same time; fast, completing influenza subtyping within 6 hours; High specificity, ensuring the specificity of the different subtypes by using two nested degenerate primers and a probe, no cross-reaction between the subtypes, no non-specific reactions with other pathogens and high sensitivity. When used separately to detect the product of a single GM-RT-PCR for a single H5 or N1 gene, the GMPLex assay showed a sensitivity of 10-5 (= 280ELD50) for both assays and the Luminex qualitative ratio results were consistent 3.08 and 3.12, respectively.

1711,Extensive transcriptome analyzes reveal competing endogenous RNA networks during avian leukosis virus subgroup J-induced tumorigenesis in chickens,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that induces myeloid tumors and hemangiomas in chickens and causes severe economic losses in commercial layers and broilers. High-throughput sequencing followed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and bioinformatic analyzes were performed to improve understanding of regulatory networks associated with differentially expressed noncoding RNAs and mRNAs that facilitate ALV-J infection. We examined the expression of mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and miRNAs in the spleens of 20-week-old chickens infected with ALV-J and uninfected chickens. We found that 1723 mRNAs, 7883 lncRNAs and 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the spleen between the uninfected and infected groups (P<0.05). Transcriptome analysis showed that chicken lncRNAs shared relatively fewer exon numbers and shorter transcripts compared to mRNA. Through competitive endogenous RNA and coexpression network analyses, we identified several tumor-associated or immune-related genes and lncRNAs. Among the transcripts whose expression levels decreased significantly in both ALV-J-infected spleen and tumor tissues, BCL11B showed the greatest change. These results suggest that BCL11B may be mechanistically involved in chick tumorigenesis and neoplastic disease, related to the immune response, and potentially be a novel biomarker for ALV-J infection. Our results provide new insights into the pathology of ALV-J infection and a high-quality transcriptome resource for an in-depth study of epigenetic influences on disease resistance and the immune system.",,"Qiu, L.;Chang, G.;Li, Z.;Bi, Y.;Liu, X.;Chen, G.",2018.0,,10.3389/fphys.2018.00996,0
1712,Discovery of novel long noncoding RNAs induced by avian leukosis virus subgroup J infection in chickens,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that has caused severe economic losses in the poultry industry in China in recent decades. Here, a set of 4804 novel long non-coding transcripts and numerous differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of HD11 and CEF cells infected with ALV-J. We also found that they share relatively shorter transcripts and fewer exon numbers compared to mRNA. Correlation analyzes suggested that many lncRNAs could activate gene expression in ways other than transcriptional regulation in an enhancer-like manner. In vivo analyzes of the expression level showed that three lncRNAs (NOGGAT001975.2, NOGGAT005832.2 and NOGGAT009792.2) are potentially related to the regulation of the immune response and could act as novel biomarkers for ALV-J infection.

In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses from a mock sample, a pooled duck feces sample, and a pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries created by three methods. The sequencing primers were generated by random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using an RNA-Seq kit in Method 1, by random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in Method 2 developed in our laboratory, and by added hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in Method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified virus families and genera were identified using Methods 2 and 3 than with method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified with method 2 than with method 3, most of the differences were not statistically significant.

1714,Evolutionary genomics of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses (pH1N 1v),"Background: In April 2009, a new strain of the human H1N1 influenza A virus broke out, causing a worldwide pandemic. The present study attempts to estimate a temporal rearrangement history of the 2009 H1N1 viruses by phylogenetic analysis based on a total of 394 sequences of H1N1 viruses isolated from swine, human and avian. Results: Phylogenetic trees of eight gene segments showed that human-derived viruses formed a well-supported clade, while porcine and avian lineages were intermixed. A new divergent porcine sublineage containing gene segments from 2009 H1N1 viruses was characterized that was closely related to porcine viruses expressed in six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) between 2004 and 2007 in the USA and South Korea versus swine viruses isolated in NA and M from Thailand between 2004 and 2005. The substitution rates varied drastically between eight segments, and the mean substitution rate was generally higher for H1N1 2009 than for porcine and human viruses (F 2.23 = 5.972, P<0.01). Similarly, higher dN/dS substitution ratios were identified in 2009 H1N1 than in porcine and human viruses with the exception of the M2 gene (F2, 25 = 3.779, P<0.05). The 2009 H1N1 viruses were estimated to be around 0.1 to 0.5 years old, while their common ancestors with the most closely related swine viruses existed between 9.3 and 17.37 years. Conclusion: Our results implied that at least four reassortments or transmissions likely occurred prior to 2009 H1N1 viruses. A first rearrangement occurred in 1976, and bird-like Eurasian swine viruses emerged. The second transmission took place in Asia and North America between 1988 and 1992 and mainly affected six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS). The third reassortment occurred between North American swine and avian viruses between 1998 and 2000, involving PB2 and PA segments. In 2004-2005 reassortments from birds to swine, Eurasian and classical swine viruses occurred. South Korea, Thailand and the US were identified as locations where reassortments were most likely to have taken place. The co-circulation of several sublineages of pigs and the specific lifestyle in Asia may have facilitated the mixing of different influenza viruses, leading to the creation of a new virus strain. © 2011 Qu et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Qu, Y.;Zhang, R.;Cui, P.;Song, G.;Duan, Z.;Lei, F.",2011.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-8-250,0
1715,The complex microbiota of raw milk,"Here we review what is known about the microorganisms present in raw milk, including milk from cows, sheep, goats and humans. Milk can support a rich microbiota due to its high nutrient content. These microorganisms enter milk from a variety of sources and once in milk can play a number of roles such as: B. Facilitate milk fermentation (e.g. Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and fungal populations), cause spoilage (e.g. Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Bacillus). and other spore-forming or thermoduric microorganisms), health-promoting (e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or pathogenic (e.g. listeria, salmonella, Escherichia coli, campylobacter and mycotoxin-producing fungi). There is also concern that the presence of antibiotic residues in milk will lead to the development of resistance, particularly in pathogenic bacteria. Here we discuss these issues comprehensively and compare the approaches, both culture-dependent and culture-independent, that can be used to study the microbial composition of milk. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.",,"Quigley, L.;O'Sullivan, O.;Stanton, C.;Beresford, T.

1716,A direct high-throughput in-cell ELISA to measure the infectivity of cytopathic and non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus strains to determine antiviral activity,"Screening of antiviral compounds against multiple field strains requires low-cost, high-throughput methods applicable to any virus strain. For this purpose, colorimetric cell viability assays are used as long as the viruses are cytopathic (CP) in the cell culture. However, the Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) strains circulating in the field are mostly non-cytopathic (NCP). An in-cell ELISA to measure viral infectivity by detecting a conserved protein produced during viral replication (non-structural protein 3, ""NS3"") was developed. The ELISA is performed directly on the 96-well culture plate without harvesting the cells. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was tested for its ability to assess the BVDV-specific antiviral activity of bovine type I and III recombinant IFNs. The results correlated with those measured by qRT-PCR and virus titration. The NS3 in-cell ELISA was also efficient in estimating the IC50 of two compounds with different antiviral activity. Estimation of the 50% inhibitory dose of each IFN using six BVDV strains of different biotype and genotype showed that CP strains were more susceptible to both IFNs than NCP, while NCP type 2 viruses were more sensitive to IFN-I. The in cell ELISA format using a detector antibody against a conserved nonstructural protein can potentially be applied to accurately measure the infectivity of any virus strain.",,"Quintana, M.

1717,Genome dynamics and molecular epidemiology of infection of multidrug-resistant Helicobacter pullorum isolates from broiler and free-range chickens in India,"Some life-threatening, foodborne, and zoonotic infections are transmitted by poultry birds. Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in livestock farming has led to an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis involving the phenotypic and sequence-based characterization of the whole genome of 11 H. pullorum isolates from broiler and free-range chickens collected from retail wet markets in Hyderabad City, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that all isolates were resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics including fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides and macrolides. The isolates were also shown to be extended spectrum β-lactamase producers and even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five or six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding one or more resistance nodular division efflux pumps. Phylogenetic analysis combined with pangenomic analysis revealed a remarkable level of genetic diversity among free-range chicken isolates; in contrast, a high level of genetic similarity was observed in broiler isolates. Comparative genomic analyzes of all publicly available H. pullorum genomes, including our isolates (n=16), together with the genomes of 17 other Helicobacter species, revealed a large number (8,560) of H. pullorum-specific protein-coding genes, with an average of 535 such genes per isolate. The in silico virulence screen identified 182 important virulence genes and also demonstrated high strain-specific gene content in isolates from free-range chickens (average 34) compared to broiler isolates. A significant prevalence of prophages (ranging from 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in free range and broiler isolates. Taken together, these observations provide significant baseline data for the functional molecular epidemiology of infection of non-pyloric Helicobacter species such as H. pullorum, unraveling their evolution in chickens and their possible zoonotic transmission to humans. IMPORTANT: The poultry industry is expanding worldwide with an ever-growing consumer base for chicken meat. Against this background, the foodborne transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria is an important public health issue. Our study includes a critical baseline approach aimed at the genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of H. pullorum, an avian pathogen with proven zoonotic potential. We believe our studies would facilitate the development of surveillance systems that would ensure food safety for humans and guide public health policy regarding the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries like India. In this study, we sequenced 11 novel H. pullorum genomes. These genomes would be of great value in addition to ongoing comparative genomic studies of Helicobacter.",,"Qumar, S.;Majid, M.;Kumar, N.;Tiwari, S.

Our aim was to assess and verify the impact of PBFD and its position as a critical threat process for Australian parrot bird species. We investigate the origin/evolutionary pathways and potential threat of PBFD to vulnerable populations of parrotbirds and captive-bred flocks. CONCLUSIONS: Recent phylogenetic analyzes of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) indicate that all endangered Australian parrotbird species are susceptible to and equally likely to be infected by BFDV genotypes from a range of host parrot species. Management of the disease in captive breeding programs has relied on testing and culling, which has proven costly. The risk of PBFD should be very carefully considered by management teams considering establishing breeding stocks for endangered species. Alternative disease prevention tools, including vaccination, which are increasingly used in wildlife health, should be considered more seriously to manage and prevent PBFD in captive flocks of critically endangered species.",,"Raidal, S.

1720,Functional characterization of a novel holin-like antibacterial protein encoding the tmp1 gene from the goat skin surface metagenome,"We have identified a holin-like gene from a goat skin surface metagenome. The ORF designated tmp1, which encodes 34 amino acids that share sequence similarity with putative holin-like toxin genes. To analyze the antibacterial activity of the tmp1-encoded protein, this ORF was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expressed gene product Tmp1 showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria but not against gram-negative bacteria. A single transmembrane domain (TMD) was identified within Tmp1, and deletion analysis of the N-terminal region and TMD revealed that TMD is responsible for antibacterial activity. TMD-dependent antibacterial activity was validated using a synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of TMD. Besides antibacterial activity, Tmp1 also complemented the function of holin in a lysis-defective bacteriophage lambda. To expand the spectrum of antibacterial activity, a mutant library of tmp1 was generated by random mutagenesis. Four mutants with amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of Tmp1 showed increased antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and were not hemolytic. Enhanced activity of these mutant proteins is attributed to their increased hydrophobicity. © 2011 Springer Verlag.",,"Rajesh, T.;Anthony, T.;Saranya, S.;Pushpam, P.

Of 53 bursa samples examined by RT-PCR, 40 showed a positive reaction. The amplified products were subjected to nucleotide sequencing and the sequences obtained were compared to those of the Georgia IBD virus (IBDV) vaccine strain, the classical virulent strain 52/70 and the very virulent Japanese OKYM strain. Nucleotide homology data showed that all of the isolates from Tamil Nadu showed a range of 91 to 99.6% homology among themselves. Four isolates clustered with this strain compared to the very virulent Japanese OKYM strain. The majority of the isolates clustered with the very virulent OKYM strain as indicated by the phylogenetic analysis performed using the MEGA program. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of IBDV isolates with those of the vaccine strain Georgia, the classical virulent strain 52/70 and the very virulent strain OKYM also revealed the presence of a conserved serine-rich heptapeptide sequence in most of the isolates.

Based on restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of viral DNA, BoHV1 can be divided into three subtypes namely BoHV1.1, 1.2a and 1.2b. Because this method requires pure viral DNA, it is time consuming and labor intensive. In the current study, UL0.5 gene-based PCR sequencing was used for BoHV1 subtyping.

1723,Molecular signature of high yielding (growth) influenza A virus reassortants produced as vaccine candidates,"Background:Human influenza virus isolates generally grow poorly in embryonated chicken eggs. Therefore, gene reassortment of wild-type (wt) influenza A viruses using a highly egg-adapted donor virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), will be performed to obtain the viral ""seeds"" of the High Yield Reassortant (HYR) provide for the vaccine production. HYR must contain the genes for wt virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and one to six “internal” genes of PR8. Most studies on wt influenza and HYRs have focused on the HA gene. The main objective of this study is to identify the molecular signature in all eight gene segments of candidate influenza A-HYR vaccine seeds associated with high growth in ovo. Methodology: The genomes of 14 wt parental viruses, 23 HYRs (5 H1N1; 2, 1976 H1N1-SOIV; 2, 2009 H1N1pdm; 2 H2N2 and 12 H3N2) and PR8 were analyzed using the high-throughput sequencing pipeline with Big Dye Terminator Chemistry sequences M gene exception. The PR8-derived M gene was invariant in all 23 HYRs, underscoring the critical role of PR8 M in the high-yielding phenotype. None of the wt virus-derived internal genes showed any silent alteration(s), with the exception of the PB1 gene in X-157. The highest number of recurrent silent and coding mutations was found in NS. Regarding the surface antigens, the majority of HYRs had mutations in HA coding for them; only 2 HYRs had coding mutations in NA. Significance: In the age of applying reverse genetics to alter the influenza A virus genome, the mutations identified in the HYR gene segments associated with high growth in ovo may have great practical utility to modify PR8 and/or wt virus gene sequences for improved growth of vaccine ""seed"" viruses. © 2013 Ramanunninair et al.",,"Ramanunninair, M.;Le, J.;Onodera, S.;Fulvini, A.

In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of APMV-1 isolated from migratory birds collected in Alaska, Japan, and Russia, and evaluated the evidence for intercontinental virus spread using phylogenetic methods. In addition, we predicted viral virulence using deduced amino acid residues for the fusion protein cleavage site and estimated mutation rates for the fusion gene of migratory class I and class II isolates. All 73 isolates sequenced in this study were most closely related to virus genotypes previously reported in wild birds; however, five class II genotype I isolates formed a monophyletic clade that exhibited previously unreported genetic diversity and met the criteria for designating a new subgenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of wild bird isolates provided evidence for intercontinental virus spread, particularly viral lineages of APMV-1 class II genotype I subgenotypes Ib and Ic. This result supports migratory bird movement as a possible mechanism for APMV-1 redistribution. None of the predicted deduced amino acid motifs for the fusion protein cleavage site of APMV-1 strains isolated from migratory birds in Alaska, Japan and Russia matched those of previously identified virulent viruses. Therefore, these data do not provide support that these strains contribute to the emergence of avian pathogens. The estimated mutation rates for fusion genes from class I and class II wild bird isolates were faster than those previously reported for non-virulent APMV-1 strains.

1726,Fecal viromatic composition of migratory wild duck species,"Fecal vioma includes a complex variety of eukaryotic viruses, phages and viruses that infect the host. However, little is known about the intestinal community of viruses present in wild waterfowl, and the structure of this community in wild ducks has not been studied. Thus, the faecal virome compositions of six species of wild plant ducks and one species of wild diving ducks were analyzed. Fecal samples were taken directly from the rectums of 60 ducks donated by hunters. DNA and RNA virus particles were purified and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform. The reads obtained from the sequencing were analyzed and compared to sequences in the GenBank database. Virus-related sequences from the virus families Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae and Myoviridae showed the highest overall frequencies in the samples. Viromeanalysis identified viruses that had not been found in wild duck feces and showed different virome profiles between different species and between samples of the same species. This study advances our understanding of viruses in wild ducks as possible viral reservoirs and provides a basis for further investigation and monitoring transmission of viruses from wild animals to humans and outbreaks of disease in domestic animals.",,"RamÃ­rez-MartÃ­nez, L.

1727,Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding avian pneumovirus viral polymerase,"We report here the nucleotide sequence of the L gene of avian pneumovirus (APV). This is the second pneumovirus L gene and the second avian paramyxovirus L gene, after Newcastle disease virus, to be sequenced. The APV-L gene is 6099 nucleotides long and encodes a single large ORF of 2004 amino acids. This makes the APV-L protein the smallest that can be described for any non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus. The protein contains six linear, non-contiguous domains, a putative ATP-binding site, and four polymerase motifs previously described for the L proteins of negative-strand RNA viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of domain III of 14 different L proteins suggests that pneumoviruses are evolutionarily distant from the other members of the Paramyxoviridae as are Filoviridae.",,"Randhawa, J.

This test did not detect any contaminating virus sequences in RotaTeq® (rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, pentavalent, RV5, Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ). To confirm this finding, Merck has developed and applied a series of polymerase chain reaction-based analysis methods and a testing algorithm to systematically demonstrate the absence of infectious PCV in RotaTeq®. This paper describes the methodology and rationale developed to thoroughly evaluate the key starting materials, product intermediates and the final product to demonstrate the absence of infectious PCV and the continued quality of this product. This approach could be applied to assess the validity of other adventitious drug risks encountered in biological processes and products. © PDA, Inc. 2011.",,"Ranucci, C.

1729,Deep sequencing as a method for typing bluetongue virus isolates,"Bluetongue (BT) is an economically important endemic livestock disease in the tropics and subtropics. In addition, recent spreads in temperate regions such as North America and northern Europe are of serious concern. Rapid serotyping and characterization of BT virus (BTV) is an essential step in identifying the origin of the virus and combating the disease. BTV serotyping is typically performed by serum neutralization and more recently by nucleotide sequencing. This report describes the near-complete genome sequencing and typing of two BTV isolates using Illumina's next-generation sequencing platform. Two of the BTV RNAs were multiplexed with ten other unknown probes. Viral RNA was isolated and fragmented, reverse transcribed, the cDNA ends repaired and ligated with a multiplex oligo. The genomic library was amplified using primers complementary to the ligated oligo and subjected to single and paired-end sequencing. The raw reads were assembled using a de novo method, and reference-based assembly was performed based on the contig data. Nearly complete sequences of all BTV segments were obtained with more than 20-fold coverage, and the single-read sequencing method was sufficient to identify the virus genotype and serotype. The two viruses used in this study were typed as BTV-1 and BTV-9E.",,"Rao, P. P.;Reddy, Y. N.;Ganesh, K.;Nair, S. G.;Niranjan, V.;Hegde, N. R.",2013.0,Nov,,0

This coronavirus has been widely spread in laboratories and passaged in both pigs and cell cultures. In order to determine the variability between different populations of the PEDV strain CV777, a full-length genome (approx. 28 kb) sequencing was performed in 6 different laboratories using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the various full genome sequences differ from each other and from the reference sequence (accession number AF353511), but they are >99% identical. Unique and common differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest level of variability, including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus by either losing the initiation codon or gaining a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5' terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated by analyzing subgenomic mRNAs from infected cells.

1734,Metagenomic profiling of ticks: identification of novel Rickettsia genomes and detection of tick-borne canine parvovirus,"BACKGROUND: Ticks act as vectors of human and animal pathogens worldwide. Ticks rely on bacterial endosymbionts, which often have close and complex evolutionary links with tick-borne pathogens. Since the prevalence, diversity, and virulence potential of tick-borne pathogens remain poorly understood, there is an urgent need for microbial surveillance of ticks as potential disease vectors. METHODOLOGY/MAIN RESULTS: We developed a two-step protocol involving 16S amplicon screening of pooled hard tick samples collected from dogs, sheep and camels in Palestine, followed by shotgun metagenomics on individual ticks to screen through Detect tick-borne pathogens and characterize endosymbionts. Two ticks isolated from sheep yielded an abundance of reads from the genus Rickettsia, which were assembled into draft genomes. One of the resulting genomes was very similar to Rickettsia massiliae strain MTU5. Analysis of signature genes showed that the other represents the first genome sequence of the potential pathogen Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae. Ticks from a dog and a sheep provided draft genome sequences of Coxiella strains. A sheep tick provided sequences from the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis, while camel hyalomma ticks provided sequences belonging to Francisella-like endosymbionts. We generated a genome sequence of a canine parvovirus from the metagenome of a dog tick from Jericho. SIGNIFICANCE: Here we demonstrated how an inexpensive two-step protocol can be used to detect and characterize tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. By recovering genome sequences of an unexpected pathogen (canine parvovirus) and a previously unsequenced pathogen (Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae), we demonstrate the open-ended nature of metagenomics. We also provide evidence that ticks can transmit canine parvovirus, raising the possibility that ticks could be helping to spread this troublesome virus.",,"Ravi, A.;Ereqat, S.;Al-Jawabreh, A.;Abdeen, Z.;Abu Shamma, O.;Hall, H.;Pallen, M.

1735,Network inference from multimodal data: A review of approaches to infectious disease transmission,"Network inference problems are common in several biomedical subfields such as genomics, metagenomics, neuroscience, and epidemiology. Networks are useful to represent a wide range of complex interactions, ranging from those between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities, to those found in human or animal populations. Recent advances in technology have resulted in an increasing amount of healthcare data across multiple modalities, increasing the preponderance of network inference problems. Multi-domain data can now be used to improve the robustness and reliability of recovered networks from unimodal data. For infectious diseases in particular, there is a body of knowledge that focuses on combining multiple pieces of linked information. Combining or analyzing different modalities together has provided better insight into disease transmission than would be possible with a single modality in isolation. This was particularly helpful in understanding the occurrence and transmission of infections with pandemic potential in early stages. Novel linked information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other covariates, including high-throughput sequence data, clinical visits, information from social networks, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and clinical symptoms (reported as free-text data), also encourage further investigation of these methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of multimodal inference methods for infectious disease transmission with a particular focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on analytical Bayesian inference methods as this allows for the simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters, for example not only the disease transmission network but also parameters of epidemic dynamics. Our review examines their assumptions, key inference parameters, and limitations, and ultimately provides insights into improving future network inference methods in multiple applications.",,"Ray, B.;Ghedin, E.;Chunara, R.",2016.0,,10.1016/j.jbi.2016.09.004,0
1736,Finding a needle in the virus-metagenome haystack - micro-metagenome analysis captures a snapshot of the diversity of a bacteriophage armoire,"Viruses are ubiquitous in the oceans and are critical components of marine microbial communities that regulate nutrient transfer to higher trophic levels or the dissolved organic pool through lysis of host cells. Hydrothermal vent systems are oases of biological activity in the deep oceans for which the understanding of biodiversity and its impact on the global ocean biogeochemical cycle is still in its infancy. To gain biological insight into viral communities present in hydrothermal vent systems, we developed a method based on deep sequencing of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis bands representing key viral fractions found in seawater within and around a hydrothermal plume are present around, originating from Loki's Castle Vent field the mid-oceanic arctic ridge. The reduction in the complexity of the viral community enabled by this novel approach enabled the almost complete reconstruction of a lambda-like phage genome from the viral fraction of the cloud. The phylogenetic study of different gene regions in this lambdoid phage genome revealed the diversity at loci encoding superinfection exclusion and integrase-like proteins. This suggests the importance of fine-tuning lyosgenic conversion as a viral survival strategy and provides insights into the nature of host-virus and virus-virus interactions within hydrothermal plumes. By reducing the complexity of the viral community through targeted sequencing of prominent dsDNA viral fractions, this method has selectively mimicked viral dominance approaching that previously achieved only through culture, thereby allowing bioinformatic analysis to identify a lambdoid viral ""needle"" within the larger viral locate community.

This study was designed to investigate whether PSV is widespread in swine in India and to characterize PSV present in the study population. The study found that five out of 70 (7.14%) stool samples were found positive for PSV by RT-PCR. Three viruses were successfully isolated from fecal samples using the IB-RS-2 cell line. Full genome sequencing and analysis of an Indian PSV isolate revealed the highest homology (88%) with the V13 strain from England. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete polyprotein nucleotide sequences of 14 PSV strains classified the viruses into four different clades.

1739,Comparison between transcriptome sequencing and 16S metagenomics for the detection of bacterial pathogens in wild animals,"Background Rodents are major reservoirs of pathogens responsible for numerous zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock. Assessing their microbial diversity at both individual and population levels is critical for monitoring endemic infections and revealing microbial association patterns within reservoirs. Recently, NGS approaches have been used to characterize microbial communities of different ecosystems. However, their relative effectiveness has not been evaluated. Here we compared two NGS approaches, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S metagenomics, and evaluated their ability to study neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations. Methodology/Main Results We first extracted nucleic acids from the spleens of 190 voles collected in France. RNA extracts were pooled, randomly retro-transcribed, then RNA-Seq was performed using HiSeq. Composite bacterial sequences were assigned to the next taxon registered in GenBank. DNA extracts were analyzed via a 16S metagenomics approach using two sequencers: the 454 GS-FLX and the MiSeq. The V4 region of the gene encoding 16S rRNA was amplified for each sample using barcoded universal primers. Amplicons were multiplexed and processed on the different sequencers. The resulting datasets were demultiplexed and each read was pipelined to be classified taxonomically using the Ribosomal Database Project. A total of 45 pathogenic bacterial genera were detected. The bacteria identified by RNA-Seq were comparable to those discovered by the 16S metagenomics approach processed with MiSeq (16S-MiSeq). In contrast, 21 of these pathogens went unnoticed when the 16S metagenomics approach was processed via 454 pyrosequencing (16S-454). In addition, the 16S metagenomics approaches revealed high levels of co-infection in bank voles. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in detecting bacteria. Although only the 16S-MiSeq method allowed for the identification of bacteria in each individual reservoir, with subsequent deduction of bacterial prevalence in host populations and generation of patterns of bacterial interactions within the reservoir. Finally, the number of bacterial reads obtained with the 16S-MiSeq could be a good indicator of bacterial prevalence.",,"Razzauti, M.;Galan, M.;Bernard, M.;Maman, S.;Klopp, C.;Charbonnel, N.;Vayssier-Taussat, M.;Eloit, M.;Cosson, J.

1740,Insights into resistome and stress response genes in the rumen of Bubalus bubalis by metagenomic analysis,"Buffalo rumen microbiota experience a variety of diets and represent a vast reservoir of mobiloma, resistoma, and stress responses. However, knowledge of metagenomic responses to such conditions is still rudimentary. We analyzed the metagenomes of buffalo rumen in the liquid and solid phase of river buffalo rumen biomaterial adapted to different proportions of concentrate to green or dry roughage using high-throughput sequencing to determine the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes and genetic exchange between bacteria know population and environmental reservoirs. A total of 3914.94 MB of data was generated from all three treatment groups. Data were analyzed using Metagenome Rapid Annotation System Tools. At the phyla level, Bacteroidetes were dominant in all treatments followed by Firmicutes. Genes encoding functional responses to stress (oxidative stress and heat shock proteins) and resistome genes (resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, phage, transposable elements, and pathogenicity islands) were prevalent in similar proportions in liquid and solid fractions of rumen metagenomes . The fluoroquinolone resistance, MDR efflux pump, and methicillin resistance genes were broadly distributed across 11, 9, and 14 bacterial classes, respectively. Bacteria responsible for phage replication, as well as prophages and phage packaging, and streptococcal rlt-like phage genes have been mainly assigned to the phyla Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteaobacteria. In addition, more reads matching the sigma B genes were identified in the rumen of the buffalo. This study highlights the presence of different adaptation mechanisms to different diets, antibiotics, and other stresses in the buffalo rumen, reflecting the proportional representation of the major bacterial groups.",,"Reddy, B.;Singh, K.

There are very few reports on the molecular epidemiology of rabies virus of Indian origin. In this study on knowledge of rabies virus dynamics, a total of 41 rabies-positive brain samples from dogs, cats, domestic animals, wild animals and humans from 11 states underwent RT-PCR amplification of N gene between nucleotide N521-N1262 (742 bp) and P gene between nucleotide P239-P750 (512 bp). The N gene could be amplified from 30, the P gene from 41 samples using specific primer sets.

1742,Genetic characterization of Belgian nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) reference strain B1648,"The virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) strain B1648 was first isolated in 1984 in Flanders, Belgium. Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants are still circulating in Europe and North Africa. Here, the full genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relatedness to other IBV strains and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in strain B1648 (51UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-EM-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-31UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c, and 6b, which have been rarely reported in the literature, were present in B1648 and most other complete IBV genomes. According to phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome, replicase-transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein, B1648 strain clustered with non-Massachusetts-type strains NGA/A116E7/ 2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA /90254/2005, QX-like CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 clustered with strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and is further referred to as the B1648 genotype. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related to the Beaudette and Massachusetts reference strains (89, 7%). . Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyzes indicated that the B1648 strain may have played an important role in the development of IBV in Europe and North Africa. Furthermore, the determinants of nephropathogenicity could be located on the 1a, spike, M and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). Overall, strain B1648 differs from all strains previously reported in Europe and other parts of the world.",,"Reddy, V. R.;Theuns, S.;Roukaerts, I. D.;Zeller, M.;Matthijnssens, J.;Nauwynck, H.

1744,Tracing the antigenic evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"Quantifying and predicting the antigenic properties of a virus is something of a holy grail for infectious disease research because of its central importance in the emergence of new strains, the severity of outbreaks, and vaccine selection. However, these traits are defined by a complex interplay of viral and host factors such that phylogenetic measures of viral similarity often correlate poorly with antigenic relationships. Here, we generate antigenic phylogenies that track the phenotypic evolution of two foot-and-mouth disease virus serotypes by combining host serology and viral sequence data to identify sites critical to their antigenic evolution. For the SAT1 serotype, we validate our antigenic phylogeny against monoclonal antibody escape mutants consistent with all predicted antigenic sites. For serotype O, we validate against known sites where available, and otherwise directly evaluate the impact of substitutions on the antigenic phenotype at predicted sites using reverse genetics and serology. We also highlight a critical and poorly understood issue for vaccine selection by demonstrating qualitative differences between assays, which are often used interchangeably to determine antigenic correspondence between field viruses and vaccine strains. Our approach provides a tool to identify naturally occurring antigenic substitutions, allowing us to follow the genetic diversification and associated antigenic evolution of the virus. Despite the tremendously important role that vaccines have played in improving human and animal health, vaccinology remains a strikingly empirical science. This study advances the field by providing guidance for the matching of vaccine strains via site-directed mutagenesis through this high-resolution trace of the antigenic evolution of the virus between rare major changes in phenotype.",,"Reeve, R.;Borley, D.

1746,Beak and feather disease viruses circulating in Cape parrots (Poicepahlus robustus) in South Africa,"Captive and wild parrots are susceptible to the highly contagious parrot beak and feather disease. The causative agent, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), has recently been identified in the largest remaining population of endangered Cape parrots (Poicepahlus robustus) endemic to South Africa. Whole genomes were isolated from 26 blood samples from wild and captive Cape Parrots and sequenced to determine possible sources of infection. All sequences had characteristic BFDV sequence motifs and were similar in length to those reported in the literature. However, BFDV coat protein (CP) sequences from this study did not contain a previously identified bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within residues 39-56, indicating that an alternative NLS is involved in the shuttle of the CP into the nucleus. Sequences from the wild population showed a high degree of similarity regardless of year or location, suggesting that the disease outbreak occurred just prior to sample collection. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes showed that captive Cape parrot sequences cluster with those isolated from captive-bred budgerigars in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Exposure to captive bred Cape parrots from a KwaZulu-Natal breeding facility is suggested as a possible source of the virus infection. Phylogenetic analysis of BFDV isolates from wild and captive Cape Parrots revealed two separate events of infection in different populations, underscoring the potential risk of introducing new viral strains into the wild population. The present study represents the first systematic investigation of BFDV virus diversity in the southernmost population of Cape parrots.",,"Regnard, G. L.;Boyes, R. S.;Martin, R. O.;Hitzeroth, I.

In May 2014, clinical samples received from a broiler breeder farm that had been experiencing health and production issues for about a week tested positive by avian influenza (AI) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR). After immediate escalation to an official, statutory investigation to rule out the presence of a reportable AI virus (AIV; H5 or H7 subtypes), a non-reportable H4N6 low pathogenicity (LP) AIV was isolated by virus isolation in embryonated specifically pathogen-free (SPF ) proven ) poultry eggs, neuraminidase inhibition test, cleavage site sequencing and AIV subtype H4-specific serology. Restrictions on movement of premises have been lifted and no further disease control measures under UK legislation have been implemented. Phylogenetic analysis of the virus's haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes revealed the closest relationship to viruses from mallard ducks in Sweden in 2007 and 2009. In June 2014, clinical suspicion of NAD in a flock of free-ranging laying hens was reported elsewhere in the UK, due to a increased daily mortality and decreased egg production over a five-day period. An H4N6 LPAIV with an intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.50 was isolated. This virus was genetically very similar, but not identical, to the virus discovered in May 2014. Full viral genome analyzes revealed characteristics of a strain that had not recently been transmitted from wild birds, suggesting spread to the poultry sector had taken place. A stalk deletion in the neuraminidase gene sequence indicated adaptation of the virus to poultry. In addition, the post-mortem revealed unexpected evidence of systemic spread of the virus. No other cases were reported. Infection with LPAIVs in poultry often results in variable clinical presentations, making the disease difficult to detect.",,"Reid, S. M.;Brookes, S.

1749,"Faustovirus, a new lineage of giant viruses related to Asfarvirus that infect amoebas","Giant viruses are protist-associated viruses belonging to the proposed order Megavirales; almost all were derived from Acanthamoeba spp. isolated. Their isolation in humans suggests they are part of the human virome. Using a high-throughput strategy to isolate novel giant viruses from their original protozoal hosts, we obtained eight isolates of a novel giant virus lineage from Vermamoeba vermiformis, the most common free-living protist found in the human environment. This new line has been proposed as the Faustovirus line. The prototype member, Faustovirus E12, forms ≤200 nm icosahedral virions that are devoid of fibrillae and that encapsulate a 466 kbp genome encoding 451 predicted proteins. Of these, 164 are in the virion. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral core genes showed that Faustovirus is distantly related to the mammalian pathogenic African swine fever virus, but encodes â‰ˆ 3-fold more mosaic gene complements. About two-thirds of these genes show no significant similarity to genes encoding any known proteins. These results indicate that expanding the protist panel to discover new giant viruses is a fruitful strategy. SIGNIFICANCE Using Vermamoeba, a protist living in humans and their environment, we isolated eight strains of a new giant virus that we named Faustovirus. The genomes of these strains were sequenced and their sequences revealed that faustoviruses are related but distinct from the African swine fever (ASFV) pathogen, which belongs to the Asfarviridae family. Furthermore, the Faustovirus gene pertoire is three times larger than that of ASFV and includes about two-thirds ORFans (open reading frames [ORFs] with no detectable homology to other ORFs in a database).",,"Reteno, D.

1750,Analysis of Hepatitis C Virus/Classical Swine Fever Virus Chimeric 5-NTRs: Sequences within the hepatitis C virus IRES are required for viral RNA replication,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is classified in the genus Hepacivirus of the family Flaviviridae, members of which have a single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein. Within this family, HCV is closely related to viruses of the genus Pestivirus, which includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Translation of the hepaci- and pestiviral polyprotein is initiated by internal entry of ribosomes promoted by the 5-NTR. The secondary and tertiary RNA structures of the HCV and pestivirus 5 NTRs are well conserved, although their sequences differ significantly. By analogy with other positive-strand RNA viruses, the HCV 5-NTR likely contains cis-acting determinants for replication as well as determinants for translation. Studies on both signals could be complicated because these signals could overlap. In this study, this problem was addressed by constructing chimeric HCV/CSFV-5 NTRs. A two-stage analysis of these 5-NTRs was performed: (a) in a translational assay, which offered the opportunity to examine translation independently of the possible effects on replication; and (b) in a replication assay examining only the chimeric 5-NTRs for which IRES-dependent translation was demonstrated. Overlap has been observed between the HCV RNA elements involved in these processes. The replacement of domain II had a minor impact on the translational efficiency of the chimeric 5-NTRs, while replication of subgenomic replicons containing these chimeric 5-NTRs was abolished. Swapping domain III subdomains greatly decreased translational activity while maintaining replication.",,"Reusken, C. B. E.;Dalebout, T. J.;Eerligh, P.;Bredenbeek, P. J.;Spaan, W. J.

Aichi virus may be one of the causative agents of gastroenteritis in humans, and kobuviruses are also likely to cause diarrhea in cattle and swine. Although Aichi virus has been detected relatively rarely (0-3%) in human diarrhea, a high seroprevalence of up to 80-95% by age 30-40 years has been identified, reflecting the general mode of infection in various human indicates populations. Much new information about kobuviruses and their host species has accumulated in recent years.

1754,Molecular Detection of Hepatitis E Virus in Non-Imported Hepatitis Case - Identification of a Potential Novel Human Hepatitis E Virus Lineage in Hungary Hungarian,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of hepatitis in endemic areas. However, it has recently been shown that human infections can occur in developed countries with no travel experience and that pigs can act as a reservoir. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify hepatitis E virus by molecular methods in patients with acute non-AC hepatitis infection with no recent travel history in Hungary and to determine viral genetic relatedness to known HEV strains. MATERIALS: Laboratory diagnosis of hepatitis E virus infection was performed in patient sera by HEV IgM and IgG ELISA, IgM and IgG immunoblot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using primers for a partial viral capsid region. RESULTS: A patient with acute hepatitis of unknown origin was treated in June 2004 at Szeged Hospital. The acute patient's sera were positive for HEV IgM and IgG, confirmed by immunoblot. Viral genome was successfully amplified in sera by RT-PCR. By sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the virus designated Hungary-1 showed 95% nucleotide identity with genotype 3 hepatitis E viruses, based on the highest identity with the porcine HEV strain (Sp354-1-02) and with 90 % Nucleic acid identity with the human strain (Greece2). DISCUSSION: Hepatitis E virus infection is present in Hungary with no travel to known endemic regions. The first identified HEV in Hungary, representing a new human genetic lineage, supports the possibility of endemic infections caused by genotype 3 strains in developed countries and that pigs could act as a reservoir for human HEV.",,"Reuter, G.;Fodor, D.;Katai, A.;Szucs, G.",2005.0,2020-11-01 00:00:00,,0

The causative agent, Borna disease virus (BDV), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is classified in the new Bornaviridae virus family within the order Mononegavirales, can cause severe clinical symptoms, typically viral encephalitis with prominent behavioral abnormalities . After an incubation period of a few weeks to several months, BDV infection leads to motor and sensory impairment, followed by paralysis and death. Natural infections appear to be subclinical in most cases. BD attracted worldwide attention when it was reported that sera and/or cerebrospinal fluid from neuropsychiatric patients may contain antibodies specific to BDV. Since infected animals only produce BDV-specific antibodies after virus replication, it was assumed that the broad spectrum of BDV-sensitive species also includes humans. However, reports describing the presence of other BDV markers, ie BDV RNA or BDV antigen, in peripheral blood leukocytes or brain tissue of neuropsychiatric patients are highly controversial and thus the role of BDV in human neuropsychiatric disorders is questionable.

1766,Change in the predominance of bovine viral diarrhea virus subgenotypes in samples sent to a diagnostic laboratory over a 20-year period,"Although the causative agent of bovine viral diarrhea was originally categorized as 1 species, phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses belong to 2 different species, Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus 1 (BVDV-1) and BVDV-2, with 2-11 subgenotypes within each species . The distribution of species and subgenotypes has been shown to vary by geographic region. It is not known whether the distribution shifts over time. Surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008 revealed that 3 subgenotypes are circulating among cattle in the United States: BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a. The mean percentage prevalence of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-2a strains reported in surveys prior to 2001 were 21%, 43%, and 36%, respectively. Surveys of viruses isolated after 2001 reported decreasing percentages of BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a strains, with BVDV-1b strains accounting for 75-100% of samples. Comparison of these surveys is distorted by differences in geographic location, survey methods, and the type of sample used in the survey. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the prevalence of BVDV subgenotypes in samples collected from the same geographic region and laboratory changed over time. BVDV strains isolated in 1988, 1998 and 2008 at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Amarillo, Texas were genotyped and the prevalence of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b and BVDV-2a strains was determined definitely.

1767,Isolation and characterization of a novel cervid adenovirus from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) kids in a captive herd,"novel adenovirus, CeAdV1, was isolated from buffy coat and nasal swab specimens collected from two captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The isolation was an incidental finding during the course of screening animals for use in a research study of an unrelated pathogen. In the screening procedure, virus isolation was performed on both nasal swab and buffy coat specimens and a cytopathic effect was observed. Electron microscopy showed viral particles with the shape and morphology of an adenovirus. Next-generation sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis assigned this virus to the Mastadenovirus genus. Its sequence was genetically distinct from all other recognized species of this genus, with only 76% sequence identity to its closest genetic counterpart, bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3). The virus could be propagated in bovine-derived cells but grew to a higher titer in cervid-derived cells. Inoculation of white-tailed deer fawns with the isolated virus resulted in fever, thymic tissue breakdown and mild respiratory illness. A comparative serology performed with sera from convalescents showed clear antigenic differences between the novel cervid adenovirus and BAdV3. A retrospective serological study of the captive deer herd showed that this virus had been circulating in the herd for at least 14 years with no clinical disease reported.

1768,Stability of the parainfluenza virus 5 genome demonstrated by deep sequencing of strains isolated from different hosts and subsequent passage in cell culture,"UNLABELING: Strain diversity of a rubulavirus, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), was examined by comparing 11 newly determined and 6 previously published genomic sequences. These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 from monkeys, 2 from pigs and 6 from dogs. Strain diversity is remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographic origin; a total of 7.8% of the nucleotides are variable and the mean pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. The variation is unevenly distributed across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence for selection for antibody-mediated evasion in hemagglutinin neuraminidase was found. The finding that some canine and porcine, but not primate, strains are mutated in the SH gene and do not produce SH raised the possibility that dogs (or pigs) may not be the natural host of PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of a strain (W3) in Vero cells at a high multiplicity of infection under competitive conditions with large proportions of defective interfering genomes. A similar observation was made for a strain W3 mutant (PIV5VDELTAC) lacking V gene function, in which the dominant changes were related to pseudoreversion in this gene. The mutations detected in PIV5VDELTAC during pseudoreversion, and also those characterizing the SH gene in canine and porcine strains, predominantly affected U-to-C transitions. This suggests an important role for biased hypermutation via an adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR)-like activity. IMPORTANT: Here we report the sequence variation of 16 different parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) isolates isolated from a range of species including humans, monkeys, dogs and pigs over 4 decades. Surprisingly, strain diversity was remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographic origin. The variation was unevenly distributed across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of immune or host selection was found. This general genome stability of PIV5 was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome remained remarkably constant even during the selection of virus mutants. Some of the canine isolates had lost their ability to encode one of the viral proteins called SH, suggesting that while PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be the natural host for PIV5.",,"Rima, B.

We propose naming the virus New Minto after the place where the ticks were collected. The prototype of the new Mintovirus is sensitive to the effects of sodium deoxycholate and kills lactating mice by the intracerebral but not the intraperitoneal route; weaned mice do not die after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous inoculation. The virus produces plaque in serially expanded Vero cells but not in primary Pekin duck embryo cells. Through complement fixation and neutralization tests, New Minto is related to Sawgrass virus, a previously ungrouped virus from Florida. The formation of a Sawgrass group is suggested.

These viruses are classified according to the antigenic properties of the two glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virus particles, hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). To date, 17 H and 10 N have been described, and 116 HxNy combinations or subtypes have been described. With the exception of the H17N10 subtype recently identified in bats, all identified subtypes have been identified in wild waterfowl. These birds are considered natural reservoirs of influenza viruses, some subtypes of which can be transmitted to other bird and mammalian species, including humans. Transmission between species appears to be regular and can occasionally lead to the adaptation and stable establishment of a new viral lineage in a particular species. Recalling the genetic diversity of avian, porcine and human influenza viruses, this review focuses on lesser-known influenza A viruses that have been identified in horses, dogs and, more recently, bats.

Peripheral blood leukocytes were simultaneously tested for BVDV by virus isolation. The results of hybridization and virus isolation agreed 92% of the time. Compared to virus isolation, hybridization had a detection sensitivity of 59.5% and a specificity of 95%. Cross-reactivity with RNA extracts from Border Disease Virus-infected cells has been observed. No cross-reactivity has been demonstrated with other common bovine viruses (bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus-3 and bluetongue virus), with viruses classified in related families (equine arteritis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), or detected against viruses with similar genomic organization (dengue virus type 2 and Japanese encephalitis virus).",,"Roberts, K.

1772,First report of apple mosaic virus in Alaska,"The apple mosaic virus (ApMV; family Bromoviridae, genus Ilarvirus) is one of the oldest and economically most important viruses of the apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) (1,3). Yield losses can vary from negligible to as much as 50% depending on the variety affected. Although ApMV is found worldwide and occurs naturally in more than 65 plant species (1), it has not previously been reported to occur in Alaska. In July 2011, conspicuous light yellow mosaic leaves were observed on the 'Valentine' apple and its root stem 'Ranetka' from an apple orchard in Wasilla, AK. Leaves were collected and extracted by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using ApMV-specific primers (2) and total RNA with buffer modifications to the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, 50 mg of leaf tissue was suspended in liquid nitrogen and 450 mL of SE buffer (0.14 M NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4< /sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O [pH 7.4], 0.05% v/v Tween-20, 2% w/v Polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 , 0.2% wt /vol ovalbumin, 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin and 0.05% w/v sodium azide) were added and after vigorous vortexing 80 µl of the mixture was added to 400 µl RLT buffer supplied by the Kit and then processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (4). Direct sequencing of the predicted ~260 bp PCR product, when analyzed by BLAST, resulted in 97-98% nucleotide identities with ApMV accessions in GenBank. To determine the distribution and incidence of infection in the Wasilla orchard, all 118 apple trees (99 cultivars) were then sampled and serologically analyzed by double antibody sandwich ELISA with ApMV antiserum according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, IN). The 'Geneva Early' apple and the same 'Valentine' tree and its rootstock tested positive for ApMV by ELISA and RT-PCR. Strong diagnostic ApMV symptoms were not evident in the infected 'Geneva Early', which is typical for most commercially grown apples. No leaves were available for virus indexing on the 'Ranetka' rootstock of the ApMV-infected 'Geneva Early'. An additional 21 asymptomatic apple trees from an orchard in Talkeetna, AK, tested negative for ApMV by ELISA. Limited natural spread of ApMV to other plants can occur through pollen and seed transmission. The most common route of transmission is from ApMV-infected rootstocks and slips. It is important to source new propagating plant material from certified virus-tested nurseries and to avoid grafting ApMV-containing plant material. To my knowledge, this is the first report of ApMV in Alaska. References: (1) RW Fulton. No. 83. CMI/AAB Descriptions of Plant Viruses. 1972. (2) W. Menzel et al. J.Virol.",,"Robertson, N.

1773,Genomics and Outbreak Investigation: From Sequence to Consequence,"Outbreaks of infection can be devastating for individuals and societies. In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to identify and characterize outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to bacterial infection outbreaks. We describe traditional epidemiological analyzes and show how WGS can be informative in multiple steps of outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to studying bacterial infection outbreaks and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological surveys, diagnostic assays, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will bring about radical changes in clinical microbiology and epidemiology of infectious diseases in the near future . However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice. © 2013 BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Robinson, E. R.;Walker, T. M.;Pallen, M.

Both viruses can cause serious lung infections and severe acute encephalitis. Since their discovery in the 1990s, outbreaks of these zoonotic paramyxoviruses have been associated with a high potential for public health and, in particular, for the economy. Currently, only geographic groupings in Asia and Australia have been described for the henipaviruses. Although few virus isolates are available and more detailed characterization is needed, there is recent evidence that distinct henipaviruses may be present on the African continent.

1775,The bovine leukemia virus can be divided into seven genotypes: Evidence for the existence of two new clades,"Previous studies have classified the env sequences of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) provirus from different locations worldwide into two to four genetic groupings. These various studies gave unique names to the identified groups, and no study to date has integrated all available sequences. Therefore, we hypothesized that many of the different groups previously identified actually correspond to a limited set of genotypes that are unevenly distributed worldwide. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the env gene of 28 BLV field strains and compared these sequences to 46 env sequences representing all previously identified genetic groupings. Through the use of phylogenetic analysis, we have discovered six clades, or genotypes, which we have termed genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Genotypes 1-5 have counterparts among the previously identified sequence groupings. One env sequence did not aggregate with any of the others and was highly divergent compared to the six genotypes identified here. Therefore, an additional genotype, which we have named 7, may exist. Similarity comparisons were highly congruent with phylogenetic analyses. In addition, our analyzes confirmed the existence of geographic clusters. © 2009 SGM.",,"Rodriguez, S. M.;Golemba, M.

1776,Ultrastructural findings in lymph nodes of pigs suffering from naturally occurring post-weaning multisystem wasting syndrome,"The aim of this study was to assess ultrastructural lesions in lymph nodes of pigs affected by post-weaning multisystem wasting syndrome (PMWS) and to correlate these changes with the detection of viral particles (VLPs). Lymph node samples were collected from 4 PMWS-affected pigs and 2 healthy animals and processed by transmission electron microscopy. Significant ultrastructural changes were found only in PMWS-affected pigs, mainly in histiocytes and rarely in other cell types. The histiocytes showed extensive swelling and proliferation of mitochondria, as well as proliferation and dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Infected histiocytes contained large numbers of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (ICI) with VLPs; some histiocytes also had intranuclear inclusions (INIs). Small inclusions were surrounded by a double membrane that was granular in appearance or contained paracrystalline arrays; icosahedral VLPs were 8–17 nm in diameter. Large ICIs were double membrane bounded or not and contained VLPs that usually form paracrystalline arrays. ICIs have often been found adjacent to, and also within, mitochondria with severe swelling. INIs were not surrounded by membranes and contained virions with a diameter of 10-13 nm. Lymphocyte depletion was a prominent finding of lymph nodes from PMWS-affected pigs. The inclusion bodies mentioned in the present study that contain VLPs should be classified as viral factories, suggesting that viral replication is likely a common event in macrophages in which mitochondria might play a role.",,"Rodriguez-CariÃ±o, C.;SegalÃ©s, J.",2009.0,,,0

After reverse transcription, the genome was amplified at the 5' end along with the same region from a sheep BD isolate by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The region of the p20 gene was sequenced and compared to published data for BVD and HC viruses. A number of motifs have been conserved in the amino acid sequences of all viruses. The porcine isolate had a greater degree of homology with the BD isolate (87%) than with BVD (73%) or HC viruses (74%) in this region. This further confirms the BD-like nature of the virus.",,"Roehe, P. M.;Woodward, M. J.;Edwards, S.",1992.0,,10.1016/0378-1135(92)90051-t,0

Based on their ultrastructure, antigenic relationships, and phylogenomic relationships, the five viruses are classified as members of the Orthobunyavirus genus. Three are viruses of the California encephalitis virus serogroup and are related to the trivittatus virus; the other two are most similar to Mermet virus in the Simbu serogroup and Tataguine virus, which is not currently assigned to any serogroup.

1780,"Reemergence of a new variant of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, subclass 2.2.1.1, in Egypt in 2014","Large-scale surveillance is critical to understanding the evolution and emergence of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in endemic areas. The spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1 (HPAI) continues to cause significant economic losses to the Egyptian poultry industry and poses a public health threat. In this report, an HPAI H5N1 strain (A/chicken/Egypt/Fadllah-7/2014) was detected in a vaccinated flock showing clinical signs of infection. Genetic characterization of the isolate showed a high level of nucleotide identity (95-98%) with variants and classic groups of H5N1. In addition, multiple nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed several prominent and characteristic substitutions in the surface glycoprotein that may have biological relevance to the pathobiology of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the reported isolate is closely related to H5N1 AIVs subclade 2.2.1.1, although there have been no reports of this subclade of AI-reported cases in Egyptian bird species since 2011. In conclusion, our results highlight the re-emergence of a new subclass 2.2.1.1 H5N1 AIV variant that may escape vaccine-induced immunity. This discovery illustrates the importance of continuous surveillance of poultry in this country for the control of AIV, including identification of vaccine seed virus sources.",,"Rohaim, M.

1781,Do hemagglutinin genes of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses form unique phylogenetic lineages?,"Avian influenza A viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 periodically cause severe disease outbreaks in poultry. The question we wanted to address in this study is whether these highly pathogenic strains represent unique lineages or whether they and related nonpathogenic viruses descended from a common ancestor in the wild bird reservoir. We therefore compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of 15 H5 and 26 H7 influenza A viruses isolated over 91 years from a variety of host species in Eurasia, Africa, Australia and North America HA- Genes of H5 and H7 viruses, which cause severe diseases in domestic birds, do not form unique lineages but share common ancestors with nonpathogenic H5 and H7 viruses. These results predict that the highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza A viruses will continue to emerge from wild bird reservoirs. Another important question is whether H7 influenza viruses found in mammalian species originate from avian strains. We included eight equine influenza viruses and one seal isolate in the phylogenetic analysis of the H7-HA genes. We were able to show that the HA genes of both equine and seal viruses share common ancestors with the avian H7-HA genes. This indicates that currently circulating H7 viruses with an avian HA gene may have the potential to adapt to mammalian species and cause an influenza outbreak in the new host.",,"Rohm, C.;Horimoto, T.;Kawaoka, Y.;Suss, J.;Webster, R.

1782,454-Pyrosequencing: A Molecular Battiscope for Freshwater Viral Ecology,"Viruses, the most abundant biological entity on the planet, are capable of infecting organisms from all three branches of life, although most bacteria infect where the greatest cellular diversity resides. However, characterization and assessment of viral diversity in natural settings is only gradually becoming possible. By developing a novel technique for harvesting viral DNA and applying 454 pyrosequencing, a snapshot of the diversity of DNA viruses harvested from a stagnant pond on a cattle ranch was obtained. A large number of viral genotypes (785) were present within the virome. The absolute numbers of lambdoid and Shiga toxin (Stx)-encoding phage detected indicated that the depth of sequencing allowed recovery of only approximately 8% of the total virus population, numbers falling within less than an order of magnitude with dilution analysis predictions agreed. The most common viral genotypes in the pond were bacteriophages (93.7%). The predominant viral genotypes found associated with the farm and infecting higher life forms were pathogens causing disease in cattle and humans, e.g. B. Members of the Herpesviridae. The techniques and analyzes described here offer a new approach to monitoring viral populations in the aquatic environment, with the potential to become an integral part of the development of risk analysis tools to monitor the spread of viral pathogens of animal, plant and human diseases. © 2010 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Rooks, D.

The phylogenetic data showed that all viruses examined were closely related to Suid Herpesvirus 1. Based on sequence data for the gB gene, a nested PCR combined with restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the PCR products was developed for simultaneous detection and identification of the viruses examined. Nested primers were selected from highly conserved sequence stretches to amplify a 294 bp region in all five viruses and subsequent REA of the PCR products allowed specific identification.

1784,Review of the taxonomy of the family Circoviridae: establishment of the genus Cyclovirus and removal of the genus Gyrovirus,"The Circoviridae family contains viruses with covalently closed, circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, including the smallest known autonomously replicating, capsid-encoding animal pathogens. Members of this family are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and swine and have historically been classified into one of two genera: circovirus, which includes avian and swine pathogens, and gyrovirus, which comprises a single species (chicken anemia virus). However, over the past six years, viral metagenomic approaches as well as degenerate PCR detection in unconventional hosts and environmental samples have elucidated a broader range of hosts, including fish, a variety of mammals, and invertebrates for members of the family Circoviridae. Notably, these methods have uncovered a distinct group of viruses closely related to members of the Circovirus genus, comprising a new genus, Cyclovirus. The discovery of new viruses and a reassessment of genomic traits that characterize members of the Circoviridae prompted a revision of the classification criteria used for this family of animal viruses. Here we provide details of an updated Circoviridae taxonomy ratified in 2016 by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses that establishes the genus Cyclovirus and places the genus Gyrovirus in the family Anelloviridae, a separate lineage of animal viruses that also have circular ssDNA contains genomes. In addition, we provide a new species cut-off threshold of 80% genome-wide pairwise identity for members of the family Circoviridae based on pairwise identity distribution analysis, and list guidelines to distinguish between members of this family and other eukaryotic viruses with circular ssDNA genomes.",,"Rosario, K.;Breitbart, M.;Harrach, B.;SegalÃ©s, J.;Delwart, E.;Biagini, P.;Varsani, A.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3247-y,0
1785,The whitefly viral RNA metagenome leads to the discovery and characterization of a whitefly-borne carlavirus in North America,"Whiteflies from the species complex Bemisia tabaci can transmit a large number of plant viruses and are among the most harmful pests in agriculture. Although whiteflies are known to transmit both DNA and RNA viruses, most of the diversity has been recorded for the former, particularly for the Begomovirus genus. This study examined the overall diversity of DNA and RNA viruses found in whiteflies collected from a single Florida site to assess whether there are additional, previously undiscovered virus types within the B. tabaci vector . The metagenomic analysis of viral DNA extracted from the whiteflies only detected begomoviruses. In contrast, whiteflies contained sequences similar to RNA viruses from different groups, with a diversity beyond currently described viruses. Metagenomic analysis of whiteflies also led to the first report of a whitefly-borne RNA virus similar to Cowpea Mild Mottle Virus (CpMMV Florida) (genus Carlavirus) in North America. Further investigation led to the detection of CpMMV Florida in native and cultivated plants growing near the original field site of the whitefly collection and the determination of its experimental host range. Analysis of complete CpMMV Florida genomes obtained from whiteflies and plants suggests that the current classification criteria for carlaviruses need to be re-evaluated. Overall, metagenomic analysis supports that DNA plant viruses transmitted by B. tabaci are dominated by begomoviruses, while significantly less is known about RNA viruses present in this harmful insect vector. © 2014 Rosario et al.",,"Rosario, K.;Capobianco, H.;Ng, T.

The present study identified 10 novel genomes resembling ssDNA circovinuses by data mining from public viral metagenomes. The metagenomic libraries included samples from treated water and three different marine environments (Chesapeake Bay, British Columbia coastal waters, and Sargasso Sea). All genomes share similarities with the replication protein (Rep) of circoviruses; however, only half have genomic features consistent with known circoviruses. Some of the genomes exhibit a mix of genomic features associated with different families of ssDNA viruses (i.e., circoviruses, geminiviruses, and parvoviruses). Unique genome architectures and phylogenetic analyzes of the Rep protein suggest that these viruses belong to novel genera and/or families.

1787,The discovery of viruses in all three major lineages of terrestrial arthropods underscores the diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses associated with invertebrates,"Viruses encoding a replication-associated protein (Rep) within a covalently closed, single-stranded (ss)DNA genome are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms, including economically valuable agricultural crops and livestock. Although circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group for which our knowledge is rapidly increasing, biased sampling in relation to vertebrates and terrestrial plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here we screened terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and report the identification of 44 viral genomes and replicons associated with specimens representing all three major terrestrial arthropod lineages, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects) and Myriapoda (centipedes). We identified virus genomes belonging to three established CRESS DNA virus families (Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, and Smacoviridae); however, more than half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are only distantly related to currently classified CRESS viral DNA sequences. Although members of virus and satellite families known to infect plants (Geminiviridae, Nanoviridae, Alphasatellitidae) were not identified in this study, these plant-infecting CRESS DNA viruses and replicons are transmitted by Hemipterae. Therefore, members of six of the seven established CRESS DNA virus families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous virus sequences, previously reported from a variety of organisms revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA virus diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results underscore the enormous and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel results from efforts to discover RNA viruses in undersampled taxa.",,"Rosario, K.;Mettel, K.

Within clinical metagenomics, the identification of microorganisms from a complex and host-rich background remains a key computational challenge. As a proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mix of 25 human pathogens and an unknown complex biological model using benchtop technology. The datasets were then analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline designed around current rapid classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses against a background of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative, non-targeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications and when applied to the complex biological model, over 1,600 species were identified, including several species recorded with over 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of applying metagenomics in the clinical laboratory setting and that it can be achieved with the infrastructure available to non-specialized sequencing centers.",,"Rose, G.;Wooldridge, D.

The main objective of this study was to identify associations between different PRRSV-RFLP types in swine herds in southern Ontario and clinical signs of the disease in these herds. The herds included in the study submitted samples to the University of Guelph Animal Health Laboratory between September 2004 and August 2007. Each farm owner was interviewed to describe the clinical disease in the herd and the RFLP pattern of an isolate of PRRSV was obtained from a diagnostic sample. The most common isolates were RFLP types 1-4 (25.1%), 252 (14.7%), 134 (12%) and 1-2 (7.7%). It was noted that the distribution of RFLP types in this study differs from a previous study in Ontario. The RFLP types most strongly associated with clinical disease in the farrowing phase of production were 1-4, 1-2 and 134.

Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are processed from a cluster of five independent, self-sufficient transcription units in a proviral region dispensable for infectivity in vivo and account for ~40% of all microRNAs in both experimental and natural malignancies. They undergo strong purifying selection and associate with argonauts, consistent with a critical function in silencing important cellular and/or viral targets.

1791,Metagenomics of rumen bacteriophages from thirteen lactating dairy cows,"Background: The bovine rumen harbors a diverse and complex community of eukaryae, bacteria, archaea, and viruses (including bacteriophages). The viral population in the rumen (the rumen virome) has received little attention compared to the microbial population in the rumen (the rumen microbiome). We used massively parallel sequencing of virus-like particles to examine rumen virosome diversity in thirteen lactating Australian Holstein dairy cows, all housed at the same site, 12 of which were sampled on the same day. Results: Fourteen putative viral sequence fragments greater than 30 Kbp in length were assembled and annotated. Many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs showed no homology to previously annotated genes, underscoring the large amount of work still required to fully annotate the functions encoded in viral genomes. The frequency of the contig sequences varied greatly between animals, even though the cattle were of the same age and stage of lactation and received the same diets. Additionally, the twelve cohabiting animals shared a number of their dominant viral contigs. We compared the functional properties of our bovine viromes to those of other viromes and to rumen microbiomes. At a functional level, we found strong similarities between all virus samples, which differed greatly from the rumen microbiome samples. Conclusions: Our results indicate a large inter-animal variation in bovine rumen virome and that cohabiting animals may have similar viromes than non-cohabiting animals. We report on the most comprehensive sequencing of the rumen virus to date. This work highlights the tremendous amount of novelty and variation present in the rumen virome.",,"Ross, E.

1792,Identification and full genome sequencing of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using random-access amplification and next-generation sequencing technologies,"BACKGROUND: During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A virus (AIV) and avian paramyxovirus (APMV) in Belgium, we isolated two haemagglutinating agents from cloacal swab pools of wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) collected at two different sampling sites times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and specific real-time RT-PCR testing. METHODS: To refine the virological identification of APMV2-10 by HI subtyping assays and in the absence of validated molecular assays for APMV2-10, random-access amplification was used in combination with next-generation sequencing for sequence-independent identification of the viruses and determination of their genomes. RESULTS: Three different APMVs were identified. The complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from the random sequences from a pooled sample. The almost complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) and a partial sequence of an APMV4 were determined from the second pooled sample. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV4 isolated from the first sample. Although cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, HI subtyping revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify the co-infecting APMV4 in the APMV6-infected pool. CONCLUSIONS: These data further contribute to the knowledge of genetic diversity within serotypes APMV4 and 6 and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. In addition, this study demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing. Characterization and full genome sequencing of APMVs, including identification of viruses in mixed infections, can be achieved with only moderate and economical sequencing efforts.",,"Rosseel, T.;Lambrecht, B.;Vandenbussche, F.;van den Berg, T.;Van Borm, S.",2011.0,2006-10-01 00:00:00,,0

Bioinformatic analysis of the resulting data from the DNA virus identification workflow (a total of 32,757 sequences with an average read length of 335 bases) first showed the presence of parvovirus-like sequences in the tested blood sample. Thorough follow-up using specific real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the detected sequence fragments confirmed the presence of these sequences in the original sample as well as in a sample from an additional animal, but contamination with an identical genetic signature in negative extraction controls was demonstrated. Further investigations using an alternative extraction method identified contamination of the originally used Qiagen extraction columns with parvovirus-like nucleic acids or virus particles. Although we have not found any relevant virus to be associated with the disease, these observations clearly illustrate the importance of employing an appropriate control strategy and diagnostic follow-up testing in any viral metagenomic study. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"Rosseel, T.;Pardon, B.;De Clercq, K.;Ozhelvaci, O.;Van Borm, S.",2014.0,,10.1111/tbed.12251,0
1794,Next-generation DNase SISPA sequencing confirms Schmallenberg virus in Belgian field samples and identifies genetic variations in Europe,"In 2011, a novel orthobunyavirus was identified in cattle and sheep in Germany and the Netherlands. This virus was named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Later, the presence of the virus was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in cases of bovine and ovine congenital malformations in several European countries, including Belgium. In the absence of specific sequencing protocols for this novel virus, we confirmed its presence in RT-qPCR positive field samples using DNase SISPA-Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), a virus discovery method based on random amplification and next-generation sequencing. An in vitro transcribed RNA was used to construct a standard curve allowing quantification of viral RNA in the field samples. Two field samples from aborted lambs with 7.66 and 7.64 log(10) RNA copies per microliter of total RNA allowed unequivocal identification of SBV. One sample yielded 192 SBV reads covering approximately 81% of the L segment, 56% of the M segment, and 13% of the S segment. The other sample resulted in 8 reads spread across the L and M segments. Three low positive field samples (one from an aborted calf, two from aborted lambs) with virus levels corresponding to 4.27-4.89 log(10) RNA copies per microliter failed to identify with DNase SISPA-NGS. This partial sequence information was compared to the full genome sequence of SBV isolated from cattle in Germany, identifying several sequence differences. The virus detection method used allowed the confirmation of SBV in RT-qPCR positive brain samples. However, the failure to confirm SBV in weakly PCR-positive samples demonstrates the importance of selecting properly targeted and fresh field samples in any virus detection method. The partial sequences obtained from the field samples showed some differences to the sequences from cattle in Germany, which indicates sequence divergences within the disease.",,"Rosseel, T.;Scheuch, M.;Hoper, D.;De Regge, N.;Caij, A.

1795,Markers for current or past hepatitis E virus infection are as common in wild ungulates as in humans in Sweden,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic human pathogen that infects both domestic and wild animals. About 17% of the Swedish population is immune to HEV, but only a few cases are reported annually, indicating that most infections are subclinical. However, clinical hepatitis E can also be overlooked. In identified cases, the source of infection is usually unknown. To determine whether HEV can be transmitted from wild animals, the prevalence of markers for past and/or current infection in sera and stool samples from 260 hunted Swedish wild ungulates were examined. HEV markers were found in 43 (17%) of the animals. The most frequently infected animals were elk (Alces alces) with 19 out of 69 animals (28%) showing HEV markers, followed by wild boar (Sus scrofa) with 21 out of 139 animals (15%), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) with 2 of 30 animals, red deer (Cervus elaphus) with 1 of 15 animals and fallow deer (Dama dama) with 0 of 7 animals. The partial open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the viral genomes of the animals was sequenced and compared to those of 14 endemic human cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three humans were infected with HEV strains similar to those found in wild boar.

Comparative Immunology,"Four influenza A strains isolated from Ontario turkeys and the Chicken/Scotland/59 strain have been found to immunize turkeys against the deadly disease caused by the virus Turkey/Ontario 7732/66 (V7732). These viruses form avian influenza A serotype 5 (AA5). Immune protection against V7732 was not achieved with influenza viruses of other serotypes. Immunoprotective relationships between AA5 viruses were not always detectable in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and serum neutralization (SN) tests, particularly with turkey and mammalian antisera; a better correlation between immunoprotection and these in vitro tests was observed with chicken antisera.

During the clinical phase, severe vesicular lesions appeared on the snout and the skin around the coronary ligaments observed in pigs. A total of 48 serum samples and 12 clinical samples (ruptured snout epithelia) were collected. All serum samples were subjected to an indirect 3AB nonstructural protein (NSP) ELISA and a liquid phase blocking (LPB) ELISA. In the 3AB NSP ELISA, all serum samples were found positive for NSP antibodies, indicating infection. In the LPB-ELISA, 42 of 48 (87.5%) pigs were found to have a protective log10 antibody titer ≥1.8 against FMD virus serotypes O, A and Asia 1. All clinical materials were found positive for serotype O by antigen detection ELISA and multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR). A phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 region found that the serotype O isolates that caused the outbreak were clustered within the Ind2001 lineage. Pigs infected with FMD can pose a serious threat to other susceptible livestock because they exhale enormous amounts of virus. Consequently, they should be included in the prophylactic vaccination and surveillance programs ongoing in the country.",,"Rout, M.;Subramaniam, S.;Mohapatra, J. K.;Dash, B.

A wide range of ABV genotypes has been demonstrated not only in parrots but also in other bird species including canaries (Serinus canaria forma domestica) and Bengal finches (Lonchura striata f. dom.), both of which belong to the order Passeriformes. . In this study, 286 samples from captive and wild birds of different sparrow species in different parts of Germany were analyzed for the presence of ABV. Interestingly, only three ABV positive samples were identified by RT-PCR. They are descended from a Yellow-winged Pytilia (Pytilia hypogrammica) and two Black-rumped Waxbills (Estrilda troglodytes) from a flock of captive finches in Saxony. The ABV isolates detected here were only distantly related to ABV isolates found in sparrow species in Germany and Japan, and form a new genotype provisionally named ABV-EF (for ""estrildid finches"").",,"Rubbenstroth, D.;Schmidt, V.;Rinder, M.;Legler, M.;Corman, V.

1799,Phylogenetic characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolated in mainland China between 2001 and 2009,"Twenty Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from infected chicken flocks in China in 2001-2009 were characterized biologically and genetically. All 20 NDVs were classified into velogenic (n=17) and lentogenic (n=3) viruses according to the mean time of death (MDT) of chick embryos. Velogenic viruses carry the 112R-RQKR/F117 (n = 14) or 112G-RQGR/L117 (n = 3) motif at the F0 cleavage site, while all lentogenic viruses carry a sequence motif of 112G-RQGR/L117 (n = 3) at the the same place. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three distinct genotypes (genotypes I, II and VII) existed in chicken flocks in China and VIId of genotype VII were mainly responsible for the current ND panzootics. Two natural recombinants (XD/Shandong/08 and QG/Hebei/07) were assumed and identified by the SimPlot program, and their two parental strains could be of the NDV vaccine line and the VIId velogen line, respectively. The results indicate that recombination plays a role in NDV evolution and the live vaccines have the ability to promote NDV evolution through homologous recombination with circulating virus. © 2009 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Rui, Z.;Juan, P.;Jingliang, S.;Jixun, Z.;Xiaoting, W.;Shouping, Z.;Xiaojiao, L.;Guozhong, Z.",2010.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.020,0
1800,The potential of respiratory droplet-borne influenza virus A/H5N1 to evolve in a mammalian host,"Avian influenza viruses A/H5N1 pose a pandemic threat. As little as five amino acid substitutions, or four with rearrangement, may be sufficient for mammalian-to-mammalian respiratory droplet transmission. From surveillance data we have found that two of these substitutions are common in A/H5N1 viruses, and therefore some viruses may require only three additional substitutions to become transmissible via respiratory droplets between mammals. We used a mathematical model of virus evolution within the host to study factors that might increase or decrease the likelihood that the remaining substitutions will evolve after the virus has infected a mammalian host. These factors, combined with the presence of some of these substitutions in circulating strains, make a virus evolving in nature a potentially serious threat. These results highlight critical areas where more data is needed to assess and potentially mitigate this threat.",,"Russell, C. A.;Fonville, J. M.;Brown, A. E.;Burke, D. F.;Smith, D. L.;James, S.

1801,H1N1 influenza viruses with widely differing haemagglutinin stability are efficiently transmitted from pig to pig and to ferrets,"pandemic-capable influenza virus requires a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein that is immunologically unseen by most humans and capable of supporting human replication and transmission. HA stabilization has been linked to the 2009 human pH1N1 pandemic potential and the airborne transmissibility of H5N1 in the ferret model. Pigs have served as an intermediate host for zoonotic influenza viruses, but the evolutionary pressure this host exerts on HA stability was unknown. For over 70 contemporary porcine H1 and H3 isolates, we found the pH of HA activation to range from pH 5.1 to 5.9 for H1 viruses and pH 5.3 to 5.8 for H3 viruses measured. Thus, contemporary porcine isolates vary widely in HA stability, with values favored by both avian (pH > 5.5) and human and ferret (pH <= 5.5) species. Using an early 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viral backbone, we generated three viruses that differed by an HA residue that altered only HA stability: WT (pH 5.5), HA1-Y17H (pH 6, 0) and HA2-R106K (pH 5.3). All three replicated in pigs and were transmitted from pig to pig and from pig to ferret. WT and R106 viruses retained the HA genotype and phenotype after transmission. Y17H (pH 6.0) acquired HA mutations that stabilized the HA protein to pH 5.8 after transfer to pigs and to 5.5 after transfer to ferrets. Overall, we found that pigs support a wide range of HA activation pHs for contact transmission, and many recent pig H1N1 and H3N2 isolates have stabilized (human-like) HA proteins. This represents an increased risk of a pandemic and underscores the importance of ongoing swine virus surveillance and control.",,"Russier, M.;Yang, G.;Marinova-Petkova, A.;Vogel, P.;Kaplan, B.

1802,"Discovery of an expanded set of avian leukosis subgroup E proviruses in chickens using Vermillion, a novel sequence acquisition and analysis pipeline","Transposable elements (TEs), such as B. endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), are widespread in the genomes of vertebrates. ERVs result from retroviral infections of germline cells, and once integrated into host DNA, they become part of the host's heritable genetic material. ERVs have been attributed positive effects on host physiology, such as generation of novel, adaptive genetic variations and resistance to infection, and negative effects as causative agents of tumorigenesis and disease. The avian leukosis virus subgroup E family (ALVE) of chicken endogenous viruses has been used as a model system to study the effects of ERVs on host physiology, and approximately 30 different ALVE proviruses have been described in the Gallus gallus genome. In this report we describe the development of a software tool we call Vermillion and the use of this tool in combination with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to count the number of known proviruses belonging to the ALVE family of ERVs. to increase the chicken genome four-fold, including expanding the number of known ALVE elements on chromosome 1 (Gga1) from the current 9 to a total of 40.

1804,Serological differentiation of FMD virus strains in relation to the selection of suitable vaccine viruses,"Serological differentiation for the purpose of selecting appropriate vaccine strains or for advice on vaccine use attempts to predict whether a particular vaccine/antigen is likely to induce antibodies protective against predominant field strains. The purpose of such distinctions is not identical to virus classification. It is therefore proposed that the most appropriate measure of this relationship (r) is given by: r = serum activity against heterologous (field) strain/serum activity against homologous (vaccine) strain. A comparison of the complement fixation test with viral neutralization test systems - i.e. metabolic inhibition (color), plaque reduction, a two-dimensional microneutralization cytopathy endpoint (microneut.) and neutralization kinetics - showed that the two test systems did not always produce identical results. Experience has also shown that in cattle there is a good correlation between neutralizing serum titre and challenge protection in both homologous and heterologous systems. It is possible to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between vaccine antigen dose and neutralizing serum titer. It is therefore suggested that the preferred strain comparison test for the purpose of vaccine use should be one based on the virus neutralization system. When comparing two virus strains, their identity must be assumed until their probable difference has been shown. It is therefore necessary for any test system to know the intrinsic test error in order to detect the smallest statistically significant difference between two test values. An analysis of the power of the different test systems used in our laboratory is presented. Experience has shown that methods of handling and storing vaccine viruses can lead to significant changes in the biophysical properties of the virus, e.g. virulence, plaque morphology, sucrose density gradient behavior, even antigenic shift and immunogenicity. It is therefore suggested that, as far as possible, reference antisera for comparing strains to assess the use of vaccines should be prepared from the strains currently used in vaccine production.",,"Rweyemamu, M.

Although the majority of confirmed rabies cases in wild carnivore species are reported from the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the rest are from other wild carnivores, including the critically endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in 2014 and 2015 in two wild dogs and one spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) at Madikwe Game Reserve, North West Province, South Africa using direct fluorescent antibody testing and immunohistochemistry. No new wild dogs have been introduced into Madikwe Game Reserve for many years and the wild dogs were last vaccinated against rabies about 11 years before the incident. The first wild dog euthanized was the last survivor of a rogue pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the remainder of which died with no carcasses found or carcasses too decomposed to sample. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses revealed that they were canid RABVs. The RABVs, derived from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs and one goat, mainly from the Northwest Province, were genetically characterized by targeting a subregion of the nucleoprotein gene. Nucleotide sequence analyzes of these viruses and two previously characterized RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, phylogenetically associated with virus isolates from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 in the Northwest Province and domestic dogs from neighboring communities. The source(s) of the deaths and possible reservoir hosts for the virus could only be speculated based on data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviour, killings, park management and the changing environmental ecology that have been closely monitored at Madikwe over several years. The most likely sources of rabies were border fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats, and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and vulnerable predators can be mitigated through regional rabies control, primarily in domestic dogs and cats, and preventive vaccination of vulnerable park employees and their pets. The importance of continued prophylactic rabies protection through regular vaccination of critically endangered wild animal carnivores and submission of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of wild or domestic animals that behave uncharacteristically or are found dead is emphasized.",,"Sabeta, C.

1808,Characterization of a novel VIII subgenotype of Newcastle disease virus circulating in Iran,"Newcastle disease is an economically important and highly contagious disease affecting wild and domestic bird species. Despite extensive vaccination efforts in the poultry industry, outbreaks of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) still occur, causing significant economic losses. Farm chickens may serve as a potential reservoir of NDVs for commercial poultry due to poor biosecurity and inadequate vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relatedness and molecular characterization of eight NDVs isolated from backyard fowl in Iran between 2011 and 2013. The complete coding sequence of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) genes of eight NDVs was determined and compared to other published NDVs. Based on distances between populations and phylogenetic topology between available NDV categories, Iranian isolates formed a new VIIl subgenotype distinct from previous groups, which have been termed genotype VII. In addition, both F and HN genes of the Iranian isolates shared high nucleotide sequence similarity to viruses isolated in China. All viruses analyzed contained a polybasic cleavage site motif (111G/RRRQKRâ†“F117), indicating that all isolates could be categorized as a virulent pathotype. No mutation was observed in the neutralizing epitopes of the F protein. Analysis of amino acids associated with neutralizing antigenic sites within the HN protein revealed that all isolates had a unique amino acid (Q) at position 347. These findings underscore the need to reinforce the biosecurity measures implemented on village flocks and to practice a mandatory vaccination program for domestic poultry. In addition, continuous monitoring of NDVs in different bird species can help gain more knowledge about the evolution of this virus and prevent future panzoa.",,"Sabouri, F.;Vasfi Marandi, M.;Bashashati, M.",2018.0,,10.1080/03079457.2017.1376735,0
1809,Simultaneous identification of DNA and RNA viruses in pig feces by process-driven deep sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Animal feces contain a community of many different microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses. Little information is available on the diversity of viruses in pig faeces. Here we describe a protocol optimized for the purification of the total fraction of virus particles from pig feces. The genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis. The efficiency of the procedure was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphologies and genome types. Defined amounts of the bacteriophage were added to the sample and their abundance determined by quantitative PCR during the preparation process. RESULTS: The method was applied to a pooled fecal sample from five pigs. 69,613 sequence reads were generated from this sample. All added bacteriophage were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. Overall, 7.7% of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. They were mainly from bacteriophage (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities to plant viruses. The most frequently detected swine viruses were Kobuvirus, Rotavirus C, Astrovirus, Enterovirus B, Sapovirus and Picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with identities to chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively named Pig Stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), is a novel porcine virus. CONCLUSION: The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA viruses in pig faeces including the identification of previously unknown viruses. It can be applied in studies examining the etiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases. The implemented process control is used for quality control, ensures the comparability of the method and can be used for further method optimization.",,"Sachsenroder, J.;Twardziok, S.;Hammerl, J.

1810,"The general composition of porcine faecal virome is dependent on age, but not on feeding with a probiotic bacterium","Background: The porcine faecal virome, which encompasses the viral community present in porcine faeces, is complex and consists of porcine viruses, bacteriophages, transiently transmitted plant viruses and other smaller virus species. Little is known about factors affecting its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the virometic composition of pig faeces was analyzed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets either receiving or not receiving the probiotic bacterium. Results: DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared from 8 pooled fecal samples from the feeding trial and subjected to on-line next-generation sequencing, resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. On average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest in samples from the youngest piglets (55-77%) and lowest in samples from sows (8-10%). In contrast, the proportion of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to about 90% in the sows. The dominant mammalian viruses differed remarkably between 12-day-old piglets (Kobuvirus), 54-day-old piglets (Boca, Dependo, and Pig Feces-Associated Small Circular DNA Virus [PigSCV]), and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus, and ""circovirus-like"" viruses CB-A and RW-A).In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher in the sows than in the piglets.Between the viromas of the probiotic bacteria-treated group and the no consistent differences in virome composition could be observed in the control group.Conclusion: The analysis shows that the porcine fecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition depends mainly on the age of the pigs.Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could be detected with the The metagenomics method used cannot be detected © 2014 Sachsenröde r et al.",,"SachsenrÃ¶der, J.;Twardziok, S.

1813,No viral association found in a series of differentiated cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia by human papillomavirus and panviral microarray testing,"Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC), and the differentiated type (dVIN) is observed more frequently in association with VSCC. In contrast to common VIN (uVIN), which is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a germline mutation in the p53 gene is believed to be associated with ≥90% of dVIN cases. To date, no infectious agent associated with dVIN has been identified, and studies investigating this possibility have been hampered by the difficulty of accurately diagnosing dVIN from small biopsies. Here we used immunostaining for p16<sup>ink4a</sup>, a biomarker for HPV infection, to examine 14 high-grade VIN uVIN cases and 14 dVIN cases and select 10 dVIN cases to host them comprehensively for all known viruses using a panviral microarray platform (ViroChip). All uVIN tissue samples, including 8 wart and 6 basaloid cases, showed positivity with the p16<sup>ink4a</sup> immunodye. The staining pattern was consistent in all cases except in two cases where positive staining was localized to the lower third of the epidermis. In contrast, immunostaining for p16<sup>ink4a</sup> was negative in all dVIN cases. ViroChip analysis of 10 pure dVIN samples confirmed the absence of human papillomavirus subtypes or other viruses, with the exception of a single sample that showed a weak microarray signature for a swine herpesvirus. Subsequent PCR testing of the sample was negative for herpesvirus, and thorough next-generation metagenomic sequencing revealed only sequences consistent with non-pathogenic viral flora and bacterial contamination. In this study, we demonstrated the absence of viral association in 10 dVIN cases. Alternative pathways for carcinogenesis such as p53 mutation should be considered when investigating potential treatment options for dVIN.",,"Saglam, O.;Samayoa, E.;Somasekar, S.;Naccache, S.;Iwasaki, A.;Chiu, C.

1814,Antigenic subtyping and competition analysis of porcine circovirus type 2 epitopes using monoclonal antibodies,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) strains have been classified into two major genotypes (PCV2a and PCV2b) and 8 genetic clusters: PCV2b-1A to PCV2b-1C and PCV2a-2A to PCV2a-2E. To date, no studies have been performed to antigenically subtype PCV2 strains encompassing eight PCV2 clusters. The present study aimed to antigenically subtype PCV2 and perform epitope competition analysis using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Fourteen PCV2 strains representative of eight clusters were tested with 20 mAbs (15 of them were generated against PCV2a strain Stoon-1010 and 5 of them against PCV2b strain 1147) in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays. Four mAbs reacted with all 14 PCV2 strains and one mAb reacted with all but one PCV2a 2C strain. One mAb reacted with all PCV2a strains except one PCV2a 2C strain and one mAb reacted with all PCV2b strains except one PCV2b 1C strain. Nine mAbs reacted with strains PCV2b-1A/1B, PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. Three mAbs only reacted with strains PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. A mAb specifically reacted with the strains of PCV2b-1A/1B. This suggests that discrete antigenic differences exist between different PCV2 genetic clusters and that these clusters can be distinguished using a panel of universal and cluster-specific mAbs. Six mAbs were selected for cross-competition analysis by a competitive ELISA using PCV2 strain Stoon-1010. Six overlapping epitopes have been identified on the PCV2 capsid protein. The universal mAbs recognized larger epitopes than the cluster-specific mAbs. These findings are helpful in the development of new generation diagnostic tests and vaccines against PCV2. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Saha, D.;Huang, L.;Bussalleu, E.;Lefebvre, D.

1815,Comparison of the properties of avian reoviruses isolated from the alimentary and respiratory tract with viruses isolated from the synovia,"Two week old gnotobiotic chicks were footpad inoculated with viruses isolated from synovia and synovial membrane: WVU 1464-29H, WVU 1675, WVU 2937, WVU 2986 and WVU 71-212; from the digestive tract: reoviruses 24, 25 and 59; or from the respiratory tract: reovirus Fahey Crawley (FC). All viruses induced swelling of the footpad and inflammatory changes in the synovial membrane. Serum from virus-infected chicks shared a common agar gel precipitin (AGP) lineage. On the basis of the plaque reduction test in primary chick kidney cells (PCK), the viruses were divided into 4 main serotypes. All viruses produced cytopathic effects (CPE) in primary chicken tissue cultures. Except for reovirus FC and WVU 1464-29H, all viruses produced CPE in the Vero cell line.",,"Sahu, S. P.;Olson, N.

1816,Sequence analysis of in vivo defective interfering RNA of pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus,"Influenza virus defective interfering (DI) particles are naturally occurring, non-infectious virions that are typically generated during serial in vitro passages in cell cultures of the virus at a high multiplicity of infection. DI particles are known for their role in inhibiting viral replication and for the effects they have on the production of infectious virions. So far, influenza virus DI particles have mainly been described as a phenomenon of cell culture and in experimentally infected embryonated chicken eggs. They have also been isolated from a respiratory infection in chickens. Using a sequencing approach, we characterize multiple subgenomic viral RNAs from human nasopharyngeal samples infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The distribution of these in vivo derived DI-like RNAs was similar to that of in vitro DIs, with the majority of the defective RNAs being generated from PB2 (segment 1) of the polymerase complex, followed by PB1 and PA. The lengths of the in vivo-derived DI-like segments are also similar to known in vitro DIs, and the in vivo-derived DI-like segments share internal deletions of the same segments. The presence of identical DI-like RNAs in patients linked by direct contact is compatible with transmission between them. The functional role of DI-like RNAs in natural infections remains to be elucidated.",,"Saira, K.;Lin, X.;DePasse, J.

1817,Characterization of a human influenza H9N2 virus isolated in Hong Kong,"Two H9N2 viruses were first isolated from humans in Hong Kong in 1999. The isolation of influenza viruses with a new subtype of hemagglutinin (HA) has caught the attention of public health authorities worldwide in anticipation of a pandemic. The sequence analysis of the HA genes shows that HA from A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) is most closely related to that from A/Quail/HK/G1/97 (H9N2), which contains the internal genes encoding those from Hong are similar to Kong/97 (H5N1) viruses. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyzes revealed diversity among H9 HA. A/Hong Kong/1073/99 has been shown to cause respiratory infection in Syrian hamsters, suggesting that the virus can replicate efficiently in mammalian hosts. We have developed a whole virion test vaccine using a formalin-inactivated egg-grown HK1073. Two-time intraperitoneal administration of the vaccine to hamsters conferred complete protection against challenge infection by the homologous virus grown on MDCK cells. The receptor specificity of HK1073 appeared to be different from that of other H9 subtype avian influenza viruses, which preferentially recognize α-2,3-linked sialic acid. The hemagglutination of HK1073 with guinea pig erythrocytes was inhibited by both α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked sialic acid-containing polymers. These data indicated that HK1073 had acquired a broader host range, including humans. Together with the data available so far, the present study suggested that the isolation of the H9 influenza viruses from humans requires precautions against the emergence of new human influenza. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Virus populations are predominant in respiratory infections and pose a continuous economic burden on the poultry industry, causing severe economic losses through reduced productivity [1], [2]. To understand the viral metagenome of poultry related to respiratory infections, we performed DNA virome sequencing and data analysis of broilers from 8 districts of Gujarat state, India. We report high quality sequencing reads and a very abundant DNA virus population present in the infected broilers.

1821,Isolation and characterization of a novel rhabdovirus from a wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Japan,"novel rhabdovirus was isolated from the serum of a healthy Japanese wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) and identified using rapid viral nucleic acid sequence (RDV) determination, next-generation sequencing, and electron microscopy. The virus has been tentatively named wild boar rhabdovirus 1 (WBRV1). Phylogenetic analysis of the entire genome sequence showed that WBRV1 is closely related to Tupaia rhabdovirus (TRV) isolated from cultured cells of tree shrew hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. TRV has not yet been assigned to any genus of Rhabdoviridae. Analysis of the L gene showed that WBRV1 belongs to the genus Vesiculovirus. These observations suggest that both TRV and WBRV1 belong to a new genus of Rhabdoviridae. Next-generation genome sequencing of WBRV1 revealed 5 open reading frames of 1329, 765, 627, 1629, and 6336 bases in length. The WBRV1 gene sequences are similar to those of other rhabdoviruses. Epizootiological analysis of a population of wild boar in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan showed that 6.5% were positive for the WBRV1 gene and 52% were positive for WBRV1 neutralizing antibodies. In addition, such virus-neutralizing antibodies were found in domestic pigs in another prefecture. WBRV1 was inoculated intranasally and intraperitoneally into SCID and BALB/c mice, and viral RNA was detected in SCID mice, suggesting that WBRV1 can replicate in immunocompromised mice. These results indicate that this novel virus is endemic in wild and livestock in Japan.",,"Sakai, K.;Hagiwara, K.;Omatsu, T.;Hamasaki, C.;Kuwata, R.;Shimoda, H.;Suzuki, K.;Endoh, D.;Nagata, N.;Nagai, M.;Katayama, Y.;Oba, M.;Kurane, I.;Saijo, M.;Morikawa, S.;Mizutani, T.;Maeda, K.",2015.0,1930-09-01 00:00:00,,0
1822,Bunyaviruses are prevalent in male and female Ixodes scapularis ticks in central Pennsylvania,"The black-legged Ixodes scapularis tick is widespread in the United States and transmits multiple pathogens to humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. Recently, several novel viruses of the Bunyaviridae family (South Bay Virus (SBV) and Blacklegged tick phlebovirus (BTPV)) have been identified infecting female I. scapularis ticks collected in New York State. We used metagenomic sequencing to study the distribution of viruses infecting male and female I. scapularis ticks collected in Center County, Pennsylvania. We identified both SBV and BTPV in both male and female ticks from all collection sites. The role of male I. scapularis in pathogen epidemiology has been overlooked as they rarely sting and are not considered important pathogen vectors. However, males can act as a reservoir for pathogens, which can then be transmitted to females during mating. Our data underscore the importance of investigating all potential pathways of disease maintenance and transmission throughout the life cycle of vector pathogens in order to understand the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.",,"Sakamoto, J.

The 5'-untranslated region (UTR) amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was determined by direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the nucleotide sequence data. Most swine isolates have been divided into two major subgroups, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), subgroup 1 (CSFV-1 represented by the Brecia strain) and subgroup 2 (CSFV-2 represented by the Alfort strain). However, the Japanese strains Kanagawa/74, Okinawa/86, Okinawa/86-2 and Thai CBR/93 were the most pronounced variants and these were assigned to another new distinct subgroup, CSFV-3 (represented by the p97 strain). Most ruminant isolates were classified as Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) genotype-I (BVDV-I) and divided into two subgroups, BVDV-Ia (represented by the NADL strain) and Ib (represented by the Osloss strain). Two bovine isolates (MS-1 and SY-89) and one contaminating strain (V/FLL) from an ovine cell line were genetically classified as BVDV genotype II (BVDV-II). These data suggested that the detection and phylogenetic analysis of 5' UTRs are useful for the rapid characterization of field isolates.",,"Sakoda, Y.;Ozawa, S.

For most samples, concentrations ranged from 3-6 log(10) copies RNA/mL. Levels were higher in female patients than in male patients, but we found no association between viral load and several laboratory and clinical parameters, including TBE severity. However, a poor humoral immune response was associated with more severe disease progression, suggesting that inefficient clearance of the virus leads to more severe disease. To determine whether a particular genetic lineage of TBEV had a higher virulence potential, we obtained 56 partial coat protein gene sequences by direct sequencing of reverse transcription PCR products from clinical specimens from patients. This method provided a large set of patient-derived TBEV sequences.

1825,Alternative growth promoters Modulate the broiler gut microbiome and improve body weight gain,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used to improve weight gain in poultry production. However, there is increasing concern about the impact of AGP on the emergence of antibiotic resistance among zoonotic bacterial pathogens in the avian gut microbial community. In this study, we applied mass spectrophotometric, phylogenetic, and shotgun metagenomic approaches to evaluate bioactive phenolic extracts (BPE) from blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) pomace as AGP alternatives in broilers. We conducted two trials with 100 Cobb 500 broilers (in each trial) in four equal groups given unsupplemented water, supplemented with AGP (tylosin, neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, erythromycin, and oxytetracycline) or supplemented with 0.1 g Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L or 1.0 g GAE/L (during the last 72 h before euthanasia) BPE for 6 weeks. Compared to the control group (water only), the chickens supplemented with AGP and 0.1 g GAE/L BPE gained 9.5 and 5.8% more body weight, respectively. The microbiomes of both the AGP- and BPE-treated chickens showed a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. AGP supplementation appeared to be associated with a higher relative frequency of bacteriophage and unique cecal resistoma compared to BPE supplementation or control. Functional characterization of cecal microbiomes revealed significant animal-to-animal variations in the relative abundance of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. These results provided a basis on which to study mechanisms of plant performance enhancers in animal growth regulation. In addition, the data will aid in the development of alternative strategies to improve animal growth performance and consequently production.",,"Salaheen, S.;Kim, S. W.;Haley, B. J.;Van Kessel, J. A.

A majority of the accessions originated from 11 countries representing different agroclimatic zones in sub-Saharan Africa and included landraces, local cultivars and breeding lines. After initial growth testing, 69 cowpea accessions, mostly with symptoms of viral infection, were selected for further evaluation using a combination of host range, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and sequence analyses. Analysis revealed that samples from 46 (67%) accessions contained one or more known seed-borne cowpea viruses. These included accession seed samples from Botswana (13 accessions), Ghana (6), Nigeria (6), Mali (1), Kenya (5), Cameroon (7), Niger (4), Ivory Coast (1), Benin (1st ), India (1) and China (1). Viruses were identified by RT-PCR analysis of total RNAs extracted from putatively virus-infected specimens using virus species-specific primers, and by cloning and sequencing of RT-PCR products generated using virus genus- and family-specific degenerate oligonucleotide sequences. primers were amplified. Viruses identified included cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV). Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced coat protein (CP) amino acid sequences of selected CMV isolates obtained from five agroclimatically distinct localities confirmed their membership as new members of the CMV subgroup IB.

1828,The sequence of a complete chicken BG haplotype shows dynamic expansion and contraction of two gene lines with distinct expression patterns,"Many genes important for immunity are found as multigene families. The butyrophilin genes are members of the B7 family and play diverse roles in coregulation and perhaps antigen presentation. In humans, a fixed number of butyrophilin genes are found in and around the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and show a striking association with certain autoimmune diseases. In chickens, BG genes encode homologues with slightly different domain organization. Few BG genes have been characterized, one involved in the actin-myosin interaction in the intestinal brush border and another involved in viral disease resistance. We characterize all BG genes in B12 chickens and find a multigene family organized as tandem repeats in the BG region outside of the MHC, a single gene in the MHC (the BF-BL region), and another single gene another chromosome. There is precise cell and tissue expression for each gene, but overall there are two types, those expressed by hematopoietic cells and those expressed in tissues (presumably non-hematopoietic cells), which are associated with two different types of promoters and 5-inch untranslated regions correlated (5'UTR). However, the multigene family in the BG region contains many hybrid genes, suggesting recombination and/or deletion as major evolutionary forces. We identify BG genes in the shotgun sequence of the whole chicken genome as well as by comparison to other haplotypes by fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirming the dynamic expansion and contraction within the BG region. Therefore, for reasons that have yet to be understood, the BG genes in chickens undergo much more rapid evolution compared to their mammalian homologues. © 2014 Salomonsen et al.",,"Salomonsen, J.;Chattaway, J.

Based on the pathogenicity indices (MDT, ICPI and IVPI), all of these isolates were determined to be velogenic (highly virulent) strains. Sequence analysis of the full-length mRNA encoding the fusion glycoprotein precursor (F0) of the NDV fusion proteins F1 and F2 in these six isolates revealed the presence of point mutations in the form of nucleic acid substitutions at positions 82(C†'T), 83(Tâ†' C), 736(Aâ†'G) and 1.633(Gâ†'A). However, it was found that the nucleic acid residues at positions 330-347 of the precursor F0 gene, corresponding to the cleavage site of the F0 protein, were conserved among the six NDV isolates.

1830,Phylogenetic Analysis of Lumpy Skin Disease Viruses in Northwestern Iran,"Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a devastating viral disease in cattle that has recently spread from Africa to Middle Eastern countries. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDV) isolated from different regions of Iran, as well as the origin and distribution of these viruses. In this study, a total of 234 blood samples from clinically affected animals from four provinces in northwestern Iran were analyzed for LSDV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). From 80 positive samples for LSDV detected by PCR, the partial P32 gene (759 bp) of 12 isolates was sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically. LSD viruses have been classified into three subclusters with an overall nucleotide identity of 97.1-100%. LSDVs isolated from Gilan showed the lowest nucleotide identity with the other LSDVs. Four isolates of LSDV including KO-1, EA-1, EA-3 and WA-3 showed 100% similarity to each other and also to the Neethling strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the identified LSDVs were closely related and shared high sequence homology with other LSDV isolates from Africa. It was concluded that the LSD outbreak likely occurred in north-western Iran by LSDVs invading the country from Iraq, and the P32 nucleotide sequence information obtained in the present study is a valuable resource for understanding its genetic nature and molecular epidemiology of local LSDV isolates that can be used for future vaccine development based on the circulating strains in the region.",,"Sameea Yousefi, P.;Dalir-Naghadeh, B.;Mardani, K.;Jalilzadeh-Amin, G.",2018.0,,10.1007/s11250-018-1634-3,0
1831,A four biomarker blood signature distinguishes systemic inflammation due to viral infection from other etiologies,"The innate immune system of humans and other mammals responds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are conserved across broad classes of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be detected, indicative of a systemic host response to viral infection. Previous work has identified host transcriptional signatures for individual viruses, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue fever, but the generality of these signatures for all viral infection types has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood indicative of a general systemic host response to many types of viral infections. The signature genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL) and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of the 13 validation datasets, which include humans, macaques, chimpanzees, pigs, mice, rats and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides a statistically significant (p<0.05) distinction between viral and non-viral states.

1832,The complete genome sequence of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotype 5 completes the analysis of nine APMV serotypes and reveals the longest APMV genome,"Background: Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) consist of nine known serotypes. The genomes of representatives of all APMV serotypes except APMV type 5 have recently been completely sequenced. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the APMV-5 prototype budgerigar/Kunitachi/74 strain. METHODS/MAIN RESULTS: The APMV-5 Kunitachi virus is unusual in that it lacks a virion hemagglutinin and does not grow in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. However, the virus grew in the amniotic sac of embryonated chicken eggs and in twelve different established cell lines and two primary cell cultures. The genome is 17,262 nucleotides (nt) long, which is the longest among members of the Avulavirus genus, and encodes six non-overlapping genes in the order 3 ""NP/V/WMF-HN-L-5"" with intergenic regions of 4- 57th The genome length follows the ""rule of six"" and contains a 55 nt leader sequence at the 3 inch end and a 552 nt trailer sequence at the 5 inch end. The phosphoprotein (P) gene contains a conserved RNA editing site and is expected to encode P, V, and W proteins. The F protein cleavage site (GKRKKR †“ F) corresponds to the cleavage site motif of the ubiquitous cellular protease furin. Consistent with this, no exogenous protease was required for virus replication in vitro. However, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of APMV-5 strain Kunitachi in day-old chicks was zero, suggesting that the virus is avirulent to chickens despite the presence of a polybasic F cleavage site. Conclusions/Relevance: The phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the APVM-5 genome and proteins compared to those of the other APMV serotypes showed that APMV-5 is more closely related to APMV-6 than to the other APMVs. In addition, these comparisons provided evidence of extensive genome-wide divergence, supporting the classification of the APMVs into nine separate serotypes. The structure of the F cleavage site does not appear to be a reliable indicator of virulence among APMV serotypes 2-9. The availability of sequence information for all known APMV serotypes will facilitate studies in epidemiology and vaccinology.",,"Samuel, A. S.;Paldurai, A.;Kumar, S.;Collins, P. L.;Samal, S.

1833,Climate change affects the global potential spread of bluetongue virus,"The geographic distribution of arboviruses has received considerable attention after several dramatic events around the world. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a category ""A"" disease that must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and is transmitted among ruminants by mosquitoes of the Culicoides genus. Here, we developed a comprehensive occurrence dataset to map the current distribution, estimate the ecological niche, and investigate the future potential distribution of BTV worldwide using ecological niche modeling and based on diverse future climate scenarios from general circulation models (GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCP's). The broad ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV under contemporary conditions reflected the current global distribution of the disease in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. All model predictions were significantly better than random expectations. As a further assessment of the model's robustness, we compared our model predictions to 331 independent records of recent outbreaks from the Information System for the Food and Agriculture Organization's Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES-i); all were successfully anticipated by the BTV model. Finally, we tested the ecological niche similarity between putative vectors and BTV and could not reject the niche similarity hypotheses. Under future climatic conditions, it was predicted that the potential spread of BTV would expand, particularly in Central Africa, the United States, and western Russia.",,"Samy, A. M.;Peterson, A.

1835,Analysis of swine sera for functional antibody titers against influenza and neuraminidase proteins using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA),"Neuraminidase (NA) is an envelope glycoprotein of influenza viruses, including porcine influenza A viruses. NA possesses sialidase activity, which is functionally important at several sites in viral replication and balances the sialic acid receptor-binding activity of hemagglutinin (HA), the other important envelope glycoprotein. The NA proteins of influenza A viruses have been classified into nine serological subtypes and they undergo antigenic drift variation similar to that of HA. Antibodies against NA are analyzed much less frequently than antibodies against HA. Established decades ago, the traditional NA inhibition (NI) antibody titration assay is widely considered cumbersome and inefficient for routine use. In recent years, some new formats have been developed that still measure inhibition of NA enzymatic function, but more efficiently and with less chemical waste produced. The enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) performed in 96-well plates and analyzed on a spectrophotometric plate reader is described here. An important factor in adopting ELLA technology for animal testing, such as B. pigs, is the choice of NA antigen, which can be purified protein or whole virus containing an antigenically irrelevant HA protein. This NI assay, in conjunction with the hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody assay, provides a convenient way to more comprehensively characterize viral isolates and quantify antibodies induced by infection or vaccination.",,"Sandbulte, M.

1837,Detection and characterization of atypical capripoxviruses in small ruminants in India,"Recent developments in molecular biology shed light on the interspecies transmission of SPPV and GTPV. The present study was designed to characterize the capripoxviruses circulating in sheep and goats under field conditions using RPO30 gene-based viral lineage (SPPV/GTPV), differentiation of PCR and sequencing of RPO30 and GPCR genes clinical samples. Of 58 scab cells examined (35 sheep and 23 goats), 27 sheep and 18 goat scab cells were found positive for capripox virus infections. With the exception of one sheep scab and one goat scab, all positive samples gave an amplicon size according to host origin, ie SPPV in sheep and GTPV in goats. In the two exceptional cases above, goat scab and sheep scab gave an amplicon size similar to that of SPPV and GTPV, respectively. In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes of complete ORFs of RPO30 and GPCR genes from six sheep and three goat scabs revealed that all but the above two samples had host-specific signatures and were clustered according to their host origin. In the case of cross-species samples that infected samples, sheep scab possessed GTPV-like signatures and goat scab had SPPV-like signatures. Our study identifies the circulation of cross-infecting SPPV and GTPV in the field and warrants the development of a single-strain vaccine that can protect animals from both sheeppox and goatpox diseases.",,"Santhamani, R.;Venkatesan, G.;Minhas, S.

1839,"Genetic characterization of small ruminant lentiviruses circulating in naturally infected sheep and goats in Ontario, Canada","Maedi visna virus (MVV) and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) are related members of a group of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) that infect sheep and goats. SRLVs are endemic in many countries including Canada. However, very little is known about the genetic characteristics of Canadian SRLVs, particularly in the province of Ontario. Given the importance of surveillance and eradication programs in controlling SRLVs, it is imperative that diagnostic tests used to identify infected animals be sensitive to local strains of SRLVs. The aim of this work was to characterize SRLV strains circulating in Ontario and to assess the variability of the immunodominant regions of the Gag protein. In this study, the nearly complete gag sequence of 164 SRLVs from 130 naturally infected sheep and 32 naturally infected Ontario goats were sequenced. The animals belonged to distant single and mixed animal holdings (sheep and goats). Ovine lentiviruses from the same farm tended to cluster more tightly than goat lentiviruses from the same farm. Sequence analysis revealed a higher degree of heterogeneity between the goat lentivirus sequences with an average pairwise DNA distance between farms of 10% and only 5% in the ovine lentivirus group. Interestingly, amplification of SRLVs from ELISA-positive sheep was successful in 81% of cases, while amplification of SRLV-proviral DNA was only possible in 55% of ELISA-positive goat samples; suggesting that a significant fraction of the caprine lentiviruses circulating in Ontario possess heterogeneity at the primer binding sites used in this study. Sequences from Ontario ovine and caprine SRLVs were assembled into pedigrees with other known SRLVs and found to belong to sequence groups A2 and B1, respectively, as reported by Shah et al. Are defined. (2004a). A new goat lentivirus with a pairwise genetic difference of 15.6-25.4% compared to other group B subtypes was identified. Therefore, we propose naming a new subtype, B4, within the caprine lentivirus-like cluster. Finally, we demonstrate evidence for recombination between ovine lentiviruses. These results underscore the wide genetic diversity of SRLV strains circulating in the province of Ontario and demonstrate that the gag region is amenable to phylogenetic studies and can be applied to monitor SRLV eradication programs. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Santry, L.

1840,Genomic characterization of two novel pathogenic avipoxviruses isolated from Pacific shearwaters (Ardenna spp.).,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, many seabird populations have gradually declined, and the factors driving this continued deterioration are not always well understood. Avipoxvirus infections have been found in a variety of bird species worldwide, however very little is known about the disease ecology of avipoxvirus in seabirds. Here we present two novel avipoxviruses from Pacific shearwaters (Ardenna spp), one from a flesh-footed shearwater (A. carneipes) (SWPV-1) and the other from a wedge-tailed shearwater (A. pacificus) (SWPV-2). RESULTS: Epidermal smallpox lesions, liver and blood samples were examined from A. carneipes and A. pacificus from breeding colonies in Eastern Australia. After histopathological confirmation of the disease, PCR screening for avipoxvirus, circovirus, reticuloendothelosis virus, and fungal pathogens was performed. Two samples that were PCR positive for poxvirus were further evaluated by next-generation sequencing, which revealed complete genomes of shearwaterpox virus (SWPV) from A. pacificus and A. carneipes, both of which have the highest degree of similarity to the canarypox virus showed (98% and 67%, respectively). The new complete genome of SWPV-1 from A. carneipes is missing 43 genes compared to CNPV and contains 4 predicted genes not found in any other poxvirus, while the complete genome of SWPV-2 is missing 18 genes compared to CNPV and another 15 genes are significantly fragmented, likely rendering them nonfunctional. CONCLUSION: These are the first complete genome sequences of the avipoxvirus infecting marine seabirds. Comparing SWPV-1 and -2 to existing avipoxvirus sequences, our results indicate that the complete A. carneipes SWPV genome (SWPV-1) described here is not closely related to any other avipoxvirus genome derived from avian or other natural hosts species and that it should probably be considered a separate species.",,"Sarker, S.;Das, S.;Lavers, J.

Marked genetic variations have emerged in the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene, causing the emergence of new variants. The present study genetically characterized the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strains from Assam that circulated in 2016 and caused a mild outbreak with no reported mortality. Sequence analysis of the HA gene from 20 Assam/H1N1pdm09 positive strains revealed 3 mutations (K180Q, 5202T, S220T) at the antigenic sites along with several other reported mutations that are in close proximity to the antigenic sites and therefore affect viral antigenicity could. Phylogenetically, the Assam/H1N1pdm09 strains clustered in genogroup 6B.

What evolutionary processes determine the severity and ability to transmit influenza A viruses between humans? We performed phylogenetic classifications of influenza A viruses sampled between 1918 and 2009 using a measure called entropic chaos degree, which was developed through the study of chaos in information dynamics. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal protein (PB2, PB1, PA, NS, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2) showed that influenza A viruses that adapt to humans and transmit between humans clearly differ from the porcine and porcine strains distinguish bird line. In addition, the HA, NA, and internal proteins of the influenza strain that caused a pandemic or severe epidemic with high mortality were phylogenetically different from those of previous pandemic and severe epidemic strains. We concluded that the internal protein has a significant impact on the ability to transmit between humans. Based on this study, we are convinced that the degree of entropic chaos is very useful to understand the classification and severity of an isolated influenza A virus strain.",,"Sato, K.;Tanabe, T.;Ohya, M.",2010.0,Sep,,0
1845,Antiviral activities of xanthogenates,"Strategies in the development of antiviral agents have been directed towards the development of substances that preferentially react with virus-encoded enzymes, e.g. B. polymerases and reverse transcriptase interact. Xanthates, antiviral/antitumor with distinct modes of action, selectively interact with cell proteins that regulate cell growth through protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation pathways. Such regulatory processes appear to be essential for the growth of various taxonomically unrelated viruses. Xanthate structures in position R1 were replaced by aliphatic cyclic and non-cyclic residues and in position R2 by alkali metals. The antiviral effect of such substitutions has been evaluated in plaque reduction assays using the herpes virus as a rapid reliable test system. The criterion of cytotoxicity was based on the ability of logarithmically growing cell cultures to undergo active mitotic divisions. Position R1 should be occupied with a lipophilic substituent which should be structurally restricted as mono-, bi- and tricyclic groups. The specific antiviral activity of the xanthate compound D609, expressed by its IC50, compares well with that of other herpes inhibitors, e.g. phosphonoformic acid (10 µM) or phosphonoacetic acid (20 µM). Unlike the herpesvirus, which encodes its own DNA polymerase, the DNA tumor virus 'SV40' relies on cellular DNA polymerase for its DNA replication. There was a selective antiviral effect of xanthogenate in the absence of cytotoxicity of bovine papilloma virus (BPV-1) transformed cells. The inhibition of viral gene functions by xanthogenate without adverse effects on essential cell functions shows the high selectivity of the antiviral effect. Depending on the multiplicity of the Coxsackie B4 virus, despite the presence of D609, there was a direct correlation in the amount of viral proteins synthesized. In the case of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), xanthogenate did not inhibit the synthesis of primary transcripts, which, being endowed with positive strand polarity, serve as messengers. The antiviral effect of xanthate only occurs at acidic pH, otherwise the antiviral/antitumor effects decrease. Because HIV-1 only replicates in appropriate lymphoma cells that exhibit characteristics of transformed cells, careful calibration of D609/monocarbonic acid concentration had to precede antiviral therapy. Such treatment inhibits the shedding of infectious HIV from chronically virus-producing lymphoma cultures. This is the only compound that prevents the shedding of HIV infection from carrier cultures. D609 antagonizes the action of the tumor-promoting compound TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). The effects of D609 are not directed at pkc itself. Phospholipase C seems to be the main target. Diacylglycerol, the product of phospholipase C activity, is absent in cells treated with D609. D609 interacts with the growth signal transduction sequence in a very specific mechanism. The transaction mechanisms may lack biological activity as xanthogenate blocks pkC activity responsible for the appropriate phosphorylation of these parameters. Bolus injections of D609 in conjunction with monocarbonic acid exert therapeutic effects on tumor xenografts in athymic mice when D609/undecanoic or dodecanoic acid was administered. This compound can be administered intravenously in very high concentrations.",,"Sauer, G.;Amtmann, E.;Mellert, W.",1989.0,,,0
1846,A member of a new Picornaviridae genus is excreted in pig feces,"During a study of the faecal microbiomes of two healthy piglets using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified a viral genome containing an open reading frame encoding a predicted polyprotein of 2,133 amino acids. This new viral genome showed the typical organization of picornaviruses and contained three structural proteins (VP0, VP3 and VP1) followed by seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro and 3Dpol). Given its special relationship to parechovirus, we propose naming it ""pasivirus"" to the parecho sister clade virus, with ""Swine pasivirus 1"" (SPaV1) as the type species. Fecal samples collected at an industrial facility from healthy sows and piglets from the same herd (25 and 75, respectively) aged 4 to 28 weeks were analyzed for the presence of SPAV1 by one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR targeting a 3D region of 151 bp. SPAV1 was detected in faecal samples from 51/75 healthy piglets (68% of animals) and in none of the 25 faecal samples from healthy sows, suggesting that SPAV1 circulates through enteric infection of healthy piglets.

During bluetongue surveillance activities, we identified a putative new BTV serotype in healthy goats from Sardinia, Italy. RNAs purified from blood and serum samples were positive for BTV by generic real-time RT-PCR and c-ELISA, respectively, while genotyping and serotyping were unsuccessful. Using NGS, the entire genome sequence was obtained from two blood samples (BTV-X ITL2015 strains 34200 and 33531). Overall, Seg 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 shows the highest identity (75.3-75.5% nt/77.4-78.1% aa) with recently isolated BTV-27 from Corsica and with the most recently discovered BTV XJ1407 from China (75.9% nt/78.2% aa), while with BTV-25 from Switzerland (73.0% nt/75.0% aa) and BTV-26 from Kuwait (62.0% nt/60 .5% aa) less related. In this study, a specific RT-qPCR targeting Seg 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 was evaluated. Given the Seg 2/VP2 identity of BTV-X ITL2015 with BTV-25, 26, 27s and BTV XJ1407, and that serum from BTV-X ITL2015 infected goats failed to neutralize all serotypes present tested, we propose the existence of one new BTV serotype circulating in goats in Sardinia.

1850,Origin of the 1957 pandemic H2 influenza A virus and the persistence of its possible progenitors in the avian reservoir,"H2N2 influenza A viruses caused the Asian pandemic of 1957 and then disappeared from the human population 10 years later. To assess the potential for similar outbreaks in the future, we determined the antigenicity of H2-hemagglutinins (HAs) from representative human and avian H2viruses and then analyzed the nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine their evolutionary characteristics in different hosts determine. The results of longitudinal virus surveillance studies were also examined to estimate the prevalence of avian H2 isolates in samples collected from wild ducks and domestic fowl. Patterns of reactivity obtained with a wide range of monoclonal antibodies indicated antigenic drift in the HA of human H2 influenza viruses from 1962 onwards. Amino acid changes were clustered in two regions of HA1 corresponding to antigenic sites A and D of H3-HA. In contrast, the antigenic profiles of most avian H2-HAs were remarkably conserved until 1991 and resembled the prototype strain Japan 57 (H2N2). Amino acid changes were distributed across HA1, indicating that antibodies do not play a major role in avian H2 virus selection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two geographic, site-specific lineages of avian H2-HAs: North American and Eurasian. Evidence is presented to support interregional transmission of gull H2virus. The human H2-HAs that circulated between 1957 and 1968 form a separate phylogenetic lineage most closely related to the Eurasian avian H2-HAs. In 1988, there was an increased prevalence of H2 influenza virus among wild ducks in North America, which preceded the emergence of H2N2 virus in domestic fowl. As the prevalence of H2N2 avian influenza viruses has increased on turkey farms and live bird markets in New York City and elsewhere, greater numbers of these viruses have come into direct contact with susceptible people. We conclude that antigen-conserved counterparts of the 1957 human Asian pandemic strain continue to circulate in the avian reservoir and come close to susceptible human populations.",,"Schafer, J.

HI antibodies in early plasmas were specific for VE virus and showed no significant cross-reactivity with two other North American alphaviruses, Eastern and Western Encephalitis Viruses. VE virus strains could be distinguished by virus dilution, short incubation HI, but not by plasma dilution neutralization assays using early Hahn antibodies. The discriminations by the HI test were similar in some strains but different in other strains from those described by Young and Johnson with the spiny rat antisera used to establish their VE virus subtype classifications.

Although the involvement of porcine NoVs in disease in swine is unclear, they are genetically and antigenically closely related to human NoVs. Human NoV-like strains have been detected in pigs, raising public health concerns about potential interspecies transmission. Pig SaVs are very diverse and occur in pig populations. Recently, at least three new genogroups of porcine SaVs have been proposed. In this study, we tested 413 pooled fecal samples collected in 2009 from apparently healthy finisher pigs on North Carolina pig farms. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled hybridization assays were performed to detect known porcine NoVs. The overall prevalence of pig NoVs determined using this method was 18.9%. The samples were then tested by RT-PCR targeting the 5= end of the capsid region on genogroup II (GII) NoVs, a group encompassing human NoVs, followed by sequence analysis. All identified NoVs belonged to typical porcine NoV genotypes and no human NoV-like strains were detected in samples from these pigs. Porcine NoV negative specimens (n=335) were then screened using universal calicivirus primers and 17 SaV strains were confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, they clustered with GIII, GVII, and GVIII and with currently unclassified SaVs. According to the analysis of the complete capsid sequences, 7 representative strains harboring GVII, GVIII and GIX.alpha. SaVs.

1857,Molecular characterization and module composition of P22-related Salmonella phage genomes,"Genomes from newly isolated Salmonella phages were analyzed by comparison of their EcoRI restriction patterns and by hybridization. Characteristic hybridization probes from reference phage P22, ES18 and E. coli phage κ were selected. Four probes selected from the lysis region examined the spread of lambdoid lysis genes. Other probes characterized were the replication genes and part of the structural genes. The complex immune region was examined using hybridization and biological assays. The results demonstrated the relatedness of the isolated phage to the P22 branch of lambdoid phage and revealed their modular genome organization consisting of different portions of P22-related sequences.

1858,Genomic features of human bocaviruses,"Human Bocavirus (HBoV) was first discovered in 2005 as the second pathogenic member of the parvovirus family alongside human parvovirus B19. Since then, HBoV has been shown to be very common worldwide, causing systemic infection in young children, often leading to respiratory disease. Three other, presumably enteric, human bocaviruses (HBoV2-4) were identified in stool samples. Parvoviruses are thought to replicate via their genomic terminal hairpin-like structures in a so-called ""rolling hairpin model"". These terminal sequences have recently been partially identified in head-to-tail HBoV PCR amplicons from clinical specimens and are most likely hybrid relics of HBoV's ancestors, namely the bovine parvovirus 1 on the left and the tiny canine virus on the right, shown for the first time in this article. The replication model postulated for HBoV remains questionable, since the occurrence of head-to-tail sequences is not a typical feature of the rolling hairpin replication model. However, such episomes can also be persistent storage forms of the genome.",,"Schildgen, O.;Qiu, J.;Sderlund-Venermo, M.",2012.0,,10.2217/fvl.11.136,0
1859,"First detection of porcine parvovirus 6 in North America by viral metagenomic sequencing of serum from pigs infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus Other viruses (e.g. smallpox, papilloma, parvo, reoviridae)","Background: To date, eight species in four genera of parvoviruses infecting pigs have been described. These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classic porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate tetraparvovirus 3 (including PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus, and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (including PPV4 and PPV5) , ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (including porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 (porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1 and 4- 2). PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first identified in aborted pig fetuses in China in late 2014. It was found that the prevalence of PPV6 in China in fattening pigs from farms with and without evidence of reproductive disorders in pigs is similar. Methods: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in serum from porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv)-positive specimens. Results: Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 2 positive serum samples submitted to government veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR revealed that PPV6 was present in 13.2% of the sera tested. In addition, PPV6 was present in samples from all geographic locations surveyed, including nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum indicates that PPV6 infection is widespread and not localized to any particular tissue type. Alignments of the near-full-length genomes, NS1, and capsid genes identified one of the five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5% identity with the North American strains) as the closest relative of the North American strains. Conclusions: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North America and show that the virus is present in multiple geographic areas in the United States and Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic animals is relatively low. In addition, all PPV6 genomes found in North America are most closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in healthy pigs from the Chinese province of Tianjin in 2014.",,"Schirtzinger, E.

1860,Detection of a novel bovine astrovirus in a cow with encephalitis,"Encephalitis can be caused by multiple infectious agents, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. In many cases, the pathogen cannot be identified because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous system disorders and died within 6 days of the onset of clinical symptoms. Histopathology revealed acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brainstem, and ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necrosis in both the brain and ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and viral infections in cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain sample from the cow was analyzed using a metagenomic approach with next-generation sequencing. Using the RIEMS analysis pipeline, a novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) was identified and the finding was confirmed with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome of the bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), which belongs to the family Astroviridae in the genus Mamastrovirus, is 6478 bp in length. Sequence identities between 71% with a sheep astrovirus and 69% with two recently described bovine astroviruses from the USA and Switzerland were found. The latter have also been linked to cases of encephalitis in cattle. Like these, the new virus described here was also detected in various brain slices using the specific BoAstV RT-qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. While astroviruses have so far been found mainly in connection with gastroenteritis in animals and humans, recently detected astrovirus infections have also been associated with encephalitis.",,"Schlottau, K.;Schulze, C.;Bilk, S.;Hanke, D.;HÃ¶per, D.;Beer, M.;Hoffmann, B.",2016.0,,10.1111/tbed.12493,1
1861,Occurrence of two different bovine hepacivirus clusters in Germany,"In recent years, genetic information of hepaciviruses (Family Flaviviridae), the type species of which is human hepatitis C virus, has been detected in a variety of primates and non-primate vertebrates. Here, samples from 263 German cattle from 22 different farms were examined for the presence of hepacivirus N (syn. bovine hepacivirus; BovHepV). One hundred and eighty-six cattle suffering from non-specific clinical signs such as fever and reduced milk yield and 77 apparently healthy animals were included. A total of 39 cattle (14.8%) tested positive for BovHepV by real-time RT-PCR, but no correlation between clinical symptoms and viral infection could be established. Sequences of the NS3 coding region were generated from 31 of the virus-positive samples and viral sequences of the complete coding region were generated from two samples and compared with other European and African BovHepV sequences. Based on the NS3 genomic region, two distinct German BovHepV clusters were identified that differed by up to 20% at the nucleotide level, with diversity within each cluster reaching up to 10%. Based on the full-length sequences, the newly discovered virus variants group with other German and African viruses in a sister relationship to other primate and other mammalian hepaciviruses, but form distinct clusters within the BovHepV branch. In summary, it can be said that highly different hepaciviruses have been detected in German cattle, which further expand the known phylogenetic diversity of the genus Hepacivirus.",,"Schlottau, K.;Wernike, K.;Forth, L.;Holsteg, M.;HÃ¶per, D.;Beer, M.;Hoffmann, B.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12930,0
1862,Iridescent insect virus type 6 encodes a polypeptide related to the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II,"Cytoplasmic DNA viruses encode a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) that is essential for the transcription of viral genes. The amino acid sequences of known large subunits of DdRPs contain highly conserved regions. Oligonucleotide primers derived from two conserved domains [RQP(T/S)LH and NADFDGDE] were used in PCR experiments to detect the corresponding gene of the genome of insect iridescent virus type 6, also known as Chilo Iridescent Virus (CIV) used. . A specific DNA product of approximately 150 bp could be amplified and used as a hybridization probe against the CIV gene library to identify the corresponding gene. The gene encoding DdRP was identified in EcoRI fragments M (7099 bp) and L (7400 bp) of CIV DNA between map units 0.310 and 0.347 (7990 bp). The DNA nucleotide sequence (3153 bp) of the gene encoding the largest subunit of DdRP (RPO1) was determined. Northern blot hybridization revealed the presence in CIV-infected cells of a 3.4 kb RNA transcript that hybridized to the CIV-DdRP gene. This predicted viral protein consists of 1051 amino acid residues (120K) and showed significantly greater similarity to the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II than to the homologous proteins of vaccinia virus and African swine fever virus. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the putative RPO1 of CIV may have evolved from RNA polymerase II after the divergence of the three types of eukaryotic RNA polymerases. The putative CIV RPO1 lacked the C-terminal domain that is conserved in eukaryotic, eubacterial, and other viral RNA polymerases and was analogous to archaeal RNA polymerases in this respect. It is hypothesized that the equivalent of the C-terminal domain may reside in a different subunit of CIV DdRP encoded by an unidentified viral gene.",,"Schnitzler, P.;Sonntag, K.

1863,Molecular evolution of influenza viruses,"There are two distinct mechanisms by which influenza viruses can evolve: (1) Because the RNA genome of influenza viruses is segmented, new strains can be suddenly produced through reassortment, such as occurs during an antigenic shift, resulting in new pandemic strains. (2) New viruses evolve relatively slowly through stepwise mutation and selection, for example during antigenic or genetic drift. Influenza A viruses have been found in several vertebrate species, where they form reservoirs that do not mix easily. While human influenza A viruses do not spread in birds and vice versa, the species barrier for pigs is relatively low, so pigs could act as ""mixing vessels"" for the creation of new pandemic reassortants in Southeast Asia, where the likelihood of dual infection of pigs is greatest with human and avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic studies showed that about 100 years ago an avian influenza A virus had crossed the species barrier, presumably first to pigs and then to humans, forming the new stable human and classical pig lineages. In 1979 an avian virus reappeared in the northern European pig population and formed another stable pig lineage. The northern European pig isolates from 1979 to about 1985 were genetically extremely unstable. A hypothesis is put forward that a mutator mutation is necessary for the influenza virus to cross the species barrier by providing the new host with enough variants from which to choose the best-fit ones. As long as the mutator mutation is still present, such a virus should be able to cross the species barrier a second time, as it did about 100 years ago. Even if the most recent swine isolates from northern Germany are genetically stable again, we should still monitor whether a northern European swine virus appears in the human population in the near future.",,"Scholtissek, C.",1995.0,,10.1007/bf01728660,0
1864,Analysis of influenza A virus nucleoproteins to evaluate molecular genetic mechanisms leading to new phylogenetic virus lineages,"The nucleoprotein (NP) gene of influenza A viruses is critical for separating two large, individually evolving reservoirs in birds and humans. A phylogenetic analysis of the NP gene revealed that all mammalian influenza viruses descended - directly or indirectly - from an avian ancestor. The sustained introduction of an avian influenza A virus into a mammalian species appears to be a relatively rare event, the last occurring in 1979 when such an avian virus was introduced into pigs in northern Europe, resulting in a new lineage. At least two simultaneous events are required for such a new and stable introduction: (1) the new species must be infected, and (2) a mutation in the polymerase complex must establish a labile variant, which tends to give rise to a large number of different variants, some of which can quickly adapt to the new host (or unusual environments). Since such mutator mutations could only be advantageous in phases of stress, variants with a less error-prone polymerase could arise again after adaptation. Examples of such fluctuations in mutation and evolution rates are discussed in this brief overview.",,"Scholtissek, C.;Ludwig, S.;Fitch, W. M.",1993.0,,,0
1865,Characterization of the full genome of Tupaia (tree shrew) adenovirus,"Members of the family Adenoviridae are widespread among vertebrate host species and usually cause acute but harmless infections. Adenoviruses receive particular attention because of their ability to transform host cells, their potential application in vector technology, and their phylogeny. The primary structure of the genome of the Tupaia adenovirus (TAV) carrying Tupaia spp. (tree shrew) determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically thought to be at the base of the mammalian phylogenetic tree and are widely used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavioral research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp in length with 49.96% G+C content and has 166 bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence led to the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of these are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcriptional and translational signals and sequence and positional conservation. 30 viral OPFs were found to share significant similarities with known adenoviral genes, which are classified into discrete early and late genomic regions known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant CG dinucleotide depletion at the ends of the genome, indicating methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa2, and protein with a molecular weight of 100,000, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV is a separate branch within the family tree of the Mastadenovirus genus.",,"Schondorf, E.;Bahr, U.;Handermann, M.;Darai, G.",2003.0,Apr,,0
1866,"Metagenomic screening for viruses in western Arctic caribou, Alaska, by iterative assembly of taxonomic units","Animal pathogen surveillance does not provide a sufficient level of vigilance as it is generally limited to surveillance of pathogens of known economic importance in domestic animals and virtually absent in wildlife species. Since most (re)emerging viral infections are of animal origin, it is important from a public health perspective to gain insight into the viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir. When monitoring live, free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and the availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows for a more comprehensive inventory of viruses found in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral study of the West Arctic caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nasal swabs from 39 free-ranging caribou was assessed by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that used an extensive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods, we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including various papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus that may represent a member of a new genus in the family Coronaviridae.",,"SchÃ¼rch, A.

1867,Holstein Friesian Lethal Haplotype 5 (HH5) results from a complete deletion of TBF1M and cholesterol deficiency (CDH) from an ERV (LTR) insertion into the APOB coding region,"BACKGROUND: With the availability of massive SNP data for several economically important cattle breeds, haplotype testing has been performed to identify unknown recessive diseases. A number of so-called lethal haplotypes have been discovered in Holstein-Friesian cattle, and causative mutations in candidate genes have been identified in at least seven of them. However, some deadly haplotypes are still elusive. Here we report the molecular genetic causes of lethal haplotype 5 (HH5) and cholesterol deficiency (CDH). Targeted enrichment for the known genomic regions followed by massive parallel sequencing was used to inquire about causative mutations in a case/control approach. METHODS: Targeted enrichment for the known genomic regions followed by massive parallel sequencing was used in a case/control approach. PCRs for the causative mutations were developed and compared to routine attribution in 2,100 (HH5) and 3,100 (CDH) cattle. RESULTS: HH5 is caused by a 138 kbp deletion spanning position 93.233 kb to 93.371 kb on chromosome 9 (BTA9) and harboring only dimethyl adenosine transferase 1 (TFB1M). The deletion breakpoints are flanked by long interspersed bovine nuclear elements Bov-B (upstream) and L1ME3 (downstream), suggesting a homologous recombination/deletion event. TFB1M dimethylates adenine residues in the hairpin loop at the 3' end of mitochondrial 12S rRNA, which is essential for the synthesis and function of the small ribosomal subunit of mitochondria. Homozygous TFB1M-/-mice have been reported to show embryonic lethality with developmental defects. An allele frequency of 2.8% was determined for the German HF population. CDH results from a 1.3 kbp insertion of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV2-1-LTR_BT) into exon 5 of the APOB gene at BTA11:77,959 kb. The insert is flanked by 6 bp duplications of the target site as described for retroviral integrase-mediated insertions. A premature stop codon is created in the APOB open reading frame, which leads to the protein being shortened to a length of just <140 amino acids. Such early shortenings have been shown to cause an inability of chylomicron secretion from intestinal cells, leading to malabsorption of cholesterol. The allelic frequency of this mutation in the German HF population was 6.7%, which is significantly higher than previously reported. Compared to PCR assays, which directly infer the genetic variants, the routine imputing used so far showed a diagnostic sensitivity of only 91% (HH5) and 88% (CDH), with a high specificity for both (> = 99.7 %). CONCLUSION: With the availability of direct genetic testing, it will now be possible to more effectively reduce the carrier frequency and ultimately eliminate the interference from HF populations. Furthermore, the fact that repetitive genomic elements (RE) are involved in both diseases underscores the evolutionary importance of RE, which can be detrimental as here but also beneficial across generations.",,"Schutz, E.;Wehrhahn, C.;Wanjek, M.;Bortfeld, R.;Wemheuer, W.

1868,Animal noroviruses,"Among enteric caliciviruses, noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus, one of the four recognized genera in the family Caliciviridae. These positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses are highly variable, both genetically and antigenically. Several animal enteric caliciviruses that are morphologically indistinguishable and genetically closely related to human noroviruses have been identified. The first bovine enteric noroviruses were described in the UK and are known as Newbury Agent 2. At least three genetic clusters of porcine noroviruses combine within genogroup II noroviruses. Human noroviruses are the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans of all ages. In the US, they are associated with approximately 30-50% of all foodborne outbreaks. So far, noroviruses have not been associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in immunocompetent animals. Neither bovine nor porcine norovirus can replicate in cell culture, although human norovirus can grow in a complex 3D culture system. However, the recently discovered murine noroviruses can replicate in cell culture and are therefore used as model viruses to study human noroviruses. This review focuses on virus classification, virion structure, pathogenesis, epidemiology, immune response, and diagnosis of animal noroviruses compared to human noroviruses. The classification of animal enteric caliciviruses within the genus Norovirus raises the question of whether transmission from an animal reservoir to humans could occur. Answering this question is important to determine the risk of cross-species infections that affect the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses, thus complicating the control of human norovirus infections.",,"Scipioni, A.;Mauroy, A.;VinjÃ©, J.;Thiry, E.",2008.0,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.11.012,0
1869,Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analysis of hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein fusion protein and genes among Newcastle disease virus isolates. Phylogenetic relationships among the Paramyxovirinae based on binding glycoprotein sequences,"Highly virulent isolates of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) are Schedule A pathogens for commercial poultry and reports of their isolation between Member States must be submitted to the Office of International Epizootes (OIE). The virus is classified as a member of the order Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Two interactive surface glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein (HN), play essential roles in NDV attachment and fusion of cells during infection. Antibodies against the F or HN proteins can neutralize viruses; however, full length sequences are not available for these genes from recently obtained virulent isolates. Therefore, nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the F and HN protein genes of 16 NDV isolates representing highly virulent viruses from worldwide sources were obtained for comparison with older virulent isolates and vaccine strains. The amino acid sequence of F protein was relatively conserved among isolates that retained potential glycosylation sites and C residues for disulfide bonds. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the cleavage site in the more virulent isolates, while the low virulence viruses lacked this sequence. However, a Eurasian collared pigeon virus had a K114Q substitution at the F cleavage site that is unique among NDV isolates. The HN protein among the NDV isolates retained predicted catalytic and active site residues necessary for neuraminidase activity and hemagglutination. The length of the HN for the Eurasian collared pigeon isolate and a previously reported heat-resistant virulent isolate were longer compared to other more recent virulent isolates. Phylogenetically, NDV isolates were divided into four groups, with newer virulent isolates forming a diverse branch, while all avian paramyxoviruses formed their own clade distinct from other members of the Paramyxoviridae. © Springer Verlag 2004.",,"Seal, B.

The thermostability of hemagglutinin at 56°C for 5 minutes was consistently observed for the majority of vaccine viruses. An exception was a recently developed NDV vaccine isolated from turkeys which showed a thermostability of 15 minutes. Neuraminidase activity, as measured by the elution rate of agglutinated red blood cells, varied between vaccine viruses and correlated with that of the parent isolate. Virulence, measured by the intracerebral pathogenicity index, ranged from 0 to 0.39 for NDV vaccine-type viruses, well within the range of avirulent lentogens. The sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site of all NDV vaccine isolates examined was consistent with that for Lentogen. The entire hemagglutinin neurominidase gene sequence was 98% similar in all NDV vaccine viruses examined, and the phylogenetic classification of the commercial vaccine types correlated with their parent virus. Consequently, the commercially produced NDV vaccines described here appear to be relatively stable when mass-produced in embryonated avian eggs.",,"Seal, B. S.;King, D. J.;Bennett, J.

1871,The avian response to Newcastle disease virus,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is classified as a member of the superfamily Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus family is divided into two subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. In 1993, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses reorganized the order of the Paramyxovirus genus and placed NDV within the Rubulavirus genus under the Paramyxovirinae. The enveloped virus has a 15,186 kb negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome encoding an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, a hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein, a fusion protein, a matrix protein, a phosphoprotein, and a nucleoprotein in the 5'-to 3' direction encoded. The virus has a wide host range, with most bird species reportedly infected with NDV. Isolates are characterized by virulence in chickens and are divided into three main pathotypes depending on the severity of the disease. Lentogenic isolates are of low virulence, while viruses with intermediate virulence are referred to as mesogenic. Highly virulent viruses that cause high mortality in birds are called neurotropic or viscerotropic velogenic viruses. Velogenic NDVs are Schedule A pathogens that require reporting to the Office of International Epizootics, and outbreaks result in severe trade embargoes. The primary molecular determinant of NDV pathogenicity is the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion protein. Vaccination against NDV is mainly done through mass application of live virus vaccines to commercial poultry. Although protection is measured by the presence of antibodies to NDV, vaccinated B cell-depleted chickens are resistant to disease. Consequently, immune protection involves responses that are currently incompletely defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Seal, B. S.;King, D. J.;Sellers, H.

Subsequently, several APV isolates were obtained from the north-central US. Matrix (M) and fusion protein (F) genes from these isolates were analyzed for sequence heterogeneity and compared to European APV subtypes A and B. Among the US isolates, the M gene shared greater than 98% nucleotide sequence identity, with only one non-synonymous change occurring in a single US isolate. Although the F gene shared 98% nucleotide sequence identity among US APV isolates, nine conserved substitutions were detected in the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the F protein of the US APV isolate had 72% sequence identity with the APV subtype A F protein and 71% sequence identity with the APV subtype B F protein. This is separated by an 83% sequence identity F protein amino acid sequences predicted for APV subtype versus A and B. The US isolates were phylogenetically distinguishable from their European counterparts on the basis of F gene nucleotides or predicted amino acid sequences. The lack of sequence heterogeneity among US APV subtypes indicates that these viruses have maintained a relatively stable population since the initial onset of TRT.

These isolates were characterized as APMV-1 by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using NDV-specific polyclonal antisera. However, the isolates did not react with a monoclonal antibody specific for a variety of APMV-1 isolates. Although only highly virulent isolates require reporting to international regulatory agencies, the ability to correctly identify APMV-1 types is important for control and regulatory purposes. Protein gel patterns of the purified isolates resembled previously reported APMV-1, and anti-NDV polyclonal sera recognized the viral proteins. For three isolates, oligonucleotide primers specific for the NDV nucleoprotein, fusion protein and polymerase genes were used to synthesize cDNA using viral RNA as template. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was then sequenced for the three isolates containing the genes for nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein and a 5 inch stretch of the polymerase gene. The isolates had an F protein cleavage site sequence of ERQER/LVG, indicating low virulence viruses that phylogenetically diverged with other unique NDV isolates, designated the lineage 6 genotype. In addition, a four amino acid insert was detected in the predicted phosphoprotein, which conforms to the ""rule of six"" among paramyxoviruses. These APMV-1 genotypes have not previously been reported in North America and further support the heterogeneous genetic nature of these commercially important pathogens found worldwide. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Seal, B.

1874,Evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses associated with outbreaks in Trinidad,"Bat rabies is an emerging disease of public health concern in America. Livestock outbreaks are a regular occurrence on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. We performed molecular characterization of Trinidad rabies virus (RABV) and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to examine the extent to which outbreaks are the result of in situ evolution versus importing the virus from nearby mainland South America. Trinidadian RABV sequences have been confirmed as a bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related sequences. They fell into two broadly temporally defined lineages designated Trinidad I and II. The Trinidad I lineage, which included sequences from 1997-2000 (all but two of which originated in the northeast of the island), was most closely associated with RABV from Ecuador (2005, 2007), French Guiana (1990), and Venezuela (1993, 1994) related). Trinidad II included sequences from the southwest of the island, grouped into two groups: Trinidad IIa, with one each from 2000 and 2007, and Trinidad IIb, with all sequences from 2010. The Trinidad II sequences were most closely related Related sequences from Brazil (1999, 2004) and Uruguay (2007, 2008). Phylogeographic analyzes support three separate mainland RABV introductions from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage extensions suggest periods of in situ evolution in Trinidad after each introduction. These data also indicate a joint circulation of Trinidad lineages I and IIa in 2000.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in wild pheasants in Scotland, identify the major sequence types (STs) present and assess their public health implications. A total of 287 cecal samples were collected from five Scottish regions during the 2013/2014 hunting season. Campylobacter was detected and enumerated using standard culture methods. PCR and High Throughput Multi Locus Sequence Typing (HiMLST) were used for species identification and sequence typing. Overall, 36.6% of 287 cecal specimens (n==105; 95% CI: 14-59.2) were Campylobacter positive. Using PCR, 62.6% of the samples (n==99) were identified as C. coli and 37.4% as C. jejuni. HiMLST (nâ€¯=â€¯80) identified 19 different STs. ST-828 (nâ€¯=â€¯19) was the most common, followed by ST-827 (nâ€¯=â€¯12) and ST19 (nâ€¯=â€¯7). Sixteen of the 19 isolated STs are present in humans and eight are C. coli STs, accounting for 6.96% of human infections, although the overall public health risk from pheasant meat is still considered low.",,"Seguino, A.;Chintoan-Uta, C.;Smith, S.

1876,"Molecular detection and analysis of Sheeppox and Orf viruses isolated from sheep from Qalubia, Egypt","In this study, an outbreak of sheeppox virus (SPPV) and orf virus (ORFV) in a flock of sheep in Qalubia province, Egypt was investigated. Both SPPV and ORFV caused clinically evident infections in sheep. The affected sheep showed skin lesions around the mouth or all over the body. Therefore, a reliable diagnosis should confirm the etiology of the infection, and then reduce the spread of the diseases in the affected areas. Clinical samples were examined by virus isolation, PCR and real-time PCR assays. In addition, PCR products from SPPV and ORFV isolates were sequenced and compared to reference isolates for phylogenetic analysis. Laboratory diagnosis showed that the real-time PCR assay was more accurate and sensitive than traditional PCR and virus isolation. In the phylogenetic analysis of the A29L gene, no genetic differences were observed between SPPV field strains and the strains showed 100% homology with two SPPV isolates from Kazakhstan and one isolate from Turkey. The ORFV field strains differ genetically in the P55 gene from others and from other published isolates from Egypt in 2006 and 2009.",,"Selim, A.;Elhaig, M.;HÃ¶che, J.;Gaede, W.",2016.0,,,0
1877,Molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated from broiler and layer farms in Egypt in 2012,"One of the main problems of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the frequent emergence of new variants. In the present study, 205 tracheal swabs and organs were collected from broiler and layer farms in 19 governorates across Egypt from January to August 2012. The chickens showed respiratory symptoms and mortality. Of the samples examined, 130 (approx. 64%) of the farms with suspected IBV were positive with real-time RT-PCR. 13 IBV positive specimens were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryos was performed after three consecutive blind passages, and the spike protein 1 (SP1) hypervariable region was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to examine the genetic diversity between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 13 isolates compared to other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide revealed that 11 of the 13 isolates were closely related to the Israeli variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology to 89.9% and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates were closely related to viruses CR/88121 and 4/91 with identities of 95% and 96%, respectively. This study indicates the existence of two variant groups of IBV circulating in Egypt in 2012. Group I was similar but distinguishable from Israeli variant IS/885 and Group II was related to vaccine strains 4/91 and CR/88121. There was no geographical connection between the two groups as they were spread across the country. These findings require a revision of vaccination programs and control measures for IBV. © 2013.",,"Selim, K.;Arafa, A. S.;Hussein, H. A.;El-Sanousi, A. A.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.ijvsm.2013.10.002,0

1879,Frequency and pathologic phenotype of bovine Astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 infection in neurologically diseased cattle: to assess causality,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has opened up the possibility of detecting new viruses in unsolved diseases. Recently, astrovirus brain infections in neurologically diseased humans and animals have been identified by NGS, including bovine astrovirus (BoAstV) CH13/NeuroS1 found in brain tissues of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Studies on neurotrophic astroviruses are few, and a causal relationship between BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 infection and neurological disease has been postulated but remains unproven. Aiming to get one step closer to assessing causality, we collected brain samples from 97 cattle diagnosed with unresolved nonsuppurative encephalitis and analyzed them by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to determine frequency and neuropathological distribution of BoAstV CH13/ NeuroS1 and its topographical correlation to pathology. We detected BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 RNA or proteins in neurons in all parts of the central nervous system (CNS) in 34% of all cases, but none were detected in control cattle. In general, brain lesions correlated strongly with the presence of the virus. These findings demonstrate that a significant proportion of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis are infected with BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 and further support the causal relationship between neurological diseases and Astrovirus infections.",,"Selimovic-Hamza, S.;Boujon, C.

Four bacteriophage cocktails were prepared using 13 bacteriophage and the lytic ability of the four bacteriophage cocktails was tested using Salmonella reference strains and field isolates. Bacteriophage cocktail C (SEP-1, SGP-1, STP-1, SS3eP-1, STP-2, SChP-1, SAP-1, SAP-2; ≥ 109 pfu/mL) showed the best lytic activity against the Salmonella reference strains (100% of 34) and field isolates (92.5% of 107). Fifty mice were then orally inoculated with bacteriophage cocktail C to determine the distribution of bacteriophage in various organs, blood and feces. The effects of bacteriophage on Salmonella infection in weaned pigs (n=15) were also evaluated by experimental challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium after treatment with bacteriophage cocktail C. All mice showed distribution of bacteriophages in all organs, blood and faeces up to 15 days post-treatment infection (dpi). After 35 dpi, no bacteriophage was detected in any of these samples. As shown in a challenge study in pigs, treatment with bacteriophage cocktail C reduced faecal shedding of Salmonella. The metagenomic analyzes of these pig faeces also showed that bacteriophage treatment reduced the number of species of the family Enterobacteriaceae without significantly disturbing the normal faecal flora. This study showed that bacteriophage effectively controlled Salmonella in a pig challenge model and could be a good alternative to antibiotics to control Salmonella infection.",,"Seo, B. J.;Song, E.

1883,Genetic diversity of Newcastle disease virus in Pakistan: A nationwide perspective,"Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the deadliest poultry diseases worldwide. The disease is endemic in Pakistan and recurrent outbreaks in captive, rural and commercial poultry flocks are regularly reported. Although efforts have been made in some parts of the country to characterize the pathogen, the genetic nature of strains circulating across Pakistan is currently lacking. Material and methods. To determine the genetics of NDV, 452 blood samples were collected from 113 herds originating from all provinces of Pakistan and showing high mortality (30-80%). The samples represented domestic poultry (broilers, layers and farm fowl) as well as captive wild birds (pigeons, turkeys, pheasants and peacocks). Samples were screened for both matrix and fusion genes (1792 bp) using real-time PCR, positive samples underwent full-length fusion gene amplification followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion protein revealed the presence of the motif (112RK/RQRRâ†“F117) typical of velogenetic NDV strains. The phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the fusion gene showed that all isolates belong to lineage 5 of NDV except the isolates collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. Higher resolution phylogenetic analysis of lineage 5 revealed the distribution of Pakistani NDV strains to 5b. However, the isolates from KPK belonged to lineage 4c; the first report of such a lineage from that province. Conclusions: Taken together, the data demonstrated the prevalence of multiple lineages of NDV in different poultry populations, including captive birds. Such an understanding is crucial to underpin the nature of circulating NDV strains, their potential for transmission between species, and disease diagnosis and control strategies. © 2013 Shabbir et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Shabbir, M.

Infections with both autonomous and helper virus-dependent parvoviruses are common in both human and animal populations, and many animals harbor a number of different parvovirus species. Despite the epidemiological importance of parvoviruses, the presence and role of genome recombination within or between parvoviral species has not been well characterized. Here we show that natural recombination can be widespread in these viruses. Distinct genome regions of both porcine parvoviruses and Aleutian mink disease viruses have conflicting phylogenetic histories, providing evidence for recombination within each of these two species. Furthermore, the rodent parvoviruses show complex evolutionary histories for distinct genomic regions, suggesting recombination at the interspecies level. © 2007 SGM.",,"Shackelton, L.

Forty-five isolates forming five sequence clusters were unclassifiable by the present classification. Pairwise DNA distance analysis revealed different categories of relatedness, necessitating a new classification system. We propose four major sequence groups AD that differ by 25-37%. Groups A and B are further divided into subtypes that differ by 15-27%. Group D and four of the seven subtypes of group A, A3, A4, A5 and A7, are formed by new Swiss isolates. Molecular epidemiology revealed that Swiss B1 strains differed no more from French, Brazilian or US strains than from each other, suggesting a spread of the virus through the international livestock trade. In addition, infection of goats by subtypes A3 or A4 was significantly associated with documented contact with sheep also harboring these subtypes, suggesting regular sheep-to-goat transmission. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The same viral pathogens have also been detected in healthy herds, calling into question their role in health and disease. To better understand eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on evaluating alternative methods for purifying and concentrating viral particles that do not use density gradients to generate viral metagenome data. In this study, the sequence results of three tissue processing methods were evaluated and a data analysis pipeline for RNA viruses from the gastrointestinal tract was established. In addition, using best method and increased sequencing depth, insight into the viral RNA community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week-old turkey is provided. Viruses of the families Reoviridae and Astroviridae together accounted for 76.3% of all identified viruses. The species-level dilution curve further showed that most of the species diversity was contained in the increased sequencing depth, suggesting that viruses from other virus families were present at very low abundance.",,"Shah, J.

Intestinal tissue samples were harvested from breeders and their progeny, processed for viral RNA extraction, and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq sequencing technology, resulting in 100 bp PE reads. The results of this study showed that the brood source affected the RNA virus community only at hatch, but the later environment, i.e. bird age, had the more significant effect.

1888,Analysis of host-parasite mismatch in papillomavirus evolution using importance sampling,"The papillomaviruses (PVs) are a family of viruses that infect several mammalian and non-mammalian species that cause cervical cancer in humans. The evolutionary history of PVs, as they are associated with a variety of host species, is not well understood. Incongruences between the phylogenetic trees of different viral genes and between these genes and host phylogenies indicate historical viral recombination and violations of strict virus-host cospeciation. However, the extent of recombination events between PVs is uncertain, and there is little evidence to support a theory of PV spread via recent host transmissions. We have examined the incongruence between PV genes and thus the possibility of recombination using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We find significant evidence of phylogenetic incongruence between the six PV genes E1, E2, E6, E7, L1 and L2, indicating significant recombination. Analysis of E1 and L1 phylogenies suggests ancestral recombination events. We also describe a new method to study alternative host-parasite association mechanisms by applying importance sampling to Bayesian divergence time estimation. This new approach is not constrained by a fixed viral tree topology or knowledge of viral divergence times, it can contain multiple parasite taxa per host, and it can distinguish between prior divergence of virus before host speciation and host transmission of virus after speciation will. Using this method, we find prior divergence of PV lineages associated with the ancestral mammalian host, resulting in at least 6 PV lineages prior to speciation of that host. These PV lineages have then followed paths of earlier divergence and cospecification to eventually be associated with the host species present. Only one significant case of host transmission is supported, transmission of the ancestral L1 gene between a primate and a hystricognathic host, based on the divergence times between the Ypsilon human type 41 and porcupine PVs.",,"Shah, S.

1889,The faecal virome of pigs on a high-density farm,"Pigs are an important source of protein worldwide, but are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections that can infect humans. Modern housing conditions can also increase virus transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the faeces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheal piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrhea pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families Circoviridae and Parvoviridae. Identified porcine RNA viruses, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuvirus, astrovirus, enterovirus, sapovirus, sapelovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, and testovirus. The nearly complete genomes of several new species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses have been generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Several small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins as well as two highly divergent members of the Picornavirales order have also been characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from porcine protozoa and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased study of viruses in the faeces of intensively reared animals revealed frequent coinfections with a very diverse group of viruses that provide favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral studies of animals can easily document the circulation of known and emerging viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and the prospective assessment of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Shan, T.;Li, L.;Simmonds, P.;Wang, C.;Moeser, A.;Delwart, E.",2011.0,,10.1128/jvi.05217-11,1

1891,A naturally occurring recombinant enterovirus expresses a torovirus deubiquitinase,"Enteroviruses (EVs) are implicated in a variety of human and animal diseases. In this study, a novel enterovirus (Enterovirus species G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic specimen of neonatal swine diarrhea and identified using metagenomics and full genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypical EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Notably, a 582 nucleotide long insertion flanked by 3Cpro cleavage sites at the 5= and 3= ends was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome. This insertion encodes a predicted protease with 54-68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and catalytic site characteristic of minimal PLP catalytic domains. This structure is similar to that of the catalytic core domains of foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15]-removing) enzymes on host cell substrates . Importantly, the ToV-PLP recombinant protein derived from this novel enterovirus also showed potent deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and demonstrated the ability to repress IFN-β expression. Using reverse genetics, we have generated a recombinant ToV-PLP knockout virus. Compared to the wild-type virus, the ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immune system genes in infected cells. These results suggest that ToV-PLP functions as an antagonist of the innate immune system; Enterovirus G can therefore gain fitness by acquiring ToV-PLP from a recombination event.",,"Shang, P.;Misra, S.;Hause, B.;Fang, Y.",2017.0,,10.1128/jvi.00450-17,0

Northwest China has a sparse pig population and comprehensive information on PRRSV infection is not currently available. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and genetic diversity of PRRSV from this region. 322 field-isolated tissue or serum samples were collected from aborted pig fetuses or pigs with respiratory disease from 15 herds twice over a 2-year period. PRRSV infection was determined and virus strains were classified by GP5 sequencing. We found that 35.9% of the animals were PRRSV positive and the mean prevalence in 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 was 46.5 and 29.3%, respectively. To further investigate the genetic divergence of PRRSV samples collected from 2007 to 2010, 32 strains were isolated for GP5 sequencing and analysis, and phylogenetic trees were constructed based on GP5 amino acid sequences. All PRRSVs were of the North American genotype and belonged to the highly pathogenic HP PRRSV subgenotype. Isolates from Xinjiang Province formed a densely clustered branch and were closely related to an evolutionary intermediate subgroup isolate. Virus sequences from 2007 to 2008 were compared to those from 2009 to 2010 from the same flock. New mutations were found in isolates after 2009 and focused on nucleotides in the GP5 antibody decoy epitope.

1893,Origin of the H9N2 bird flu in Bangladesh,"The H9N2 avian influenza subtype is endemic to many bird species in Asia and the Middle East and has contributed to the emergence of H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8, which pose potential pandemic threats. H9N2 viruses that have spread to Bangladesh acquired several gene segments from highly pathogenic (HP) H7N3 viruses thought to reside in Pakistan and currently cocirculating with HP H5N1. However, the source and geographic origin of these H9N2 viruses are not clear. We characterized the complete genetic sequences of 37 Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses isolated between 2011 and 2013 and examined their inter- and intra-subtypical genetic differences by tracing their genesis in relation to other H9N2 viruses isolated from neighboring countries. H9N2 viruses in Bangladesh are homogeneous with multiple mammalian host-specific markers and represent a novel H9N2 sublineage in which the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from an Iranian H9N2 lineage (Mideast-B Iran), the neuraminidase (NA) and Polymerase Basic 2 (PB2) genes are derived from Dubai H9N2 (Mideast-C Dubai), and the genes for nonstructural protein (NS), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (MP), acidic polymerase (PA), and basic polymerase 1 (PB1) are from HP H7N3 originating in Pakistan. Different H9N2 genotypes were detected in Bangladesh, which were replaced by other reassortants in 2006 and 2009. Phylogenetic and molecular analyzes indicate that the current genotype derives from the prototypical H9N2 (G1) lineage that circulated in poultry in China in the late 1990s and entered Bangladesh via the Middle East poultry trade, and that this genotype subsequently coexisted with H7N3 was rearranged and H9N2 lines spread from Pakistan and across India.

1895,Molecular epidemiology and full genome characterization of the H1N1pdm virus from India,"Background: The influenza A virus is one of the most important uncontrolled pathogens in the world, causing both seasonal epidemics and global pandemics. This was evidenced by the recent emergence and continued spread of the H1N1 influenza A virus of porcine origin in 2009, which triggered the first real pandemic in the last 40 years. During its evolution, the virus acquired many mutations, and several unidentified molecular determinants are likely responsible for the 2009 H1N1 virus' ability to cause increased disease severity in humans. The availability of limited full-genome data hampers continuous monitoring of these types of events. Outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality have been reported from all parts of the country. Methods/Results: Considering a large number of clinical cases of infection, a complete genome-based sequence characterization of Indian H1N1pdm virus and its phylogenetic analysis in relation to globally circulating viruses was performed to reveal the phylodynamic pattern of H1N1pdm virus in India from 2009-2011. Clade VII has been observed as an important circulating clade in phylogenetic analysis. Selection pressure analysis revealed 18 positively selected sites in the major surface proteins of the H1N1pdm virus. Conclusions: This study has clearly demonstrated that clade VII has been identified as a recently circulating clade both in India and worldwide. Few well-identified markers specific for clade VII were positively selected during virus evolution. Continuous surveillance of the H1N1pdm virus is in place to follow virus evolution and further transmission.

The duration of occurrence of a positive reaction was maximal for subgroup A virus, followed by subgroup D and minimal for subgroup C virus.",,"Sharma, S. N.",1999.0,,,0
1898,Comparative metagenomics of microbial traits within oceanic virus communities,"Viral genomes often contain genes recently acquired from microbes. In some cases (e.g. psbA) the proteins encoded by these genes have been shown to be important for viral replication. In this study, using a unique search strategy for the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomes in combination with datasets based on pyrosequencing of marine viromes and microbiomes, we characterize previously undiscovered microbial metabolic abilities hidden in the genomes of uncultured marine virus communities. A total of 34 microbial gene families were identified on 452 viral GOS scaffolds. The majority of the metabolic helper genes found on these scaffolds have never been described in phage. Host genes detected in viruses have been mainly subdivided into genes encoding different energy pathways such as: B. electron transport and newly identified genes of the photosystem, or translation and post-translation mechanisms. Our results suggest previously undiscovered pathways by which marine phages adapt to their hosts and improve their fitness, including translational and posttranslational level control over the host rather than the already known transcriptional level control.

1899,High prevalence and diversity of bovine astroviruses in the faeces of healthy and diarrhea calves in south-west Scotland,"Astroviruses (AstV) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and are a major cause of infant diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in calves; Therefore, we investigated whether the presence of AstV is associated with calf diarrhea. We identified distinct AstV lineages from faecal samples from both healthy and diarrhea calves and healthy adult cattle in south-west Scotland. AstV was common in calves (present in 74% (85/115) of samples) but uncommon in adult cattle (present in 15% (3/20) of samples). No association was found between the presence of AstV and calf diarrhea or the presence of a specific AstV lineage and calf diarrhea. AstV was strongly associated with the presence of group A rotavirus (RVA), and a protective effect of age was evident for both AstV and RVA. Coinfections with multiple AstV lines were detected in several calves, and serial infections with different viruses could also be detected by longitudinal sampling of individuals. In summary, our study found genotypically diverse AstV in the faeces of calves in south-west Scotland. However, no association was found between AstV and calf diarrhea, suggesting that the virus does not play a primary role in the etiology of calf diarrhea in the studied group. (C) 2015 The Authors.

1900,The rapidly fermentable substance modulates the interactions between rumen commensals and toll-like receptors to promote immune tolerance of the goat rumen,"Whether dietary non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC), a rapidly fermentable substance, affects rumen immune homeostasis by modulating the interactions of rumen microbiota and epithelial toll-like receptors (TLRs) remains unclear. A combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCRs was applied to investigate the synergistic responses of rumen microbiota and epithelial TLRs to the 15-31% dietary NFC switch in the goat model. The results showed that the 31 percent NFC diet caused the radical increase in the richness and diversity of the rumen microbiota. The phylum Verrucomicrobia was most significantly expanded, while opportunistic pathogens, namely Rikenella, Anaeroplasma and Olsenella, were significantly reduced. In the ruminal epithelium, the markedly increased expressions of TLR1,6,10 were associated with the markedly decreased expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The limited correlation analysis showed that the increased abundance of commensal bacteria in Verrucomicrobia subdivision 5 contributed to the upregulation of TLR10 expression. Finally, the significantly increased levels of rumen short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) associated with the significantly upregulated expression of epithelial genes related to SCFA absorption were observed in goats fed the 31% NFC diet. Thus, NFC-induced expansion of the rumen microbiota promoted epithelial tolerance by enhancing the intensity of TLR10 signaling. The newly established equilibrium promotes the transport of rumen energy substances into the blood.",,"Shen, H.;Lu, Z.;Chen, Z.;Wu, Y.;Shen, Z.",2016.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01812,0

In this study, we characterized a DTMUV strain (named GD2014) isolated from an egg-producing sniper duck farm in Guangdong Province, southern China. The virus was pathogenic to Muscovy duck embryos and caused a sharp decline in egg production in laying Muscovy ducks. The genome sequence of GD2014 shared 97-99% homologies with other Tembusuviruses derived from aquatic birds and 89% identities with the MM1775 strain isolated from mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire open reading frame (ORF), E gene and NS5 gene showed that GD2014 belonged to the Ntaya clade. These results have implications for understanding the origin, development and pathogenicity of DTMUV and for developing vaccines and diagnostics based on epidemiological data.",,"Shen, H. Q.;Lin, W.

1903,Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin gene of chicken H9N2 influenza virus in southern China from 2012 to 2013,"As part of our ongoing influenza surveillance program in southern China, 19 field strains of H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from dead or diseased chicken flocks in Guangdong Province, southern China, between 2012 and 2013. Hemagglutinin (HA) genes from these strains were sequenced and analyzed, and phylogenetic analysis showed that 12 of the 19 isolates belonged to lineage h9.4.2.5, while the other seven belonged to h9.4.2.6. In particular, we found that all viruses isolated in 2013 belonged to the h9.4.2.5 lineage. Line h9.4.2.5 viruses contained a PSRSSR®-GLF motif at the HA cleavage site, while line h9.4.2.6 viruses contained a PARSSR®-GLF at the same position. Most isolates in lineage h9.4.2.5 lost a potential glycosylation site at residues 200-202 and had an additional one at residues 295-297 in HA1. Notably, 19 isolates had an amino acid change (Q226L) in the receptor binding site, indicating that the viruses had potential affinity for binding to human-like receptors. The present study demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring of new H9N2 strains to better prepare for the next epidemic or pandemic outbreak of H9N2-AIV infection in chicken flocks.",,"Shen, H.

1904,Genomic and evolutionary characterization of a novel porcine influenza C-like virus,"We recently described the isolation of a novel influenza virus distantly related to human influenza C virus from swine with respiratory disease in the United States. Based on genetic, biochemical and morphological analyses, the virus has been tentatively classified as C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). To better understand the genetics and evolution of this novel pathogen, we performed a comprehensive analysis of its sequence and phylogeny. Results showed that C/OK and human influenza C viruses share a conserved set of predicted functional domains in the replication of the viral RNA genome and viral entry machinery, but differ at important functional sites. Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis showed that homologous genes of C/OK and human influenza C viruses diverged from each other estimated several hundred to several thousand years ago. Taken together, the results described in this study support and extend our previous observations that C/OK is a genetically and evolutionarily distinct influenza virus in the Orthomyxoviridae family. © 2013 Springer Verlag Vienna.",,"Sheng, Z.;Ran, Z.;Wang, D.;Hoppe, A.

1905,A metagenomic study of viral abundance and diversity in mosquitoes from Hubei Province,"Mosquitoes, as one of the most common but important vectors, have the potential to transmit or acquire many viruses through bites, however, the viral flora in mosquitoes and their impact on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases have not been well studied and evaluated. In this study, the metagenomic technique was successfully used to analyze the abundance and diversity of the viral community in three mosquito samples from Hubei, China. Among the 92,304 reads generated by a run on the 454 GS FLX System, 39% have high similarities to viral sequences associated with identified bacterial, fungal, animal, plant, and insect viruses, and 0, 02% were assigned to unidentified viral sequences, showing high abundance and diversity of viruses in mosquitoes. In addition, two new viruses in the Densovirinae subfamily and the Dicistroviridae family have been identified, and six torque tenosus viruses1 in the Anelloviridae family, three porcine parvoviruses in the Parvovirinae subfamily, and one Culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus in the Rhabdoviridae family have been preliminarily characterized.

1906,Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of a porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus strain isolated in China,"Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae that invades the central nervous system (CNS) via the peripheral nervous system and causes encephalomyelitis, or vomiting and wasting (VWD) in suckling piglets. Although only a few complete nucleotide sequences of PHEV have been reported so far, they are not annotated. This study aimed to elucidate the genomic characterization, phylogeny and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The total length of the genome of strain PHEV/2008 was 30,684 bp with a G+C content of 37.27%. The genome contained at least 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5″ and 3″ untranslated regions (UTRs) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which were 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, respectively, were predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases. Phylogenetic analysis based on full genome sequence revealed that strain PHEV/2008 was genetically distinct from other known PHEV types representing a novel genotype (GI-1). In addition, we found that PHEV/2008 was neurotrophic and highly pathogenic in 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Taken together, this is the first detailed annotated full genome sequence of a new genotype PHEV strain in China.",,"Shi, J.;Zhao, K.;Lu, H.;Li, Z.;Lv, X.;Lan, Y.;Guan, J.;He, W.;Gao, F.",2018.0,,10.1007/s11262-018-1591-y,0
1907,Molecular Epidemiology of PRRSV: A Phylogenetic Perspective,"Since it was first detected two decades ago, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) has been the subject of intense research due to its tremendous impact on the global swine industry. Thanks to the phylogenetic analyses, much has been learned about the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the virus. In this review, we focused on the evolutionary and epidemiological aspects of PRRSV from a phylogenetic perspective. We first described the diversity and transmission dynamics of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV, respectively. Then we focused on the older evolutionary history of PRRSV: the time of appearance of all existing PRRSV and an origin hypothesis were discussed. Finally, we summarized the results of previous recombination studies to assess the potential impact of recombination on viral epidemiology. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Shi, M.;Lam, T. T. Y.;Hon, C.

1908,Origin and molecular characterization of the human-infecting H6N1 influenza virus in Taiwan,"In June 2013, the first human influenza H6N1 infection was confirmed in Taiwan. However, the origin and molecular characterization of this virus, A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1), has not been well studied. In the present report we have performed phylogenetic and coalescence analyzes of this virus and compared its molecular profile/properties to other closely related strains. Molecular characterization of H6N1 revealed that it is a typical avian influenza virus with low pathogenicity that may not replicate and spread well in the mammalian upper respiratory tract. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus with A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013 (H6N1) accumulates in seven genes other than PB1. For the PB1 gene, A/Taiwan/2/2013 was clustered with a different H6N1 lineage than A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013. Although a previous study indicated that the PB2, PA, and M genes of A/Taiwan/2/2013 could have originated from the H5N2 viruses, coalescence analyzes indicated that these H5N2 viruses originated from newer strains than the ancestor of A /Taiwan/2/2013. Therefore, we propose that A/Taiwan/2/2013 is a reassortant from different H6N1 lines circulating in chickens in Taiwan. Furthermore, compared to avian isolates, a single P186L substitution (H3 numbering) in hemagglutinin H6 of the human isolate could increase the mammalian receptor binding and thus the pathogenicity of this strain in humans. Overall, human infection with this virus appears to be a random event and an influenza pandemic is unlikely to occur. However, its co-circulation and potential reassortment with other influenza subtypes still deserve attention. © 2013 Hochschulverlag and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Shi, W.;Shi, Y.;Wu, Y.;Liu, D.;Gao, G.

These H7N9 virus isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those prevalent in China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9-HPAIV isolate differed slightly from that of the H7N9-LPAIV and older H7 strains. These AIV-contaminated meat products, which are repeatedly imported into Japan, result in increased risks to poultry and public health. Continuous border disease control based on detection and culling of infected poultry and meat products is therefore essential to prevent the introduction and spread of AIV.",,"Shibata, A.;Okamatsu, M.;Sumiyoshi, R.;Matsuno, K.;Wang, Z.

In many cases, however, most of the detected sequences originate from the host genome and the bacterial flora in the gut. To improve the efficiency of detecting double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses from samples, we evaluated the applicability of S1 nuclease to deep sequencing here. Treatment of total RNA with S1 nuclease resulted in 1.5- to 28.4- and 10.1- to 208.9-fold increases in group A rotavirus sequence reads in fecal and viral culture samples, respectively. In addition, increasing coverage of assignment to reference sequences allowed sufficient genotyping using analysis software.

Sequences of 890 nts of nucleoprotein (N) genes from these isolates were analyzed and compared to those of other previously characterized Brazilian isolates. Phylogenetic analysis identified three RV genetic lineages coexisting in this region. Each lineage has been found to be associated with a specific host species and circulate independently. The first lineage was found in foxes (Dusicyon sp.) and could be distinguished from native carnivore isolates from Sao Paulo, Goias and Minas Gerais in southern and central Brazil. The second lineage was associated with insectivorous bats (Molossus spp.) and differed from RV isolates associated with vampire bats. The third lineage was found in livestock and clustered with vampire bat-associated RV isolates from Sao Paulo, Tocantins, Goias, and Matto Grosso. These results indicate that RV of these genetic lineages co-circulate in Paraiba state and that livestock in this region are infected with vampire bat-associated RV, suggesting that vampire bat is the main reservoir of livestock rabies in this region.",,"Shoji, Y.;Kobayashi, Y.;Sato, G.;Gomes, A.

1912,Evidence for interspecies transmission and resorting of influenza A virus in swine in southern China,"The Asia/57, Hong Kong/68 and Russia/77 pandemics of this century occurred or reappeared in China. Interspecies transmission and genetic rearrangement of influenza viruses have been implicated in the origin of these human pandemic influenza viruses. It has been suggested that pigs are the 'mixing vessel' in which the rearrangement takes place. To investigate this possibility, 104 swine influenza viruses randomly collected from southern China between 1976 and 1982, including 32 H3N2 isolates and 72 H1N1 isolates, were examined using dot blot hybridization, partial sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. There were 29 of 32 H3N2 isolates that were traits of originally human viruses; the other 3 isolates were reassortants containing genes from swine and human influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of polymerase B1 (PB1) genes showed that pigs in southern China have undergone multiple human-pig interspecies transmission. All 72 H1N1 isolates were of porcine origin, characteristic of the classic swine H1N1 influenza virus. Analysis of 624 swine flu genes from southern China found no evidence of avian flu genes.

Although molecular and seroepidemiological studies of HEV have been conducted in many provinces in China, the epidemiological data from Yunnan province are limited and the genotypes are not fully characterized. This study evaluated the prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) detected in pigs from Yunnan Province, China. Results: A total of 13 of 187 pig fecal samples collected in 2011 showed HEV positive results; Likewise, 7 out of 69 samples collected in 2012 showed positive results. These findings indicated an overall prevalence of 7.8% (20/256). The results of the phylogenetic and molecular evolution analysis showed that nine strains were found in the samples obtained in 2011, in which 87.1% to 99.4% of the nucleotide sequence identity was shared between these strains; and 77.0% to 81.9%, 52.2% to 53.6%, 77.0% to 88.2%, and 77.9% to 96.8% nucleotide sequence identities were shared with strains expressing genotypes 1 , 2, 3 and 4 represented. Five strains were detected in the samples obtained in 2012, in which 94.2% to 99.3% nucleotide sequence identity was shared between the strains and 81.0% to 82.5%, 81.8% to 83.2%, 81.0% to 92.7% and 81.0% to 97.8% nucleotide sequence identities were shared with strains representing genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Conclusions: Analysis of fourteen recognized HEV strains revealed that three of them were subtype 4d, two subtype 4b; the nine remaining strains isolated were subtype 4h. These results indicated that the prevalence of HEV in the Yunnan pig herds was quite high, additional public health concerns should focus on the safety of pork.",,"Shu, X.;Duan, X.;Song, C.;Li, J.;Jiang, L.;Yin, G.;Li, W.",2014.0,,10.1186/1743-422x-11-162,0
1914,Molecular detection and characterization of West Nile virus associated with multifocal retinitis in patients from southern India,"Background: In late 2009/early 2010, a mysterious virus outbreak in a southern district of Tamil Nadu affected around 2000 people; This particularly affected those who lived in coastal areas. Blood samples from affected patients were sent for clinical analysis to determine the actual cause of the disease, but reports were inconclusive. Methods: The present study describes the clinical observations and laboratory investigations using molecular methods, which were carried out on 170 of the 2000 suspected clinical cases. These were patients admitted to Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu with ocular complications. Conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification assays (RT-LAMP) were used to detect West Nile virus (WNV) infection . A further study of the genetic diversity of WNV involved in ocular complications was performed by sequence phylogeny. Results: Of 170 specimens, 25 (15%) were positive for chikungunya IgM antibody, 10 (6%) for chikungunya antigen and 30 (18%) were positive for dengue IgM antibody. The remaining 105 seronegative samples were processed for WNV detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Of the 105 samples, 35 (33%) were positive for WNV IgM antibodies, 15 (14%) were positive for WNV by RT-PCR, and 27 (26%) were positive for WNV by both real-time RT-PCR and RT -LAMP assays. Comparative analysis with acute-phase patient serum samples revealed 100% agreement between the real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. Overall, these assays had higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR because they detected 12 additional samples with a low copy number of template. Further genotyping by sequence phylogeny revealed that all WNV isolates were clustered in lineage I.

1916,Evolution of a bovine cytoplasmic tripartite motif protein (TRIM) that limits retroviral infection,"Primate tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α) proteins confer innate intracellular resistance to retroviruses. In humans, TRIM5 is in a paralogous cluster that includes TRIM6, TRIM34, and TRIM22. Although TRIM6 and TRIM34 orthologues are found in other mammals, TRIM5 has only been identified in primates to date. Cow cells show early blocks to infection by multiple retroviruses. We identify a cytoplasmic TRIM protein encoded by LOC505265 that is responsible for limiting infection by several lentiviruses and N-tropic murine leukemia virus in bovine cells. The susceptibility of N-tropic murine leukemia virus to 505265-mediated restriction is primarily determined by residue 110 of the viral capsid protein. Phylogenetically, cow LOC505265 segregates with the TRIM5/TRIM6/TRIM34 group but is not an ortholog of known TRIM genes. The B30.2/SPRY domain of 505265 has long variable regions, a feature of the proteins encoded by this paralogous group, and shows evidence of positive selection. Apparently, cows independently evolved a retroviral restriction factor from the same TRIM family that gave birth to TRIMS in primates. Certain features of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may promote convergent evolution of virus limiting factors. © 2006 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Si, Z.;Vandegraaff, N.;O'Huigin, C.;Song, B.;Yuan, W.;Xu, C.;Perron, M.;Li, X.;Marasco, W.

1918,Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated during the 2006-2008 outbreaks in Pakistan reveal genetic diversity,"Background: Since the first outbreak recorded in early 2006 in northern areas of Pakistan, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have been isolated from commercial poultry and wild/domestic birds from various areas of Pakistan up to July 2008. Various isolates of H5N1 have been sequenced to study the genetic diversity of these viruses. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed close clustering and highest sequence identity in all 8 genes to HPAI H5N1 isolates belonging to the uniform H5 clade 2.2, sublineage EMA-3, recovered from Afghanistan in the same period. Two subgroups within the Pakistani domestic and wild bird H5N1 viruses have been observed based on their sequence homology and mutations. HPAI motif, preferential receptor specificity for α-(2,3)-binding, potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and an additional glycosylation site at the globular head of the HA protein from four Pakistani H5N1 isolates. While the amino acids associated with susceptibility to various antiviral drugs (oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine) were found conserved in the Pakistani H5N1 isolates. Strikingly, some important mutations were observed at critical positions of antigenic sites (S141P, D155S, R162I & P181S) and at the receptor binding pocket (A185T, R189K & S217P) of HA-1. A high sequence similarity between the Pakistani viruses HP H5N1 and LP H9N2 was also observed. Avian-like host-specific markers with the exception of E627K in PB2, K356R in PA, V33I in NP, I28V in M2, and L107F in NS2 proteins were also observed. Conclusions: Different point mutations in different genes of H5 viruses from Pakistan were observed during field spread. The outbreaks started in 2006 in Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa province (Northwest) and spread to southern regions over time. Although migratory birds may play a role in the continued endemicity of 2.2 H5N1 virus in Pakistan in 2006-2008, the possibility of their transmission through legal or illegal poultry trade across borders cannot be ignored. © 2012 Siddique et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Siddique, N.;Naeem, K.;Abbas, M.

1919,Isolation and sequence analysis of reassortant low pathogenic avian influenza virus H4N6 from ducks and chickens in live bird markets from Pakistan,"Live bird (LBM) markets may serve as a major source of AIV infection. During routine avian influenza surveillance in Pakistan, the low pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtype H4N6 was first isolated from Khaki Campbell's duck (Anal platyrhynchos) in 2010 and from broilers in 2011 at the live bird markets (LBMs) of the port city of Karachi in Sindh province . Whole genome sequencing revealed the introduction of a new reassortant Eurasian avian virus strain. Phylogenetically, HA, NA, M, NP, and PB2 genes clustered primarily with Russian strains of influenza viruses, and the PA gene with AI isolates from the Netherlands, while NS and PB1 genes with a Pakistani isolate of H3N1 were grouped. Sequence analysis revealed an LP amino acid motif (PEKASR), avian-like receptors, conservation of amino acids at the receptor binding sites and the amino acids known to be associated with antiviral drug susceptibility, loss of the glycosylation site in the NA gene and attainment of unique PDZ domain motif (ESEI) at the C-terminus of the NS gene. Seroconversion to the H4N6 subtype was mainly observed in the bird populations of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa provinces. The isolation revealed the role of LBM, where interbreeding of different bird species provides an excellent environment for the spread and potential rearrangement of AIV. Furthermore, various point mutations in these H4N6 isolates and the close relationship to Pakistani H3N1 and other Eurasian strains also reflect the prevailing diversity among the AIVs circulating in the local LBMs. (C)2016 PVJ.

1920,Characterization and classification of viral particles associated with hepatitis A. II. Nature and configuration of the nucleic acid,"Virus particles that bound at 1.34 g/ml in CsCl and sedimented in sucrose gradients at 160 S were isolated from stool samples from patients suffering from hepatitis. In the presence of 4M urea and approximately 90% formamide, these particles released linear nucleic acid molecules with the kinked appearance characteristic of single-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. They could be distinguished from the lambda phage nucleic acid added to the preparation as a marker for the double-stranded configuration. Experiments in which the virus particles to be examined were incubated at pH 12.9 and 50 degrees C for 30 min showed that their nucleic acid molecules were hydrolyzed just as easily as the RNA genome of the poliovirus type 2 analyzed in parallel. Both the single-stranded DNA of the phage However, both phiX174 and parvovirus LuIII were found to be unaffected by this treatment, and the double-stranded DNA of phage lambda was denatured to single-stranded molecules. From this it was concluded that the human hepatitis A virus contains a linear genome of single-stranded RNA and must be assigned to the picornaviruses.",,"Siegl, G.;Frosner, G. G.",1978.0,Apr,,0

1922,Distinguishing human Wa-like rotavirus versus porcine rotavirus genotype 1 genes and proteins,"Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are 11-segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses and important causes of gastroenteritis in young animals of many animal species. Previous studies have suggested that human Wa-like RVAs share a close evolutionary relationship with porcine RVAs. In particular, the genes VP1-VP3 and NSP2-5/6 of these viruses are usually classified as genotype 1 with >. 81% nucleotide sequence identity. However, it remains unknown whether the genotype 1 genes and proteins of human Wa-like strains are distinguishable from those of porcine strains. To investigate this, we performed extensive bioinformatic analyzes using all known genotype 1 gene sequences. The RVAs analyzed represent wild-type strains isolated from humans or pigs in various geographic locations in 2004-2013, including 11 newly sequenced porcine RVAs from Brazil. We also analyzed archival strains isolated in 1977-1992 and atypical strains involved in human-pig transmission. We found that, in general, the genotype 1 genes of typical modern human Wa-like RVAs were clustered together in phylogenetic trees and separate from those of typical modern porcine RVAs. The only exception was the NSP5/6 gene, which showed no host-specific phylogenetic clustering. Using amino acid sequence alignments, we identified 34 positions that differentiated the VP1-VP3, NSP2, and NSP3 genotype 1 proteins of typical modern human Wa-like RVAs from typical modern porcine RVAs and documented how these positions translate into vary with the archived/unusual isolates. No host specific amino acid positions have been identified for NSP4, NSP5 or NSP6. Overall, the results of this study support the notion that human Wa-like RVAs and porcine RVAs are evolutionarily related, but indicate that some of their genotype 1 genes and proteins have diverged over time, possibly as a reflection of one sequestered replication and protein co-adaptation in their respective hosts.",,"Silva, F.

1923,To follow the molecular epidemiology of Brazilian infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolates.,"Infectious bursal disease is a highly contagious disease of young chickens caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Genomic segment A encodes the capsid protein (VP2), while segment B encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). In the present study, we trace the molecular epidemiology of IBDV in Brazil by analyzing 29 isolates collected from the main poultry production regions. To characterize the isolates genetically, phylogenetic and population dynamic analyzes were performed using 68 VP1 (2634nt) and 102 VP2 (1356nt) coding sequences of IBDV isolates from different regions of the world. In addition, the evolution of IBDV was analyzed by characterizing the selective forces at work during diversification of viral isolates. We show that IBDV isolates were introduced to Brazil mainly from the Netherlands and the USA. These introductions have been associated with all Brazilian poultry production regions analyzed in this work. Furthermore, we show that the evolution of IBDV was shaped by a combination of very low recombination rates and relatively high nucleotide substitution rates (2.988 × 10-4 for VP1 and 3.2937 × 10-4 for VP2), which are themselves a function of the purifying Selection that acts on VP1 and VP2. Furthermore, our expanded Bayesian skyline plot suggests that the increase in the effective population size of isolates of IBDV is consistent with their epidemiological history, with a large increase during the onset of acute outbreaks of IBD in the 1980s. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Silva, F.

1925,Current and Future Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance in Animals: Review of Principles and Practices,"There is a broad consensus internationally that monitoring the level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emerging in different systems underpins strategies to address the problem. The main reasons for resistance surveillance are to determine (i) the magnitude of the problem, (ii) whether resistance is increasing, (iii) whether previously unknown types of resistance are emerging, (iv) whether a particular type of resistance is spreading, and (v) whether a particular type of resistance is associated with a particular outbreak. The implications of collecting and using this information must be considered when designing a monitoring system. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides a basis for assessing the burden of antimicrobial resistance and providing the evidence needed to develop efficient and effective control and prevention strategies. The joint development of AMR surveillance programs in humans and animals is essential, but several key elements remain that complicate data comparisons between AMR surveillance programs and between regions. Currently, AMR monitoring relies on straightforward in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility methods. However, the lack of harmonization between the programs and the limitation of the genetic information of AMR remain the main disadvantages of these phenotypic methods. The future of AMR monitoring is moving towards genotypic detection and molecular analysis methods are expected to provide a wealth of information. However, the expectation that these molecular techniques will outperform phenotypic susceptibility testing in the routine diagnosis and monitoring of AMR remains a distant reality, and phenotypic testing remains necessary to detect emerging resistant bacteria, emerging resistance mechanisms, and trends in AMR.",,"Simjee, S.;McDermott, P.;Trott, D.

The virus was identified in hepatocytes from chick embryos and budgerigars injected with liver suspensions from naturally infected parrots. Infected hepatocytes had prominent intranuclear inclusions containing naked nucleocapsids. Both naked and enveloped virions were seen in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, and enveloped nucleocapsids were occasionally seen in the perinuclear cisternae and extracellularly. The experimental and spontaneous disease mimicked a condition in parrots previously described by Pacheco. The viral agent was classified as a herpesvirus based on the character of the intranuclear inclusions, the size and conformation of the agent as determined by electron microscopy and filtration, and the sensitivity of the agent to ether.",,"Simpson, C.

1929,Identification of the microRNA repertoire in TLR-ligand challenged bubaline PBMCs as a model for bacterial and viral infections,"In the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing, miRNA-seq, to discover and examine the expression profiles of known and novel miRNAs in TLR ligand-stimulated versus unstimulated (i.e., control) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from the blood of healthy Murrah buffalo were isolated. Six small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed in the Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on the Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were matched to the Bos taurus genome (UMD3.1 assembly), which is phylogenetically closest to the buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputationally identified in buffalo PBMCs and 130 putative novel miRNAs (not entered in the bovine mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified in the six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs across samples were represented by sample dendrograms and heat map plots. The clearly expressed miRNAs in each treatment and control group were identified. Some miRNAs were expressed at very high levels, while most of them were moderately expressed. The miRNAs bta-miR-103 and -191 were found to be very abundant and expressed in all samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p and let family members (let 7a-5p, let 7g and let 7f) in LPS and CpG - treated PBMCS and bta-miR-191, -103 & -19b in poly I:C-stimulated PBMCs. Only one novel miRNA (bta-miR-11039) out of 130 identified putative novel miRNAs was expressed in all six samples, and differentially expressed (>2-fold) miRNAs were identified. Six of the differentially expressed miRNAs across groups (bta-miR-421, bta-let-7i, bta-miR-138, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-222, and bta-miR-27b) were subsequently examined and confirmed by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for roles in innate immunity and TLR signaling pathways. This first study on the profiling and cataloging of bubalin miRNAs expressed in TLR ligand-stimulated PBMCs will provide an important reference point for future studies on the regulatory role of miRNAs in the buffalo immune system.",,"Singh, J.;Mukhopadhyay, C.

1930,Taxonomic and gene-centric metagenomics of the faecal microbiome of low and high feed conversion ratio (FCR) broilers.,"Individual weight gain among broiler farmers appears to vary, which may be due in part to variations in their gut microbiota. In this article, we analyze the faecal microbiota of low and high feed conversion ratio (FCR) broilers. After shotgun sequencing of the faecal microbiome, we used the SEED database to identify microbial diversity and metabolic potential in low and high FCR birds. Domain-level breakdown of our samples included bacteria (>95%), eukaryotes (>2%), archaea (>0.2%), and viruses (>0.2%). At the strain level, Proteobacteria (78.83% at low and 52.04% at high FCR), Firmicutes (11.97% at low and 27.53% at high FCR) and Bacteroidetes (7.10% at low FCR and 17 .53% at high FCR). fecal microbial community. Poultry dropping metagenomes revealed the sequences related to 33 genera in both low and high FCR with significantly different proportions. Functional analysis revealed that genes for carbohydrate, amino acid and derivative metabolism, and protein metabolism were the most abundant in both samples in the SEED subsystem. Genes associated with stress, virulence, cell wall and cell capsule were also abundant. Indeed, genes associated with sulfur assimilation, flagellum and flagellar motility were over-represented in low FCR birds.

In recent years, several outbreaks in East Asia have been associated with neurological complications and numerous fatalities. An outbreak in Singapore in October 2000 affected thousands of children, resulting in four fatal cases, three of which isolated EV71. The genomes of two representative EV71 strains, isolated from one fatality and one surviving patient, were completely sequenced and their nucleotide and amino acid sequences compared to known EV71 strains. The two outbreak strains were assigned to genogroup B along with strains previously isolated in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. Comparative sequence analysis of the two Singapore strains revealed 99% nucleotide similarity, while their deduced amino acid sequences were almost identical except for residue 1506 in the nonstructural region of 3A. Given that the outbreak affected closely related genetic variants of EV71, the wide range of disease severity can be attributed to critical factors such as different viral vaccine doses or different post-infection host immune responses, but is less likely due to the occurrence of EV71 attributed strains with increased virulence.",,"Singh, S.;Poh, C.

Here we used viral metagenomics to characterize eukaryotic virome in feces of healthy children from a large urban center and from three Native American villages with minimal outside contact. Numerous human enteric viruses, mainly from the families Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae, were sequenced from each of the sites. Several children from the same villages shed closely related viruses, indicating common clusters of transmission. The faeces of isolated villagers also contained multiple viral genomes of unknown cellular origin from the order Picornavirals and the CRESS DNA group, as well as higher levels of nematode and protozoan DNA. Therefore, despite cultural and geographic isolation, human enteric virus diversity was not reduced in these Amazonian villages. Frequent viral introductions and/or an increased susceptibility to enteric infections may account for complex fecal virus among Native American children in remote villages.",,"Siqueira, J.

1933,"ENDEMIC INFECTION OF BEACHED SOUTH SEA OTTER (ENHYDRA LUTRIS NEREIS) WITH NEW PARVOVIRUS, POLYOMAVIRUS AND ADENOVIRUS","Over the past century, the southern sea otter (SSO; Enhydra lutris nereis) population has slowly recovered from extinction due to overfishing. The SSO is a threatened subspecies under federal law and a fully protected species under California law, USA. Through an interagency collaborative program, stranded animals are rehabilitated and released, while deceased animals are autopsied and tissues are cryopreserved to facilitate scientific study. Here we processed archival tissues to enrich for particle-associated viral nucleic acids, which we randomly amplified and deeply sequenced to identify viral genomes through sequence similarities. Anelloviruses and endogenous retroviral sequences accounted for over 50% of the observed viral sequences. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus sequences accounted for most of the remaining reads. We have characterized and phylogenetically analyzed the complete genome of sea otter polyomavirus 1 and the complete coding sequence of sea otter parvovirus 1 and found that the closest known viruses infect primates and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), respectively. We tested archival tissue from 69 stranded SSO autopsied by PCR over 14 years (2000-13). Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus infections were detected in 51, 61, and 29% of the animals examined, respectively, with no significant increase in frequency over time, indicating endemic infection. We found that 80% of the SSO tested were infected with at least one of the three DNA viruses whose tissue distribution we determined in 261 tissue samples. Parvovirus DNA was most commonly detected in the mesenteric lymph node, polyomavirus DNA in the spleen, and adenovirus DNA in multiple tissues (spleen, retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph nodes, lung, and liver).

Six of the duck-derived viruses had indices ranging from 0.25 to 0.49 and the IVPI for A/Chicken/Alabama/75 (H4N8) was 0.49, indicating that they had low pathogenic potential. An IVPI of 1.25 to a maximum of 3.0 is necessary for a type A influenza virus to be classified as highly pathogenic. Gross lesions observed in chickens that died after intravenous virus exposure included renal swelling with more pronounced lobular patterns, but visceral urate deposits were absent.

1936,Genetic variability and the classification of hepatitis E virus,"The classification of hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants is currently in transition, with no agreed definitions for genotypes and subtypes, or for deeper taxonomic groupings into species and genera, which might include recently characterized viruses assigned to the family Hepeviridae and birds, bats, rodents, and fish. These conflicts arise because of differences in the viruses and genomic regions being compared and in the methodology used. We reexamined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of full genome sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences showed that HEV variants most closely related to those infecting humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits closely related to genotype 3 occupy an intermediate position. No uniform criteria for the assignment of virus subtypes could be defined. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these viruses with the more divergent variants from chickens, bats and rodents in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups corresponding to HEV variants infecting humans and pigs, those infecting rats and ferrets, those from bats, and those from chickens. This approach could form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the more divergent HEV-like virus from fish (Cutthroat Trout Virus) being a second genus. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Smith, D.

However, there is little evidence that variants of HAV or HEV differ antigenically or in their propensity to cause severe disease. Genetically more divergent but mainly hepatotropic variants of both HAV and HEV have been found in several mammalian species, with those of HAV being classified into eight species within the genus Hepatovirus in the virus family Picornaviridae. HEV is classified as a member of the species Orthohepevirus A in the virus family Hepeviridae, a species that also contains viruses that infect pigs, rabbits, and a variety of other mammalian species.

A subset of these viruses infects humans and can cause self-limiting acute hepatitis, which can become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. Current published descriptions of the taxonomic subdivisions within the family Hepeviridae are inconsistent in terms of species and genotype assignments. By analyzing existing sequence information, we propose a taxonomic scheme in which the family is divided into the genera Orthohepevirus (all isolates of mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV)) and Piscihepevirus (necktrout virus). Species within the Orthohepevirus genus are classified as Orthohepevirus A (human, pig, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbit, and camel isolates), Orthohepevirus B (chicken isolates), Orthohepevirus C (rat, marsupial, Asiatic musk shrew, ferret, and mink) and orthohepevirus D (isolates from bats). Suggestions are also made for naming genotypes within the human and rat HEVs. This hierarchical system is consistent with hepevirus phylogeny, and the three levels of classification (genus, species, and genotype) are consistent with and reflect discontinuities in the regions of pairwise spacing between amino acid sequences. Adoption of this system would involve the avoidance of hostnames in taxonomic identifiers and provide a logical framework for assigning new variants.",,"Smith, D.

1940,Dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,"Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant mortality in humans. In the 20th century, three influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concerns about a new pandemic influenza, the pathway of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction into humans of each of the genes for all 20th-century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus were circulating in mammalian hosts, ie, pigs and humans, as early as 1911 and were unlikely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships indicate that the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either porcine or possibly human. Furthermore, seasonal and classic H1N1 swine viruses were not directly derived from BM/1918, but their progenitors circulated together during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of the most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated by rearrangement events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses prior to the detection of the pandemic. The potential generation of pandemic strains by a series of mammalian reassortment events over a period of years prior to pandemic detection suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies to detect precursor viruses can abort future pandemics.",,"Smith, G.

1942,Identification and isolation of a novel herpesvirus in a captive mob of eastern gray kangaroos (Macropus giganteus),"novel herpesvirus was detected in a captive mob of eastern gray kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) during diagnostic work-up of individuals with ulcerative cloacitis. Virus was initially detected in tissues using consensus herpesvirus PCR. No viral inclusions or particles were evident in routine histological or transmission electron microscopy sections of cloacal lesions. Virus was isolated from specimens and transmission electron microscopy of the resulting isolates confirmed that the virus was morphologically consistent with a herpesvirus. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product from tissue samples and from the isolates revealed that the virus belonged to the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily and was distinct from other known herpesviruses. The correlation between the lesions and the novel virus remains unknown. Two herpesviruses, both in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, have been previously described in macropods and are known to cause systemic clinical disease. This is the first reported gammaherpesvirus within the order Marsupialia and can provide valuable information on the evolution and phylogeny of this virus family. Based on the current nomenclature convention for herpesviruses, the authors propose to name the novel herpesvirus macropodid herpesvirus 3 (MaHV-3).",,"Smith, J. A.;Wellehan, J.

The new arrangement, together with camelpox and taterapox genomes, allowed new data to be calculated for the last common ancestor of all VARV genomes. Analysis of recently sequenced VARV-like vaccinia virus genomes showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid changes in the vaccinia virus (VACV) cop-O1L ortholog predicted to be associated with VARV host specificity and virulence introduced the lineage before the divergence of these viruses.

1945,An overview of the strain diversity and pathogenesis of the chicken astrovirus,"Although a relatively new virus, only identified as a distinct species of avian astrovirus in 2004, chicken astrovirus (CAstV) has been associated with poor growth of broiler flocks, enteritis and diarrhea and is a candidate for the causative agent of runting-stunting syndrome. More recently, CAstV has been implicated as the sole etiologic agent in cases of two other broiler diseases, namely severe renal disease in young broilers with visceral gout and white chick brood disease. Examination of the CAstV strains associated with the latter two diseases shows that they are genetically closely related. This review discusses the pathogenesis of CAstV in terms of strain diversity and the effects of vertical versus horizontal transmission, viral load, co-infections and the age of the bird at infection, all factors that affect disease severity can affect.",,"Smyth, V.

1946,Sequence analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O/IRN/2007 VP1 gene from Iranian isolate,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus causes a vesicular and contagious disease in even-toed ungulates. In this study, the virus was isolated from vesicles of infected cattle using cell culture and serotyped using an ELISA test. The extracted RNA from the infected cells was reverse transcribed and amplified by one-step RT-PCR using VP1 gene-specific primer pairs. The purified VP1 gene was subcloned into the unique KpnI and BamHI cloning sites of the pcDNA3.1+ vector. The DH5α strain of E. coli was transformed by the vector. The sequences of the subcloned FMDV type O/IRN/2007 VP1 were aligned to FMDV type O/UKG/2001 VP1 using MegAlign software. Nucleotide sequence comparisons were performed using BLAST software, available from the NCBI website. The amino acid sequences of three subcloned FMDV types O/IRN/2007 VP1 were also aligned to three other similar sequences using the MegAlign software. Nineteen of the most similar VP1 nucleotide sequences (through the BLASTN program), the FMDV-O/IRN/2007 VP1 sequence, twenty isolates of FMDV-O-VP1 in Iran and eight topotypes of FMDV type O were aligned by Mega5, to generate an FMDV-O-VP1 -based sequence similarity tree. The nucleotide sequence comparison showed that FMDV O/IRN/2007 VP1 had the greatest nucleotide sequence similarity to the VP1 gene of FMDV O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 (99%), FMDV O1/Manisa/Netherlands (98%) and FMDV O1/Manisa /iso87/Turkey (98%).

1947,Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase genes from H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from commercial broilers in Iran (2008 and 2009),"total of 512 tissue samples collected from 30 farms in different states of Iran in 2008-2009 as part of a surveillance program for avian influenza virus infection (AIVs) in the Iranian poultry population. To determine the genetic relatedness of Iranian viruses, neuraminidase (NA) genes from ten isolates of H9N2 viruses isolated from commercial chickens in Iran between 2008 and 2009 were amplified and sequenced. The neuraminidase gene of the viruses was >90% similar to that of subline A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2). The neuraminidase stalk regions in these viruses had no deletion compared to those of the chicken/Beijing/1/94 subline (Beijing-like viruses) and the two human isolates A/HK/1073/99, A/HK/1074/99. Phylogenetic analysis of the neuraminidase (NA) gene showed that it shared a common ancestral A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 isolate that contributed the internal genes of the H5N1 virus. The results of this study showed that no (Beijing-like) virus and no (Korea-like) virus were found in chickens in Iran, and that the NA genes of H9N2 influenza viruses circulating in Iran in recent years are well preserved and the earlier Iranian isolates can be considered as representative of such a progenitor. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media BV",,"Soltanialvar, M.;Shoushtari, H.;Bozorgmehrifard, M.;Charkhkar, S.;Akbarnejad, F.",2012.0,,10.1007/s11250-011-9913-2,0

Avian influenza virus was isolated from poultry farms with a history of respiratory disease and increased mortality. Nucleotide sequence analysis of five representative isolates confirmed that all isolates possessed one type of amino acid motif (RSSR/GL) at the HA cleavage site. Deduced amino acid sequences indicated the presence of L226 (234 in H9 numbering) in all five Iranian isolates, indicating a preference for binding of α(2-6) sialic acid receptors.

1949,Molecular epidemiology of the pseudorabies virus in Yunnan and the sequence analysis of its gD gene,"Pseudorabies (PRs) outbreaks have occurred in Yunnan, China, causing significant economic losses. To determine the prevalence and origin of PR in Yunnan, particularly in vaccinated pigs, a total of 791 samples of blood, tissue, semen and sera were analyzed by serological methods, PCR and gD gene sequence analysis. Detection with viral gI antibody or PCR showed that the annual positive rates of PR virus (PRV) in Yunnan from 2010 to 2014 were 48.15, 21.26, 2.17, 5.22 and 0.35%, respectively with an average of 15.43%. In general, the incidence decreased over the period 2010-2014, probably due to the use of PRV eradication strategies. Based on the complete sequence of the gD gene, a phylogenetic tree was constructed, clustering all phyla into two independent clades, i.e. Asian and European-American clades. The virus isolates from Henan, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shandong, Fujian, Xinjiang, Hubei, Guangdong and Yunnan fell into the Asian group that harbored South Korea isolate. Four isolates of Yunnan virus along with South Korea's Namyangju fell into the European-American group.

1950,Detection and classification of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Korea by dot immunoblotting assay using monoclonal antibodies,"Dot immunoblotting assay (DIA) using five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used to detect and classify the viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. Using a group-specific MAb 3F5, 10 reference strains and 12 Korean isolates of IBV were successfully detected by DIA, and the lowest viral titer of IBV detected by DIA was approximately less than 103.8 mean embryo infective dose/ml. To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency, DIA was compared to the conventional diagnostic method of infectious bronchitis (IB). IBV antigens in allantoic fluid from embryonated eggs inoculated with field samples suspected of having IBV were specifically detected by DIA within only one or two egg passages, whereas the traditional embryonated egg inoculation method required four to seven egg passages to confirm IBV infection . These results indicated that DIA could significantly reduce the time and cost of diagnosing IB. To examine the possibility of classifying IBV by DIA, four strain-specific MAbs, 3A4, 2A3, 6F7 and 2C6 were used. According to the MAb response patterns to the IBV antigens, the 10 IBV reference strains were divided into six groups; seven tribes belonged to three different groups, and the other three tribes each belonged to an individual group. In the case of 12 Korean isolates of IBV, they were divided into six groups. Among the six groups, the MAb response patterns of three groups matched those of the IBV reference strains, but the others did not. These data suggest that there are at least three variants of IBV serotypes in Korea.",,"Song, C. S.;Kim, J. H.;Lee, Y. J.;Kim, S. J.;Izumiya, Y.;Tohya, Y.;Jang, H. K.;Mikami, T.",1998.0,,,0
1951,Epidemiological classification of infectious bronchitis virus isolated in Korea between 1986 and 1997,"Forty Korean isolates and four reference strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were classified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Each Korean isolate was isolated from different types of commercial chicken flocks between 1986 and 1997. RFLP patterns of an amplified DNA fragment (1722 bp) containing the IBV S1 gene digested by the restriction enzyme HaeIII showed that the 40 Korean isolates were classified into five genotypes, I to V. Six of them belonged to the genotype I, which had the same HaeIII and XcmI cleavage pattern as the Massachusetts type (H120 and M41), but the other four genotypes had a different HaeIII cleavage pattern than the four reference IBV strains used in this study. Genotype III appeared to be the predominant type since 29 of the 40 isolates belonged to this type, which has been consistently found in chicken flocks since 1990. On the other hand, genotypes II, IV, and V were only found in the field in 1986, 1995, and 1995, respectively. Five isolates selected from each of the five genotypes were inoculated into 1-day-old specific pathogen-free chicks to assess their pathogenicity. Genotype III induced 50% mortality and severe renal urine deposition on the kidneys, but the other four genotypes showed respiratory distress only 1-2 days after inoculation. The live H120 vaccine protected chicks from challenge with isolates selected from genotype I but not genotypes IV through V.

1952,Profiling novel microRNAs evoked by EV71 and CA16 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells using high-throughput sequencing,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are two major causes associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Although they both belong to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, there are many differences in the infection process of these viruses. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Several studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play a crucial role in host-pathogen interaction. Our previous study reported that EV71 and CA16 infection results in differential expression of miRNAs in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Here we aimed to further investigate the expression profile and possible roles of other differentially expressed miRNAs in 16HBE cells after EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. We describe 44 new differentially expressed miRNAs in all samples. Among these miRNAs, 7 new differentially expressed miRNAs show an opposite expression trend during the progression of EV71 and CA16 infections. Bioinformatic analysis, including the Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, were then used to identify the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and signaling pathways involved. The top 10 GO and Pathway annotations showed that 849 target genes are involved in cell development such as: B. in the development of the nervous system, the development of multicellular organisms and developmental biology. Finally, the genes identified in both GO and pathway analysis were used to construct a co-expression network to further identify the potential function of these co-expressed genes. Therefore, our data may be helpful to guide further studies on the molecular mechanism of developmental regulation in EV71- and CA16-mediated HFMD pathogenesis. In addition, it provided new candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HFMD.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Jiang, X.;Zhu, W.;Wu, Z.;Dong, S.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.02.008,0
1953,miR-1303 regulates BBB permeability and promotes CNS lesions after CA16 infection by directly targeting MMP9,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) belongs to the Picornaviridae family and causes mild and self-limiting hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and young children. CA16 infection can also lead to central nervous system (CNS) complications; However, the underlying mechanism by which CA16 crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and then causes CNS damage remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of CA16 neurotropic tropism by establishing an in vitro BBB model of CA16 infection and an in vivo infant CA16 rhesus monkey infection model. Results showed that CA16 infection induced increased BBB permeability accompanied by upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression. Subsequently, high-throughput miRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-1303 can regulate BBB permeability by targeting MMP9. Next, we used dual luciferase, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays to provide evidence of MMP9 targeting by miR-1303. Further experiments showed that CA16 infection promoted the breakdown of junction complexes (Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-cadherin and ZO-1), likely by down-regulating miR-1303 and up-regulating MMP9. Finally, EGFP-CA16 infection could enter the CNS by facilitating the breakdown of junction complexes, eventually leading to neuroinflammation and damage to the CNS, which was confirmed using the in vivo rhesus monkey model. Our results suggest that CA16 could penetrate the BBB and then invade the CNS by downregulating miR-1303, which disrupts junction complexes by directly regulating MMP9 and ultimately causing CNS pathological changes. These results provide new therapeutic targets in HFMD patients after CA16 infection.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Li, H.;Huang, X.;Zheng, H.;Hu, Y.;Wang, J.;Jiang, X.;Li, J.;Yang, Z.;Fan, H.;Guo, L.;Shi, H.;He, Z.;Yang, F.;Wang, X.;Dong, S.;Li, Q.;Liu, L.",2018.0,,10.1038/s41426-018-0157-3,0
1954,Different microRNA profiles demonstrate the different outcomes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells using high-throughput sequencing,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remain the predominant causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), but the factors underlying the pathogenesis of EV71 and CA16 infections have not been elucidated. Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. In the present study, we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 135 known miRNAs showed remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 30 differentially expressed miRNAs showed opposite trends in EV71 and CA16 infected samples. We then mainly focused on the top 30 differentially expressed miRNAs by further screening to predict targets. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the predicted targets revealed the enrichment of 14 biological processes, 9 molecular functions, 8 cellular components, and 85 pathways. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, signaling pathways, and coexpression genes have been determined, suggesting that miRNAs exhibit intricate regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Consequently, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of predicted targets involved in biological adhesion. The results suggested that the marked changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partially related to blood-brain barrier function. Taken together, this is the first report describing miRNA expression profiles in HUVECs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our data provide useful insights that can help elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions after EV71 and CA16 infection and offer new therapeutic targets for these infections.",,"Song, J.;Hu, Y.;Li, J.;Zheng, H.;Wang, J.;Guo, L.;Ning, R.;Li, H.;Yang, Z.;Fan, H.;Liu, L.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0177657,0

Methods: Here we used deep microRNA (miRNA) sequencing to investigate the role of novel differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16. Results: The results identified 13 new differentially expressed miRNAs in each group. In addition, the target genes were predicted by the miRanda and RNAhybrid programs and a total of 2,501 targets were found across the two databases. Then, enrichment analyzes of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that these targets were mainly involved in cellular development and associated with nervous system development, system development, development of multicellular organisms, Wnt signaling pathway, the PDGF signaling pathway and the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Finally, a co-expression regulatory network was constructed with the key targets to further extrapolate the functional interactions of the targets and their co-expressed genes. Conclusion: Our results have not only revealed potential biomarkers or targets for the diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, but also provided new insights to explore the mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 pathogenesis.",,"Song, J.;Jiang, X.;Hu, Y.;Li, H.;Zhang, X.;Xu, J.;Li, W.;Zheng, X.;Dong, S.",2018.0,,10.1159/000493798,0
1956,Evidence of human-to-pig transmission of the 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus in South Korea,"As the 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1) virus continues to infect human populations worldwide, reports of epidemiological animal infections are also increasing. Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009-like viruses have been isolated in pigs from various pig farms in South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyzes of viral segments revealed multiple events of human-to-pig transmission with no apparent signs of rearrangement. These events were also supported by serological monitoring of pig sera collected from April to December, suggesting that retransmission probably started between June and July, with a sharp increase in prevalence in the following months. Although molecular characterization shows that the porcine isolates are generally stable, some viruses continue to evolve genetically, most notably in their surface proteins. Animal experiments (ferrets and mice) show that swine pandemic isolates embody biological properties attributed to the currently circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient transmission, indicating their potential to reenter the human cycle. Taken together, these results indicate widespread human-to-animal transmission of 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1) viruses in South Korea. Given the important role of swine in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events should be closely monitored and minimized to prevent the risk of generating viruses of major human health concern.

A 606 codon open reading frame located in this region encoded a protein (p69) related to a diverse family of putative DNA and/or RNA helicases belonging to the 'DEAD/H' superfamily. Unique sequence signatures were derived that allowed selective retrieval of the putative new family helicases from amino acid sequence databases. The family includes yeast, Drosophila, mammalian, and bacterial proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and repairing damaged DNA. It is hypothesized that p69 of CIV could be a DNA or RNA helicase possibly involved in viral transcription. A distant relationship has been observed between this family of helicases and another group of proteins composed of putative helicases from poxviruses, African swine fever virus and mitochondrial yeast plasmids. CIV p69 is shown to be much more closely related to cellular helicases than any other known viral helicase.

1958,Small RNA deep sequencing identifies viral microRNAs during malignant catarrh fever induced by Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1,"Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) is a γ-herpesvirus (γ-HV) asymptomatically carried by wildebeest. When transmitted across species, AlHV-1 induces a deadly lymphoproliferative disease called malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in many ruminants, including cattle, and in rabbit models. Latency has been shown to be essential for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms causing activation and proliferation of infected CD8+ T cells are unknown. Many γ-HVs express microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNAs can regulate the expression of host or viral target genes involved in various signaling pathways and are thought to facilitate viral infection and/or mediate activation and proliferation of infected lymphocytes. The AlHV-1 genome was predicted to encode a large number of miRNAs. However, their precise contribution to viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo remains unknown. Here, using small RNA cloning and sequencing, we identified 36 putative miRNAs expressed in a lymphoblastoid cell line propagated from a calf infected with AlHV-1 and developing MCF. Among the candidate miRNAs sequenced, 32 were expressed in two major clusters on the reverse strand of the genome. The expression of these 32 viral miRNAs was further validated using Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR in lymphoid organs of calves or rabbits developing in MCF. To determine the concerted contribution in MCF of 28 viral miRNAs clustered in the non-protein coding region of the AlHV-1 genome, a recombinant virus was generated. The absence of these 28 miRNAs had no effect on virus growth in vitro or MCF induction in rabbits, indicating that the AlHV-1 miRNAs clustered in this non-protein-coding genomic region are dispensable for MCF induction.",,"Sorel, O.;Tuddenham, L.;Myster, F.;Palmeira, L.;Kerkhofs, P.;Pfeffer, S.;Vanderplasschen, A.;Dewals, B.

The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of all 6 H5N1 viruses and an additional 38 H5 subtype viruses from North American wild birds and 28 N1 subtype viruses were sequenced and compared by phylogenetic analysis to sequences contained in GenBank Are available. Both HA and NA were phylogenetically distinct from those for viruses from outside North America and for viruses recovered from mammals. Four of the H5N1-AI viruses were characterized as low pathogenic by standard in vivo pathotyping tests. One of the H5N1 viruses, A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06, has been shown to replicate at low titers in chickens, turkeys and ducks. However, transmission of A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 was more efficient in ducks than chickens or turkeys due to virus shedding. The 50% chicken infectious dose for A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 and three other H5 viruses derived from wild waterfowl was also determined and ranged from 10 5.3 to 107.5 50% egg infectious doses. Finally, seven H5 viruses representing different phylogenetic clades were screened for their antigenic relatedness by a hemagglutination inhibition assay, showing that antigenic relatedness was largely associated with geographic origin. Overall, the data support the conclusion that North American wild bird H5-AI viruses are wild bird-adapted viruses with low pathogenicity and are antigenically and genetically distinct from the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 virus lineage.

1963,"Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis E virus in pigs, wild boar, roe deer, red deer and elk in Lithuania","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. In Europe, foodborne zoonotic transmission of HEV genotype 3 has been associated with domestic and feral pigs. Data on the circulation of the virus in animals used for human consumption are controversial and a gold standard for the diagnosis of HEV-associated hepatitis has not yet been defined. To investigate the current HEV infection status in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, the presence of viral RNA was analyzed by nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) in randomly selected samples and the viral RNA was subsequently genotyped. RESULTS: Overall, 32.98% and 22.55% of domestic pig samples were HEV positive using RT-nPCR targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 fragments, respectively. Among ungulates, 25.94% of wild boar samples, 22.58% of roe deer samples, 6.67% of red deer samples, and 7.69% of elk samples were positive for HEV RNA using primers targeting the ORF1 fragment. Using primers targeting the ORF2 fragment of the HEV genome, viral RNA was only detected in 17.03% of wild boar samples and 12.90% of roe deer samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 348 nucleotide region of HEV ORF2 showed that all conserved sequences detected in Lithuanian domestic pigs and wild animals belonged to genotype 3 3i subtype reference sequences from GenBank database. The sequences obtained from pig farms in two different districts of Lithuania were of the HEV 3f subtype. The wild boar sequences clustered within subtypes 3i and 3h, clearly indicating that wild boar can harbor additional subtypes of HEV. The ORF2 nucleotide sequences obtained from roe deer proved for the first time that the HEV subtype 3i can be found in a novel host. CONCLUSION: The results of the viral prevalence and phylogenetic analyzes clearly demonstrated viral infection in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, underscoring the significant concern about transmission of zoonotic viruses both through the food chain and through direct contact with animals. The unexpected diversity of the HEV genotype 3 subtype in Lithuania and neighboring countries has shown that further studies are needed to understand the mode of HEV transmission between animals and humans in the Baltic States region.",,"Spancerniene, U.;Grigas, J.;Buitkuviene, J.;Zymantiene, J.;Juozaitiene, V.;Stankeviciute, M.;Razukevicius, D.;Zienius, D.;Stankevicius, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s13028-018-0367-7,0
1964,Physical and chemical characterization of an avian reovirus,"The avian viral agent S1133 was previously serologically classified as a member of the avian reovirus group. This viral agent grows in chick embryo fibroblast cells, bands at a density of 1.37 g/ml in CsCl equilibrium density gradients, has a particle diameter of 75 nm and a morphology similar to human reovirus type 3. Its nucleic acid consists of double-stranded RNA and adenosine-rich oligonucleotides. The dsRNA is divided into 10 segments with molecular weights of 2.7 x 106, 2.6 x 106, 2.4 x 106, 1.7 x 106, 1.5 x 106, 1.3 x 106, 1.2 x 106 , 0.80 x 106, 0.74 x 106 and 0.68 x 106 distributed for the largest (L1) to the smallest (S4) segment as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These 10 segments migrate differently on polyacrylamide gels compared to those of human reovirus type 3. The avian reovirus capsid proteins consist of eight types of polypeptides as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These are Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, Δ1, Δ2, Sigma1, Sigma2, and Sigma3 with molecular weights of 140, 125, 115, 85, 72, 40, 36, and 32 x 103, respectively. Only the sigma2 polypeptide, located in the inner capsid or nucleus co-migrated with the type 3 reovirus sigma2 polypeptide. Antiserum against reovirus type 3 did not neutralize avian reovirus.

1965,Dynamic balance of Marek's disease genomes during in vitro serial passage,"Attenuation of gallid herpesvirus-2 (GaHV-2), the causative agent of Marek's disease, can be achieved by serial passage of a virulent field isolate in avian embryo fibroblasts. In order to better understand the genes involved in the attenuation and to assign observed changes in phenotype to specific genetic variations, the genomic DNA sequence of a single virulent GaHV-2 strain (648A) was determined at defined passage intervals. Biological characterization of these ""interval isolates"" in chickens previously indicated that the ability to induce transient paralysis was lost after passage 40 and the ability to induce sustained neurological disease was lost after passage 80, which coincides with was accompanied by the loss of formation of neoplastic lesions. Deep sequencing of the interval isolates allowed detailed cataloging of the mutations present within a single passage population and the frequency with which a given mutation occurs across passages. Gross genetic changes have been identified in both novel and well-characterized genes and cis-acting regions involved in replication and cleavage/packaging. Between passages 61 and 101 there were deletions in genes encoding the virulence factors vLipase, vIL8 and RLORF4, as well as a deletion in the promoter of ICP4. In addition, three mutations in the virus-encoded telomerase that were prevalent in late passages were identified. Overall, the frequency of mutations varied greatly during serial passage and few genetic changes were absolute. This indicates that serial passage of GaHV-2 leads to the generation of a library of genomes with limited sequence heterogeneity.",,"Spatz, S. J.;Volkening, J. D.;Gimeno, I. M.;Heidari, M.;Witter, R.

1967,Serological and virological studies on selected cattle with antibodies against bovine herpesviruses,"To examine the specificity of low titre antibodies against BHV 1, twelve cattle were subjected to stress and dexamethasone treatment. They were monitored virologically by inoculating cell cultures with nasopharyngeal, ocular and vaginal or preputial swabs and serologically by determining the prevalence and incidence of antibodies to bovine, caprine, porcine and equine herpesviruses and to bovine leukemia virus. Antibodies were considered specific for BHV 1 if the animals shed IBR virus, or if the antibodies neutralized BHV 1 and reacted with BHV 1 antigens, or if they additionally reacted with CapHV antigens. Animals whose sera recognized BHV 1 and BHV 2 but no other herpesviruses were judged to have suffered both infections. Nine of the twelve animals showed specific BHV 1 antibodies. For three animals, the question of the specificity of their antibodies remains open. Two animals suffered multiple herpesvirus infections. Therefore, the induction of cross-reacting antibodies directed against epitopes common to herpesviruses could not be ruled out. The sera of one animal reacted with BHV 1 and BHV 4 antigens in ELISA tests. However, they did not neutralize BHV 1.",,"Spirig, C.;Ackermann, M.;MÃ¼ller, H. K.;Bruckner, L.;Kihm, U.",1989.0,,,0

It is a globally distributed pathogen that causes significant financial losses in livestock farming. The disease mainly affects sheep and goats, but various other ruminants and mammals have also been reported to be infected. It is also a zoonosis, mainly affecting people who come into direct or indirect contact with infected animals (e.g. farmers, veterinarians). The disease is usually benign and self-limiting, although in many cases, particularly in young animals, it can be persistent and even fatal. It is assumed that production losses due to the orf virus are underestimated since it is not a notifiable disease.

1969,Characterization of infectious bursal disease virus from four-layer flocks in the United States,"Twenty bursa samples were obtained from four flocks of laying hens vaccinated with infectious bursial disease virus (IBDV) and having problems with immunosuppression considered to be infectious bursial disease. All samples were found positive for IBDV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the samples identified them as classic viruses of molecular groups 3 and 4. Two samples from each of the four flocks were sequenced and within one flock these sequences were identical; however, some differences were observed between herds. One virus from each of the four herds was selected for further analysis. The VP2 hypervariable sequence region of samples GA-1, H-30 and CS-2-35 had nucleotide and amino acid similarities to the classical D78 and Vi Bursa G vaccines used in these flocks. The sequence of HPR-2 was similar to the Bursa Vac 4 vaccine used in this herd and the virulent STC IBDV classic strain. Deduced amino acid sequence of these isolates showed that all isolates had proline at position 222, which is characteristic of classical US viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates based on the hypervariable VP2 amino acid sequence grouped GA-1, H-30 and CS-2-35 with the D78 vaccine and HPR-2 with STC. The pathogenicity of these isolates was tested on specifically pathogen-free chickens. Bursal body weight (B-BW) ratios and histopathologic lesion scores in the bursa were determined. Gross lesions were observed in the bursa, and the B:BW ratios of the birds infected with all four wild-type viruses were significantly different compared to the D78 vaccine and the unvaccinated control groups. The histopathology of the bursa of groups infected with GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35 and HPR-2 showed variable degrees of follicle depletion and necrosis. A very slight lymphoid depletion was observed in the D78-infected group 5 days post-inoculation and no microscopic lesions were observed in this group 8 days post-inoculation or at any time in the uninoculated control group. The bursae collected from the field viruses and D78-infected birds at autopsy revealed the presence of IBDV via RT-PCR and the VP-2 hypervariable nucleotide sequences of GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35, HPR-2- and D78 samples were identical to the original virus isolates and vaccine, respectively.",,"Sreedevi, B.;LeFever, L.

The mortality rate from JE is 30%, while 10-15% of patients fully recover. The disease spreads through infected mosquito bites that breed in paddy fields and feed on pigs, birds and ducks. PURPOSE: Since proteins have an important structure-function relationship, the study was designed to perform the identification of poly- and non-structural proteins in the infectious virus group using different strains of Japanese encephalitis virus, i.e. JAOARS982, Nakayama strain SA (V ), strain SA-14. Methods: Using non-structural proteins, protein sequences of the following Japanese encephalitis virus groups were obtained: Japanese encephalitis virus, Weatnile virus, Kunjin virus. Further comparative and phylogenetic analyzes were conducted to examine the evolutionary relationship between these groups. RESULTS: Alignment score phylogeny results were 375184 using multiple alignment, Jal view, ClustalW(1.83) and ClustalW2. However, analysis among the nonstructural proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Kunjin virus revealed that the phylogeny alignment score was 875 by multiple sequence alignment and tree view, respectively. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these four strains are related and show high similarity to the other viruses of this group due to conserved regions in their sequences.",,"Srivastava, P.;Trivedi, A.

1971,Animal models of Ebola virus infection,"Ebola virus is a highly pathogenic member of the Filoviridae family that causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and NHP. The 2013–2016 outbreak in West Africa has increased interest in developing and refining animal models of Ebola virus disease. These models are used to test countermeasures and vaccines, generate scientific knowledge about the mechanisms of disease progression and transmission, and study key correlates of immunology. The Ebola virus is classified as a BSL4 pathogen and a Category A pathogen for which the United States government must be prepared in the event of bioterrorism. Rodents such as Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), mice (Mus musculus) and guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) are the most common types of research. However, NHP, particularly macaques, are preferred for research into Ebola virus disease due to similarities to humans in terms of pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and causes of death. To meet regulatory requirements for approving countermeasures against high-impact pathogens, the FDA introduced the animal rule, allowing efficacy studies in animal models in place of human clinical data when such studies are impractical or ethically unacceptable.

1972,Genetic heterogeneity of classical swine fever virus in Central Europe,"The aim of this work was to genetically characterize Central European isolates of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and to evaluate the applicability of molecular analysis in the epizootiology of CSFV infections. 34 viruses originating from Central European pigs or wild boars were examined. All of these viruses were detected by each of three sets of oligonucleotide primers designed for specific RT-PCR amplification of different genomic regions. Comparative sequence analyzes of the PCR products showed that it was a genetic type common in Western Europe. A further differentiation of virus isolates into subgroups broadly consistent with their regions of origin in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Estonia was possible. The discrimination ability of the technique was enhanced by analyzing a composite data set consisting of all sequence data from all viruses. Using this approach, we were able to distinguish between all viruses and grouped them to exactly match their geographic origins, with the exception of a single Estonian isolate, which grouped with viruses from eastern Poland.",,"Stadejek, T.;VilÄek, Å ;Lowings, J.

This study reports the first identification of PCV3 in Europe in the serum of pigs from Polish herds. Between 2014 and 2017, a total of 1,050 serum samples were collected from sows and 3-20 week old pigs from 14 commercial farms from different regions of Poland, of different size and health status. Samples were pooled from 4-6 and assayed for PCV3 by real-time PCR. PCV3 DNA was detected in 12 out of 14 farms (85.7%). In the PCV3-positive farms, the virus was detected in 5.9% to 65% of the serum pools. PCV3 was most common in weaned and finisher pigs (26.1% and 28.0% of serum pools, respectively). Sequence analysis of the 359 nucleotide fragment of ORF2 showed the highest 99.7% identity with PCV3-US/SD2016 from USA.

1975,Markers of Venezuelan encephalitis virus that distinguish enzootic strains of subtype ID from those of IE,"Strains of Venezuelan encephalitis virus isolated from enzootic habitats during interepizootic periods in Central America and northern South America can be antigenically distinguished from one another by inhibition of hemagglutination. This test provided the basis for classifying these virus strains into subtypes IE and ID. Virus strains of these two subtypes were found to be fundamentally different in terms of virulence to English shorthaired guinea pigs. Studies are described which confirm that virus strains of the ID subtype are virulent for guinea pigs and that the virulence is not the result of cocycling subpopulations of epizootic subtype I AB or IC virions. Two additional markers were found that distinguish viral strains of ID and IE subtypes of Venezuelan encephalitis. First, hydroxyapatite chromatography of intact virions at pH 6.5 showed differential elution of ID and IE prototype strains. Virions from subtype ID strains eluted at 0.08-0.11 M phosphate, while those from subtype IE strains eluted at 0.15-0.20 M phosphate. Second, the isoelectric points of the E1 envelope glycoproteins of the ID and IE prototype strains were significantly different; pH 6.85 to 7.00 and pH 7.25 to 7.30, respectively. There was no significant difference in the isoelectric points of the E2 envelope glycoproteins. These distinguishing features most likely reflect a fundamental difference in virion surface structure.",,"Stanick, D. R.;Wiebe, M. E.;Scherer, W. F.",1985.0,,,0
1976,Detection and molecular characterization of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus in Lithuanian wild boar populations,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is recognized worldwide as an important and economically devastating pathogen in swine production. Although PRRSV is widespread in domestic pigs, there is a lack of information on PRRSV infection in European wild boar (Sus scrofa). The information currently available does not provide conclusive evidence that wild boar is a reservoir of PRRSV. Nevertheless, wild boar can become infected through occasional direct or indirect contact with domestic pigs. In addition, wild boar can act as a reservoir for infectious diseases of domestic pigs. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to determine virus prevalence and to further investigate the epidemiology and diversity of PRRSV strains present in Lithuanian wild boar over a 5-year period. A total of 1597 tissue and serum samples from wild boar living in 44 districts and ten counties in Lithuania were analyzed using conventional nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time Taqman RT-PCR for the detection of PRRSV-specific Openness analyzed reading frame (ORF) 1 and 6 sequences. RESULTS: PRRSV was widespread in Lithuanian wild boar populations, with an average rate of 18.66% by conventional RT-PCR and 19.54% by real-time RT-PCR. PRRSV was detected in 36.71% and 41.77% of the 237 hunting grounds tested by conventional RT-nPCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. No statistically significant differences in PRRSV prevalence by geographic area were observed in the ten Lithuanian counties. Animals infected with PRRSV were identified in all age groups; However, significantly higher prevalence rates were found in subadult and adult wild boar than in young animals up to 12 months of age. No positive results were obtained using conventional PCR with type 2 specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF5 region revealed that ten wild boar harbor virus sequences of genetic subtypes 3 and 4 and therefore may pose a serious threat to Lithuanian pig farms where only subtype 2 strains are circulating. CONCLUSIONS: The results of virus prevalence and phylogenetic analyzes strongly support the role of wild boar as a possible natural reservoir for PRRSV in Lithuania.",,"Stankevicius, A.;Buitkuviene, J.;Sutkiene, V.;Spancerniene, U.;Pampariene, I.;Pautienius, A.;Oberauskas, V.;Zilinskas, H.;Zymantiene, J.",2016.0,,10.1186/s13028-016-0232-5,0
1977,"The analysis of influenza A viruses of subtype H1 from wild birds, turkeys and pigs in Germany shows transmission events between the species","Background Influenza A virus transmission between wild birds, poultry and swine has been repeatedly demonstrated between species despite significant host species barriers. In particular, viruses of subtypes H1 and H3 have been transmitted between pigs and poultry, predominantly turkeys, in regions with high population densities of both species. The detection of a swine influenza H1N1 virus in a flock of turkeys in Germany in 2009 prompted us to molecularly investigate the H1 subtype viruses recently detected in wild birds, pigs and poultry. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between H1N1 viruses originating from wild and domestic animals from Germany and to identify possible transspecies transmission or reassortment events. Methods Haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes and full-length genome sequences were generated from selected, current H1N1 viruses from wild birds, pigs and turkeys. Phylogenetic analyzes were combined with genotyping and analyzes of the deduced amino acid sequences for biologically active sites. Antigenic relationships were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition responses. Results Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequences revealed that viruses from different H1 subgroups co-circulate between domestic and wild birds. In addition, these viruses comprised different genotypes and were antigenically distinct. An H1N1 virus isolated from a turkey farm in northern Germany in 2009 showed the greatest similarity to the bird-like H1N1 swine influenza virus that has been circulating in Europe since the late 1970s. Conclusions The data demonstrate the genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of the H1 viruses currently circulating in domestic and wild animals in Germany and point to turkeys as a possible bridge between avian and mammalian hosts. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Starick, E.;Fereidouni, S.

1978,Circular replication-associated protein encoding DNA viruses identified in the faeces of various animals in New Zealand,"In recent years, innovations in molecular techniques and sequencing technologies have led to a rapid increase in the number of known viral sequences, particularly those with circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA genome. CRESS DNA viruses are found in the virome of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide variety of organisms. A large number of the recently identified CRESS-DNA viruses cannot be assigned to any known virus family, suggesting that the current view of the CRESS-DNA viral sequence space is grossly underestimated. Animal feces have proven to be a particularly useful source for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem because they are inexpensive and non-invasive. In this study, a viral metagenomic approach was used to examine the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the faeces of domestic and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (which may be defective molecules or individual components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from forty-nine individual animal fecal samples. Based on shared genome organization and sequence similarity, eighteen of the isolates were classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates as smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity to members of known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, emphasizes the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforces the suggestion that a large subset of CRESS DNA viruses has yet to be identified .",,"Steel, O.;Kraberger, S.;Sikorski, A.;Young, L.

1979,"Widespread recombination, reassortment, and transmission of unbalanced composite viral genotypes in natural arenavirus infections","Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arena viruses package a large (L) and a small (S) genome segment into their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, new genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment have been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here we used metagenomic sequencing to examine the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals we determined the complete or nearly complete sequence of 210 genome segments grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 different S and 11 different L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases, the L segment genotypes predominated within the host over the S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype was dominant at individual animals and at the population level. We confirmed the sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous cases of recombination and reassortment were discovered, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations with 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which despite their atypical structures were capable of stable replication and transmission. Overall, this represents diversity within the host on a scale and in a form far exceeding what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can plausibly be attributed to the mixing of subclinically infected wild caught in captivity. Thus, these results not only provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution and adaptation of arenaviruses, but also allow the study of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.",,"Stenglein, M.

1980,Isolation and cloning of two variants of papillomaviruses from domestic pigs: Sus scrofa papillomavirus type 1 variants a and b,"The healthy skin of two female domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) was sampled with cotton swabs. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to PCR with degenerate papillomavirus (PV)-specific primers. Similarity searches performed with BLASTN showed that partial E1 and L1 sequences were amplified from two new PVs. Subsequently, the complete genomes of these Sus scrofa papillomaviruses (SsPVs) were amplified using long template PCR, cloned and sequenced using a transposon insertion method. They contained the typical PV open reading frames (ORFs) E1, E2, E4, E6, L1 and L2, but the E7 ORF was absent in both viruses. The pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of the L1 ORFs of the SsPVs showed a similarity of 98.5%, classifying these viruses as SsPV type 1 ""variants"" (SsPV-1a and -1b). A contiguous phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a chained alignment of the E1, E2, L1, and L2 ORFs of SsPV-1 variants a and b and 81 other human and animal PV-type species. This phylogenetic analysis showed that the SsPV-1a and -1b variants did not cluster with the other PVs of artiodactyl (hoofed hoof) host species, but clustered at the edge of the genus Alphapapillomavirus, very close to the root of that genus. © 2008 SGM.",,"Stevens, H.;Rector, A.;van der Kroght, K.;van Ranst, M.",2008.0,,10.1099/vir.0.2008/003186-0,0
1981,The cloning and sequencing strategy for small RNA affects the expression signatures of host and virus microRNA,"The establishment of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures is the fundamental element to study the role played by these regulatory molecules in the biology of an organism. Marek's disease virus 1 (MDV-1) is an avian herpesvirus that naturally infects chickens and induces T-cell lymphoma. During latency, MDV-1, like other herpesviruses, expresses a limited subset of transcripts. This includes three miRNA clusters. Several studies identified the expression of virus- and host-encoded miRNAs from MDV-1 infected cell cultures and chickens. However, when comparing miRNA cloning frequencies from different cloning and sequencing protocols, a large discrepancy was observed. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of preparing and sequencing small RNA libraries on miRNA frequencies obtained from the same RNA samples collected during MDV-1 infection of chickens at different steps of oncoviral pathogenesis. Depending on the strategy used, qualitative and quantitative discrepancies were found in the data. One of the mature miRNAs derived from the Latency Associated Transcript (LAT), mdv1-miR-M7-5p, showed the highest variation. Its cloning frequency was 50% of viral miRNA counts when a small-scale sequencing approach was used. Its frequency was 100 times lower when determined by the deep sequencing approach. Northern blot analysis showed better correlation with the miRNA frequencies found by the small-scale sequencing approach. By analyzing the cellular miRNA repertoire, we also found a gap between the two sequencing approaches. Overall, our study shows that next-generation sequencing data, considered alone, is limited for assessing the absolute copy number of transcripts. Therefore, small RNA quantification should be addressed by compiling data obtained using various techniques such as microarrays, qRT-PCR, and NB analysis in support of high-throughput sequencing data. These observations should be considered when investigating miRNA variations before attempting functional studies. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Stik, G.;Muylkens, B.;Coupeau, D.;Laurent, S.;Dambrine, G.;Messmer, M.;Chane-Woon-Ming, B.;Pfeffer, S.;Rasschaert, D.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.04.005,0
1982,Molecular and biological properties of avian polyomaviruses: Isolates from different avian species indicate that avian polyomaviruses constitute a distinct subgenus within the polyomavirus genus,"The isolation and characterization of two avian polyomaviruses from chicken (BFDV-2) and one parrot (BFDV-3) is reported. Both isolates are closely related to the non-mammalian polyomavirus (BFDV) (now called BFDV-1) isolated from budgies, and all three viral genomes have been shown to share the same basal size of 4981 bp. However, a 151 bp insertion was observed in the non-coding region of BFDV-2, representing an exact duplication of the left half of the non-coding region, including the putative early promoter and the amino terminus of the large T antigen. With an additional 15 base pairs swapped elsewhere in the three genomes, these viruses have varying degrees of tropism for different bird species. The production of antibodies directed against a β-galactosidase-large T-antigen fusion protein of BFDV-1 is described. These antibodies detected the large T antigen with an M(r) of approximately 80K and the small t antigen with an M(r) of approximately 24K in cells infected with BFDV isolates. While these antibodies bind with low affinity to the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen, SV40 or mouse polyomavirus specific antibodies do not bind to the BFDV large T antigen. Antibodies directed against BFDV structural polypeptides show broad reciprocal cross-reactivities with all three structural proteins of mammalian polyomaviruses. The importance of polyomavirus infections in different bird species is discussed. Based on unique structural and biological features, we propose to place these viruses in a distinct subgenus (avipolyomavirus) within the polyomaviruses.",,"Stoll, R.;Luo, D.;Kouwenhoven, B.;Hobom, G.;Muller, H.",1993.0,,,0
1983,Whole genome sequencing shows that geographic variation in Escherichia coli O157 genotypes dominates host association,"Genetic variation in an infectious disease agent can be caused by ecological niche differences resulting from different host species and different geographic locations. Whole genome sequencing was used to compare E. coli O157 isolates from host reservoirs (cattle and sheep) from Scotland and to compare genetic variation of isolates (human, animal, environment/food) collected from Scotland, New Zealand , the Netherlands, Canada and the USA UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Nei's genetic distance, calculated from nuclear genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), showed that the animal isolates came from the same population. Examination of the Shiga toxin bacteriophage and its insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that bovine and ovine isolates had statistically indistinguishable dilution profiles, diversity and genotypes. In contrast, isolates from different countries showed significant differences in Nei genetic distance and SBI typing. Therefore, after successful international transmission, which has occurred multiple times, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global patchwork of continental and transcontinental phylogeographic clades. These results are important for three reasons: first, to understand the transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multiple geographic locations; second, emphasizing the importance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm-based interventions; and third, improving our understanding of why the incidence of human disease varies across the world.",,"Strachan, N.

1984,Detection and subtyping of foot-and-mouth disease virus in infected cattle by polymerase chain reaction and amplified VP1 sequencing,Rapid and accurate detection of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks is necessary to contain the spread of the disease through appropriate vaccination. The use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the way viral diseases are diagnosed. Sequence analysis of the amplified VP1 sequence can allow classification of the FMD virus detected in the diseased animal. PCR assays were performed to identify the virus and its serotype in suspect animals from 2 outbreaks of FMD type O virus. Sequence analysis of the amplified VP1 cDNA showed 78% homology with O1K and over 95% homology between samples. These results suggest that the two outbreaks were due to infection with the same virus serosubtype.,,"Stram, Y.;Molad, T.;Chai, D.;Gelman, B.;Yadin, H.",1995.0,,,0

1986,Increased phylogenetic diversity of bovine diarrhea type 1 viral virus isolates in England and Wales since 2001,"There are currently two recognized bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) genotypes, type 1 and type 2. These genotypes are divided into subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis, namely ap for BVDV-1 and ac for BVDV-2. In this study, the genetic heterogeneity of BVDV-1 in England and Wales was examined and compared to the situation in 1996/1997. Viral RNA was extracted from 316 blood samples previously identified as positive for BVDV-1 collected between 2004 and 2009. A region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and the PCR products were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR revealed the existence of five subtypes of BVDV-1 circulating in England and Wales, namely BVDV-1a (244 samples), BVDV-1b (50), BVDV-1e (3), BVDV- 1f (1) and BVDV-1i (18). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the Npro region of the viral genome supported the classification obtained with the 5' UTR. Given that only three subtypes were detected in 1999, this report supports the notion that the repopulation of cattle from continental Europe following the mass culling during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak and the slaughter of cattle for infection with bovine tuberculosis occurred has increased the genetic diversity of BVDV-1 subtypes in England and Wales over the past 10 years. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Strong, R.;Errington, J.;Cook, R.;Ross-Smith, N.;Wakeley, P.;Steinbach, F.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.09.006,0

Phylogenetically, the virus was most closely related to parrot herpesvirus, but displayed sufficient nucleotide and amino acid diversity to be considered a novel alphaherpesvirus.

1990,Liver rupture hemorrhage syndrome in chickens caused by a novel genotype of avian hepatitis E virus,"Since 2016, severe outbreaks of Hepatic Rupture Hemorrhage Syndrome (HRHS) in chickens have occurred in several Chinese provinces and have caused huge economic losses in the poultry industry, but the etiological features and pathogenic potential thereof have remained unclear. This study sequenced the partial helicase and capsid gene of the potentially novel avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolated from chickens with HRHS and tested the pathogenicity thereof on SPF chicks, while showing clinical symptoms, histopathological changes , virus distribution, viremia and virus shedding was monitored 14 days post-infection (dpi). The analysis revealed that the HRHS-related avian HEV belongs to a new genotype and infected chicks developed the typical symptoms of HRHS. Thus, this study successfully developed an experimental infection model to investigate the pathogenicity and role of the novel avian HEV in HRHS. Meanwhile, the novel avian HEV was mainly present in liver and spleen, which induces rapid viremia and chronic virus shedding in infected chicks and could cause 40% mortality before 14 dpi.

1991,Characterization of H7N2 avian influenza virus in wild birds and pikas in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area,"Qinghai Lake is an important breeding ground for migratory birds, which has recently seen several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) animal diseases. From 2006 to 2009, we examined Qinghai's wild birds and pikas for evidence of AIV infection. We sampled 941 healthy wild animals and isolated seventeen H7N2 viruses (eight from pikas and nine from wild birds). The H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas may play an important role in the ecology of AIVs as they act as intermediate hosts where viruses are better adapted to mammals. Our results of AI infection in pikas are consistent with previous observations and raise the possibility that picas may play a previously unrecognized role in the ecology of the peridomestic aquatic environment of AIV.",,"Su, S.;Xing, G.;Wang, J.;Li, Z.;Gu, J.;Yan, L.;Lei, J.;Ji, S.;Hu, B.;Gray, G.

1992,Overexpression of the Rybp gene inhibits differentiation of bovine myoblasts into myotubes,"The RING1 and YY1 Binding Protein (Rybp) genes inhibit myogenesis in mice, but the effects of these genes in cattle have not been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the Rybp gene in bovine skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation. In the present study, the Rybp gene was overexpressed in bovine myoblasts via adenovirus. RNA-seq was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results showed that overexpression of the Rybp gene inhibited myotube formation. The morphological differences in the myoblasts started on the second day and were very significant 6 days after adenovirus induction. A total of 1311 (707 upregulated and 604 downregulated) DEGs were screened using RNA-seq between myoblasts with added negative control adenoviruses (AD-NC) and Rybp adenoviruses (AD-Rybp) after 6 days of induction. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in biological functions related to muscle, and that of the 32 signaling pathways, those related to muscle development were significantly enriched for the identified DEGs. This study can not only provide a theoretical basis for the regulation of skeletal muscle development in cattle by examining the role of Rybp gene in myoblast differentiation, but also lay a theoretical basis for molecular breeding of beef cattle.",,"Su, X.;Zhao, Y.;Wang, Y.;Zhang, L.;Zan, L.;Wang, H.",2018.0,2018-07-01 00:00:00,,0
1993,Isolation and genetic characterization of a novel adeno-associated virus from Muscovy ducks in China,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV; genus Dependoparvovirus, family Parvoviridae) was first discovered in 1965 as a contaminant in adenovirus preparations. The AAVs are generally considered non-pathogenic and have the ability to attenuate the replication of other, more pathogenic viruses, making them attractive as potential therapeutics or preventive measures. This study characterized a novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after a field isolate of DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) was propagated in duck embryonic fibroblasts. The complete genome sequence of MHH-05-2015 was determined and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared to other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of the structural and nonstructural protein-encoding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63-64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 is not directly descended from other members of the dependoparvovirus family. These results suggest that MHH-05-2015 is a new subtype of AAV distinct from other avian AAVs.",,"Su, X. N.;Liu, J. J.;Zhou, Q. F.;Zhang, X. H.;Zhao, L. C.;Xie, Q. M.;Chen, W.

1994,Companion Animal Symposium: Microbial and Gastrointestinal Health of Dogs and Cats Review,"Recent molecular studies have revealed complex communities of bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. More than 10 strains of bacteria have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria accounting for more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defensive barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, support enterocytes with nutrients, and play a critical role in immune system development. Of importance to gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment food substrates into short-chain fatty acids, primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can also have adverse effects on the health of the host. Specific pathogens (e.g. Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Changes in the composition of the small intestine microbiota, possibly leading to changes in gut permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in dogs with small intestine dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is growing evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs and cats. Current theories on the development of IBD suggest a combination of environmental factors, the gut microbiota, and host genetic susceptibility. Recent studies have demonstrated a genetic susceptibility to defective bacterial clearance in boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (ie toll-like receptors) has been identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similar to humans, microbial dysbiosis has been identified in IBD in cats and dogs. Frequently observed microbial changes are increased proteobacteria (ie Escherichia coli) with a simultaneous decrease in Firmicutes, in particular a reduced diversity of the Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (ie Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This suggests that these groups of bacteria, key producers of short-chain fatty acids, may play an important role in promoting gut health.",,"Suchodolski, J. S.",2011.0,May,,0
1995,Viruses detected in the cecal contents of healthy pigs representing a new genetic cluster in genogroup II of the genus Norwalk-like viruses,"Viruses of the genus Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) that have been identified in humans have been classified genetically into two major genetic groups, genogroups I and II (GI and GII), which together consist of at least 14 genetic subgroups. However, a comparable classification of NLVs in other animal species is still pending. We sequenced a 2 kb region from within the RNA polymerase gene to the 3 inch end of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) from two NLV strains previously detected in the cecal contents of healthy pigs. The entire ORF2 sequences of these two NLV strains were analyzed for their genetic relationships to 15 human strains previously reported and used as references for the genetic classification of human NLV strains and two other strains; first, a recently reported human strain that appears to represent a novel genetic subgroup of GII; and the other an animal NLV strain. Analysis of a matrix showing pairwise identities and the topology of a neighbor-joining tree showed that the two pig strains could be classified into a new genetic subgroup of GII based on the amino acid sequences of the entire capsid protein. The grouping of the two pig strains was well confirmed by results of similar analyzes of the nucleotide sequences of the entire ORF2 and a 510 base region at the 3 inch end of ORF1. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Sugieda, M.;Nakajima, S.",2002.0,,10.1016/s0168-1702(02)00107-7,0
1996,Differentiation of respiratory syncytial virus subgroups with cDNA probes in a nucleic acid hybridization assay,"new approach to determining the respiratory syncytial (RS) virus subgroups was developed using a simple nucleic acid filter hybridization technique. By this method, virus-infected cells are bound and fixed in a single step, and the viral RNA in the fixed cell preparation is directly characterized by its ability to hybridize to cDNA probes specific for either the A or B subgroups of the RS are virus. The subgroup-specific probes were constructed from cDNA clones encoding part of the extracellular domain of the RS virus G protein of either RS virus subgroup B (8/60) or RS virus subgroup A (A2). corresponded. The cDNA probes were 32 P labeled and used to analyze RS virus isolates collected over a three decade period. Replicate matrices from infected cell preparations were hybridized with either subgroup A or B probe. The subgroup assignments of 40 viruses tested by nucleic acid hybridization were consistent with the results of subgroup determinations based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies, which was previously the only method available to determine the subgroup classification of RS virus isolates. The nucleic acid hybridization assay has the advantage of providing a broad differentiation of the two subgroups based on nucleic acid homology, regardless of minor antigenic differences detected in assays using monoclonal antibodies. The nucleic acid hybridization technique provides a reliable method for characterizing the RS virus subset.",,"Sullender, W. M.;Anderson, L. J.;Anderson, K.;Wertz, G. W.",1990.0,,,0

Unlike previously published bELISAs, which require preparation of reagents or manipulation by the end-user, or have not been evaluated for use in mammals and birds, this assay is performed using commercially available recombinant nucleoprotein antigen and corresponding nucleoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody and has been shown to work with multiple avian and mammalian species. The effectiveness of the bELISA as a serum screening assay was compared to the agar gel immunodiffusion assay (AGID) using 251 serum samples obtained from experimentally infected mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). The agreement between the AGID test and the bELISA was 94.1% (95% CI = 89.9, 98.3) for raccoons and 71.2% (95% CI = 63.5, 78.9) for mallards and 82.8% (95% CI = 78.2, 87.3) overall. The bELISA was more sensitive than the AGID assay as demonstrated by the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus earlier in experimental infection studies and at higher serial dilutions. The effectiveness of the bELISA for monitoring natural influenza A virus exposure was also compared to the AGID assay using an additional 745 serum samples from six avian and six mammalian species. This bELISA provides a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive technique for large-scale monitoring of influenza A virus exposure in taxonomically diverse vertebrate species.",,"Sullivan, H. J.;Blitvich, B.

Here, seven PBV-RT-PCR-positive stool samples from children with diarrhea and four stool samples from healthy children as controls were analyzed by viral metagenomics. The results showed that all seven diarrhea fecal samples contained high titers of PBV sequences, while three of the controls were negative and had a low PBV titer. Three of the diarrhea fecal samples were also positive for other viruses including anellovirus, human gyrovirus, human parechovirus and porcine stool-associated circular virus. PBV sequences from the seven patients were assembled, generating seven large contigs with the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) ORF.

To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains currently prevalent in China, a total of 16,256 samples from pig farms in 27 provinces of China suspected of being infected with PRV were analyzed for the detection of PRV between 2012 and 2017. Since the extensive use of gE-deleted PRV vaccine in China, the PRV-gE has been used to determine wild-type virus infection by PCR. Of the 16,256 samples detected, approximately 1,345 samples were positive for detection of PRV-gE, representing an average positive rate of 8.27%. Positive PRV detection rates from 2012 to 2017 were 11.92% (153/1284), 12.19% (225/1846), 6.70% (169/2523), 11.10% (269/2424), 5.57% (147/2640) and 6.90% (382/5539), respectively. To understand the genetic properties of the currently circulating PRV strains, 25 PRV strains isolated from these PRV-gE positive samples were selected for further investigation. Phylogenetic analyzes based on gB, gC and gE showed that the PRV strains dominant in China had a remarkably strong evolutionary relationship with PRVs from other countries, which could explain the observation that the Bartha-K61 vaccine did not fully protect against emerging strains could offer. Sequence alignments identified many amino acid changes within the gB, gC, and gE proteins of PRVs circulating after the outbreak in China compared to those from other countries or those prevalent in China; These changes could also affect the protective efficacy of previously used vaccines in China and may be partly related to the increased virulence of the current PRV epidemic strains in China.",,"Sun, Y.;Liang, W.;Liu, Q.;Zhao, T.;Zhu, H.;Hua, L.;Peng, Z.;Tang, X.;Stratton, C.

In this study, we report for the first time the isolation and genetic analysis of three novel triple reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses from pigs in Tianjin, north China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel viruses contained genes from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP), Eurasian pigs (HA, NA, and M), and triple reassorted pigs (NS). This indicated that the rearrangement between the 2009 H1N1, Eurasian swine influenza and triple reassortant swine influenza viruses had occurred in pigs in Tianjin and led to the generation of new viruses. In addition, three humanoid H1N1 viruses, two classical swine H1N1 viruses, and two Eurasian swine H1N1 viruses were isolated during swine influenza virus surveillance from 2009 to 2013, suggesting that multiple genetic lineages of swine H1N1 viruses exist in of the pig population circulate together in Tianjin, China.

The results indicated that all three strains belong to the NDV genotype V and are virulent as judged by the intracerebral pathogenicity index and the polybasic amino acid sequence at the cleavage site of the fusion protein. In 4-week-old SPF chickens, NDV-Belize-3/08 behaved like a typical velogenic viscerotropic NDV strain and caused severe necrohaemorrhagic lesions in the lymphoid organs with systemic virus distribution. The phylogenetic analysis of several representatives of the NDV genotype V revealed that the genotype V can be divided into three subgenotypes namely Va, Vb and Vc and that all tested isolates from Belize belong to the subgenotype Vb.

Therefore, the genetic and antigenic characterization of H10 influenza viruses and the development of an appropriate vaccine are essential to prepare for a future pandemic caused by H10 influenza viruses. However, current information on these properties of H10 influenza viruses circulating in birds is limited. In this study, genetic analysis of H10 influenza viruses revealed that the viruses recently circulating in wild birds in East Asia are genetically close to human H10N8 influenza viruses. In addition, the antigenicity of the H10 influenza viruses was stable among the viruses circulating in birds. An inactivated vaccine genetically and antigenically similar to human H10 influenza viruses was prepared from A/duck/Mongolia/245/2015 (H10N3).

This virus is an RNA virus and resembles bluetongue virus in biological (Omori et al., 1969a,b; Matsumoto et al., 1970) and physicochemical (Inaba et al., 1970) properties. The diameter of the virion is 55 nm and the capsid consists of 32 capsomeres (Saito et al., 1972; Ito et al., 1973). There is no evidence of serological cross-reaction between Ibaraki virus and bluetongue virus (Inaba et al., 1970). It is not known whether Ibaraki virus RNA is single-stranded or double-stranded; therefore the classification of Ibaraki virus is uncertain. The present paper presents evidence that this virus contains double-stranded RNA. It should therefore be classified in the same group as bluetongue virus, i.e. as orbivirus.",,"Suzuki, Y.;Saito, Y.;Nakagawa, S.",1977.0,,,0
2005,"Past, present and future of hepatitis E virus infection: zoonotic perspectives","The origin of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is not fully understood, but it is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen. To date, HEV has been isolated from many animal species. The family Hepeviridae consists of two genera. The Orthohepevirus genus includes four distinct species (A, B, C, and D), each with different genotypes. Within the species Orthohepevirus A, the host ranges HEV-1 and HEV-2 are restricted to humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 primarily infect a wide range of different animal species and are also zoonotic to humans. Previously, pig and wild boar species were thought to be the primary natural reservoir of HEV, but recently rabbits have also been identified as major carriers. In addition, the increasing number of HEV infections within the food supply chain underscores the important role of agricultural and food processing practices in limiting virus transmission. In particular, a Chinese commercial vaccine has the potential to protect humans and possibly animal reservoirs from HEV infection. This review summarizes the status of HEV infection worldwide in different animal species and outlines different routes of zoonotic transmission with reference to interspecies transmission and recent vaccine developments.",,"Syed, S.

2007,wide range of strain diversity in virulent and vaccine strains of alphaherpesviruses,"Alphaherpesviruses are widespread in the human population and include herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV). These viral pathogens cause epithelial lesions and then infect the nervous system to cause lifelong latency, reactivation, and spread. A related veterinary herpesvirus, pseudorabies (PRV), causes similar diseases in livestock, resulting in significant economic losses. Vaccines developed for VZV and PRV serve as useful models for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine. We present full genome sequence comparisons of the PRV vaccine strain Bartha and two virulent PRV isolates, Kaplan and Becker. These genomic sequences were determined by high-throughput sequencing and assembly and provide new insight into the attenuation of a mammalian alphaherpesvirus vaccine strain. We find many previously unknown coding differences between PRV Bartha and the virulent strains, including changes to the fusion proteins gH and gB and over forty other viral proteins. The variation in PRV protein sequences between strains is much closer to the values previously observed for HSV-1 than for the highly stable VZV proteome. Almost 20% of the PRV genome contains tandem short sequence repeats (SSRs), a class of nucleic acid motifs whose length variation has been implicated in changes in DNA binding site efficiency, transcriptional regulation, and protein interactions. We find SSRs throughout the herpesvirus family and provide the first global characterization of SSRs in viruses, both within and between strains. We find variations in SSR length between different isolates of PRV and HSV-1, which may provide a novel mechanism for interstrain phenotypic variation. Finally, we discovered a small number of polymorphic bases in each plaque-purified PRV strain and we characterize the effect of passage and plaque purification on these polymorphisms. These data add to the growing evidence that even plaque-purified stocks of stable DNA viruses exhibit limited sequence heterogeneity that is likely to trigger future strain evolution. © 2011 Szpara et al.",,"Szpara, M.

2008,A new microplate neutralization test for the typing of herpes simplex virus,"As a first step to simplify the typing of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), a microplate serum neutralization test for the assessment of complement-dependent neutralizing (CRN) antibodies was established. When immunizing guinea pigs with HSV type 2, the late sera were usually better at differentiating between HSV types than hyperimmune rabbit sera, with the CRN titer against the heterologous HSV type 1 being much lower than the homologous titer. Sera from guinea pigs immunized with HSV type 1 showed approximately the same level of cross-reactivity against HSV type 2 as rabbit antisera. Guinea pig sera with minimal cross-reactivity levels were selected and their high dilution (1:160) and complement were added to serial 10-fold virus dilutions in the microplate titration of virus infectivity. A selective reduction in virus titer by each antiserum could determine the HSV type. No equivocal incident was found in a number of strains, including many fresh isolates. The typing result agreed with that obtained by a modification of the method of Yang et al. was determined based on virus titers obtained with Vero and primary chick embryo cells. Typing based on plaques in chick embryo cells sometimes failed to identify type 1 HSV.",,"Tada, A.;Yoshino, K.",1978.0,,,0
2009,The bovine virus diarrhea virus 1 is divided into different subgenotypes depending on the analyzed region within the viral genome,"Phylogenetic analyzes of Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) were performed based on the nucleotide sequences of the 5 inch untranslated region (5-UTR) and the E2-encoding gene. Thirty-six BVDV detected in naturally infected cattle in the northern region of Japan were classified into three genotypes, BVDV1a, BVDV1b and BVDV2, in a 5-UTR pedigree. BVDV1c was identified in a phylogenetic tree constructed from the E2-encoding gene, and viruses classified in BVDV1c were placed in BVDV1a in the 5-UTR pedigree. Furthermore, BVDV1a and BVDV1b clustered closer together in the E2 phylogenetic tree than in the 5-UTR tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic analysis of the E2 gene is more useful for identifying subgenotypes within BVDV1. © 2004 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Tajima, M.",2004.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2003.11.011,0

Conducting a survey of HEV infections among 566 wild boar captured in Japan between January 2010 and August 2013, we found 24 boars (4.2%) with persistent HEV infections: 13 had HEV genotype 3, 10 had HEV genotype 4 and the rest The boar possessed a novel HEV variant (designated wbJNN_13). The entire wbJNN_13 genome was 7247 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail and differed significantly from known HEV isolates of genotypes 1 to 4 derived from human, pig, wild boar, deer, mongoose and rabbit by 22 .4-28.2%, JBOAR135-Shiz09 and wbJOY_06 by 19.6-21.9% and rat, ferret, bat and avian HEV isolates by 40.9-46.1% across the genome . Pedigrees confirmed that wbJNN_13 is distantly related to all known HEV isolates. A Simplot analysis revealed no significant recombination between the existing HEV strains. These results indicate the presence of at least three genetic lineages of putative boar-native HEV strains.

2011,Phylogenetic characterization of H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated in Indonesia between 2003 and 2007,"The widespread distribution of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus poses a global threat to human health. Indonesia has had the highest number of human infections and deaths caused by these viruses. To understand the enzootic conditions of the viruses in Indonesia, 24 H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry from 2003 to 2007 were phylogenetically characterized. Although previous studies classified the Indonesian viruses exclusively into clades 2.1.1-2.1.3, our phylogenetic analyzes revealed a new sublineage that did not belong to any of the current clades. In addition, novel reassortant viruses that emerged between this new sublineage and other clades in Java Island in 2005-2006 were identified. H5N1 viruses were introduced multiple times from Java Island to Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Sumatra Island between 2003 and 2007, resulting in geographical spread of these viruses in Indonesia. These results identify Java Island as the epicenter of the Indonesian spread of the H5N1 virus. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,"Takano, R.;Nidom, C.

2014,A thymic cell marker in mouse leukemia virus-induced rat lymphoma,"specific marker for an immature population of thymus cells in the rat was demonstrated by rosette formation between thymus cells and guinea pig erythrocytes. This method was used to classify murine leukemia virus-induced rat lymphomas. Eight of nine Grobvirus-induced rat lymphoma lines originating in the thymus formed rosettes; whereas Friend, Rauscher, or Moloney virus-induced rat lymphoma lines derived from either the thymus, spleen, or mesenteric lymph nodes did not rosette. The percentage of total cells that rosettes in the gross lymphoma lines decreased with in vivo passages. If the tumor cells were subjected to trypsin treatment, then the tumor cells would form rosettes. Lymphoma lines lacking rosette-forming cells failed to form rosettes after trypsin treatment. An immunofluorescence test showed that none of the lymphoma lines induced by Gross, Friend, Rauscher or Moloney viruses carried the surface immunoglobulin characteristic of B cells. These results suggest that macrolymphomas may arise from the thymic cortex and that Friend, Rauscher, or Moloney lymphomas arise from either mature thymic cells (non-rosette forming cells) or from a subpopulation of the B cell lineage that does cannot have the surface immunoglobulin G receptor.",,"Takeichi, N.;Suzuki, K.;Kobayashi, H.",1979.0,,,0

Whole genome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates represented 15 genotypes, corresponding to the genetic constellation of the eight segments. All H1N1 viruses were fully A(H1N1)-pdm09 viruses, while all H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were reassortants among 5 different ancestral viruses: H1 and H3 triple reassortant (TR) IAV-S, originating before 2009 from North America originated human seasonal H1, human seasonal H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Notably, 93% of the reassorted IAV-S retained M genes derived from A(H1N1)pdm09, indicating some advantage in terms of their host adaptation. Monte Carlo analysis of Bayesian Markov chain revealed that the multiple introduction of A(H1N1)pdm09 and TR IAV-S into the Vietnamese pig population has driven the genetic diversity of the currently circulating Vietnamese IAV-S. Furthermore, our results indicate that a reassortant IAV-S with human-like H3 and N2 genes and an A(H1N1)pdm09 origin M gene probably caused a human case in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010 .

2017,Evaluation methods for whole genome sequencing of avian avulavirus-1,"Background: The avian avulavirus-1 (AAvV-1, formerly Newcastle Disease Virus) is responsible for the outbreak of poultry and wild bird disease. Numerous whole genome sequencing methods have been described for this virus. These methods included cloning, amplification of specific primers, shotgun PCR approaches, sequence-independent single primer amplification, and next-generation sequencing platform kits. Methods: Three methods were used to sequence 173 Israeli avian avulavirus-1 field isolates and one vaccine (VH) strain. Sequencing was performed on Proton and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and, to a lesser extent, Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq sequencers. Target Specific Primer (SP) and Sequence Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) products sequenced via the Ion Torrent Sequencer exhibited high error rates and truncated genomes. All next generation sequencing platform sequencing kits generated high sequence fidelity and near complete genomic size. Results: A high level of mutations was observed in the intergenic regions between the avian Avulavirus-1 genes. Within genes, several regions are more mutated than the fusion region currently used for typing.

2018,Evaluation of broadband PCR electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) system and virus microarrays for virus detection,"Advanced nucleic acid-based technologies are powerful research tools for novel virus discovery, but need to be standardized for broader applications such as virus detection in biological products and clinical samples. We used well-characterized retrovirus stocks to assess the limit of detection (LOD) for broadband PCR using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS or PLEX-ID), RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. The results showed that in the absence of background cellular nucleic acids, PLEX-ID and RT-PCR had a similar LOD for xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (XMRV; 3.12 particles per μl), while the sensitivity of virus detection was 10-fold higher was virus microarrays. When virus was spiked into a background of cellular nucleic acids, the LOD remained the same using PLEX-ID, while virus detection by RT-PCR was 10-fold less sensitive and no virus could be detected by microarrays. Expected endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences were detected in cell lines tested, and known species-specific viral sequences were detected in bovine serum and porcine trypsin. A follow-up strategy was developed using PCR amplification, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics to show that an RD114-like retroviral sequence detected by PLEX-ID in canine cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Cf2Th canine thymus) was due to defective endogenous gammaretrovirus-related sequences. © 2014 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Taliaferro, L.

2020,A generic assay for whole genome amplification and deep sequencing of Enterovirus A71,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has emerged as the leading cause of large outbreaks of severe and sometimes fatal hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the Asia-Pacific region. EV-A71 outbreaks have been associated with (sub)genogroup switches, sometimes accompanied by recombination events. Understanding EV-A71 population dynamics is therefore crucial to understanding this emerging infection and can provide crucial information for vaccine development. Despite the public health burden of EV-A71, relatively few full genome sequences of EV-A71 are available for analysis and from limited geographic locations. The availability of an efficient method for whole genome sequencing would stimulate efforts to generate more viral sequence data. Here we report for the first time the development of a next-generation sequencing-based protocol for sequencing the entire genome of EV-A71 directly from clinical samples. We were able to sequence viruses of subgenogroup C4 and B5, while RNA was successfully amplified from culture materials of different EV-A71 subgenogroups belonging to both genogroup B and C. The nature of the genetic diversity within the host was examined in 22 clinical specimens, revealing 107 positions carrying minor variants (ranging from 0 to 15 variants per specimen). Our analysis of EV-A71 strains collected in 2013 showed that they all belonged to subgenogroup B5, representing the first report of this subgenogroup in Vietnam.

2022,Suppression of coronavirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors,"Coronaviruses infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species, causing severe disease in humans, cats, mice, and birds in the forms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), mouse hepatitis, and avian infectious bronchitis, respectively. No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for either the SARS coronavirus or the FIP virus, both of which cause deadly diseases. A cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), has been reported to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. Inhibition of calcineurin blocks nuclear factor translocation of activated T cells from the cytosol to the nucleus, preventing transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been reported for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. In addition, many viruses require cyclophilins for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication. © 2013 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Tanaka, Y.;Sato, Y.;Sasaki, T.",2013.0,,10.3390/v5051250,0

There are many clinical syndromes in which viruses are suspected to play a role, but in which traditional microbiological techniques routinely fail to reveal the etiological agent. In addition, emerging viruses continue to pose challenges to human populations due to the encroachment of human settlements into animal and livestock habitats, globalization, climate change, increasing numbers of immunocompromised people, and bioterrorism. Metagenomics-based tools such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing are ideal to address these challenges.

2025,"Molecular evolution of porcine Japanese encephalitis virus isolates in Oita, Japan during 1980-2009","To identify patterns of genetic modification in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strains circulating in Oita, the complete envelope (E) gene was sequenced for 35 isolates from pigs over a 30-year period. Using nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, the genetic variation was examined, the phylogeny estimated and the selection pressure analysed. This study showed that the major genotype (G) of JEV isolates had shifted from GIII to GI in Oita in the mid-1990s. The selection intensities acting on the Oita GIII and GI strains were found to be nearly equal. This suggests that the intensity of selection may not be the reason for such a genotype shift observed in Oita. Pairwise comparisons showed the high conservation of the E gene at the protein level. Compared to the Oita GIII strains, all Oita GI strains shared four amino acid changes at E129 (TM), E222 (AS), E327 (ST), and E366 (AS). Among all 70 JEV isolates involved in this publication, the GI strains shared only one amino acid change at E222 (AA) compared to the GIII strains. No strong evidence for positive selection was found, JEV evolution was generally subject to strong purifying selection, but an ongoing evolutionary pathway was found to lie beneath relaxed purifying selection in Oita.

Tracheal swabs (n = 60), cloacal swabs (n = 50) and convalescent sera (n = 110) from the flocks were sent to the laboratory for diagnostics. Virus isolation was attempted in specific pathogen-free embryonating chicken eggs and Vero and MDCK cells. Virus characterization was performed using agar gel immunodiffusion, hemagglutination assay, hemagglutination inhibition assay, virus neutralization assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. A presumptive influenza virus was successfully propagated and isolated at the first passage in MDCK cells, but initially not in Vero cells or specific pathogen-free chick embryos. After two passages in MDCK cells, the isolate could be propagated in specifically pathogen-free chicken embryos. Preliminary sequence analysis of the isolated virus confirmed it to be an influenza A virus with almost 100% (235/236) identity to the swine influenza A virus matrix gene, A/Swine/Illinois/100084/01 (H1N2) , acted. However, it was not possible to subtype the virus using conventional serotyping methods. The results of the genetic characterization of the isolated virus showed that it was of the H3N2 subtype and was designated A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2). Phylogenetic analysis of the eight gene segments of the virus showed that isolate A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) was most closely related to the triple reassortant H3N2 swine viruses [A/Swine/WI/14094/99 (H3N2) ] , which has been circulating among swine in the United States since 1998 and contains gene segments from avian, swine, and human viruses. A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolated from turkeys in this study was classified as a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus because it caused only a decrease in egg production with minor other clinical signs and no mortality.",,"Tang, Y.;Lee, C.

Sequence comparison of nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of all 10 genome segments revealed 58.1-100% and 51.4-100% aa identity between the two variant strains and 54.3-89.4% and 49.5-98.1% aa identity between the two variants and classic vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed moderate to significant divergence in nt sequence between the two variants and the ARV reference strains. These results have demonstrated the first naturally occurring co-infection of two ARV variants in commercial young laying hens and provided scientific evidence that multiple ARV strains can be present simultaneously in a chicken host species.",,"Tang, Y.;Lin, L.;Sebastian, A.;Lu, H.",2016.0,,10.1038/srep24519,0

The genome of the field strain PA TARV was 23,496 bp long with 10 dsRNA segments encoding 12 viral proteins. The lengths of the genomic segments ranged from 1192 bp (S4) to 3959 bp (L1). The 5' and 3' conserved terminal sequences of the PA-TARV field strain were similar to the two Minnesota (MN) TARVs (MN9 and MN10) recently published and the avian orthoreovirus (ARV) reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of all 10 genome segments revealed that there was a low to significant nucleotide sequence mismatch between the PA-TARV field strain and the reference TARV and ARV strains. Analysis of the PA TARV sequence shows that this PA TARV field strain is a unique strain and differs from TARV MN9 or MN10 in the M2 segment genes and the ARV S1133 vaccine strain.",,"Tang, Y.;Lu, H.;Sebastian, A.;Yeh, Y.

2030,Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) open reading frames 1a and 1b jointly initiate viral negative-strand RNA synthesis,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) poses an ongoing threat to the swine industry, particularly when highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) emerges. Previous studies have shown that PRRSV RNA synthesis correlates with HP PRRSV virulence. PRRSV RNA synthesis involves genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA, and these processes require negative-strand RNA as a template. However, the mechanisms involved in PRRSV minus-strand RNA synthesis are not yet fully understood. A mini-genome system can be used to assess viral replication mechanisms and assess the effects of potential antiviral drugs on viral replicase activities. In this study, we developed a minigenome system using firefly luciferase as a reporter. Based on this system, we found that the PRRSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp9 alone was unable to activate virus negative-strand RNA synthesis. We have also shown that combinations of open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b are required for viral minus-strand RNA synthesis.",,"Tang, Y. D.;Fang, Q. Q.;Liu, J. T.;Wang, T.

2031,Combining a comprehensive analysis of off-site lambda phage integration with a CRISPR-based means to characterize downstream physiology,"During its lysogenic life cycle, the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. In this report, we analyze lambda phage integration into non-canonical sites using next-generation sequencing and show that it generates significant genetic diversity by targeting over 300 unique sites in the Escherichia coli host genome. Furthermore, these integration events can have important phenotypic consequences for the host, including changes in cell motility and increased antibiotic resistance. Importantly, the new technologies we developed to enable this study—sequencing secondary sites using next-generation sequencing, and then selecting relevant lysogens using CRISPR (clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9-based Selection - broadly applicable to other phage bacteria <b>IMPORTANT</b> Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogenesis, in which the phage genome becomes integrated into the host chromosome. While phage integration generally occurs at a specific site in the host chromosome, it is known to occur at other, so-called secondary, sites as well. In this study, we developed a new experimental technology to comprehensively study secondary integration sites and discovered that phage can integrate into over 300 unique sites in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. We further developed an assay to study the phenotypic consequences of such different integration events and found that phage integration can cause changes in evolutionarily relevant traits such as bacterial motility and an increase in antibiotic resistance. Importantly, our method is easily applicable to other phage-bacteria systems.",,"Tanouchi, Y.;Covert, M. W.",2017.0,09 19,,0
2032,A metagenomic approach to characterize temperate bacteriophage populations from patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis without cystic fibrosis,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), usually a ground commensal, is an important opportunistic pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (nCFBR). Persistent infection correlates with accelerated decline in lung function and early mortality. Horizontal DNA transfer by temperate bacteriophages can confer gene function and selective advantages on their bacterial host within the restricted environment of the lower lung. In this study, we chemically induce temperate bacteriophages from Pa clonal cultures and identify their mixed viral communities using metagenomic approaches. We compared 92 moderate phage metagenomes stratified by these clinical backgrounds (47 CF and 45 nCFBR-Pa isolates) using MG-RAST and GeneWise2. The KEGG analysis shows that the complexity of the transport of accessory genes of temperate phages increases with the duration and severity of the disease. In addition, we identify the presence of Ig-like motifs in phage structural genes associated with bacterial adhesion and carbohydrate binding, including Big_2, He_Pig, and Fn3.

2036,"Virology, serology and demography of hepatitis E virus blood donors in south-east England","BACKGROUND The hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (G3) in England comprises two main phylogenetic groups (group 1 and group 2) and can be transmitted by transfusion. Unselected screening identified 79 viremic donors; 76 participated in a follow-up study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Viral RNA dynamics, phylogenetics and seroconversion were characterized in the donors. Detailed demographic, travel, clinical, and lifestyle questionnaires were completed. RESULTS The majority of viremic subjects (57/79) were seronegative at the time of donation, but all seroconverted. The viremia was short-lived, with a median of 6.5 weeks to confirmed viral clearance. All infections were acquired in the UK and were G3, with group 2 virus predominating (43/54; 80%). Infection was associated with some clinical symptoms both at and after donation (8/77; 10%). Viral load and symptoms were more pronounced in group 1 infections. There was no serological evidence of reinfection. Male donors were more common (p=0.002); both male and female donors were older than comparison donors. Animal contact was unlikely to be the source of infection. Eating chicken and pork was common to all infected donors; processed pork was most commonly purchased from a particular retail chain. CONCLUSION Viremic donors represent a primary infection in older members of the community and reflect a widespread zoonosis in the UK. The two phylogenetic groups of HEV G3 show different pathogenicity and the more common group 2 appears to be less adapted to humans. There are no objective demographic criteria that can identify donors at increased risk of HEV.",,"Tedder, R. S.;Tettmar, K. I.;Brailsford, S.

2037,Increased prevalence of anellovirus in pediatric patients with fever,"The Anelloviridae family consists of non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. Three genera of anelloviruses are known to infect humans, namely TTV, TTMDV and TTMV. Although anelloviruses were originally thought to cause non-AG viral hepatitis, continued research to date has not shown any definitive links between anellovirus and human disease. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients aged 2 to 36 months. We found that although anelloviruses were present in a large number of samples from both febrile and afebrile patients, they were more abundant in the plasma and nasopharynx (NP) samples from febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. Using PCR to detect each of the three anellovirus species that infect humans, we found that the anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV were more common in plasma and NP samples from febrile patients than in afebrile controls. This was not the case for the species TTMV, which was found in similar percentages of febrile and nonfebrile patient samples. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of plasma and NP samples containing anellovirus increased with age until patients reached 19 to 24 months of age, after which the percentage of anellovirus-positive patient samples fell. This trend was striking for TTV and TTMDV and very moderate for TTMV in both plasma and NP samples. Finally, as the temperature of febrile patients increased, so did the frequency of TTV and TTMDV detection. Again, TTMV was equally present in febrile and nonfebrile patient samples. Taken together, these data show that the human anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV are associated with fever in children, while the closely related human anellovirus TTMV has no association with fever.",,"TeKippe, E.

2038,Animal viral metagenomics as a tool to detect zoonoses prior to human infection?,"Many human viral infections are of zoonotic, ie wild or domesticated, origin. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly through contact with an animal or indirectly through the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a blood-sucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate to its new human host, human-to-human transmission can occur, potentially leading to an epidemic like the A/H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009. Therefore, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important public health challenge in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e. the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, shows promise for the surveillance of such diseases and can be performed by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and become arthropods that are in close contact with humans. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge on viral diversity within such animals (particularly blood-sucking arthropods, wild and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present their potential future application for zoonotic and arboviral disease surveillance. © 2014 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Temmam, S.;Davoust, B.;Berenger, J.

2039,Faustovirus-like asfarvirus in hematophagous mosquitoes and their vertebrate hosts,"Faustovirus, a new giant virus related to Asfarviridae, was recently isolated in Vermamoeba vermiformis, a protist found in sewage in various geographic locations and occasionally reported in cases of human eye infections. As part of a global metagenomic analysis of viral communities existing in midges, we report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and its detection in their animal hosts. DNA virome analysis of three pools of Culicoides sp., stuffed female Culicoides imicola and unstuffed male/female C. imicola mosquitoes collected in Senegal revealed the presence of giant amoeba-infecting viruses and a plurality of sequences among them associated with the Faustovirus. Phylogenetic analyzes performed on several structural genes of Faustovirus confirmed the clustering of arthropod-borne Faustovirus with sewage-borne Faustoviruses with a clear geographical clustering of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphologies and diameters compatible with Faustovirus. The presence of the infectious arthropod-borne Faustovirus was finally confirmed by the successful isolation of V. vermiformis amoebas. A global proteomic analysis of mosquitoes revealed that the blood meal came from bovine, rodent and human arthropods. Further screening of bovine sera and rodent tissue revealed that the prevalence of Faustovirus was estimated at 38% in rodents and 14% in cattle, suggesting a possible origin of Faustovirus occurrence in arthropods through ingestion of contaminated blood meal. Viral loads were highest in rodent urine and kidney samples, suggesting possible shedding of viral particles into the environment. Faustovirus DNA polymerase-related sequences were also detected in more than 9% and 11% of febrile patients and in sera from healthy Senegalese people, respectively. Our study therefore underscores the need to investigate the role of arthropods, wild and domestic animals in the life cycle of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and in particular in the environmental cycle of Faustovirus.",,"Temmam, S.;Monteil-Bouchard, S.;Sambou, M.;Aubadie-Ladrix, M.;Azza, S.;Decloquement, P.;Bou Khalil, J.

In the present work, we report the isolation and characterization of Newcastle disease (NDV) viruses recovered from Eurasian collared pigeons in 2000-2001 and compare them to isolates recovered from feral pigeons (Columba livia ) were won. All isolates could be classified as avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV1) and belonged to the group of pigeon variants (PPMV1) since their hemagglutinating activity was inhibited by the PPMV1-specific mAb 161/617. The intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranged from 0.68 to 1.38 and all isolates contained several basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent viruses. The phylogenetic analysis of the isolates shows that 18/20 of them form a separate cluster from the isolates obtained from pigeons in the same period. These results suggest that different lineages are circulating in feral pigeon populations and that a separate lineage affects the Eurasian collared pigeon.",,"Terregino, C.;Cattoli, G.;Grossele, B.;Bertoli, E.;Tisato, E.;Capua, I.",2003.0,,10.1080/0307,0
2043,Heterologous viral expression systems in fosmid vectors increase the functional analysis potential of metagenomic libraries,"The exceptional potential of metagenomic functional analysis to identify activities of interest in uncultured microorganisms has been limited by reduced gene expression in surrogate hosts. We have developed vectors and specialized E. coli strains as improved heterologous expression systems for metagenomic DNA, taking advantage of viral components that prevent transcription termination at metagenomic terminators. One of the systems uses phage T7 RNA polymerase to drive metagenomic gene expression, while the other approach uses the lambda phage transcriptional antitermination protein N to limit transcription termination. A metagenomic library was constructed and functionally screened to identify genes conferring carbenicillin resistance to E. coli. Using these enhanced expression systems resulted in a 6-fold increase in the frequency of carbenicillin-resistant clones. Subcloning and sequence analysis showed that efflux pumps in addition to β-lactamases can not only contribute to carbenicillin resistance, but are actually sufficient to mediate carbenicillin resistance.",,"TerrÃ³n-GonzÃ¡lez, L.;Medina, C.;LimÃ³n-MortÃ©s, M.

2044,"Identification of a novel aviadenovirus, termed pigeon adenovirus 2, in domestic pigeons (Columba livia)","Young pigeon disease syndrome (YPDS) mainly affects young pigeons under one year old and causes crop congestion, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia and occasionally death. This disease is a major health concern internationally due to its seasonal occurrence in competitions such as carrier pigeon races or ornamental bird shows. While the etiology of YPDS is still unclear, adenoviruses are often discussed as possible causative agents. Electron microscopy of faeces from a YPDS outbreak showed massive shedding of adenovirus-like particles. Whole genome sequencing of this sample identified a novel adenovirus tentatively named Pigeon Adenovirus 2 (PiAdV-2). Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyzes indicate that PiAdV-2 belongs to a new species within the genus Aviadenovirus, for which we propose the name Pigeon Aviadenovirus B. . In a screening of other herds affected by YPDS, two variants of PiAdV-2 (variants A and B) were detected that shared 97.6% nucleotide identity of partial polymerase sequences but only 79.7% nucleotide identity of partial hexon sequences. The distribution of both PiAdV-2 variants was further investigated in faecal samples collected between 2008 and 2015 from healthy or YPDS-affected carrier pigeons from different lofts. Regardless of their state of health, about 20% of the young and 13% of the adult flocks of pigeons carried PiAdV-2 variants. The birds were free of PiAdV-1 or other avidenoviruses as determined by PCRs targeting the aviadenovirus polymerase and the PiAdV-1 fiber gene, respectively. In conclusion, there is no evidence of a correlation between YPDS outbreaks and the presence of PiAdV-2 or other avidenoviruses, arguing against a causal role in this disease complex.",,"Teske, L.;Rubbenstroth, D.;Meixner, M.;Liere, K.;Bartels, H.;Rautenschlein, S.",2017.0,01 02,,0
2045,Characterization of a genetically heterogeneous porcine rotavirus C and other viruses present in the faecal virome of a Belgian piglet without diarrhea,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are becoming more accessible, leading to an expanded interest in the composition of the porcine enteric virome. In the present study, the faecal virome of a Belgian piglet without diarrhea was determined. Although only the virome of a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a group C porcine rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other fully characterized porcine RVC strain, Cowden. Its relationship to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the pig strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which may be serologically distinct from most other porcine RVC strains. A putative new RVC-VP6 genotype was also identified. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this stool sample contained the rare porcine genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical porcine RVA genotypes I5, A8 and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1 and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the piglet fecal virome also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. The results of the current study indicate that many viruses can be present simultaneously in faecal samples from piglets without diarrhea. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with disease, but they could still have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The rapid development of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections that may have gone unnoticed with traditional diagnostic techniques.

Here, the possibilities of nanopore sequencing for virus diagnostics were examined. First, cell culture grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were detected as early as 7 seconds into sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) at 3 hours. Next, the diarrheal feces of a week-old piglet were analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages that may have remodeled the piglet microbiome. Contigs were consistent with Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus phage. In addition, the porcine Kobuvirus was detected in faeces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but during a follow-up study. The retrospective analysis showed the wide distribution (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrhea piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methods will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be carried out.

2047,Molecular Characterization of Positive-Strand RNA Viruses: Pestiviruses and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV),"Molecular characterization has become an important tool for the analysis of viruses including their classification. The manuscript focuses on the molecular analysis of two members of the Pestivirus genus (Hog Cholera Virus, HCV and Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus, BVDV) and the recently discovered Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV). The first protein encoded within the single large pestivirus ORF is a nonstructural protein with autoproteolytic activity. The cleavage site between the protease and the capsid protein p14 was previously predicted, but recent experimental data indicate that processing occurs at a different site. The capsid protein is followed by a putative internal signal sequence and three glycoproteins that are part of the virion envelope. According to a new proposal for the nomenclature of the structural proteins of pestiviruses, they are designated C, E0, E1 and E2. The genomes of BVDV pairs isolated from animals suffering from mucosal diseases were analyzed. The genomes of cytopathogenic (cp) BVD viruses may contain inserts that are highly homologous to cellular sequences. In addition, cp BVDV can differ from its non-cytopathogenic (noncp) counterpart by mere rearrangement of viral sequences. The PRRS disease, which emerged a few years ago, is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus; the viral genome is positive polarity and 15 kb in size. Data on morphology, morphogenesis and virion composition already suggested that PRRSV belongs to a group of so-called arteriviruses that includes Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV), Lactate Dehydrogenase Elevating Virus (LDV) and Simian Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (SHFV). includes. This conclusion has now been confirmed by analyzing the genome organization, the gene expression strategy and by comparing derived protein sequences.",,"Thiel, H.

High HEV seroprevalences can be found in European pig populations. The aim of this study was to obtain prevalence data on HEV infection in pigs in Belgium and to phylogenetically compare Belgian human HEV sequences with those derived from pigs. In Belgian pigs, an ELISA screening prevalence of 73% (95% CI 68.8-77.5) was determined and part of the results were reassessed by Western Blot (WB). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed and scenarios for varying ELISA specificity relative to WB were analyzed. The seroprevalences estimated by the different scenarios ranged between 69 and 81% and are consistent with the high HEV exposure of the European pig population. Porcine HEV sequences were compared genetically to those detected in humans in Belgium and genotype 3 subtype f dominance was demonstrated in both pigs and humans. The high HEV seroprevalence in pigs and the close phylogenetic relationship between pig and human HEV sequences further support the risk of zoonotic transmission of HEV between humans and pigs. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Thiry, D.;Mauroy, A.;Saegerman, C.;Thomas, I.;Wautier, M.;Miry, C.;Czaplicki, G.;Berkvens, D.;Praet, N.;van der Poel, W.;Cariolet, R.;Brochier, B.;Thiry, E.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.06.004,0
2050,Molecular biology of bovine herpesvirus type 4,"Bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BHV-4) is a ubiquitous bovine virus. Its genome is a 144 ± 6 kb double-stranded DNA consisting of a unique central piece (L-DNA) flanked at both ends by tandem repeats called polyrepetitive DNA (prDNA or H-DNA). The overall arrangement of genes was obtained by analyzing homologies between short BHV-4 DNA sequences and corresponding genes from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). Gene expression is regulated in time. The glycoprotein precursor p(gp10/gp17) is expressed as a gamma-1 polypeptide. Glycoproteins gp1, gp8, gp11 and their precursors are gamma-2 proteins. Strain variation analysis allows the definition of two types of strains based on DNA patterns: the Movar 33/63-like and the DN 599-like strains.

2051,The Origin of Lentivirus Research: Maedi Visna Virus,"Maedi and Visna are contagious sheep diseases introduced to Iceland in 1933 by imported Karakul sheep. Maedi, a slowly progressive pneumonia, and the central nervous system disease Visna have been shown to be transmissible to sheep and are most likely caused by a virus. In 1957, the visna virus was isolated in tissue culture from the brain of sheep and the following year the maedi virus was isolated from the lungs of sheep. Both viruses showed similar cytopathic effects in tissue culture. Electron microscopic studies of ultrathin sections of Visna virus-infected cells revealed spherical particles 70–100 nm in diameter formed by budding from the cell membrane. Later studies showed identical particles in cultures infected with Maedi virus. This and several other comparative studies strongly suggest that maedi and visna were caused by strains of the same virus, later named maedi visna virus (MVV). Comparative studies in tissue culture suggested that MVV is related to animal RNA tumor viruses, the oncornaviruses. This was later supported by the finding that MVV is an RNA virus. A few months after reverse transcriptase was detected in oncornaviruses, the enzyme was also found in MVV virions. Thus, MVV has been classified as a retrovirus along with the oncornaviruses. However, MVV is not oncogenic in vivo or in vitro and was classified in 1975 in a subgroup of retroviruses called lentiviruses, which cause cytopathic action and slowly progressive inflammatory disease in animals in vitro, but are non-oncogenic. In the early 1980's the causative agent of AIDS was determined to be a non-oncogenic retrovirus and classified as a lentivirus. This made HIV the first human lentivirus. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",,"Thormar, H.",2013.0,,,0
2052,"Prevalence and diversity of H9N2 avian influenza in chickens in North Vietnam, 2014","Despite their classification as avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV), A/H9N2 viruses cause significant losses in poultry in many countries in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. To date, poultry surveillance in Vietnam has focused on the detection of influenza H5 viruses and there is limited knowledge of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of influenza H9. We determined the prevalence and diversity of influenza A virus in live bird markets (LBM) chickens from 7 North Vietnamese provinces using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from October to December 2014. Screening by real-time RT-PCR gave 1207/4900 (24.6%). from pooled swabs to be influenza A virus positive; the estimated overall prevalence after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) was 5.8% (CI 5.4-6.0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with M gene Ct < 26. No influenza H7 was detected; 422 (90.1%) were H9 positive; and 22 (4.7%) were H5 positive. There was no evidence of an interaction between the detection rates of H9 and H5 viruses. We sequenced 17 whole genomes from A/H9N2, 2 from A/H5N6 and 11 partial genomes. All H9N2 viruses had internal genes clustered with genotype 57 and closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H7N9 and A/H10N8. Using a 98% nucleotide divergence cutoff, we identified 9 distinct H9 genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introduction of H9 viruses into North Vietnam rather than in situ transmission. Further investigation of H9 prevalence and diversity in other regions of Vietnam is warranted to assess H9 endemic elsewhere in the country.",,"Thuy, D. M.;Peacock, T. P.;Bich, V. T.

2053,Chimeric Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome viruses display full function of genotype 1 envelope proteins in the genotype 2 backbone,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is divided into two genotypes, type 1 and type 2, which share only about 60% genetic identity. Here we report viable chimeric viruses in which the coat protein genes from ORF2a to ORF5 of vSHE (type 1) have been swapped into the genetic backbone of vAPRRS (type 2). We found that the genotype 1 envelope proteins were fully functional in genotype 2 PRRSV and the rescued chimeric progeny viruses displayed robust genetic stability and similar replication properties to the parental strains in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the substitution of entire ORFs between different porcine arterivirus genotypes.

2058,Targeted high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize microbial communities during composting of livestock deaths,"Aim A thorough understanding of the microbial community is necessary to ensure a significant reduction of pathogens during the composting process. Methods and Results Two biosecure, static composting systems containing cattle deaths were constructed in sub-zero temperatures. The temperature at each sampling site was measured continuously and samples were grouped as either <= 50 or >= 55 degrees C based on the temperature exposure required for effective pathogen inactivation during composting. High-throughput 454 sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial communities in each sample. Depending on the temperature, an accumulation of bacterial communities was observed. However, neither richness nor diversity differed between the temperature groups. Firmicutes was the most abundant strain in both temperature groups, but was more pronounced (63 mean point 6%) in samples >= 55 degrees C (P<0 mean point 05). Similar are members of Clostridia, Clostridium sensu stricto (3 mean dot 64%), Clostridium XI (0 mean dot 59%), UF (Clostridiaceae 1) (5 mean dot 29%) and UF (Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI) (6 mean dot dot 20%) were prominent at >= 55 °C (P < 0, dot 05 in the middle), likely reflecting spore survival and/or anaerobic microenvironments in passively aerated compost heaps. Members of Thermobifida (3 mean dot 54%), UO (Actinomycetales) (12 mean dot 29%), and UO (Bacillales) (19 mean dot 49%) were also prominent at >= 55 degrees C (P<0 mean dot 05 ). Conclusion Considerable spatial diversity exists within bacterial communities in field-scale compost heaps. The localized temperature at the sampling site may be one of the factors contributing to this phenomenon. Significance and Impact of the Study This is the first study to describe the profile of the microbial community using high-throughput targeted 16S rRNA sequencing in passively aerated composted livestock dies.",,"Tkachuk, V.

2059,An extensive repertoire of type III secretory effectors in Escherichia coli O157 and the role of lambdoid phage in their dissemination,"Several pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli use the Type III secretion to inject ""effector proteins"" into human cells, which then subvert eukaryotic cell biology to the bacterium's advantage. We used bioinformatics and experimental approaches to determine that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of >60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were judged to be probable pseudogenes, while 49 were judged to be potentially functional. A total of 39 proteins were experimentally confirmed as effectors: 31 by proteomics and 28 by translocation assays. At the protein level, the EHEC effector sequences fall into >20 families. The largest family, the NIeG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai tribe alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologues of effectors from plant pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and from Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG), as well as two other members of the Map/IpgB family. Genes encoding established or predicted effectors are found in >20 interchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine interchangeable effector loci residing within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type III secretion in E. coli is linked to a vast phage ""metagenome"" that serves as a crucible for the evolution of pathogenicity. © 2006 by the US National Academy of Sciences.",,"Tobe, T.;Beatson, S.

2061,Circoviruses: immunosuppressive threats to avian species: a review,"Circoviruses are small, non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses unique among animal viruses in having circular, single-stranded DNA genomes. Their genomes are also the smallest possessed by animal viruses. The circovirus family currently includes three members, chicken anemia virus, porcine circovirus and parrot beak and feather disease virus, with pigeon circovirus classified as a tentative member. Infections with each of the four circoviruses are associated with potentially fatal diseases in which virus-induced lymphoid tissue damage and immunosuppression are common features. Experiences with other animal virus families suggest that other animal species are infected by as yet undiscovered circoviruses and that they may have similar tissue tropism and disease-causing potential. Recent reports describing the association of circovirus-like viruses with immunodeficiency diseases in geese and southern black-backed gulls suggest that circovirus infections are more common in avian species than previously thought, and raise the question of whether novel circoviruses cause infection in poultry clinical and/or subclinical diseases that may be economically significant. This review has three purposes. First, the information currently available on the classified circoviruses and viruses considered circovirus-like will be summarized. Second, it aims to alert readers to the possibility that other bird species, including farmed poultry, may be infected with novel circoviruses. Finally, possible methods for discovering new circoviruses and combating infections by such viruses are suggested.",,"Todd, D.",2000.0,Oct,,0
2062,Morphogenesis of a cytomegalovirus from an American bison affected by malignant catarrhal fever,"herpesvirus isolated from multiple organs of an American bison afflicted with malignant catarrhal fever was cultured in fetal bovine spleen cells and examined by electron microscopy. The subtle structural features of the mature virion and the mode of virus morphogenesis were found to be similar to the herpesviruses, which are classified in the cytomegalovirus subgroup. The capsids were granular, hexagonal in shape, and contained pleomorphic cores in thin sections. The encasing of the capsids occurred mainly by budding on cytoplasmic membranes that appeared to be formed as distended vesicles of the Golgi apparatus; Budding on nuclear membranes has only rarely been observed. Cytoplasmic inclusions, consisting of granular threads and amorphous, electron-dense material, have been found associated with virions during the late stages of infection. The formation of cytoplasmic inclusions, morphogenesis and ultrastructure of the virus are all consistent with the classification of this virus as a cytomegalovirus.",,"Todd, W.

Objectives: Genotyping of VZV strains in Australia using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM) of SNPs in five gene targets. Study design: Extracted DNA from 78 samples from chickenpox and zoster patients was genotyped by HRM analysis of SNPs in five open reading frames (ORFs): 1 (685 G > A), 21 (33 725 C > T), 37 ( 66 288 G > A), 60 (101 464 C > A) and 62 (106 262 T > C) using a double-stranded (ds) DNA saturating dye, LC Green Plus. Results: For each genotype, the temperature shifts in the melting curve (Tm) differentiated the nucleotide present at that locus (P < 0.0001) with melting curve shifts between alleles ranging from 0.56 °C (ORF 37) to 3.34 °C (ORF 62). . The most frequently detected genotypes were the European type C (59%) and type B (18%) strains. This was followed by the African/Asian type A (14%) and Japanese J1 (9%), strains both widespread in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.

The assay uses a TaqMan MGB probe that hybridizes to a unique molecular signature of dIBDV. The assay successfully detected all evaluated strains belonging to the dIBDV genetic lineage and demonstrated high specificity and lack of cross-reactivity with non-dIBDVs, IBDV-negative specimens and other common avian viruses. Using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, we obtained acceptable PCR efficiencies and detection coefficients, and relatively low intra- and inter-assay variability.

Histopathologic features of the lesions were consistent with this diagnosis. Orf virus DNA, phylogenetically similar to an isolate from a captive musk ox at the Minnesota Zoo, USA, was detected in the lesions by PCR using parapoxvirus primers. In addition, there was a metaphyseal abscess with a cortical fistula in the right metacarpal, from which Brucella suis biovar 4 was isolated and the identification was supported by PCR.

The primer sets were used with PCR to screen tissue or tissue culture media suspected of containing virus from 54 PD outbreaks. The primer sets amplified DNA from all but one sample. Ten amplification patterns were discovered suggesting that PD is caused by a genetically heterogeneous viral population.

2072,Molecular phylogeny of the parrot acid herpesviruses causing Pacheco's disease: correlation of genotype with phenotypic expression,"Fragments of 419 bp of the UL16 open reading frame from 73 parrot herpesviruses (PsHVs) from the United States and Europe were sequenced. All viruses caused Pacheco's disease and serotypes of the European isolates were known. A pedigree derived from these sequences showed that the PsHVs that cause Pacheco's disease comprised four major genotypes, with each genotype containing between two and four variants. With the exception of two viruses, the serotypes of the virus isolates could be predicted from the genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 4 corresponded to serotype 1 isolates, genotype 2 corresponded to serotype 2 isolates, and genotype 3 corresponded to serotype 3 isolates. The single serotype 4 virus assigned to genotype 4. DNA from a virus with a unique serotype could not be amplified with primers that amplified DNA from all other PsHVs, and their classification remains unknown. Viruses representing all four genotypes were found in both the United States and Europe and therefore serotypes 1, 2 and 3 were predicted to be present in the United States. Serotype 4 was represented by a single European isolate that was genetically indistinguishable from serotype 1 viruses; therefore, the presence of serotype 4 in the United States could not be predicted. It has been found that genotype 4 viruses are most commonly associated with Pacheco disease in macaws and conures and are least likely to be isolated in chick embryo fibroblasts in the United States. All four genotypes caused deaths in Amazon parrots, but genotype 4 has only been associated with Pacheco disease in Amazons in Europe. Genotypes 2, 3 and 4, but not 1, have been found in African gray parrots.

The viral genes can be divided into three distinct kinetic groups: immediate early, early and late classes. In this study, a massively parallel sequencing technique based on the PacBio Single Molecule real-time sequencing platform was used to quantify the poly(A) fraction of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) lytic transcriptome during a 12-hour production interval. cells. Other approaches, including microarray, real-time RT-PCR, and Illumina sequencing, are able to detect only aggregated transcriptional activity of specific genomic regions, but not individual herpesvirus transcripts.

2074,Metagenomic evaluation of adventitious viruses in commercial bovine sera,"Animal serum is an indispensable supplement to cell culture media. Contamination of animal serum with incoming viruses has led to extensive regulatory action and product recalls. We used metagenomic methods to detect and characterize viral contaminants in 26 bovine serum samples from 12 manufacturers. Across samples, we have detected sequences with homology to 20 viruses at depths of up to 50,000 viral reads per million. The viruses detected represented nine virus families plus four taxonomically unassigned viruses and had both RNA genomes and DNA genomes. The sequences ranged from 28% to 96% and were similar at the amino acid level to viruses in the GenBank database. The number of viruses varied from zero to 11 among samples and from 1 to 11 among suppliers, with only one product from one supplier being completely 'clean' calculated from metagenomic data (viral reads per million) exactly matched the Ct values real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtq-PCR), with metagenomics being about as sensitive as rtq-PCR.

2075,Sequencing approach to analyze the role of quasi-species in classical swine fever,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a positive-sense RNA virus with a high degree of genetic variability among isolates. There is also great diversity in terms of virulence, with strains covering the entire spectrum from avirulent to highly virulent. The underlying genetic determinants are far from understood. Because RNA polymerases of RNA viruses lack proofreading activity, various genome variations called haplotypes occur during replication. A set of haplotypes is referred to as a viral quasi-species. Genetic variability can be a fitness advantage by facilitating a more effective escape from the host immune response. To investigate the correlation of quasispecies composition and virulence in vivo, we analyzed next-generation sequencing data from CSFV isolates of different virulence. Virus samples from pigs infected with the highly virulent isolates ""Koslov"" and ""Brescia"" showed higher quasispecies diversity and more nucleotide variability compared to samples from pigs infected with weakly and moderately virulent isolates.",,"Topfer, A.;Hoper, D.;Blome, S.;Beer, M.;Beerenwinkel, N.;Ruggli, N.;Leifer, I.",2013.0,1930-03-01 00:00:00,,0
2076,Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus: Most Slovenian isolates belong to genotypes 1d and 1f,"panel of 43 bovine viral diarrheal viruses isolated from mainly persistently infected cattle on 23 Slovenian farms between 1997 and 2001 was genetically characterized. Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures, reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR with primers targeting the 5-UTR and the Npro gene, followed by direct sequencing of the purified PCR products obtained for both genomic regions. The Npro sequences provided the best genetic resolution and also provided higher statistical support for the phylogenetic classification of the viruses. Thirty-eight of the Slovenian isolates belonged to genetic subtypes 1d and 1f, four were 1b and one subtype 1g. No BVDV type 2 viruses were found. This genetic prevalence was consistent with those previously reported for neighboring countries, in contrast to results reported for more distant European countries, e.g. B. France, Spain and the United Kingdom have been reported. Several virus isolates were analyzed from eight cattle herds; all but one of the isolates from each herd belonged to the same genetic group.

2077,Biological and molecular characterization of avian influenza virus (H9N2) isolates from Iran,"Three influenza A virus (H9N2) isolates obtained from three separate broiler flocks with different mortality rates were cloned twice in embryonated SPF chick eggs by limiting dilution. The biological properties of these isolates were studied in 4-week-old SPF chickens and chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures. The isolates did not cause mortality in the inoculated chickens, nor did they produce CPE in cell cultures, indicating low pathogenicity. 486 bp PCR products containing the sequences for the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site generated from the isolates were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Sequence analysis of the isolates' HA region containing the cleavage site revealed a similar sequence motif (PARSSRG) but different flanking regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the isolates were closely related to those previously isolated, indicating a common source. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the newer isolates were very similar to those from Saudi Arabia, Germany and Pakistan. It is postulated that the pathogenicity of Iranian isolates appears to be similar to that of other Eurasian isolates, with the exception of some Chinese isolates. It is possible that an increase in mortality under field conditions is caused by co-infection of newer isolates with bacteria such as Mycoplasma, Escherichia coli and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale rather than the emergence of a pathogenic H9N2 subtype of the virus.",,"Toroghi, R.;Momayez, R.",2006.0,,,0
2078,Emergence of the amantadine-resistant H5N1 avian influenza virus in India,"This study reports the genetic characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) (subtype H5N1) isolated from poultry in West Bengal, India. We analyzed all eight genome segments of two viruses isolated from chickens in January 2010 to understand their genetic relatedness to other Indian H5N1 isolates and possible links between different outbreaks. The viruses' hemagglutinin (HA) gene contained several basic amino acids at the cleavage site, a marker for high virulence in chickens. Of most concern, the viruses had a serine to asparagine amino acid substitution at position 31 of the M2 ion channel protein, suggesting the emergence of amantadine-resistant mutants that have not previously been reported in HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in India. The amino acid lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein illustrates the risk that the virus poses to mammals. In the phylogenetic trees, the viruses in all genes clustered within the lineage of avian isolates from India (2008-2009) and avian and human isolates from Bangladesh (2007-2009).

2079,First Genetic Characterization of Peste des Petits Ruminants from Niger: On the Advancing Frontline of the Asian Virus Lineage,"Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a serious transboundary infectious disease of small ruminants. The causative agent, the PPR virus (PPRV), can be divided into four genetically distinct lineages using phylogenetic analysis. In recent decades, Line IV of PPRV has dramatically expanded its geographic range from Asia to the Middle East and Africa, where it has gradually replaced other PPRV lines. Lineages I and II are historically common in West Africa. Currently, Line II appears to dominate the region, while the last recorded occurrence of Line I was in 1994. Recent studies reported the presence of lineage IV in Nigeria, suggesting that this lineage is spreading into West Africa. In Niger, a close neighboring country to Nigeria, PPRV has never been genetically characterized despite reports of the occurrence of PPR. In this study, pathological samples from diseased goats collected in 2013 during a suspected PPR outbreak in southern Niger near the Nigerian border were compared to samples collected in a previous investigation in October 2001 in southwestern Niger. These strains were characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify their genetic lineage. Our results show that lineages I and II circulated together in southwestern Niger in 2001, while the strain that caused the 2013 outbreak belonged to lineage IV and is closely related to the strains identified in Nigeria. These results confirm lineage IV progression in West Africa. The process of replacement of the PPRV lineage and its implications for the epidemiology and control of the disease in this region are unclear and should be the subject of further studies in this area.",,"Tounkara, K.;Bataille, A.;Adombi, C.

2080,Genetic and biological characterization of an H1N2 avian-like swine influenza virus generated by resorting circulating H1N1 and H3N2 avian-like subtypes in Denmark,"Background: Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are the most common subtypes in swine. In 2003, a rearranged H1N2 swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype emerged and spread in Denmark. In the present study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was genetically characterized and the infection dynamics compared to a “bird-like” H1N1 virus by an experimental infection study. methods. Sequence analyzes of the H1N2 virus were performed. Two groups of pigs were vaccinated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and an ""bird-like"" H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by an inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. Nasal virus shedding and pulmonary viral load were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassorted H1N2 virus contained a European ""bird-like"" H1 gene and a European ""pig-like"" N2 gene, making it genetically different from most H1N2 viruses circulating in Europe, but virus-like is reported in Sweden and Italy in 2009/2010. Sequence analysis of the internal genes revealed that the rearrangement likely occurred between circulating Danish 'bird-like' H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies and increased levels of acute phase proteins after vaccination. Pigs vaccinated with H1N2 showed nasal virus shedding for seven days, peaking on day 1 post-inoculation, two days earlier than H1N1-infected pigs and at a level six-fold higher. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 post-inoculation had high viral loads in all lung lobes. After the second vaccination, nasal virus shedding was minimal. There were no clinical signs other than elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. Conclusions: The H1N2 'bird-like' subtype, which has been established in the Danish pig population since at least 2003, is a reassortant between the circulating swine 'bird-like' H1N1 and H3N2. Danish H1N2 has a 'bird-like' H1 and is distinct from most other known H1N2 viruses in Europe and North America/Asia, which have H1 genes of human and 'classic swine' origin, respectively. However, the variant also seems to be circulating in countries such as Sweden and Italy. The infection dynamics of the newly sorted ""bird-like"" H1N2 are similar to the older ""bird-like"" H1N1 subtype. © 2013 Trebbien et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Trebbien, R.;Bragstad, K.;Larsen, L.

2081,Neuropathological survey shows underestimation of the prevalence of neuroinfectious diseases in cattle in Switzerland,"Neuroinfectious diseases in livestock pose a serious threat to animal health, but their prevalence is not well documented and the etiology of the disease often remains undetected. The aim of this study was to generate basic data on the prevalence of neuroinfectious diseases in cattle in Switzerland through neuropathological surveys and to identify disease-associated pathogens. The survey was conducted over a period of one year with a representative number of brainstem samples (n = 1816) from fallen cattle. Overall, 4% (n = 73) of the animals had significant lesions, the most common types of which indicated viral (n = 27) and bacterial (n = 31) etiologies. Follow-up diagnostics using immunohistochemistry, PCR protocols, and next-generation sequencing identified infection with Listeria monocytogenes (n = 6), ovine herpesvirus 2 (n = 7), bovine astrovirus CH13 (n = 2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (n = 6). ), bovine retrovirus CH15 (n=2), posavirus 1 (n=2), and porcine astroviruses (n=2). A retrospective, questionnaire-based study found that animal owners observed clinical signs of neurological disease in about a third of the cases with lesions, which is estimated to be about 85 cases per year in the adult fallen cattle population in Switzerland. This estimate stands in stark contrast to the number of cases reported to authorities and reveals a gap in disease surveillance. Systematic neuropathological assessments and subsequent molecular testing in neurologically diseased cattle could greatly improve the efficiency of disease detection to estimate the prevalence of endemic diseases, identify new or re-emerging pathogens, and provide ""early warning"" of disease outbreaks.",,"Truchet, L.;Walland, J.;Wuthrich, D.;Boujon, C.

2082,High-throughput sequencing reveals differential immune responses in the intestinal mucosa of two inbred lines affected by necrotic enteritis,"We examined the necrotic enteritis (NE)-induced transcripts of immune-related genes in the intestinal mucosa of two highly inbred white Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2, which share the same MHC haplotype and show different levels of NE susceptibility using high - Throughput RNA Sequencing Technology (RNA-Seq). NE was induced by the previously described coinfection model using Eimeria maxima and Clostridium perfringens. RNA-Seq generated over 38 million sequence reads for the Marek's disease (MD)-resistant 6.3 line and over 40 million reads for the MD-prone 7.2 line. Matching these sequences to the Gallus gallus genomic database revealed the expression of over 29,900 NE-induced gene transcripts in these two lines, of which 7,841 genes were significantly upregulated and 2,919 genes were downregulated in lineage 6.3 chickens, and 6,043 genes were significantly upregulated and 2,764 Genes were downregulated in the NE-induced line 7.2 compared to their uninfected controls. Analysis of 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Gene Ontology database revealed annotations for 246 biological processes, 215 molecular functions, and 81 cellular components. Among the 53 cytokines and 96 cytokine receptors, 15 cytokines and 29 cytokine receptors were highly expressed in lineage 6.3, while the expression of 15 cytokines and 15 cytokine receptors was higher in lineage 7.2 than in lineage 6.3 (fold change >=2, p<0.01) . In a hierarchical cluster analysis of novel mRNAs, the novel mRNA transcriptome showed higher expression at line 6.3 than line 7.2, consistent with the expression profile of immune-related target genes. In qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analysis, all examined genes showed similar responses to NE (correlation coefficient R=0.85–0.89, p<0.01) in both lineages 6.3 and 7.2. This study is the first report describing NE-induced DEGs and novel transcriptomes using RNA-seq data from two inbred chick lines showing different degrees of NE sensitivity.

The emergence of new viral diseases,"The sudden emergence of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a ""new"" pathogen is not an isolated case, as is shown, for example, by the frequent occurrence of new influenza virus strains. Often the new strains of the virus circulate alongside the older strains in a susceptible population, but crowding out of the older strains has also been observed. In rare cases, the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus or, most recently, with the causative agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. Mechanisms of formation are not always clearly understood, but altered host range appears to be a common occurrence. Whether a true host range change is occurring or whether the virus has adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently is often unknown.

Taiwan type O foot-and-mouth disease virus is genetically very homogeneous, as evidenced by the minute variation of 0.2-0.9% uncovered in 20 variants. Virus variants O/HCP-0314/TW/97 and O/TCP-022/TW/97 dominated FMD outbreaks and were widespread in most affected pig farming areas. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences around the major neutralizable antigenic sites on the VP1 polypeptide revealed no significant antigenic variation. However, the O/CHP-158/TW/97 variant had an alternative critical residue at position 43 in antigenic site 3, possibly due to selective printing in the field. Two vaccine production strains (O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 and O1/Campos/Brazil/71) are likely to provide partial heterologous protection of swine against O-Taiwan viruses. The Type O Taiwan variants clustered in sublineage A1 of four major lineages in the phylogenetic tree. Viruses O/Hong Kong/9/94 and O/1685/Moscow/Russia/95 in sublineage A2 are closely related to variants O Taiwan.

Since then, a variety of wild carnivores and other wildlife species have been found dead, neurologically ill, or exhibiting aggressive behavior across the island. To determine the animal species, geographic areas and environments affected, animal carcasses were examined for rabies using a direct fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The viral genomes from the brains of selected rabid animals were sequenced for the phylogeny of rabies viruses (RABV). Of a total of 1016 wild carnivores, 276/831 (33.2%) were Formosan FBs FAT positive, with occasional biting incidents in 1 dog and suspected defection in 1 house shrew. All other animals tested, including dogs, cats, bats, mice, house shrews and squirrels, were negative for rabies. The rabies was badger-associated and confined to nine counties/cities in Sylvatic environments. The phylogeny of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes of 59 Formosan FB-associated RABV showed that they are clustered into two distinct groups, TWI and TWII, consistent with the geographic separation in western and eastern Taiwan provided by the Central Mountain Range and in rabies-free in the north coincides with central-southern rabies-affected regions by a river bisecting western Taiwan.

2090,An endogenous retrovirus of an evolutionarily young polar bear (Ursus maritimus) identified from next-generation sequence data,"Transcriptome analysis of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) tissues identified sequences with similarity to porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV). Based on these sequences, four proviral copies and 15 solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) of a newly described endogenous retrovirus were characterized from the polar bear draft genome sequence. Closely related sequences were identified by PCR analysis of brown bears (Ursus arctos) and black bears (Ursus americanus), but were absent in non-Ursinae bear species. The virus was therefore named UrsusERV. Two distinct groups of LTRs were observed, including one recombinant ERV containing one LTR belonging to each group, suggesting that recent genomic invasions by at least two UrsusERV variants have occurred. Age estimates based on proviral LTR divergence and preservation of integration sites in ursids suggest that the viral clade is only a few million years old. The most recent provirus was polar bear specific, had intact open reading frames (ORFs), and could potentially encode functional proteins. Phylogenetic analyzes of UrsusERV consensus protein sequences suggest that it is part of a retrovirus clade from pigs, gibbons and koalas. The estimates for the young age and lineage specificity of the virus suggest that UrsusERV is a recent cross-species transmission from an unknown reservoir, and places the virus group among the most recent ERVs identified in mammals.",,"Tsangaras, K.;Mayer, J.;Alquezar-Planas, D.

2091,Identification of a novel bat papillomavirus by metagenomics,"The discovery of novel viruses in animals increases our understanding of viral diversity and potential emerging zoonoses. High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technology enables millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, enabling comprehensive investigation of the genetic content in a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we collected 156 rectal swab specimens from apparently healthy bats (n=96), pigs (n=9), cattle (n=9), stray dogs (n=11), stray cats (n=11), and monkeys (n = 20) using an HTS metagenomics approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was isolated from a bentwing bat (M. schreibersii ) sample. It is approximately 7.5 kb in length, has a G+C content of 45.8%, and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the MscPV1 and CPV6 genomes, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and the Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related. The estimated time of divergence of MscPV1 from the common EdPV1/MscPV1 ancestor was approximately 60.2-91.9 million years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes. Estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from codivergence due to possible host shifts. Because the nucleotide sequence of this virus showed only limited similarity to that of related animal PVs, it would be unlikely that the conventional PCR approach using consensus primers would have detected the new virus in the sample. In contrast to the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no obvious mucosal or skin lesions, while RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the novel genus Dyolambda papillomavirus. © 2012 Tse et al.",,"Tse, H.;Tsang, A. K. L.;Tsoi, H. W.;Leung, A. S. P.;Ho, C. C.;Lau, S. K. P.;Woo, P. C.

2093,A novel activation mechanism of the avian influenza virus H9N2 by furin,"The H9N2 avian influenza virus is widespread in waterfowl and has become endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. H9N2 influenza viruses have served as a reservoir of internal genes for other avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and several cases of human infection by H9N2 influenza viruses have suggested their pandemic potential. Fortunately, a comprehensive surveillance program allows for close monitoring of H9N2 influenza viruses worldwide and has yielded a large collection of viral sequences and phylogenetic information. Despite the large amount of sequences in different databases, very little is known about specific virus isolates and their pathogenesis. Here we characterize a low pathogenicity avian influenza virus, A/Chicken/Israel/810/2001 (H9N2) (Israel810), which is representative of influenza virus strains that have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry farms. We show that under certain circumstances, the Israel810 hemagglutinin (HA) can be activated by furin, a hallmark of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We show that Israel810 HA can be cleaved in cells with high levels of furin expression and that a mutation that eliminates a glycosylation site in HA1 allows Israel810 HA to be universally cleaved in cell culture. Pseudoparticles generated from Israel810 HA or the glycosylation mutant efficiently transduce cells.

2094,"Similarities and differences between the E5 oncoproteins of bovine papillomavirus type 1 and type 4: cytoskeleton, motility and invasiveness in E5-transformed bovine and mouse cells","Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are oncogenic viruses. In cattle, BPV-1/2 is associated with bladder cancer and BPV-4 with upper gastrointestinal cancer. BPV E5 is a small hydrophobic protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). E5 is the major transforming protein of BPVs, capable of inducing cell transformation in cultured mouse fibroblasts and, in cooperation with E7, in primary bovine cells. E5-induced cellular transformation is accompanied by activation of multiple cellular protein kinases, including growth factor receptors, and alkalinization of endosomes and GA. We have reported that BPV E5 causes swelling and fragmentation of the GA and extensive vacuolation of the cytoplasm. We now show that E5 from both BPV-1 and BPV-4 disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in transformed bovine cells, where these morphological and behavioral characteristics are accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of the cellular phosphotyrosine kinase c-src. Both BPV-1 and BPV-4 E5 increase the motility of transformed mouse cells, but only BPV-1 E5 causes transformed mouse cells to penetrate a Matrigel matrix. BPV-1 transformed mouse cells but not BPV-4 transformed mouse cells have hyperphorylated c-src. © 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Tsirimonaki, E.;Ullah, R.;Marchetti, B.;Ashrafi, G.

2095,Dynamics of envelope development in clade C SHIV-infected hog-tailed macaques during disease progression analyzed by ultra-deep pyrosequencing,"Understanding the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope during disease progression can provide tremendous insights for vaccine development, and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in non-human primates provides an ideal platform for such studies. A newly evolved clade C SHIV, SHIV-1157ipd3N4, capable of infecting rhesus monkeys and closely resembling primary HIV-1 in transmission and pathogenesis, was used to infect several hog-tailed macaques. One of the infected animals subsequently progressed to AIDS while one did not progress. The development of the viral envelope in the infected animals during the course of the disease was analyzed by a bioinformatic approach using ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Our results showed significant envelope changes that occurred in the progressive animal after the onset of AIDS. These envelope variations affected the length of the variable loops and loading of different envelope regions. In addition, several mutations were localized at the CD4 and CCR5 binding sites that potentially affect receptor binding affinity and viral fitness and could be selected for in late disease stages. More importantly, these envelope mutations are not random, as they have been repeatedly observed in a rhesus monkey and a human infant infected with either SHIV or HIV-1 and carrying the parental envelope of the infectious molecular clone SHIV-1157ipd3N4. In addition, similar mutations were also observed from other studies on different clades of envelopes independent of the host species. These recurring mutations in different envelopes suggest that there may be a common evolutionary pattern and selection pathway for the HIV-1 envelope during disease progression.",,"Tso, F.

2096,Genetic diversity and recombination of enterovirus G strains in Japanese pigs: high prevalence of strains carrying a papain-like cysteine protease sequence in the enterovirus G population,"To investigate the genetic diversity of Enterovirus G (EV-G) in Japanese pigs, metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples from pigs with and without diarrhea collected between 2014 and 2016. Fifty-nine EV-G sequences >5,000 nucleotides long were obtained. Complete VP1 sequence analysis classified Japanese EV-G isolates into G1 (17 kindreds), G2 (four kindreds), G3 (22 kindreds), G4 (two kindreds), G6 (two kindreds), G9 (six kindreds), G10 (five strains) and a new genotype (one strain). Notably, 16 G1 and one G2 strains identified in stool samples with diarrhea (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP)- Sequence recently found in the US and Belgium in the EV-G genome at the 2C-3A junction. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. In addition, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events have been found in EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains.

2097,Identification of a novel bovine enterovirus possessing highly divergent amino acid sequences in the capsid protein,"Background: Bovine enterovirus (BEV) belongs to the species Enterovirus E or F, genus Enterovirus and family Picornaviridae. Although numerous studies have identified BEV in the faeces of cattle with diarrhea, the pathogenicity of BEV remains unclear. Previously, we reported the detection of a novel Kobu-like virus in calf feces by metagenomic analysis. In the present study, we identified a novel BEV in diarrheal faeces collected for this survey. Complete genome sequences were determined by deep sequencing in feces. Secondary RNA structure analysis of the 5-inch untranslated region (UTR), phylogenetic tree construction, and pairwise identity analysis were performed. Results: The complete genome sequences of BEV were genetically distant from other EVs and the VP1 coding region contained new and unique amino acid sequences. We have designated this strain as BEV AN12/Bos taurus/JPN/2014 (referred to as BEV-AN12). According to genomic analysis, the genome length of this virus is 7414 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail, and its genome consists of a 5 inch UTR, an open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein, and a 3 inch UTR. The results of the secondary RNA structure analysis showed that BEV-AN12 had an additional trefoil structure and a small stem-loop structure in the 5-UTR, similar to other BEVs. In the pairwise identity analysis, BEV-AN12 showed high amino acid (aa) identities with Enterovirus F in the polyprotein, P2 and P3 regions (aa identity ≥ 82.4%). Therefore, BEV-AN12 is closely related to Enterovirus F. However, amino acid sequences in the capsid protein regions, especially in the VP1 coding region, showed a significantly low amino acid identity to other viruses of the genus Enterovirus (VP1-AA identity ≥ 58.6%). Furthermore, BEV-AN12 branched separately from Enterovirus E and F in pedigrees based on the aa sequences of P1 and VP1, although it was clustered with Enterovirus F in trees based on sequences in the P2 and P3 genomic region. Conclusions: We identified new BEV with highly divergent aa sequences in the VP1 coding region in Japan. According to the species definition, we proposed naming this strain ""Enterovirus K"", which is a new species within the Enterovirus genus. Further genomic studies are needed to understand the pathogenicity of BEVs.",,"Tsuchiaka, S.;Rahpaya, S.

2098,Evidence of serological diversity within group C rotaviruses,"Cowden strain of group C porcine rotavirus and Shintoku strain of group C bovine rotavirus were classified as distinct serotypes by two-way cross-neutralization tests. Two patterns of neutralization against the Cowden and Shintoku strains were observed when hyperimmune or convalescent phase antisera against three uncultivable group C swine rotavirus and one group C human rotavirus were used in one-way cross-neutralization assays. Antisera against two group C swine rotaviruses and human group C rotavirus neutralized the Cowden strain at high titers but did not neutralize the Shintoku strain, suggesting that these three strains are serotypically related to the Cowden strain. The remaining antisera against a group C porcine rotavirus (HF strain) reacted with the Cowden and Shintoku group C rotaviruses in cell culture immunofluorescence assays, but did not neutralize either virus in a one-way cross-neutralization, suggesting that the HF strain belongs to a third serotype. However, confirmation of these findings requires additional analysis by mutual cross-neutralization. Our results support the existence of at least two distinct serotypes of group C rotavirus and possibly a third in animals and humans. The observed serotypic similarity between the Cowden strain and a human group C rotavirus suggests that the culturable Cowden strain and antiserum against this virus may provide important reagents for the diagnosis of group C rotavirus in humans.",,"Tsunemitsu, H.;Jiang, B.;Yamashita, Y.;Oseto, M.;Ushijima, H.;Saif, L.

While studies of group A rotavirus (RVA) have been conducted in Thailand, reports of group C rotavirus (RVC) are limited. Here we aimed to identify the prevalence of RVC circulating in Thai commercial pig farms. We analyzed 769 fecal and intestinal mucosal contents from pigs affected by diarrhea between 2011 and 2016 using RT-PCR specific for the PEDV spike (S), rotavirus glycoprotein (G) VP7 and protease-sensitive genes Protein (P) VP4 were. We found that 6.6% (51/769) of specimens tested positive for RVC, of which 11 specimens were co-infected with RVA and four specimens with PEDV. Three samples tested positive for all three viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene showed that the most common RVC genotype was G1, which was grouped with the prototypical RVC Cowden strain. While G6 and G9 were also common, G3 was relatively rare. Analysis of the VP4 gene revealed that the most common P type was P[5], followed by P[4], P[7] and P[1].

2102,Antigenic relationship between influenza A viruses of human and animal origin,"Reciprocal antigenic relationships between 17 influenza A viruses of human, porcine, equine, and avian origin were examined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and strain-specific complement fixation (CF). Cross-reactions were observed between the following strains: (a) Equi/1/Prague/1/56, Avian influenza (Dutch strain) and Turkey/England/1/63 (Langham strain); (b) Equi/2/Miami/1/63, Quail/Italy/1117/65, Pheasant/Italy/647/66, Duck/England/1/62 and Turkey/Canada/1/63; (c) A2/Singapore/1/57 and Turkey/Massachussets/65; (d) Pig/S15/30 and Chicken/Scotland/1/59. Overall, the results of the HI tests performed with post-infection sera showed a lower specificity than that of HI with hyperimmune sera or that of strain-specific CF. There is clearly no sharp delineation of the antigenic subtypes of influenza A viruses, and studies on an even broader range of strains are likely to reveal a continuous spectrum of antigenic variation across the group. The authors suggest that in practice host specificity rather than antigen specificity must be used as the main criterion in classifying influenza A viruses.",,"Tumova, B.;Pereira, H. G.",1968.0,,,0
2103,Gene-centric metagenomics analysis of the feline gut microbiome using 454 junior pyrosequencing,"The feline gastrointestinal microbiota has a direct impact on feline and human health as a reservoir for potential zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. To describe the microbial diversity of the gastrointestinal tract in cats, fecal faecal samples were characterized using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. However, data correlating overall microbial composition and their functions are lacking. The present descriptive study evaluated both the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of feline gut microbiota using GS Junior Titan shotgun pyrosequencing. A total of 152,494 pyrosequencing reads (5405 assembled contigs) were generated and classified into both phylogenetic and metabolic profiles of feline gut microbiota. The Bacteroides/Chlorobi group was the predominant bacterial group with ~. 68% of the total classified variety, followed by Firmicutes (about 13%) and Proteobacteria (about 6%) respectively. Archaea, fungi, and viruses formed the smaller communities in the overall microbial diversity. Interestingly, this study also identified a number of potential enteric zoonotic pathogens (0.02–1.25%) and genes involved in antibiotic resistance (0.02–0.7%) in cat fecal materials. Based on clustering between nine gastrointestinal metagenomes from five different monogastric hosts (dog, human, mouse, cat and chicken), the feline metagenome clustered closely together with chicken at both phylogenetic and metabolic levels (>80%).

Cotia virus grew in a variety of cell cultures and on the chick chorioallantois (CAM). Its growth characteristics are similar to those of other smallpoxviruses. Microscopy showed virus factories, or type B inclusions, that emerged before infectious progeny viruses could be detected. Type A inclusions appeared later, after the development of the progeny virus; these have been shown by electron microscopy to be distinct from the type A inclusions of cowpox and other smallpoxviruses and have been named Cotia bodies. Immunofluorescence staining also revealed ring structures that appeared prior to the development of Cotia bodies. Cotia virus growth in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells was sensitive to inhibitors of DNA and protein synthesis, but resistant to a concentration of rifampicin that inhibited vaccinia virus. Antigen sharing between Cotia virus and vaccinia virus has been demonstrated by gel precipitation assays and immunofluorescence staining.

2107,Use of DOP-PCR for non-specific virus detection,"The detection and identification of pathogens in a specific sample without knowledge of the pathogen requires the combination of sample purification and generic signal amplification. Our universal virus detection assay combines viral capsid purification with a generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) optimized for virus-sized genomes. As a general strategy, nucleic acid extraction is preceded by biochemical and physical purification by targeted digestion of contaminating host nucleic acids. RNA is transcribed into cDNA; cDNA and the DNA are then used as templates for degenerate oligonucleotide primer-PCR (DOP-PCR). This PCR uses a pool of related but distinct primers that combine degenerate and specific annealing conditions. PCR products can be identified by cloning and sequencing, by microarray, or by high-throughput sequencing. We have detected enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses using DOP-PCR in both cell cultures and clinical specimens. The assay can detect single and double stranded genomes, circular genomes, segmented genomes and linear genomes. Both large virus genomes such as herpesvirus and very small virus genomes (eg circovirus) can be sensitively detected in the same assay. The DOP-PCR assay can be used to identify viruses either directly from biological samples or from cell cultures. A strong feature of DOP-PCR is its ability to amplify viral sequences without prior knowledge of those sequences, increasing the likelihood of finding mutated or new viruses. In combination with high-throughput sequencing, DOP-PCR is a very sensitive tool that can potentially be used to characterize a specific sample. © PDA, Inc. 2011.",,"Uhlenhaut, C.;McClenahan, S.;Krause, P.

IT-227/82 is an antigenic variant of chicken Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The genome is 15,192 nucleotides (nt) long, similar to the previously published NDV strain ZJ1. However, it is six nt longer than the genomes of NDV strains LaSota/46 and Beaudette C. The 6 nt insertion was in the 5'' non-coding region of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. The presence of this Six-nt insertion showed no correlation with the virulence or reservoir of the NDV strains sequenced to date. However, the genome length of 15,186 and 15,192 nt can be associated with “old” (I, II, III and IV) and “new” (V, VI, VII and VIII) NDV genotypes, respectively. Comparison of open reading frames showed that PPMV-1 strain IT-227/82 encodes the longest W protein (227 amino acids). The length of the W protein also showed remarkable differences within the genotypes and therefore cannot be regarded as a phylogenetic trait. The hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein of strain IT-227/82 consists of 571 amino acids, similar to NDV strains of genotypes IV, V and VII, while strains of genotypes I and II have longer HN proteins, 616 and 577 amino acids, respectively .

There are two genotypes, BVDV 1 and 2, which are differentiated based on the sequence of the 5'-noncoding region (5'-NCR) using real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is more sensitive, more specific, and less time-consuming than traditional PCR, and carries less risk of cross-contamination of samples. There is limited information on BVDV genetic subtypes in South Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the genotypes of BVDV currently circulating in South African feedlots. A total of 279 samples (219 tissue samples, 59 transtracheal aspirates and 1 blood sample) were collected from dead and live cattle with lesions or clinical signs consistent with BVDV infection. Pooled homogenates from the same animals were prepared and total RNA was extracted. A screening test was performed on the pooled specimens and positive pools were evaluated individually. A Cador BVDV type 1/2 RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for the real-time PCR assay on a LightCycler® V2. 0 real-time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Results were read at 530 and 640 nm for BVDV 1 and 2, respectively. Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus was detected in a total of 103 specimens, including 91 tissue specimens, 1 blood specimen and 11 transtracheal aspirates. Eighty-five (82.5%) of the strains were genotype 1 and 18 (17.5%) were genotype 2.

All strains had a genome length of 15,192 nucleotides consisting of six genes in the order 3″-NP-P/V/WMF-HN-L-5″. The general genomic properties of the Japanese field strains were consistent with the previously characterized class II NDV, except for those belonging to early genotypes (genotypes I-IV), which have the six-nucleotide insertion at nucleotide positions 1,648-1,653 of the nucleoprotein (NP) absent. Gen. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Japanese strains could be classified into genotypes VIc and VIIe according to the unified NDV classification system using the complete genomic sequence and the complete coding sequence of the fusion gene (F). The characterization of functional domains and neutralizing epitopes of the F and hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) proteins of Japanese field strains revealed a total of 31 amino acid substitutions compared to the vaccine strains Ishii and B1, which are widespread in Japan. Although the virus neutralization test (VN) showed that poor immunity of the flock due to vaccination failure or partial and uneven immunization may be the main factors involved in the mechanism of breakthrough infection of the Japanese field strains, the VN titer decreases by about two to triple the field NDV strains possessing a point mutation (E347K or E347G) at the linear epitope of the HN protein were observed compared to the vaccine strain B1 and the field strain 2440/69 lacking the point mutation.

There is currently limited molecular epidemiological data on the causes of ND outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry farms. Knowing the genomic properties of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which infects commercial poultry farms despite vaccination, could provide important insights into the infection dynamics of these viruses. In addition, molecular analyzes at the subgenotype level and studies on the relationship of Japanese NDVs to other isolates from around the world are lacking. Therefore, in the present study, a molecular-epidemiological investigation was performed to characterize nine NDVs isolated from vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in five different prefectures in non-epidemic areas of Japan between 1969 and 2002. methods. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed to identify the complete fusion (F) protein gene, the 3-prime end of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, and the 5-prime end of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) gene characterize.

Deduced amino acids were analyzed for homologies, recombination and mutation. Recombination events were estimated using the recombination detection program (RDP) version 3.44. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine evolutionary relationships between tribes.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates could be classified into two genetic lineages and three sublineages, namely genotypes VIa (lineage 4a), VId (lineage 4d), and VIId (lineage 5d). No recombination events were observed, but a point mutation in one of the neutralizing epitopes of the F protein was identified in the field isolates from Japan. Conclusions: All field isolates from vaccinated poultry in non-epidemic areas of Japan were part of much larger outbreaks in provinces and regions and in some cases on continents. In general, four ND pansoots emerged in Japan and these outbreaks were mainly characterized by the co-circulation of genetically distinct virus lines due to the involvement of infected wild birds. The point mutation identified in the field isolates from Japan may be due to escaping vaccination pressure. Identification of such a mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis to understand the dynamics of NDV infection in vaccinated chickens. © 2013 Umali et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Umali, D.

2114,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of Newcastle disease virus isolated from clinical cases of Newcastle disease in commercial layer farms in the Philippines,"Newcastle disease (ND) is an economically devastating poultry disease. Limited data are currently available on the molecular characteristics of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from the Philippines. Clinical and molecular characterizations were performed on five clinical cases of ND in vaccinated commercial layer farms from four provinces in the Philippines, namely Bulacan, Pampanga, Zamboanga del Sur and Davao Del Sur. Clinical signs observed in affected flocks were conjunctivitis, wheezing, rales, facial swelling, lethargy, greenish diarrhea, torticollis and paralysis. Disease onset ranged from 21 to 124 days with mortality rates from 15 to 61%. The gross morphologic lesions identified were the presence of serous exudates in the infraorbital cavities, hemorrhagic trachea, inflamed spleen, liver and kidneys, and petechial hemorrhages in the proventriculus and cecal tonsils. Nucleotide sequencing showed that all field strains with FO proteolytic cleavage sites of 112RRRKRz.ast;F117 and 112RRQKRz.ast;F117 patterns were velogen. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all field NDV strains belong to class II genotype VII, subgenotypes Vila, VIIIh and Vili. The evolutionary divergence showed that the field NDV strains were closely related (up to 99% similarity) to the newly identified subgenotypes of virulent NDVs currently emerging in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.",,"Umali, D.

2115,Screening of human cell lines for viral infection using RNA-Seq data analysis,"The surveillance of viral infections of cell cultures is largely neglected, although the viruses have an impact on the physiology of cells and can pose a biological hazard in terms of laboratory safety and the safety of bioactive drugs produced by cell cultures. PCR, immunological assays and enzyme activity tests are common methods for detecting viral infections. We screened more than 300 cancer cell line encyclopedia RNA sequencing datasets and 60 complete human cell line exome sequencing datasets for specific viral sequences and overall viral nucleotide and protein sequence assessments using the taxonomeric bioinformatics tool developed by IDbyDNA. The results were compared to our previous findings from virus-specific PCR analyses. Both the results obtained from the direct alignment method and from the taxonomere alignment method showed complete agreement with the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus species. Taxonomer also revealed bovine polyomavirus infection in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, most likely introduced by contaminated fetal bovine serum. RNA-Seq datasets were more sensitive for virus detection, although a significant proportion of cell lines had a low number of virus-specific alignments due to low nucleotide contamination during the RNA preparation or sequencing process. Low-quality reads that lead to false positive taxonomer results can be eliminated by trimming the sequence data prior to analysis. Another important finding is that no viruses were detected that have never been detected in cell cultures. The results show that the currently used testing of cell cultures is sufficient to detect contamination and to assess the risk of cell cultures. The results underscore that next-generation sequencing is an efficient tool to determine the viral infection status of human cells.",,"Uphoff, C. C.;Pommerenke, C.;Denkmann, S. A.;Drexler, H.

2116,Ephemeral cattle fever,"Ephemeral fever remains a viral disease of considerable concern to many countries including Australia. The virus has only been partially characterized and is awaiting final classification. Although the BEF virus was initially thought to contain 6 structural proteins, there is increasing evidence that it contains the 5 proteins characteristic of the Rhabdoviridae. Although BEF is thought to be transmitted by arthropods, the vector has yet to be identified, but the distribution of BEF suggests that more than one vector is capable of transmitting the disease. Despite rigorous study of the clinical symptoms and pathology of ephemeral fever, little progress has been made in the pathogenesis of the disease. This is partly due to the difficulty of propagating the BEF virus in vitro and the inability to define the site of replication. However, there is increasing evidence that BEF is immunopathological in nature and that the clinical expression of the disease is influenced by the release of one or more inflammatory mediators. The disease is characterized by a number of haematological and biochemical changes and early and prolonged treatment with phenylbutazone can reverse a number of these changes. Intravenous calcium, together with prolonged phenylbutazone therapy, can now be considered a reasonable adjunct to the treatment regimen. The vaccines currently available are made from either live attenuated or killed virus and may be less reliable. There appears to be a need for a reliable, low cost, cold chain independent alternative vaccine.",,"Uren, M. F.",1989.0,,,0
2117,Unassigned reads from bovine RNAseq data: A source for missing and mismatched sequences in the reference arrays and for detecting in-host pathogens,"Normally, reads from transcriptome sequencing data that are not mapped to the reference genome of the target species are not considered. A recent RNAseq project on the new killer disease bovine-neonatal pancytopenia had pointed to an unexplained signature of the immune response to a double-stranded RNA virus. To elucidate the background, contigs were assembled de novo from unmapped RNAseq reads and matched to the bovine genome assemblies and multispecies NCBI databases. The lack of true virus sequence contigs rejected the hypothesis that a live virus is responsible for the unexplained immune response. Alignment data also revealed incomplete bovine reference genome alignments. In addition, we found that several parasite and virus genome reference arrays in the NCBI were contaminated with bovine DNA and confirmed recombination of bovine DNA in BVD virus strains. Examination of unmapped reads can extract useful biological information about the presence of microorganisms and highlight problems with reference genome assemblies from host and pathogen species.",,"Usman, T.;Hadlich, F.;Demasius, W.;Weikard, R.;Kuhn, C.",2017.0,1,,0
2118,"Nucleoprotein (N) partial gene sequencing and sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus field isolates from Gujarat State, India","The present study was carried out with the aim of characterizing the rabies virus (genus Lyssavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae under the order Mononegavirales) by sequencing of the partial nucleoprotein (N) gene of the rabies virus and phylogenetic analysis to determine the genotype and lineage of the rabies virus present know in the Indian state of Gujarat. A total of 32 specimens (18 brain specimens and 14 saliva specimens) were collected aseptically from live and dead animals (namely, dog, buffalo, cow, goat, donkey and hyena) for the detection of rabies virus. Of 32 samples, 24 samples were found positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions, and from these 24 positive samples, 20 samples with a good level of gene product were selected for sequencing. ClustalW alignment of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences of field rabies isolates revealed 95.20-100 and 97.95-100% similarity to each other, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments of field rabies isolates and reference vaccine strains [Pasteur strain and Challenge Virus (CVS) strain] revealed single nucleotide mutations at a total of 91 positions and amino acid mutations at a total of 17 different positions. Phylogenetic analysis of N gene sequences using our 20 field rabies isolates and 21 other reported isolates in the gene bank resulted in 3 phylogenetic clusters. All field rabies isolates shared the same genetic ancestry with each other and with other previously reported Indian rabies isolates, which placed them in the arctic lineage of genotype 1 rabies virus. However, they were genetically distant from Pasteur and CVS reference strains, which clustered in different phylogenetic clusters.",,"Vagheshwari, D. H.;Bhanderi, B. B.;Mathakiya, R. A.;Jhala, M.

2119,Global distribution of human protoparvoviruses,"The development of next-generation sequencing and metagenomics has revolutionized the detection of novel viruses. Among these viruses are 3 human protoparvoviruses: bufavirus, tusavirus and cutavirus. These viruses have been detected in the stool of children with diarrhea. In addition, cutavirus was detected in skin biopsies from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in France and in a melanoma patient in Denmark. We examined the seroprevalences of IgG against bufavirus, tusavirus and cutavirus in different populations (n = 840) and found a notable geographical difference in the prevalence of bufavirus IgG. Although prevalence in adult populations was low in Finland (1.9%) and the United States (3.6%), bufavirus IgG was high in populations in Iraq (84.8%), Iran (56, 1%) and widespread in Kenya (72.3%). Conversely, cutavirus IgG showed consistently low prevalences (0%–5.6%) in all cohorts, and tusavirus IgG was not detected.

2120,"Epidemiology of two human protoparvoviruses, bufavirus and tusavirus","Two human parvoviruses were recently discovered by metagenomics in Africa, bufavirus (BuV) in 2012 and tusavirus (TuV) in 2014. These viruses have been studied exclusively by PCR in stool and have only been detected in patients with diarrhea, albeit with less prevalence. Three genotypes of BuV have been identified. We detected BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%) by internal EIA, while TuV-IgG was found in one child (0.4%). . All children and 91% of adults were Finnish, but interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. No cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected by competition EIA, suggesting that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. In addition, we analyzed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and, for the first time, in one nasal swab (0.1%). This is the first study to document the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results suggest that BuV infection may be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared strong and long-lasting, indicating systemic infection in humans.",,"Vaisanen, E.;Paloniemi, M.;Kuisma, I.;Lithovius, V.;Kumar, A.;Franssila, R.;Ahmed, K.;Delwart, E.;Vesikari, T.;Hedman, K.;Soderlund-Venermo, M.",2016.0,Dec,,0
2121,S1 gene-based phylogeny of infectious bronchitis virus: An attempt to harmonize virus classification,"Infectious bronchitis (IBV) virus is the causative agent of a highly contagious disease that is causing severe economic losses to the global poultry industry. The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct virus types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measurements of pairwise similarity between nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group designations have been adopted that are inconsistent with phylogenetic history, resulting in a confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Here we propose a simple and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with a unique and rational lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. By using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene, we determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn enabled us to define 6 genotypes that collectively encompass 32 different viral lineages and a number of interlineage recombinants. Because of the extensive rate variation between IBVs, we propose that inferring phylogenetic relationships alone is a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. Adoption of an internationally recognized viral nomenclature is critical for future studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme presented here is subject to update, and revised new S1 sequences should become available.",,"Valastro, V.;Holmes, E.

2122,Genetic typing and prevalence of border disease virus (BDV) in small ruminant herds in Spain,"Between 2001 and 2002, samples from 1413 animals in 21 Spanish small ruminant flocks, most of them with animals showing clinical signs compatible with Border Disease (BD), were tested for the presence of pestivirus antigen and antibodies by a indirect peroxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) or the virus neutralization test (VNT). Although all herds harbored seropositive animals, virus could only be isolated from animals in five of the herds. Between 4 and 11 months later, all animals older than 6 months were sampled again in three flocks. At this point, 51-83% of them had neutralizing antibodies. The prevalence of persistently infected (PI) animals in two flocks was 0.3 and 0.6%, respectively. The third herd had probably eliminated all PI animals. Fourteen virus isolates were obtained. The 5 inch untranslated region (5-UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analyzes classified them as a group of border disease viruses (BDV) that are separate from BDV-1 but have a relatively low bootstrap score. Three of the 14 isolates were in the same subgroup as a set of previously characterized Spanish isolates from the Basque Country, assigned to subgroup BDV-C. They were also grouped with an isolate from chamois, currently assigned to group BDV-4. Due to their close relationship to the chamois isolate, these isolates were provisionally assigned to a subgroup BDV-4a. The remaining isolates generated a new subgroup related to but not in the same cluster as the chamois isolate and were therefore tentatively assigned to a new subgroup, BDV-4b. Our results show that BDV classification and nomenclature need to be harmonized. © 2006 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Valdazo-GonzÃ¡lez, B.;Ãlvarez-MartÃ­nez, M.;Greiser-Wilke, I.",2006.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.06.008,0

2124,Anaplasma marginal superinfection due to pathogen strains with different genomic backgrounds,"Strain superinfection occurs when a second strain of pathogen infects a host that is already infected with a primary strain. The selection pressures driving the strain divergence underlying superinfection and enabling the entry of a new strain into a host population are critical knowledge gaps relevant to changes in infectious disease epidemiology. In endemic regions with high infection prevalence, broad population immunity to Anaplasma marginale, a high antigenic variant rickettsial pathogen, develops and creates strong selective pressure for emergence and superinfection with strains differing in their Msp2 variant repertoire. The kindreds can arise either through msp2 locus duplication and allelic divergence on an existing genomic background, or by introducing a kindred with a different msp2 allelic repertoire on a different genomic background. To answer this question, we developed a multilocus typing assay based on high-throughput sequencing of non-msp2 target loci to distinguish between strains with different genomic backgrounds. The technical error level was statistically defined using the percentage of perfect sequence matches of clones of each target locus and validated using experimental single strains and pairs of strains. Testing of A. marginale-positive specimens from tropical regions where A. marginale infection is endemic identified single infections that contained unique alleles for all five target loci. The data showed a highly significant difference in the number of strains per animal in tropical regions compared to infections in temperate regions and strongly supported the hypothesis that transmission of genomically diverse A. marginale strains is prevalent in endemic areas.",,"Vallejo Esquerra, E.;Herndon, D.

2125,What is in a burden? Viral metagenomics identifies genetic variations and contaminating circoviruses in laboratory isolates of Pigeon Paramyxovirus type 1,"We used next-generation sequencing on randomly amplified viral nucleic acids to determine the genome sequence of 11 isolates of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) from Belgium (period 1998-2011). The PPMV-1 deep sequence data allowed the identification of sequence variability in several PPMV-1 isolates, including a STOP codon in the matrix gene that was present in 15% of an isolate's viral population. In particular, mutations previously associated with pathogenicity in chickens were identified as minor sequence variants in a parental laboratory strain. A phylogenetic analysis of the consensus PPMV-1 genomic sequences was performed. In addition to providing nearly complete Paramyxovirus genome sequences, our sequence-independent approach identified the presence of pigeon circovirus (PiCV) sequences in four of these virus strains. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis specific for PMV-1 and PiCV showed that these contaminants were present in seven virus stocks composed of allantoic fluids and occasionally also detected in stocks passaged in embryonated chicken eggs. Phylogenetic analysis of the PiCV consensus genome sequences revealed a circulation of PiCV covering the entire genetic diversity of known PiCV. Co-infecting viruses or sequence variants from the original sample may remain in the populations without being identified by routine virus-specific diagnostic tools. The exact role of PiCV in pigeon disease - specifically Newcastle disease - and its potential interference with PPMV-1 diagnostics remains to be investigated. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Van Borm, S.;Rosseel, T.;Steensels, M.;Van den Berg, T.;Lambrecht, B.",2013.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2012.11.017,0

HEV genotype 3 (Gt3) infections are endemic in swine in western Europe and the Americas and cause zoonotic infections in humans. Several serological assays for the detection of HEV antibodies in pigs have been developed, initially mainly based on HEV genotype 1 (Gt1) antigens. To develop a sensitive HEV Gt3 ELISA, a recombinant baculovirus expression product of the HEV Gt3 open reading frame 2 was prepared and plated on polystyrene ELISA plates. After incubation of pig sera, bound HEV antibodies were detected with anti-pig anti-IgG and anti-IgM conjugates. Sera sets from pigs experimentally infected with HEV Gt3 were used for the primary assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. A batch of 1100 pig sera was used to further validate the assay and establish the cutoff value. All swine sera were tested with the developed HEV Gt3 assay and two other serological assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens. Since no gold standard for HEV antibody testing is available, further validation and final determination of the cutoff of the developed HEV Gt3 assay was performed using a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem. The developed and validated HEV antibody assay demonstrated effective detection of HEV-specific antibodies.

The classification of this virus is based on a partial sequence analysis of cDNA from a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes homologous in all human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related viruses and their corresponding mRNAs, including appropriate splices, have been identified. An additional non-homologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region is accessible for translation by alternative splicing. Sequence comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistantly related to HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. In all coding regions, similarity tends to be lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, the least similarity between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2 was found in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. The U3-R and R-U5 borders of the STLV-PH969-LTR were determined experimentally at nucleotides 268 and 52.4, respectively. This 695 bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 LTRs, respectively, but its general organization is similar to that found in the HTLV bovine leukemia virus genus. In the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) site, sequence similarity to the HTLV-1 Rex-responsive element (RexRE) core and secondary structure prediction suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21 bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2 and BLV. Only two direct repeats with similarity to these Tax-responsive elements were found in the STLV-PH969 LTR, suggesting differences in the Tax-mediated transactivation of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions that suggest a replication cycle comparable to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.",,"Van Marianne, B.;Goubau, P.;Rousseau, R.;Desmyter, J.;Vandamme, A.

2133,Genetic heterogeneity in foot-and-mouth disease virus leaders and 3C proteinases,"The leader and 3C proteinases of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) are responsible for almost all proteolytic processing events of the viral polyprotein precursor. Examination of the genetic heterogeneity of the regions encoding these proteins from isolates from six FMDV serotypes revealed that the 3C proteinase is more conserved than the leader proteinase. Maximum likelihood analysis revealed similar phylogenetic groupings for the nonstructural protein coding regions of both the leader and the 3C. These groupings differed from the structural coding region of the VP1 protein, which was grouped by serotype as previously shown. Two distinct clades were evident for both the leader and 3C coding regions: one comprising serotypes A, O and C together with SAT isolates (South African Territories) from East Africa. The other group consisted of SAT isolates originating from southern Africa. Only one virus isolate obtained from a buffalo in Uganda did not fit this phylogenetic pattern. This SAT 1 virus was grouped with types A, O and C in leader analysis but with the South African SAT types in 3C analysis, implying intertypic recombination. The leader proteinases of South African SAT-type isolates differed from those present in European-type isolates, particularly in the self-processing region. A three-dimensional structure was modeled for the leader proteinase of one of the SAT-type viruses, ZIM/7/83/2, and compared to the previously elucidated crystal structure of the O1Kaufbeuren leader proteinase. The active sites of the two leaders were found to closely overlap despite the observed sequence variation between the two molecules. A comparison of 3C proteinase P1 cleavage sites suggested that FMDV 3C proteinase may have broader substrate specificity than that observed with hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Van Rensburg, H.;Haydon, D.;Joubert, F.;Bastos, A.;Heath, L.;Nel, L.",2002.0,,10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00471-7,0
2134,Origin of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus: A comparative genomic analysis,"To test the avian origin hypothesis of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus, we surveyed influenza sequences from a broad taxonomic distribution and collected 65 full-length genomes, which included numerous other porcine (H1N2, H3N1, and H3N2), human (H2N2, H3N2, and H5N1) and avian (H1N1, H4N6, H5N1, H6N1, H6N6, H6N8, H7N3, H8N4, H9N2, and H13N2) subtypes. Amino acids from all eight segments were concatenated, aligned, and used for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, the genes of the polymerase complex (PB1, PB2 and PA) were analyzed individually. All of our results placed the Brevig-Mission/1918 strain in a position basal to the rest of the clade containing human H1N1s and were consistent with a resort hypothesis for the origin of the 1918 virus. Our genomic phylogeny further indicates a sister relationship with the ""classic"" porcine H1N1 lineage.

2135,An ecological and conservational perspective on advances in applied virology of zoonoses,"The aim of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and protection. We review recent advances in virology and provide examples of how they affect both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of necessary breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the laboratory. To encourage this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table listing key term definitions. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic agents in their reservoir hosts, both to assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. Finally, we emphasize the need for intelligent monitoring, virus detection efforts, and predictive modeling. In today's globalized society, a shift towards a predictive approach is needed because, as demonstrated by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, identification after occurrence is often too late to prevent global spread. The integration of molecular virology and ecological techniques will enable earlier detection of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they spill over from wildlife reservoirs to human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation problems. © 2011 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Vandegrift, K.

2136,Comparative genome sequencing identifies a prophage-associated genomic island associated with host adaptation of Lawsonia intracellularis infections,"Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of proliferative enteropathy (PE). The disease is endemic in pigs, occurs in horses and has also been reported in a variety of other animal species, including non-human primates. Comparing the entire genome sequences of a homologous porcine L. intracellularis isolate cultured for passage 10 and 60 in vitro, we identified a 18 kb prophage-associated genomic island at passage 10 (pathogenic variant) that was isolated at passage 60 ( non-pathogenic variant). This chromosomal island encompasses 15 genes downstream of the prophage DLP12 integrase gene. The prevalence of this genetic element was assessed in 12 other L. intracellularis isolates and in 53 infected animals and found to be conserved in all pig isolates cultured for up to 20 passages and in isolates cultured for more than 40 passages were cultivated was lost. In addition, the prophage region was also present in 26 fecal samples obtained from pigs clinically affected by both acute and chronic forms of the disease. However, the equine L. intracellularis isolates examined did not contain this genomic island, regardless of in vitro passage. Furthermore, fecal samples from 21 clinically affected horses and four wild rabbits trapped in horse farms with PE outbreaks did not show this prophage-associated islet. Although the presence of this prophage-associated islet was not essential for a virulent L. intracellularis phenotype, this genetic element was porcine isolate specific and possibly contributed to the ecological specialization of this organism for the porcine host.",,"Vannucci, F.

2137,Sequence-based taxonomic framework for the classification of uncultured single-stranded DNA viruses of the Genomoviridae family,"With the advent of metagenomic approaches, a wide variety of known and unknown viruses have been identified in different types of environmental, plant, and animal samples. One such widespread group of viruses is the recently established family Genomoviridae, which includes viruses with small (approximately 2-2.4 kb), circular ssDNA genomes that encode rolling circle replication initiation proteins (Rep) and unique capsid proteins. Here we propose a sequence-based taxonomic framework for the classification of 121 novel viral genomes within this family. Genomoviruses exhibit approximately 47% sequence diversity, which is very similar to that within the well-established and extensively studied family Geminiviridae (46% diversity). Based on our analysis, we set a genome-wide pairwise identity of 78% as the species differentiation threshold. Furthermore, using a Rep sequence phylogeny-based analysis in conjunction with current knowledge on geminivirus classification, we establish nine genera within the Genomoviridae family. These are Gemycircularvirus (n=73), Gemyduguivirus (n=1), Gemygorvirus (n=9), Gemykibivirus (n=29), Gemycolovirus (n=3), Gemykrogvirus (n=3), Gemykroznavirus (n=1) , Gemytondvirus (n=1), Gemyvongvirus (n=1). The presented taxonomic framework provides a rational classification of genomic viruses based solely on the sequence information and is an example for the future classification of other groups of uncultured viruses discovered using metagenomic approaches.",,"Varsani, A.;Krupovic, M.",2017.0,Jan,,0
2138,Smacoviridae: a new family of animal-associated single-stranded DNA viruses,"Smacoviruses have small (similar to 2.3–2.9 kb), circular, single-stranded DNA genomes that encode rolling circle replication-associated proteins (Rep) and unique capsid proteins. Although smacoviruses are widespread in the faeces of various vertebrates, including humans, none of these viruses have been cultured. Smacoviruses exhibit a genome-wide sequence diversity of approximately 45%, which is very similar to that of other families of circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS) viruses, including members of the families Geminiviridae (46% diversity) and Genomoviridae (47% diversity). Here we announce the creation of a new family Smacoviridae and describe a sequence-based taxonomic framework used to classify 83 Smacovirus genomes into 43 species within six new genera, Bovismacovirus (n = 3), Cosmacovirus (n = 1) , Dragsmacovirus (n=1), Drosmacovirus (n=3), Huchismacovirus (n=7) and Porprismacovirus (n=28). As in the case of gemoviruses, species delineation is based on genome-wide pairwise identity, while genera are established based on Rep amino acid sequence identity coupled with strong phylogenetic support. A similar sequence-based taxonomic framework should guide the classification of a stunning variety of other uncultured and currently unclassified CRESS-DNA viruses discovered by metagenomic approaches.",,"Varsani, A.;Krupovic, M.",2018.0,Jul,,0
2139,A new variant of the influenza virus h1n1 swine flu virus,"In 2009, a swine-derived H1N1 virus strain, commonly referred to as swine flu, caused the 2009 flu pandemic. Most countries with cold climates are affected by the disease. In the US, between 1979 and 2001, an average of 41,000 people died from influenza each year. Influenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by RNA viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family that affects birds and mammals. This virus is mainly classified into three types: 1) Influenza virus A 2) Influenza virus B 3) Influenza virus C. Swine flu belongs to influenza virus A(H1N1). The virus particle is 80-120 nanometers in size. In the early stages of swine flu, it can be difficult to distinguish between a cold and influenza, but flu can be identified by a sudden onset of high fever and extreme fatigue. Transmitted through three main routes: direct transmission, the air bone route, and direct personal contact (like shaking hands). Since influenza viruses can persist outside the body, they can also be transmitted through contaminated surfaces such as banknotes, doorknobs, etc. H1N1 spreads easily, rarely fatally. One of the mechanisms of H1N1 is believed to be inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which leads to lower cortisol levels. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight, disinfectants and detergents. Commonly used antivirals are oseltamivir and zanamivir, which are neuraminidase inhibitors, and amantadine and rimantadine block a viral ion channel and prevent viruses from infecting cells. Vaccines such as Live Intranasal Monovalent Vaccines, Intramuscular Injection Monovalent Vaccines, Fluzone, etc.",,"Veeranjaneyulu, T. N.;Seerishna, B.;Kiran, T. N. R.;Madhulatha, A. V. S.;Bindu, A.

2140,Autochthonous hepatitis E virus infection as the cause of acute hepatitis in Germany - a case report,"There is increasing evidence that the hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis not only in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and America with poor hygiene standards, but also in highly industrialized countries. We report here on two patients from Thuringia (Germany) with an HEV infection without a recent stay abroad. All other common causes of hepatitis were excluded. Transaminases were significantly increased in both cases, while jaundice was detectable in only one patient. Both patients made a full recovery over the long term. Epidemiological and phylogenetic data from virus analyzes suggest that HEV infection must be considered a zoonosis. It is likely that animal-to-human virus transmission occurs through undercooked meat or entrails, e.g. B. of pigs or wild animals takes place. In summary, HEV infection is a relevant differential diagnosis in acute non-A/B/C viral hepatitis. Further studies are required to identify other transmission routes, pathogen reservoirs and novel concepts for prophylaxis, especially in patients at risk of liver diseases. © 2010 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.",,"Veitt, R.;Reichardt, M.;Wenzel, J.;Jilg, W.",2011.0,,10.1055/s-0029-1245767,0
2141,Phylodynamics of the genus Parapoxvirus in Mexico (2007–2011),"In this study, we report for the first time the phylodynamics of the genus Parapoxvirus (PPV) in Mexico. Based on PCR analysis of 124 epithelial samples collected from naturally infected goats, sheep and cows in Mexico between 2007 and 2011, we found that various PPVs were present in 21 of the 24 states sampled during this study. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the occurrence of different PPV species in Mexico and their phylogenetic relationship with other PPV circulating in the US and Canada. Furthermore, we describe the existence of two distinct phylogenetic ORFV groups that are uniquely associated with the host (ovine or caprine). Evidence for directed selection at five specific amino acid residues in the enveloped glycoprotein B2L may help support this host preference. Overall, the results obtained in this study underscore the importance of the genus PPV in Mexico and open the possibility for future studies that will describe in more detail the importance of this genus in North America.",,"Velazquez-Salinas, L.;Ramirez-Medina, E.;Bracht, A.

2142,Avian influenza viruses in wild birds: viral evolution in a multi-host ecosystem,"Wild ducks and gulls are the main reservoirs of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). The mechanisms driving AIV evolution are complex in sites where diverse duck and gull species from multiple flight routes breed, winter, or reside in instars. The Republic of Georgia lies at the crossroads of three migratory routes: the Central Asian Air Route, the East Africa/West Asia Air Route, and the Black Sea-Mediterranean Air Route. For six full study years (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species breeding, migrating, and wintering in Georgia. We found a considerable variety of virus subtypes, the prevalence of which varied from year to year. The low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8 and H16N3, as well as two highly pathogenic ones AIVs (HPAIVs) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8 have been found. Whole-genome pedigrees revealed significant host-species ancestry restriction for almost all gene segments and significant differences in observed resort rates, defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruity, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs between different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses circulating in Eurasia in 2014 and 2015 did not reorder, but analysis after their subsequent spread in 2016 and 2017 revealed reordering in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions, with local AIVs being preserved in Georgia, while other lineages showed significant genetic interactions with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relatively small samples in the region.",,"Venkatesh, D.;Poen, M.

2143,Molecular characterization of Belgian pseudorabiesvirus isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar,"Aujeszky's disease is an economically important disease in domestic pigs caused by suid herpesvirus 1, also known as pseudorabies virus (PRV). In several European countries, including Belgium, the virus has been successfully eradicated from the domestic pig population. However, the presence of PRV in the wild boar population poses a risk of possible reintroduction of the virus into the domestic pig population. It is therefore important to assess the genetic relatedness between circulating strains and possible epidemiological links. In this study, nine historical Belgian domestic pig isolates circulating before 1990 and five more recent wild boar isolates sourced from Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg since 2006 were genetically characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic analysis. While all wild boar isolates have been characterized as type I RFLP genotypes, the RFLP patterns of domestic pig isolates suggest that a genotype I to genotype II shift may have occurred in the domestic pig population in the 1980s. Phylogenetic analysis observed Belgian wild boar isolates belonging to both clade A and B, while all domestic pig isolates were grouped within clade A. Joint phylogenetic analysis of wild boar and domestic pig strains showed that some isolates with identical sequences were present in both populations, raising the question of whether these strains pose an increased risk of reintroducing the virus into the native population. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Verpoest, S.;Cay, A.

2144,The ability of UL49.5 proteins to inhibit TAP is widespread among members of the Varicellovirus genus,"Lifelong infection by varicelloviruses is characterized by a delicate balance between the host's immune response and the immune evasion strategies employed by these viruses. Viral-derived peptides are presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The antigen processing-associated transporter (TAP) transports the peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, where loading with MHC-I molecules takes place. The varicelloviruses bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), pseudorabies virus and equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 have been found to encode a UL49.5 protein that inhibits TAP-mediated peptide transport. To investigate the extent to which UL49.5-mediated TAP inhibition is conserved within the Alphaherpesvirinae family, the homologues of five additional varicelloviruses, one mardivirus and one iltovirus were examined. The UL49.5 proteins from BoHV-5, bubaline herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1, and felid herpesvirus 1 have been identified as potent TAP inhibitors. The UL49.5 proteins of varicella zoster virus and simian varicellovirus cannot block TAP; this is not due to the lack of viral cofactors that might aid in this process, since cells infected with these viruses also showed no reduced TAP function. The UL49.5 homologues of Mardivirus Marek's Disease Virus 1 and Iltovirus infectious laryngotracheitis virus did not block TAP, suggesting that the ability to inhibit TAP via UL49.5 was acquired only by varicelloviruses. A phylogenetic analysis of viruses that inhibit TAP through their UL49.5 proteins reveals an interesting heritable pattern that points to the existence of this ability in defined clades within the genus Varicellovirus.

Classical swine fever virus can be divided into three genogroups, each consisting of three or four subgroups. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the genotypes of CSFV isolates in the Republic of Serbia. This study, based on sequence analysis of the partial E2 gene and 5' non-coding region (NCR) of 15 CSFV isolated from domestic pigs between 2006 and 2008, revealed that all were clustered in genetic group 2.3. Furthermore, we showed that the two most commonly used real-time RT-PCR assays could detect all local CSF viruses circulating in Serbia during an intensive vaccination campaign against CSF in recent years",,"Vesna, M.;Sonja, R.;Valcic, A.

Initial analysis included both spiked and unspiked bird faecal samples, as well as unspiked human faecal samples. We detected 21 viruses in the non-spiked bird samples (Australian Muscovy duck and Pacific black duck) and we also present a summary of some viruses detected in human faecal samples.

Avian Coronavirus and Avian Paramyxovirus 6. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses, while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/sequenced viruses. In addition to virus detection, the technique also enabled the characterization of the host's mitochondrial DNA present and hence the identification of the host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provided insight into the ""ribosomal activity microbiome""; from intestinal parasites; and from foods eaten, such as plants or insects, which we correlated with viruses not associated with the bird host.",,"Vibin, J.;Chamings, A.;Collier, F.;Klaassen, M.;Nelson, T.

Sequence-independent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of capsid-protected, nuclease-resistant viral nucleic acids were followed by DNA sequencing and sequence similarity searches. Limited Sanger sequencing (35 to 240 subclones per sample) identified an average of 1.4 different eukaryotic viruses per sample, while Pyrosequencing revealed 2.6 viruses per sample. In addition to bacteriophages and plant viruses, we detected known enteric viruses including rotavirus, adenovirus, picobirnavirus, and human enterovirus species A (HEV-A) through HEV-C, as well as numerous other members of the Picornaviridae family including parechovirus, aichi virus, rhinovirus, and human cardiovirus. The viruses with the most divergent sequences compared to previously reported viruses included members of a new genus Picornaviridae and four new virus species (members of the families Dicistroviridae, Nodaviridae and Circoviridae and the genus Bocavirus). Samples from six healthy contacts of AFP patients were similarly analyzed and also contained multiple viruses, particularly HEV-C, including a potentially novel enterovirus genotype. Determining the prevalences and pathogenicities of the new genotypes, species, genera, and potential new virus families identified in this study in different demographic groups requires further studies with different demographic and patient groups, now facilitated by knowledge of these viral genomes.",,"Victoria, J.

2148,Viral nucleic acids in live attenuated vaccines: detection of minority variants and an adventitious virus,"Metagenomics and a panmicrobial microarray were used to study eight live attenuated vaccines. Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and two live rotavirus vaccines were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyrosequenced. Over half a million sequence reads were generated, covering 20 to 99% of the attenuated viral genomes at depths of up to 8,000 reads per nucleotide. Mutations and minority variants compared to vaccine strains not known to affect attenuation have been detected in OPV, mumps virus and varicella-zoster virus. The expected detection of endogenous retroviral sequences from the producing avian and primate cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be non-infectious to humans, was present as RNA in virus particles, while Simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an oral rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a common nonpathogenic swine virus that has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Deep sequencing and microarrays can therefore detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live attenuated vaccines.

In this study, 16 independent outbreaks of diarrhea in suckling piglets and sows in which rotavirus A was the only identified pathogen were examined. Deep sequencing was performed on total RNA from 24 positive fecal samples. Genotyping, phylogenetic and Bayesian analyzes indicated that all isolates shared a common porcine or human porcine ancestor. The new strain was introduced to the population just before the outbreaks began. In addition, high diversification of the VP7 and VP4 genes occurred in a short period of time. Isolates showed a high number of amino acid changes in the neutralizing epitopes compared to vaccine sequences.

2151,Stumbling upon emerging pathogens around the world: A phylogeographic approach to determining the epidemiology of porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) considering global trade,"Porcine Circovirus-2 (PCV-2) is an emerging virus that has been implicated in a number of different syndromes in pigs known as Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD). Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 has achieved a global distribution, has become endemic in most swine producing countries, and is currently recognized as a major cause of losses on swine farms. In this study, we analyzed the main pathways of PCV-2 spread between pig producing countries using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches. A search of PCV-2 genomic sequences in GenBank was performed and the 420 PCV-2 sequences obtained were grouped into haplotypes (set of sequences showing 100% identity) based on the infinite site model of genome evolution. A phylogenetic hypothesis was derived from Bayesian inference for virus strain classification, and a haplotype network was constructed from median joining to predict the geographic distribution of and genealogical relationships between haplotypes. In order to provide epidemiological and economic context to these analyses, we considered all available information on PCV-2 sequences in GenBank, including published articles on virus isolation and statistics on live pig trade, contained in the UN Comtrade database (http: //comtrade.un.org/). In these analyses, we identified a strong correlation between the spread of PCV-2 predicted by the haplotype network and international live pig trade statistics. This correlation offers a new perspective on the epidemiology of PCV-2, underscores the importance of animal movement around the world for the emergence of new pathogens, and demonstrates the need for effective sanitary barriers in the live animal trade. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Vidigal, P.

In this study, we genetically characterize the porcine hepadnavirus strains in pigs from slaughterhouses located in certified slaughterhouses in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, and assess their hepatotropic potential. Results: Porcine bile and liver samples were positive for partial genome amplification (ORF S and ORF C), direct sequencing and viral load quantification. Sequencing of the gene encoding the surface antigen allowed classification of hepadnavirus into genotypes, similar to HBV genotype classification. Indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of HBsAg antigen in liver tissue sections.

2153,"Hendra and Nipah Infection: Pathology, Models, and Possible Therapies","The Paramyxoviridae family includes several genera that contain emerging or re-emerging threats to human and animal health, with no truly specific effective treatment available. Hendra and Nipah viruses belong to a newly identified genus of emerging paramyxoviruses, henipavirus. Since their discovery in the 1990s, henipavirus outbreaks have been associated with high potential economic and public health threats. Compared to other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses appear to have unique properties. Henipaviruses are zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a broader tropism than most other paramyxoviruses and can cause severe acute encephalitis with features unique among viral encephalitis. There are currently no approved effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for henipavirus infection. Although ribavirin has been used empirically and appeared useful during the largest outbreak caused by one of these viruses, Nipah virus, its effectiveness is controversial given its lack of efficacy in several animal models of henipavirus infection. Nevertheless, due to its highly pathogenic nature, much effort has been invested in the development of anti-henipavirus therapeutics. In this review, we describe the unique characteristics of henipavirus infections and the various strategies and animal models that have been developed to date to identify and test potential drugs to prevent or treat henipavirus infections. Some of these components have the potential to be broad spectrum antiviral agents because they target effectors of viral pathogenesis common to other viruses. We will focus on small molecules or biologics rather than vaccine strategies developed as anti-henipaviral therapeutics. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"Vigant, F.;Lee, B.",2011.0,,,0
2154,Analysis of the crow's lung transcriptome in response to infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) H5N1 currently circulating in Asia causes severe disease in domestic poultry as well as wild birds such as crows. However, the molecular pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in crows and other wild birds is not well understood. Therefore, as a step of investigation, a comprehensive global gene expression analysis was performed on crows infected with HPAI H5N1 crow isolate (A/Crow/India/11TI11/2011) using high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) (GS FLX Titan XLR70 ). The reference crow genome is not available, so RNA-Seq analysis was performed based on a de novo assembled transcriptome. The RNA-seq result shows that 4052 genes were expressed only in uninfected samples, 6277 genes were expressed only in HPAIV-infected samples, and of the 6814 genes that were expressed in both samples, 2279 genes were expressed significantly differently. Our transcriptome profile data allow to understand the molecular mechanism behind the recent fatal HPAIV outbreak in crows, which until recently was thought to cause fatal infections only in gallinaceous birds such as chickens but not in wild birds. The pattern of differentially expressed genes suggests that this isolate of H5N1 virus evades the host's innate immune response by attenuating interferon (IFN)-induced signaling, possibly by downregulating IFN type I (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 ) and type II IFN receptors, upregulates the signaling inhibitors suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 and alters the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs).

Glycoprotein Erns of an atypical bovine pestivirus Th/04_KhonKaen was produced in a baculovirus expression system and purified by affinity chromatography. The recombinant Erns protein was used as an antigen in a microsphere immunoassay to detect antibodies to BVDV-1 and atypical bovine pestivirus. The diagnostic performance of the new method was evaluated by testing a total of 596 serum samples and the assay was compared to the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Based on the median negative/positive cutoff fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 2800, the microsphere immunoassay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% compared to the ELISA. The immunoassay was able to detect antibodies against both BVDV-1 and the atypical pestivirus. This novel microsphere immunoassay has the potential to be multiplexed for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against various bovine pathogens in a high-throughput and economical manner. © 2012 Elsevier BV",,"Vijayaraghavan, B.;Xia, H.;Harimoorthy, R.;Liu, L.;BelÃ¡k, S.",2012.0,,10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.06.017,0

2157,Human coronavirus OC43 full genome sequence: Molecular clock analysis suggests a relatively recent zoonotic coronavirus transmission event,"Corona viruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of around 30 kb. Based on genetic similarities, coronaviruses are divided into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), share remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30,738 nucleotides) of the prototype HCoV OC43 strain (ATCC VR7S9). Whole genome and open reading frame (ORF) analyzes were performed in comparison to the BCoV genome. There is a 290 nucleotide deletion in the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, corresponding to the absence of the BCoV ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major HCoV OC43 ORFs and for those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity is shown between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs except the E gene. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggest a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event, dating their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. An evolutionary rate on the order of 4 × 10 -4 nucleotide changes per site per year has been estimated. This is the first zoonotic animal-human coronavirus pair that can be analyzed to provide insight into the processes of adaptation of a non-human coronavirus to a human host, which is important for understanding the interspecies transmission events leading to the emergence of the virus Coronavirus have led severe outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome.

2159,Organization and diversity of the 3'-noncoding region of the classical swine fever virus genome,"Specific PCR primers were chosen to amplify a 359 bp DNA fragment encoding the 3' portion of the polymerase gene and the 3' non-coding (3'-NC) region of the classical swine fever virus genome (CSFV) flanked. In RT-PCR, the selected fragment was amplified from the genomes of 27 virus strains collected over half a century from Europe, America and Asia, and from three vaccine strains of CSFV. Eight PCR products were sequenced using an automated sequencer. The nucleotide sequence analysis was performed with the computer programs DNASTAR and PHYLIP. The comparative studies revealed that the 3'-NC region contains a variable nucleotide region located immediately after the stop codon TGA or TAA. In addition, a highly conserved constant region near the extreme 3' terminus was identified. Two imperfect repeated sequences were found in both the variable and constant regions. In addition, the variable region was characterized by the appearance of a 50 bp poly-AT lane. Phylogenetic analyzes using different mathematical approaches (MegAlign, Neighbor-Joining-Method, Maximum Likelihood, Parsimony) revealed that the investigated CSFV strains were divided into two main phylogenetic groups. Group I consisted of the Brescia reference strain along with ancient American and European field isolates and a Brazilian vaccine strain. Group II included the reference strain Alfort (Tübingen) and newer European field strains. The congenital tremor strain formed a distinct lineage which, although very different, was more closely related to group I than to group II. In summary, the present phylogenetic grouping yielded very similar results to previous studies based on a comparison of the E2 (gp55) region. The agreement of the phylogenetic analysis in the two different regions confirms the reliability of the genetic grouping of CSFV strains into two major genogroups.",,"VilÄek, Å ;BelÃ¡k, S.",1997.0,,10.1023/a:1007971110065,0
2160,Genetic diversity of BVDV: implications for classification and molecular epidemiology,"Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is important for the accurate classification of viruses and for the development of molecular epidemiology. BVDV isolates were typically typed based on comparison of genomic sequences from the 5"" untranslated region (5"" UTR), Npro and E2 regions. Recently, we have identified 11 genetic groups (subgenotypes) of BVDV-1. Our further experiments confirmed a new subgenotype, BVDV-1k, isolated from cattle in Switzerland. BVDV isolates from India have been typed as BVDV-1b, while BVDV-1c is a predominant subgenotype in Australia. The results of BVDV genetic typing indicate that the distribution of subgenotypes is unrelated to the geographic origin of the virus isolates. © 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Vilcek, S.;Durkovic, B.;Kolesarova, M.;Paton, D.

2161,Genetic diversity of recent bovine viral diarrheal viruses from south-eastern Austria (Styria),"To characterize the isolates of the Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) circulating in the south-east of Austria, namely in Styria, 71 blood samples taken between 1998 and 2000 from persistently infected cattle in 62 herds were subjected to genetic typing. For this purpose, 288 bp fragments from the 5″ untranslated region (5″-UTR) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR). The products were sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis. Seventy virus isolates were typed as BVDV species 1 (BVDV-1). Only one isolate was typed as BVDV species 2 (BVDV-2), which is the first isolate of this pestivirus genotype found in Austria. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses belonging to five genetic groups within BVDV-1 are circulating in Styria. Most viruses (53) were found in group BVDV-1f, nine viruses in BVDV-1h, four viruses in BVDV-1b, three viruses in BVDV-1d and one virus in BVDV-1g. No virus was found in the BVDV-1a genetic group, which is prevalent in the UK and widespread in the US. Likewise, the BVDV isolates predominant in a neighboring country, namely Germany, belonged to different genogroups than those circulating in Styria. We conclude that certain BVDV-1 genetic groups are predominant in a given region and environment. New groups, including BVDV-2, can be introduced, eg through animal trade. The low incidence of BVDV-2 in Styria is consistent with the sporadic occurrence of this virus in other regions of Europe. © 2002 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved.",,"Vilcek, S.;Greiser-Wilke, I.;Durkovic, B.;Obritzhauser, W.;Deutz, A.;KÃ¶fer, J.",2003.0,,10.1016/s0378-1135(02)00296-1,0
2162,Molecular characterization of sheep pestiviruses,"Forty-two ovine pestivirus isolates collected over an 18-year period were compared by phylogenetic analysis. The viruses were mainly field isolates from Great Britain; two more were from Sweden and two from New Zealand. RT-PCR products were obtained from two genomic regions, one within the 5' non-coding (5'-NC) region and the other encompassing parts of the p20 (N(pro)) and C coding regions. Direct sequencing of the 5'-NC-PCR products, followed by computer-aided phylogenetic analysis, classified the ovine pestiviruses into three major genotypes. The results showed that sheep can be naturally infected not only with border disease virus (BDV), but also with bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) types I and II. The BDV isolates separated into two major subtypes represented by the Moredun strain from Scotland and the 137/4 strain from England. The BVDV-I group consisted of three clusters, two of which were represented by the BVDV reference strains NADL and Osloss, respectively, and the third by the sheep isolates D1120/1 and D1432/P. The grouping of ovine pestiviruses based on a comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5'-NC region was confirmed by a comparative analysis of the p20 (NP(pro)) and C coding regions performed at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels . The occurrence of three genotypes in sheep, including BVDV-I and BVDV-II, indicates the inadequacy of the current host-species-based nomenclature and classification of pestiviruses.",,"VilÄek, Å ;Nettleton, P.

2163,Genetic variability of classical swine fever virus,"The genetic variability of classical swine fever virus was examined by comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of 76 virus isolates collected on three continents during half a century. Portions of the E2 (gp55) and polymerase gene coding regions of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR and DNA fragments of 254 and 207 bp, respectively, were sequenced. Comparative sequence analysis of the E2 region revealed two main phylogenetic groups of CSFV, suggesting that the virus apparently evolved from two ancestral nodes. Group I (represented by the Brescia strain) consisted of old and newer American and Asian viruses, as well as old English isolates from the 1950's. This group was divided into three subgroups, designated IA IC. Group II (represented by the Alfort strain) consisted of relatively recent isolates from Europe, along with the Osaka strain isolated in Japan from a pig of European origin. Based on genetic distances, the group was divided into subgroups II.A and II.B. Malaysian isolates have branched into both groups, indicating multiple origins for simultaneous outbreaks in that country. All ten vaccine strains tested were branched into Group I, suggesting a common ancestor. The Japanese Kanagawa strain isolated in 1974 and the British congenital tremor strain of 1964 were the most prominent variants of CSFV in our collection. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the polymerase coding region of 32 European strains distinguished subgroups II.A and II.B, which were similar to the corresponding subgroups of the E2 pedigree. Thus, the results indicated that the E2 region and the polymerase-encoding regions appear appropriate for the grouping of CSFV isolates from around the world, distinguishing two main groups of virus. The reliability of these regions for phylogenetic analysis is indicated by the similarity of the results obtained from the two separate parts of the CSFV genome.",,"VilÄek, Å ;Stadejek, T.;Ballagi-PordÃ¡ny, A.;Lowings, J.

2164,Diversity of hepatitis E virus genotype 3: phylogenetic analysis and presence of subtype 3b in wild boar in Europe,"Indigenous hepatitis E cases caused by genotype 3 (HEV-3) viruses are increasingly being diagnosed worldwide, particularly in developed countries. Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease and accumulating evidence suggests that domestic and wild pigs are the main reservoirs of HEV-3. A detailed analysis of HEV-3 subtypes could help determine the interplay of human activity, the role of animals as reservoirs, and transmission between species. Although full genomic sequences are the most useful for HEV subtype determination, only partial genomic sequences are available in most cases. We therefore performed a subtype classification analysis using regions from all three open reading frames of the genome. More than 1000 published HEV-3 isolates have been subtyped using this approach. Newly obtained HEV partial sequences from killed German wild boar were also included in this study. These sequences have been assigned to genotype 3 and clustered within subtypes 3a, 3i and unexpectedly one of them within subtype 3b, a first non-human report of this subtype in Europe.",,"Vina-Rodriguez, A.;Schlosser, J.;Becher, D.;Kaden, V.;Groschup, M.

2165,Investigation of human cancers for retroviruses by low-stringency target enrichment and high-throughput sequencing,"Although almost one fifth of all human cancers have an infectious etiology, the causes of most cancers remain unexplained. Despite the enormous data output from high-throughput shotgun sequencing, viral DNA in a clinical sample typically represents a fraction of the host DNA that is too small to be detected. Sequence variations between viral genomes complicate the use of sequence-specific and highly sensitive PCR methods. It was therefore our goal to develop and characterize a method that allows sensitive detection of sequences despite considerable variation. We show that our low stringency in-solution hybridization method enables the detection of <100 virus copies. Furthermore, distantly related proviral sequences can be enriched by orders of magnitude, enabling the discovery of previously unknown viral sequences by high-throughput sequencing. The sensitivity was sufficient to detect retroviral sequences in clinical specimens. We used this method to screen for novel retroviruses in samples from three cancer types. Consistent with recent studies, our investigation revealed no retroviral infections in human B-cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or colon cancer biopsies. Nevertheless, our generally applicable method enables sensitive detection and allows sequencing of distantly related sequences from complex material.",,"Vinner, L.;Mourier, T.;Friis-Nielsen, J.;Gniadecki, R.;Dybkaer, K.;Rosenberg, J.;Langhoff, J.

A 474 bp product encompassing the hypervariable region of the IBDV VP2 gene was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nucleotide sequences of two isolates, VMB1 and VMB2, were determined and compared to twenty IBDV strains, including seven very virulent, four classically virulent, four classically attenuated, three antigenic variants and two avirulent serotype 2 strains. The two isolates showed 96.5–98.4% similarity to very virulent strains, 84.6–94.6% to classically virulent strains, 90.0–91.4% to classical attenuated strains, 83.0– 91.9% with antigenic variants and 65.8-68.7% with avirulent strains. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two isolates revealed amino acid substitutions of V256I, N279D, L294I and N299S, specific for very virulent strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two isolates, along with a reported highly virulent Indian strain, were closely related to European, Japanese and Chinese highly virulent strains, indicating their evolutionary origin.",,"Viswas, K.

2168,Novel hemotropic mycoplasma are widespread and genetically diverse in vampire bats,"Bats (order: Chiroptera) have been extensively studied as reservoir hosts for viruses important to human and animal health. However, whether bats are equally competent hosts for non-viral pathogens as bacteria remains an important open question. Here we analyzed blood and saliva samples from vampire bats from Peru and Belize for hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (hemoplasma), bacteria that can cause inapparent infection or anemia in hosts. 16S rRNA gene amplification of blood showed that 67% (150/223) of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were infected with hemoplasma. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed three new genotypes that were phylogenetically related but not identical to hemoplasma described from other (non-vampire) bat species, rodents, humans, and non-human primates. Hemoplasm prevalence in vampire bats was highest in non-reproductive and young individuals, did not differ between countries, and was relatively stable (ie, endemic) over time. Metagenomics from pooled D. rotundus saliva from Peru discovered non-hemotropic mycoplasma species and hemoplasma genotypes phylogenetically similar to those identified in blood, providing indirect evidence for possible direct transmission of hemoplasma through biting or social contact. This study shows that vampire bats harbor several novel hemoplasmas and sheds light on risk factors for infection and basic modes of transmission. Given the high frequency of direct contact that occurs when vampire bats eat humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, the potential for these bacteria to be transmitted between species should be explored in future work.",,"Volokhov, D.

OBJECTIVES: We characterized pulmonary changes in these fatal Norwegian cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Detailed clinical information and upper and lower airway specimens were collected after hospitalization. At autopsy, lung tissue was collected, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical and light microscopy studies were performed to visualize local expression of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and pyrosequencing of the unfixed samples enabled the identification of mutations in the influenza virus surface glycoprotein (hemagglutinin gene) particularly at position 222. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The overall course of the disease lasted from 2 to 40 days (median 9 days). Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was evident in 11 cases, 4 of which had no apparent underlying disease. Obesity was evident in 12 cases, with three people classified as otherwise healthy. The HA D222G mutation was detected in six cases, 3 of which had no underlying disease. Immunohistochemistry showed that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is prominent at the site of inflammation both in close proximity to and within alveolar structures in lung tissue. In addition to a possible role for the HA-D222G mutation, our results indicate that host factors and underlying diseases in the infected individuals are of fundamental importance for the course of the disease in many cases.

2170,"99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Diseases: Agricultural Lifestyles and the Hygiene Hypothesis","About 15 years have passed since Strachan first put forward the idea that infection and unsanitary contact can offer protection against the development of allergic diseases. The so-called ""hygiene hypothesis"" has since undergone numerous modifications in the fields of epidemiology, clinical science and immunology. Three main areas of research were advanced: exploring the role of overt viral and bacterial infections in the etiology of allergic diseases; to investigate the importance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds for the development of allergies; and to examine the effect of both exposures on the underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. A concept that unifies these different aspects has not been found, but different parts of a complex interplay between host immune responses, properties of the invading microorganism, the extent and variety of environmental exposure, and the interactions between the genetic background of an exposed subject and the environmental pressures become visible. A natural experiment on the hygiene hypothesis is the recurring observation of a protective effect of growing up on a farm for asthma and allergies. This has been shown in a large number of epidemiological studies worldwide in children and adults. The timing and duration of exposure probably play a crucial role. The greatest risk reduction was demonstrated for those who were exposed prenatally and then continuously into adulthood. The protective factors in these agricultural environments are not yet fully elucidated. Findings from various studies indicate that contact with livestock confers protection, at least in childhood. The consumption of unprocessed cow's milk directly from the farm has also been proven to protect against asthma and allergies in children. Increased levels of microbial substances can at least partially contribute to the ""farm effect"". However, few studies have measured microbial exposure in these environments and the results obtained so far suggest that the underlying protective microbial exposure(s) have not been identified, but a number of studies have using metagenomic approaches are currently underway. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection against respiratory allergies are also not well understood. There is good evidence for the involvement of innate immune responses, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking. In addition, a number of gene-environment interactions have been observed. © 2010 British Society for Immunology.",,"Von Mutius, E.",2010.0,,10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04138.x,0
2171,The possible role played by buffalo in recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in South Africa,"The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) serves as a maintenance host for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in southern Africa. A single buffalo can become infected with all three endemic serotypes of FMD virus (SAT-1, SAT-2, and SAT-3) and pose a risk of infection to other susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. The 2000 floods in southern Africa severely damaged the Kruger National Park (KNP) deer fence and there were several reports of buffalo escaping the park. The VP1 gene, which encodes the major antigenic determinant of FMD virus, was used to determine phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates recovered from the outbreaks and those previously recovered from buffalo in the KNP. These results show that buffalo were most likely the source of the outbreaks, suggesting that disease control through fencing, as well as vaccination, is extremely important to ensure FMD does not become established in livestock populations.",,"Vosloo, W.;Boshoff, K.;Dwarka, R.;Bastos, A.",2002.0,,,0

A virulent form of IBDV entered South Africa in 1989 and little molecular information is available on this strain to date. In this study, the polyprotein coding region of the South African strain SA-KZN95 was sequenced and analyzed along with 52 representative sequences from other serotype I and II strains. We examined the relative impact of recombination on phylogenetic reconstruction using a multidimensional scaling approach. Phylogenetic analyzes consistently placed the South African isolate within the very virulent IBDV clade. Selection analyzes were also performed to identify evolutionarily relevant amino acid residues. Previously, 19 residues in the polyprotein were shown to be potentially diagnostic for the different IBDV pathotypes. This study identified two additional unique residues in the polyprotein that can be used as genetic signatures in future viral identifications.

After subcloning into the EcoRI site of pBR322 and amplification, both strands of the insert were sequenced using a shotgun strategy. Starting from the first initiation codon, immediately preceded by a GC-rich region encompassing four overlapping CCGCC consensus sequences, an open reading frame for a 302 amino acid long polypeptide was resolved. This peptide had an M(r) of 33,827, started with methionine and ended with serine. The identity of the isolated cDNA was confirmed by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with resolved sequences of bovine spermidine synthase tryptic peptides. The coding strand of the cDNA showed no specific regulatory or ribosome binding signals within 82 nucleotides before the start codon and no polyadenylation signal within 247 nucleotides after the stop codon. The coding region, which contained a 13 nucleotide repeat near the 5' end, was longer than and quite different from its bacterial counterpart. This region appears to be of retroviral origin and shows significant homology with sequences found in a variety of human, mammalian, avian, and viral genes and mRNAs. By computer analysis, the first 200 nucleotides of the 5' end of the coding strand appear to be capable of forming a very stable secondary structure with a free energy change of -157.6 kcal/mol.

In this study, field surveys were conducted in the western highlands of Kenya, collecting viral symptomatic leaf samples. Next-generation sequencing was then performed to provide insight into the molecular evolution and evolutionary relationships of Bean Common Mosaic Necrosis Virus (BCMNV) and Cowpea Aphid Borne Mosaic Virus (CABMV) found in symptomatic communities Beans and cowpeas are present. Eleven nearly complete genomes of BCMNV and two of CABMV were obtained from western Kenya. Bayesian phylogenomic analyzes and tests for differential selection pressures within sites and across tree branches of the viral genomes were performed. Three well-supported clades in BCMNV and one supported clade for CABMNV were resolved and matched individual gene trees. Analysis of selection pressures within sites and across phylogenetic branches suggested that both viruses evolved independently, but under strong purifying selection at a slow evolutionary rate. These results provide valuable insights into the evolution of BCMNV and CABMV genomes and their relationship to other viral genomes worldwide.

2177,"In vivo characterization of two Australian isolates of Marek's disease virus, including pathology, viral load and neuropathotyping based on clinical signs","OBJECTIVE: To assess the pathogenicity of Australian Marek's disease virus (MDV), isolate MPF23 (1985) against the reference strain MPF57 based on pathology, viral load and neuropathotyping based on clinical signs. METHODS: Two MDV challenge isolates (MPF57 or MPF23) were administered to unvaccinated, specific pathogen-free (SPF) layer chicks on day 5 post hatch at three challenge doses (500, 2000 or 8000 plaque forming units (pfu)/chick). . Mortality, body weight, immune organ weights, MDV load in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and clinical signs were measured up to 56 days post-challenge (dpc). RESULTS: MPF23 was the more pathogenic of the two viruses and resulted in a higher mortality (81% vs. 62%) and a higher incidence of MD lesions (100% vs. 76%). MPF23 induced earlier, more persistent and more severe neurological signs in the period 26-56 dpc. However, there were few differences during the 0-23 dpc used in the neuropathotyping classification to be tested. The pattern observed during this earlier period classified both viruses as neuropathotype B, consistent with a very virulent pathotype. MDV burden in PBL at 7 and 44 dpc did not differ between virus isolates, but burden at 7 dpc was significantly and negatively associated with time to euthanasia or death. CONCLUSION: MPF23 appears to be at least as virulent as the MDV strains isolated over the following two decades. The neuropathotyping system developed in the USA did not clearly distinguish between the two isolates tested; However, extending the time to assess clinical symptoms beyond 26 dpc showed clear differences.",,"Wajid, S.

2179,A global genomic characterization of nairoviruses identifies nine discrete genogroups with distinctive structural features and host-vector associations,"Nairoviruses are primarily tick-borne bunyaviruses, some of which are known to cause mild to severe febrile illness in humans or livestock. We describe the genome sequences of 11 poorly characterized nairoviruses that have ecological associations with either birds (viruses Farallon, Punta Salinas, Sapphire II, Zirqa, Avalon, Clo Mor, Taggert, and Abu Hammad), rodents (viruses Qalyub and Bandia), or camels (Dera -Ghazi Khan virus). Global phylogenetic analyzes of proteins encoded in the L, M, and S RNA segments of these and 20 other available nairovirus genomes identified nine well-supported genogroups (Nairobi sheep disease, Thiafora, Sakhalin, Keterah, Qalyub, Kasokero , Dera Ghazi Khan, Hughes , and Tamdy). Genogroup-specific structural variations were evident, particularly in the M segment, which encodes a polyprotein from which virion envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) are generated by proteolytic processing. Structural variations include the extension, truncation, or absence of sequences encoding an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein in the N-terminal domain, distinctive patterns of conserved cysteine residues in the GP38-like domain, insertion of sequences expressing a double-membrane span encode protein (NSm) between the Gn and Gc domains and the presence of an alternative long open reading frame encoding a viroporin-like transmembrane protein (Gx).

2180,The history of bluetongue disease and a current global overview,"Bluetongue (BT) disease was first reported more than 125 years ago when European breeds of sheep were introduced to southern Africa. BT virus (BTV) has been identified in many tropical and temperate regions of the world. BT, the disease, is a ruminant phenomenon in temperate zones. Clinical diseases are few in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. At least 24 serotypes of BTV have been described. While the viruses are classified antigenically and taxonomically as BTV, each serotype is unique and may not cause BT disease. The BTVs are transmitted among ruminants by competent vector species of the genus Culicoides, ie mosquitoes or midges. BTV serotypes exist with vector species of Culicoides in predictable, but finite, geographic and ecological cycles or ecosystems around the world. Despite the almost certain movement of livestock and Culicoides species between these ecosystems, there is little evidence that introduced BTV serotypes have become established in these ecosystems. Rather, periodic cyclical expansions and regressions of these virus-vector ecosystems allow the virus and disease to move into and out of adjacent, non-endemic areas in a pattern common to many other known arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). is characteristic. Previous publications suggested that a carrier condition occurred in cattle infected with BTV as fetuses. No subsequent natural experience or research supports the hypothesis, which has not been validated. The conclusions of the research are not accepted by the scientific community. It is therefore logical to propose that regulatory restrictions on the movement of cattle from BTV-affected countries be relaxed or removed.",,"Walton, T. E.",2004.0,Jul-Sep,,0

2183,Identification of novel and differentially expressed microRNAs in enzootic goat nasal adenocarcinoma,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally regulate a variety of genes involved in growth, development, metabolism, and other biological processes in eukaryotic cells, and numerous miRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression. Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA), an epithelial tumor induced in goats and sheep by enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), is a chronic, progressive, contact-borne disease. Methods: In this work, small RNA Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to construct a goat nasal miRNA library. This study aimed to identify novel and differentially expressed miRNAs in tumor and paracarcinoma nasal tissues of Nanjiang yellow goats with ENA. Results: Four hundred six known miRNAs and 29 new miRNAs were identified. A total of 116 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in paracarcinoma nasal tissues and ENA (54 down-regulated; 60 up-regulated; two expressed only in the control group); Target gene prediction and functional analysis revealed that 6176 non-redundant target genes, 1792 significant GO and 97 significant KEGG signaling pathways were predicted for 121 miRNAs (116 significant expression miRNAs and five-star sequence). Analysis of the GO and KEGG signaling pathways revealed that the majority of target genes in ENA are involved in cell proliferation, signaling and other processes associated with cancer. Conclusions: This is the first large-scale identification of miRNAs in Capra hircus ENA and provides a theoretical basis for studying the intricate miRNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in ENA pathogenesis and progression.",,"Wang, B.;Ye, N.;Cao, S.

2184,Microbial phylogeny determines the transcriptional response of the resistome to dynamic composting processes,"BACKGROUND: Animal manure is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that pose a potential health risk worldwide, particularly for resistance to antibiotics commonly used in animal production (such as tetracycline, sulfonamide, and fluoroquinolone). At present, the effects of biological treatment (composting) on the transcriptional response of manure ARGs and their microbial hosts are not well characterized. Composting is a dynamic process consisting of four different phases differentiated by the temperature resulting from microbial activity, namely the mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling and maturation phase. In this study, changes in resistome expression were determined and related to active microbiome profiles during the dynamic composting process. This was achieved by integrating metagenomic and metatranscriptomic time series data for the developing microbial community during composting. RESULTS: Composting markedly reduced the aggregate expression level of the manure resistome, which consisted mainly of genes encoding tetracycline, vancomycin, fluoroquinolone, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance and efflux pumps. Furthermore, a differential transcriptional response of Resistom to composting at the ARG level was highlighted. Expression of tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) decreased during composting, with marked shifts in the four stages of composting being associated with variations in antibiotic concentration. Composting had no effect on the expression of sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance genes, which increased slightly during the thermophilic period and then declined to initial levels. As indigenous populations changed widely during dynamic composting, the core resistome persisted and the composition of their reservoir hosts significantly correlated with dynamic active microbial phylogenetic structure. Hosts for sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance genes changed markedly in their phylogenetic structure, experiencing an initial increase and then a decrease in frequency. In contrast, hosts for tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) showed a constant decline over time. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional patterns of a nuclear resistome during composting were identified, and microbial phylogeny was the key factor in defining the differential transcriptional response of the resistome to this dynamic biological process. This research demonstrated the benefits of composting for manure treatment. It reduced the risk of emerging environmental contaminants such as tetracyclines, tetracycline resistance genes and clinically relevant pathogens bearing ARGs, as well as RNA viruses and bacteriophages.",,"Wang, C.;Dong, D.;Strong, P.

The GX871 genome was 10 segments and 18914 bp, one base less than the CHUV prototype strain K-47 due to a one base deletion in the 5 inch noncoding region of segment 8. In a short encoding, a frameshift mutation detected region (1010-1026 nt) corresponding to VP1 protein; this frameshift resulted in a five amino acid mutation from 336CVLSY340 to 336YGAKL340. In addition, there was a one base deletion at 1713 nt and a one base insertion at 1682 nt in the 3'' non-coding region of segment 5. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced VP2 amino acid sequences, viruses of the palyam serogroup have been identified in divided into three groups.

2189,Identification of the precursors of Indonesian and Vietnamese avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses from southern China,"Transmission of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus to Southeast Asian countries triggered the first major outbreak and transmission wave in late 2003, accelerating the global threat of a pandemic. Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and transmission routes of the H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the H5N1 wave 1 viruses, we recently performed further sequencing and analysis of samples collected from 2001-2004 from live poultry markets in Guangdong, Hunan and Yunnan in southern China. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. In addition, the results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, while two viruses isolated from Hunan in 2002 and were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia in 2003 (Group 2.1). Further phylogenetic analysis of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of these viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships as the surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were of genotype Z and had a high degree of similarity (≥ 99%) to their respective progeny viruses in most gene segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link for H5N1 virus between Yunnan and Vietnam and between Hunan and Indonesia in 2002 and 2003. The poultry trade could be responsible for the introduction of the virus into Vietnam, while the route of transmission from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear.

2190,Transcriptomic analysis identifies candidate genes and sets of genes that control the response of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells to poly-I:C stimulation,"Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic dsRNA analogue, has been shown to have similar stimulatory effects to viral dsRNA. In the present study, in order to gain deep knowledge of the transcriptional response of the host of pigs to poly-I:C stimulation, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from piglets of a Chinese native breed (Dapulian) and a modern commercial breed and stimulated (Landrace) with poly I:C, and compared their transcription profiles using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results showed that poly-I:C stimulation can induce significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes in Dapulian (g=290) as well as Landrace (g=85). We also performed a gene set analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) package and identified some significantly enriched gene sets in Dapulian (g=18) and Landrace (g=21). Most of the shared DE genes and gene sets were immune related and may play critical rules in the immune response to poly I:C stimulation. Furthermore, when comparing the gene expression profile between the two breeds, including control and poly I:C stimulation groups, we discovered large sets of significantly DE genes and enriched gene sets. Besides immune-related functions, some of the DE genes and sets of genes between the two breeds were involved in the development and growth of different tissues, which may be correlated with the different traits of the two breeds. The DE genes and gene sets discovered here provide crucial information for understanding the immune regulation of antiviral responses and the molecular mechanisms of differential genetic resistance to viral infections in modern and domestic pigs.",,"Wang, J.;Wang, Y.;Wang, H.;Wang, H.;Liu, J.

2191,Characterization of emerging Newcastle disease virus isolates in China,"Summary Background: Newcastle disease (ND) is a devastating worldwide poultry disease characterized by increased respiration, circulatory disturbances, hemorrhagic enteritis and nervous signs. Sequence analysis reveals multiple amino acid residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of recent Shaanxi strains. Both cross-protection and cross-serum neutralization tests showed that the conventional vaccine strains could not provide complete protection for the flocks. Methods: To better understand the epidemiology of Newcastle disease outbreak, a partial F gene and the complete HN gene were amplified from Shaanxi isolates by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by sequence and phylogenetic analyzes performed. In the pathogenicity analysis, tests were performed on both the high intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and the mean time to death (MDT) of chick embryos. In addition, a cross-protection experiment was also conducted in which specific pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain were challenged with the new Shaanxi strain. Results: Nine isolates of Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) recovered from ND outbreaks in chicken flocks in China were genotypically and pathotypically characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all NDVs recently isolated in Shaanxi have <sup>112</sup>RRQKRF<sup>117</sup> for the C-terminus of F2 protein and have high ICPI and MDT of chick embryos. suggesting that they were all classified as velogenic NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates showed that they belong to subgenotype VIId, which has been implicated in recent outbreaks in northwestern China. The percentage of amino acid sequence identity of F protein between recent Shaanxi strains and five vaccine strains ranged from 81.9%-88.1%, while the percentage of amino acid sequence identity of HN protein between recent Shaanxi strains and vaccine strains ranged from 81 .9% to 88.1% ranged from 87.4%-91.2%. In addition, a number of amino acid residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of these isolates were observed, which may result in an alteration in antibody recognition and neutralization capacity. A cross-protection experiment showed that specific pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain could not provide complete protection for the flocks challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain. Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that the recent Shannxi NDV strains exhibit antigenic variations that may be responsible for the recent outbreaks of NDVs in northwestern China.",,"Wang, J.

Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1 sequences revealed three distinct genetic groups. There was excellent agreement between the genetic groups assigned based on the full VP0, VP3, and the partial 3D regions. Given the growing importance of molecular techniques in diagnosis, we propose to designate the three genetic groups as DHV types A, B, and C. The new serotype strains isolated in South Korea grouped into genotypes B and C, respectively, suggesting a potential genetic correlate of the serotype. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1, VP0 and VP3 nucleotide and amino acid sequences and the partial 3D nucleotide sequence, DHVs of the same genotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous genotypes.

2195,Characterization of miRNAs involved in the response to poly(I:C) in porcine airway epithelial cells,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including infectious diseases. Knowledge of the miRNAs affected by poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA, in porcine airway epithelial cells (PAECs) contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of viral airway diseases in pigs, which cause huge economic losses worldwide every year. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to profile miRNA expression in poly(I:C)-treated PAECs compared to the untreated control. This approach yielded 23 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), five of which had not previously been associated with viral infections. Nineteen of the 23 miRNAs were downregulated, including members of the miR-17-92 cluster, a known polycistronic oncomir heavily implicated in human viral infections. Target genes of DEMs, predicted using bioinformatic methods and validated by luciferase reporter analysis on two representative DEMs, were significantly enriched in multiple signaling pathways including transformation of growth factor-β signaling. A large set of sequence variations (IsomiRs) were found, including a substitution at position 5, which was verified by a luciferase reporter assay along with bioinformatic analysis, to redirect miRNAs to a new spectrum of targets. Twelve novel porcine miRNAs conserved in other species were identified by homology analysis along with cloning verification. In addition, expression analysis revealed the potential importance of three new miRNAs for the immune response of pigs to viruses.

These viruses are major contributors to respiratory and digestive disorders in humans and animals. Out of 9 Enterovirus species, Enterovirus EG are closely related to diseases affecting livestock. While enterovirus infections have been increasingly reported in cattle and swine, enterovirus infections in small ruminants are largely unknown. Methods Virological, molecular, and bioinformatic methods were employed to characterize a novel caprine enterovirus CEV-JL14 that exhibited severe diarrhea in China with morbidity and mortality rates of up to 84% and 54%, respectively. Results CEV-JL14 has been defined and proposed as a new enterovirus species L within the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. CEV-JL14 had a complete genomic sequence of 7461 nucleotides with an ORF encoding 2172 amino acids and shared 77.1% genomic sequence identity with TB4-OEV, an ovine enterovirus. Comparison of 5'-UTR and structural genes of CEV-JL14 with known enterovirus species revealed high levels of genetic variation between CEV-JL14 with known enterovirus species. The VP1 nucleotide sequence identities of CEV-14 were 51.8%-53.5% with those of Enterovirus E and F, 30.9%-65.3% with Enterovirus G and 43.8-51. 5% with enterovirus AD. CEV-JL14 has been proposed as a new species within the Enterovirus genus according to the current ICTV enterovirus delineation criteria. Conclusions CEV-JL14 did not group phylogenetically into enterovirus E and F, nor into enterovirus G. It was defined and proposed as a new species L within the Enterovirus genus.

We found that the relative abundance of ARGs in bacterial DNA was significantly higher than that in phage DNA in all water samples (>10.6-fold), and wastewater treatment did not increase the relative abundance of bacteria- or phage-associated ARGs significantly changed. We have further demonstrated the distribution and diversity of the different types of ARGs according to the class of antibiotics to which they confer resistance, the tetracycline resistance genes were the most abundant resistance genes, and phage are more likely to harbor ATP-binding cassette transporter families and ribosomal protective genes. In addition, the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was also detected in the phage population. When assessing the contribution of phage to the spread of different groups of ARGs, β-lactamase resistance genes had relatively high spreadability, although abundance was low. These findings potentially indicate that phage might not only serve as an important reservoir of ARGs, but also carry specific ARGs in pig farm effluent, and this phenomenon is independent of the environment.",,"Wang, M.;Xiong, W.;Liu, P.;Xie, X.;Zeng, J.;Sun, Y.;Zeng, Z.",2018.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02474,0
2199,Complete sequence and evolutionary genome analysis of the transposable bacteriophage Pseudomonas aeruginosa D3112,"The bacteriophage D3112 represents one of two distinct groups of transposable phages found in the clinically relevant opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To advance our understanding of transposable phages in P. aeruginosa, we sequenced the entire genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp with a total G+C content of 65%. We identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c-repressor gene and early genes A and B) that were previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions conforms to published genetic and transcription maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D3112 as a lambda-like phage based on its morphology. Similarity-based analyzes identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins closely resembled the prophage sequences in Escherichia coli and phage Phi12 from Staphylococcus aureus, while the right-end proteins closely resembled the proteins in Xylella fastidiosa. We performed phylogenetic analyzes to understand the evolutionary relationships of D3112 in terms of Mu-like versus lambda-like bacteriophages. In some cases, different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses. Overall, our results reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.",,"Wang, P.

2200,Nucleotide sequence analysis of the E2 major protective antigen coding region of 12 Hogcholera virus (HCV) strains,"HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 major gene cDNA fragments from 11 field strains isolated at different times in China and 1 French reference strain (Thiveral) were each amplified by the RT-PCR method and sequenced. The amplified fragments were located from 5' 2485 to 2708 of the major E2 domains B and C and encoded 75 amino acid residues of the E2 glycoprotein. All products amplified by RT-PCR from 12 strains in the study were the same size of 224 bp. Comparing 12 sequences with other 9 reference strains reported prior to using the DNAstar software, it was found that the Hog Cholera virus could be divided into two groups by pedigree analysis. Strains Brescia, Gpe, Ald, Thiverval, C, CW, HCLV, HCVSM, BJCY1/96, BJTX3/96, BJSY2/96, HeNXH2/98, HeNZZ1/82 and GDGZ1/95 were assigned to group A and were 85 .7% 100% for the nucleotide sequence and 83.8%-100% for the amino acid sequence in homology; but strains HCVF98, HCVF94, HeBHH2/95, LN1/84, SZGM1/85, SCCD1/79 and Alfort were assigned to group B and were 84.3%-100% in nucleotide sequence and 85.1%-100 % in terms of amino acid sequence homology; and 21 HCV strains were 78.1%-100% homologous in nucleotide sequence and 78.4%-100% in amino acid sequence. The homology was 99.1% for the nucleotide sequence and 100% for the amino acid sequence between the HCLV strains in our study and the C strains reported by Rijn's in the Netherlands. Our sequencing method has been shown to be reliable. There were apparent differences between the two groups in the sequences of the major envelope glycoprotein E2 gene, particularly in the amino acid substitutions at sites 713 and 729, respectively, and it was shown that the two groups of HCV field strains may vary genetically to some extent. The results of other reports on the challenge of the partial field strains showed that the Chinese strain vaccine virus (HCLV) has good immunity.",,"Wang, Q.;Wang, Z.;Zhao, Y.;Li, B.;Qiu, H.",2000.0,,,0
2201,Prevalence of norovirus and sapovirus in pigs of different ages determined by reverse transcription-PCR and microplate hybridization assays,"Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses (SaVs) are emerging enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in humans and animals. Porcine Genogroup II (GII) NoVs replicate in pigs, but their pathogenesis is undefined. The swine strain SaV/GIII/Cowden/80/US causes diarrhea and intestinal lesions in pigs. Recently, genetically distinct porcine NoVs (genotypes 11, 18, and 19 within GII) and SaVs containing at least two genogroups (GIII and GVI?/JJ681-like) and two unclassified strains (G?/QW19 and G?/LL26 ) comprised identified; however, their prevalence has not been reported. To investigate the prevalence of porcine NoVs and SaVs, 621 fecal samples from pigs of different ages were collected from seven pig farms and one slaughterhouse in three states of the United States. Stool samples were tested by reverse transcription PCR and microwell hybridization assays with porcine NoV and SaV specific primers and probes, respectively. Porcine GII NoVs were only detected in fattening pigs with an overall prevalence of 20%. Porcine GIII-SaVs were detected in 62% of pigs, with the highest prevalence in post-weaning pigs and the lowest in lactating pigs. Porcine GVIα/JJ681-like SaVs and the Gβ/QW19-like SaVs have rarely been detected in pigs. The Gα/LL26-like SaVs were mainly detected in younger pigs. Because some porcine NoVs and SaVs are genetically or antigenically related to human strains, and recombinants exist within NoVs or SaVs for both human and porcine strains, the high prevalence and subclinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs raises questions as to whether pigs are reservoirs for human strains or for the emergence of new human and porcine recombinants.

2203,Computation of the evolutionary correlation between individual genes and full-length genome: a method useful for selecting phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology,"Single genes or regions are still widely used to estimate phylogenetic relationships between viral isolates. The genomic regions that can reliably provide scores consistent with those predicted from full-length genomic sequences would preferably serve as good candidates as the phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiological studies of many viruses. Here, we used a statistical method to assess the evolutionary relationships between individual viral genes and full-length genomes without tree construction to determine which gene can match well with the genome in phylogenetic analyses. This method was performed by calculating linear correlations between the genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned genomic sequences. We applied this method to the phylogenetic analyzes of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparisons and the possible factors affecting the accuracy of the method were also discussed in the calculations. The results indicated that this method could provide results consistent with previous studies on the correct consensus sequences that could be successfully used as phylogenetic markers. And our results also suggested that these evolutionary correlations could provide useful information for identifying genes that could be used effectively to infer the genetic relationships.

2204,Analysis of codon usage preference in hemagglutinin genes of porcine influenza A (H1N1) virus,"Background The porcine influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) has come to the fore since 2009 and has been identified as a new reassortant strain. The glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) mediates viral binding, contains antigenic regions recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and is associated with viral cross-species infection and adaptation. The comparative study on codon usage preferences in influenza virus genomes was less extensive. In this study, we used codon usage pattern analysis to validate the adaptation and origins of S-OIV. Methods The codon usage pattern was used to assess the host adaptation of S-OIVs. A phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene was performed to understand the phylogeny of H1N1 viruses isolated from different hosts. The amino acid signature pattern at antigenic sites of HA was analyzed to understand antigenic properties. Results Results from phylogenetic analyzes of the HA gene indicate that S-OIVs group in identical clusters. The analyzes of the synonymous codon usage patterns show that the effective number of codons versus GC content at the third codon position in the HA1 gene is slightly different from that in porcine H1N1 and gradually adapts to humans. Our data show that S-OIV development occurred according to positive selection within these antigenic regions. Comparison of amino acid antigenic sites shows similar signature patterns between S-OIV and 1918 human influenza strains. Conclusion This study proposes a new and effective way to gain a better understanding of the features of the S-OIV genome and the evolutionary processes based on the codon usage pattern. It is useful in tracing the origin of influenza viruses and the transmission of viruses between different species.",,"Wang, S. F.;Su, M. W.;Tseng, S. P.;Li, M. C.;Tsao, C. H.;Huang, S. W.;Chu, W.

2205,"Divergent pathogenic properties of circulating coxsackievirus A6 associated with emerging hand, foot, and mouth disease","Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is an emerging pathogen associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Its genetic characterization and pathogenic properties are largely unknown. Here we report 39 circulating CV-A6 strains isolated from HFMD patients in northeast China in 2013. Three major CV-A6 clusters were identified and related to CV-A6, mainly from Shanghai, indicating that native CV-A6 strains were responsible for the emergence of HFMD in NE China. Four full-length CV-A6 genomes representing each cluster were sequenced and further analyzed. Boat scanning tests showed that all four CV-A6 Changchun strains were most likely recombinants between CV-A6 prototype Gdula and prototype CV-A4 or CV-A4-related viruses, while the recombination pattern was related to the strains , but differed from them in isolation from other regions of China. Furthermore, different CV-A6 strains displayed different viral replication, shedding and pathogenesis abilities in a mouse model. Further analysis showed that the viral protein 2C contributed to CV-A6's diverse pathogenic capabilities by inducing autophagy and triggering cell death. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report fatal and non-fatal CV-A6 strains associated with HFMD. The 2C protein region may play a key role in the pathogenicity of CV-A6 strains. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major and ongoing threat to infants and children. In addition to the most common pathogens such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), other enteroviruses are also increasingly contributing to HFMD. The present study focused on the recently emerged CV-A6 strain. We found that CV-A6 strains isolated in the city of Changchun in northeast China were associated with native origins. These Changchun viruses were novel recombinants of CV-A6 prototype Gdula and CV-A4. Our results imply that measures to control CV-A6 transmission are urgently needed. Further analysis revealed different pathogenicities in strains isolated in a neonatal mouse model. One of the possible causes was narrowed down to the viral protein 2C by phylogenetic studies, viral sequences and direct tests on cultured human cells. Therefore, the viral 2C protein is a promising target for antiviral drugs to prevent CV-A6-induced tissue damage.",,"Wang, S. H.;Wang, A.;Liu, P. P.;Zhang, W. Y.;Du, J.;Xu, S.;Liu, G. C.;Zheng, B.

2206,The discovery of a highly divergent coronavirus in the Asian house shrew from China sheds light on the origin of alphacoronaviruses,"Although shrews are one of the largest mammalian groups, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses. We captured 266 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, China, between 2013 and 2015. Coronavirus (CoV) RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully obtained from the RNA positive samples. The newly discovered shrew-CoV fell into four lineages that reflect their geographic origins, indicating largely allopatric evolution. Remarkably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses, but so different that they should be considered a new member of the alphacoronavirus genus, which we refer to as Wencheng Shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that WESV's S gene fell into a cluster genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. WESV's divergent position suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that bears no sequence similarity to known viruses. Taken together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in the evolution of CoV syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Due to their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship, it has been suggested that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their final ancestor in those viruses that live in bats. Here we have described a novel alphacoronavirus (Wencheng-Shrew virus, WESV) collected from Asian house shrews in China. In particular, WESV is a very divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from that of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that bears no sequence similarity to known viruses. Taken together, these data suggest that shrews are important and long-standing hosts for coronaviruses that merit additional research and surveillance.",,"Wang, W.;Lin, X. D.;Liao, Y.;Guan, X.

2207,Detection of avian influenza virus clade 7.1 (H5N1) in Lake Qinghai,"The highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus subtype has spread across Asia since 2003, reaching Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2005, and has raised global concerns over the past decade about a potential pandemic threat. A clade 2.3.2 H5N1 virus became dominant in the Qinghai Lake region in 2009 with sporadic cases of infection in mammals and was transmitted to Russia and Europe by wild migratory birds. Currently, HPAI H5N1 clades 2.3.4, 2.3.2 and 7 are the dominant cocirculating H5N1 viruses in poultry in Asia. 2.3.2 Clade is dominant in wild birds worldwide, while there are no apparent data on clade 7 circulation in wild birds. We detected HPAI H5N1 clade 7.1 virus in Qinghai Lake, which is closely related to Shanxi-like and Vietnam viruses co-circulating in poultry. This is the first report of Clade 7.1 H5N1 in wild birds. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the virus may have originated from the clade 7.1 virus gene pool that spread in Vietnam and Chinese poultry and could spread to Lake Qinghai with migratory birds. Lake Qinghai remains a significant hotspot for H5N1 surveillance, with outbreaks in wild birds and mammals occurring regularly there. Based on these facts and findings, the researchers involved should pay more attention to the Qinghai Lake Basin as a major hotspot for H5N1 avian influenza surveillance, since it has seen regular outbreaks of H5N1 in wild birds with sporadic cases of infection in mammals.",,"Wang, W.;Sharshov, K.;Li, Z.;Zheng, S.

In the present study, the complete genomic characterization of a type 1 PRRSV strain (designated GZ11-G1) and its pathogenicity in piglets was analyzed. The results showed that the full genome of GZ11-G1, 15,094 nt in size, excluding the poly(A) tails, shared 80.2-96.3% identity with the representative strains of type 1 PRRSV and in particular the highest had homology (96.3%) with Amervac PRRS, a live vaccine type 1 PRRSV virus, and SHE, a rescued virus from an infectious clone of Amervac PRRS virus. Compared to the vaccine virus, the nonstructural and structural proteins of GZ11-G1 showed extensive amino acid variation with the exception of its ORF5a. GZ11-G1 was clustered by further phylogenetic analysis with strains of PRRSV type 1 including Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and Amervac PRRS vaccine virus. In addition, GZ11-G1 has been shown to cause fever, higher viremia, and lung and lymph node lesions in piglets. Our results indicate that GZ11-G1 is genetically linked to type 1 PRRSV strains within the cluster formed by Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and the Amervac PRRS vaccine virus is related and pathogenic to piglets.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the host-EDSV interaction remains unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to examine the dynamic changes in host gene expression at 6, 12, and 24 hours post-infection in EDSV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs). A total of 441 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after EDSV infection. Analysis of the Gene Ontology pathogenicity category and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway Enrichment revealed that these DEGs are associated with multiple biological functions, including signal transduction, host immunity, viral infection, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and signaling pathways related to pathogenicity and metabolic processes . We screened and identified 12 DEGs for further study using qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq results were very consistent. This study analyzed EDSV infection-induced viral infection and host immunity from a novel perspective, and the results provide valuable information on the mechanisms underlying host-EDSV interactions, which proves useful for future antiviral drug or vaccine development Poultry and the entire poultry industry will benefit from it.",,"Wang, X.

2211,Integrated analysis of microRNA expression and mRNA transcriptome in the lungs of avian influenza virus-infected broilers,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks are global threats to poultry and humans. Our previous study suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating the host response to AIV infection in laying hens. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether the genetic background plays an essential role in the miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and whether miRNAs differentially expressed in AIV-infected laying hens are found in broiler chickens be modulated in the same way. In addition, potential molecular mechanisms of the host response to AIV infection can be further exploited by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiling. RESULTS: Total RNA isolated from the lungs of uninfected and low pathogenic H5N3-infected broilers four days post-infection was used for both miRNA depth sequencing and mRNA microarray analysis. A total of 2.6M and 3.3M filtered high quality reads were obtained from infected and uninfected chickens, respectively, using the Solexa GA-I Sequencer. A total of 271 miRNAs were identified in miRBase 16.0 and one potential new miRNA was discovered. 121 miRNAs were differentially expressed with a false detection rate of 5% by Fisher's exact test. More miRNAs were highly expressed in infected lungs (108) than in uninfected lungs (13), which was in contrast to the results in laying hens. This result suggests that a different regulatory mechanism of the host response to miRNAs-mediated AIV infection may exist in broilers. Analysis using the chicken 44K Agilent microarray showed that 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed after AIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis combining both miRNA and targeted mRNA gene expression suggests that gga-miR-34a, 122-1, 122-2, 146a, 155, 206, 1719, 1594, 1599 and 451 as well as MX1, IL-8, IRF-7, TNFRS19 are strong candidates for miRNAs or genes involved in regulation of host response to AIV infection in broiler lungs.

The 3' leader sequence is 50 nucleotides long and shares a common terminal trinucleotide (3'-UGC-), a conserved U-rich domain and a variable AU-rich domain with other animal rhabdoviruses. The N gene spans 1355 nucleotides from the transcription start sequence (AACAGG) to the poly(A) sequence [CATG(A)7] and encodes a polypeptide of 429 amino acids. The N protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49429 Da and a pI of 5.4 and, like the N protein of the bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), has a strongly acidic C-terminal domain. Analysis of the amino acid sequence relationships between all available rhabdovirus N proteins revealed that ARV and BEFV are closely related viruses (48.3% similarity), sharing greater sequence similarity with vesiculoviruses than with lyssaviruses.

The viral F protein (Fcs) cleavage site is a key determinant of membrane fusion and viral virulence. In this study, we examined the precise effect of variable amino acid sequences of Fcs on fusogenic activity. Based on viral pathogenicity, the Fcs sequences of natural isolates (n = 1572) are classified into eight types of virulent Fcs (VFcs) with the motif ""G/R/KRQ/R/KR/K-Râ†""F"" ten types of avirulent Fcs (AFcs) with the motif ""G/R/ER/K/QQG/E-Râ†""L"". The VFcs is only found in the class II cluster of the viral classification and not in class I. AFcs occurs in both class I and class II isolates. The VFc and AFc types show an evolutionary relationship with temporal distribution and host species. Using an in vitro fusion assay, VFcs-1 “RRQKRâ†“F” and VFcs-2 “RRQRRâ†“F” show the highest efficiency in triggering membrane fusion. The neutral Q residue at the P3 position of the VFcs plays an enhancing role compared to the effect of the basic R and K residues. A single K residue at P3 or P5 is less efficient for fusogenic activity in the VFcs with all basic residues. Furthermore, the cleavage efficiencies of F0 proteins with different types of Fcs motifs do not appear to affect membrane fusion. Our results provide insight into the effect of amino acid variation of the Fcs on NDV-induced fusion.",,"Wang, Y.;Yu, W.;Huo, N.;Wang, W.;Guo, Y.;Wei, Q.;Wang, X.;Zhang, S.;Yang, Z.;Xiao, S.",2017.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0183923,0

H13-AIVs cause asymptomatic infections and are mainly kept in populations of gulls and terns; However, the antigenic information recorded on the viruses was limited. In this study, 2 H13 AIVs, A/duck/Hokkaido/W345/2012 (H13N2) and A/duck/Hokkaido/WZ68/2012 (H13N2), isolated in the same year in our surveillance from the same area, were genetically and Antigenic analysis using 10 representative H13 strains, including a prototype strain, A/gull/Maryland/704/1977 (H13N6). The HA genes of H13-AIVs have been classified phylogenetically into 3 groups (I, II and III). A/Duck/Hokkaido/W345/2012 (H13N2) was genetically classified in group III. This virus differed from a prototype strain, A/gull/Maryland/704/1977 (H13N6), and the virus, A/duck/Hokkaido/WZ68/2012 (H13N2), both of which belonged to group I. Group I viruses were antigenic closely related to those in Group II but distinct from those in Group III, including A/duck/Hokkaido/W345/2012 (H13N2). In conclusion, our study shows that H13-AIVs have undergone antigenic diversification in nature.",,"Wang, Z. J.;Kikutani, Y.;Nguyen, L.

The RVA/human-wt/USA/2012741499/2012/G24P[14] strain has a genomic constellation of G24-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T9-E2-H3.

2220,Antigenic analysis of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus sublineages co-circulating in Egypt,"The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread across Eurasia and Africa, and outbreaks are now endemic in several countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. The continuous circulation of the H5N1 virus in Egypt from a single infected source has resulted in significant genetic diversification with phylogenetically separable sublineages, providing an opportunity to study the impact of genetic evolution on viral phenotypic variation. In this study, we analyzed the phylogeny of H5-hemagglutinin (HA) genes in influenza viruses isolated in Egypt from 2006 to 2011 and examined the effect of conserved amino acid mutations in the HA genes in each of the sublineages on their antigenicity. The analysis showed that in 2011 viruses were still present in at least four sublineages in poultry in Egypt. Using reverse genetics to generate HA reassortment viruses with specific HA mutations, we found antigenic drift in the HA in two influenza virus sublineages compared to the other currently co-circulating influenza virus sublineages in Egypt. In addition, the two sublineages with significant antigenic drift were antigenically distinct. Our results indicated that phylogenetically divergent H5N1 viruses that were not antigenically cross-reactive co-circulated in Egypt, indicating that there is a problem in using a single influenza virus strain as a seed virus to produce influenza virus vaccines in Egypt and the Data provided to develop more effective control strategies in H5N1 endemic areas. © 2012 SGM.",,"Watanabe, Y.;Ibrahim, M.

2221,Several genotypes of nonpathogenic H6N2 influenza viruses isolated from chickens in California,"From February 2000 to September 2001, a limited number of H6N2 influenza viruses were isolated from chickens in California. This report describes the genetic characterization of nine of these H6N2 viruses. All viruses analyzed had phylogenetically similar hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase molecules, suggesting that the viruses shared a recent common ancestor. Analysis of the HA sequence of these viruses with all available H6 viruses from different hosts and locations showed that these genes do not segregate into well-defined North American and Eurasian lineages. The neuraminidase genes of California viruses contain an 18 amino acid deletion, a possible adaptation for growth in chickens. Analysis of the remaining gene segments of the California viruses revealed that three distinct genotypes of H6N2 viruses were present.",,"Webby, R. J.;Woolcock, P. R.;Krauss, S. L.;Walker, D.

2223,Characterization of canine serum vioma from northeastern Brazil,"Domestic dogs share habitats with humans, making them a potential source of zoonotic viruses. In addition, knowledge of potential bloodborne pathogens is important due to the increasing use of blood transfusions in dogs. In the present study, we evaluated the serum virome of 520 dogs using throughput sequencing (HTS). Serum samples were pooled and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Our unbiased method identified predominant canine pathogens such as canine protoparvovirus 1 (canine parvovirus 2), understudied pathogens such as canine bocaparvovirus 1 (canine circovirus) and canine circovirus, circular viruses closely related to viruses recently found in human Specimens were found, as well as new parvoviruses and anelloviruses.

2224,Evaluation of serum virome in calves persistently infected with pestivirus A and present or not with mucosal disease,"Bovine virus diarrhea virus 1, reclassified as pestivirus A, causes a globally prevalent, economically important cattle disease. Pestivirus A can cause persistent infection as calves shed the virus throughout their lives and spread the infection throughout the herd. Many persistently infected (PI) calves die within the first 2 years of life from mucosal disease (MD) or secondary infections, probably as a result of virus-induced immune depression. Here, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to assess total viromea in sera from (i) PI calves with clinically apparent MD (n=8); (ii) PI calves with no evidence of MD (n=8); and (iii) control, pestivirus A-free calves (n=8). All groups were collected at the same time and from the same herd. Serum samples from calves in each of the groups were pooled, subjected to viral RNA/DNA enrichment and sequenced by HTS. Viral genomes of pestivirus A, ungulate erythroparvovirus 1, bosavirus (BosV), and hypothetical circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses have been identified. Specific real-time PCR assays were developed to determine the frequency of occurrence of such viruses in each of the groups. The absolute number of different viral genomes detected in both PI calf groups was higher than in the control group, as evidenced by a higher number of reads, contigs and genomes representing a wider range of taxons. Genomes representing members of the Parvoviridae family, such as U. erythroparvovirus 1 and BosV, were detected most frequently in all three groups of calves. Only in MD-affected PI calves did we find two previously unreported hypothetical single-stranded DNA genomes clustered together with CRESS DNA viruses. These results indicate that parvoviruses were the most commonly detected viral genomes in bovine serum; its detection rate shows no statistical correlation with the status of the calves for pestivirus A infection, since clinically normal or MD-affected/unaffected PI calves were infected with similar U. erythroparvovirus 1 genome loads. In addition, MD-affected PI calves have been shown to support viremia of CRESS DNA virus genomes; however, the importance of such a correlation has yet to be established.",,"Weber, M. N.;Cibulski, S.

2225,First evidence of bovine viral diarrhea virus infection in wild boar,"Background: Wild boar farming has increased due to interest in human consumption of this exotic meat. Such a development may mean an increased risk of disease transmission between wild boar and domestic animals. The wild boar population has increased in South America in recent years due to the lack of predators, causing economic losses through direct damage to crops and the risk of disease transmission. The genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae is composed of four species recognized by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea type 1 virus ( BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2). Other putative species designated as atypical pestiviruses have been identified as ""HoBi""-like virus, giraffe pestivirus, Bungowannah pestivirus, pronghorn antelope virus, porcine atypical pestivirus (APPV), Norwegian rat pestivirus (NrPV), and Rhinolophus affinis -bat pestivirus (RaPestV-1) ). CSFV is frequently detected in wild boar, but despite positive serology, bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV) has never been detected in this species. This communication describes the first detection of BVDV in the lungs of captive boars using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. Materials, Methods & Results: Forty lung samples from farmed wild boar were collected after slaughter at a commercial slaughterhouse. The organs were minced separately, centrifuged and the supernatant saved for further analysis. Total RNA was isolated using a phenol-based protocol and an RT-PCR protocol was performed that amplified 118 bp of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR). One out of 40 samples was positive. In the case of the positive sample, partial fragments of the 5'-UTR and N-terminal autoprotease (N-pro) were sequenced and analyzed. Strain LV Java/2012 shared 99% identity in the 5'-UTR and 98% in the N-pro region with a BVDV-2 previously reported in cattle in southern Brazil. In both 5'UTR and Npro phylogenetic analysis, strain LV Java/2015 aggregated with BVDV-2 strains and was most closely related to subtype 2b identified in cattle in southern Brazil and found in the same end node grouped. Discussion: Wild boar are often associated with the transmission of pathogens to domestic animals. This animal species is considered a reservoir of the pestivirus CSFV and an important key in CSFV control and eradication programs in Europe. Although the indirect presence of BVDV in wild boar has been reported by serological testing, direct detection of the viral agent has never been reported. The present study demonstrated the presence of BVDV-2 genomic segments obtained by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing in captive feral pigs. The reported data suggest a potential importance of this species in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses, which could interfere with control and eradication programs of these important bovine pathogens worldwide. The LV Java/2012 strain was closely related to BVDV-2b and showed the highest identity with a strain detected in cattle from southern Brazil. These data suggest that wild boar and cattle may share this pathogen due to strain similarity and that both have been reported in the same region. This may result in the need to include feral pigs in BVDV control programs as feral pigs circulate between different regions and can transmit this pathogen to different herds of cattle. The present study reported the first molecular detection of BVDV in wild boar in the literature. The data generated here suggest a possible role of boars in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses.",,"Weber, M. N.;Pino, E. H. M.;Souza, C. K.;Mosena, A. C. S.;Sato, J. P.

Influenza virus surveillance studies in wild bird populations in America, Europe and Asia confirmed that wild waterfowl are the reservoir for all known influenza A viruses. Phylogenetic analysis groups the influenza viruses in wild waterfowl into two distinct superfamilies - one in America and one in Eurasia. The separation of viruses into American and Eurasian clades implies that wild bird transmission of HP H5 to the Americas is likely to be a rare event. The rapid evolution of Eurasian H5NI viruses makes them an ongoing threat to poultry and humans worldwide.",,"Webster, R. G.;Krauss, S.;Hulse-Post, D.;Sturm-Ramirez, K.",2007.0,Jul,,0
2227,The pangenome of Lactobacillus reuteri strains derived from the porcine gastrointestinal tract,"BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus reuteri is an intestinal symbiont of a variety of vertebrate species that has diversified into distinct phylogenetic clades that are highly host-specific. Previous work demonstrated host specificity in mice and began to determine the mechanisms by which gut colonization and host restriction are achieved. However, how L. reuteri strains colonize the porcine gastrointestinal (GI) tract is unknown. RESULTS: To gain insight into the ecology of L. reuteri in the porcine intestine, the genome sequence of the small intestinal porcine isolate L. reuteri ATCC 53608 was completed and consisted of a chromosome of 1.94 Mbp and two plasmids of 138.5 kbp and 9, 09 kbp , respectively. In addition, we generated draft genomes from four additional L. reuteri strains isolated from pig feces or the lower gastrointestinal tract, lp167-67, pg-3b, 20-2, and 3c6, and subjected all five genomes together with genome of strain I5007 completed by previous comparative genome analysis. A phylogenetic analysis based on whole genomes showed that porcine L. reuteri strains fall into two distinct clades as previously suggested by multi-locus sequence analysis. These six pigs-L. reuteri genomes contained a core set of 1364 orthologous gene clusters, as determined by OrthoMCL analysis, which contributed to a pangenome with a total of 3373 gene clusters. Genome comparisons of the six porcine L. reuteri strains with 14 L. reuteri strains from other host strains yielded a total pangenome of 5225 gene clusters containing a nuclear genome of 851 gene clusters, but showed that there were no pig-specific genes per se. However, genes specific to Strains of the two phylogenetic porcine lineages are, and are conserved among, some of which encode cell surface proteins that may contribute to the diversification of the two lineages and their observed host specificity. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the phylogenetic analysis of L. reuteri strains to the genome-wide level, pointing to distinct evolutionary trajectories of porcine L. reuteri lineages and provides new insights into the genomic events in L. reuteri that have occurred during specialization to their hosts. The appearance of two distinct porcine-derived clades may reflect differences in host genotype, environmental factors such as dietary components, or the evolution of ancestral strains of human and rodent origin after exposure to porcine populations.",,"Wegmann, U.;MacKenzie, D.

2228,Genetic dynamic analysis of influenza A H5N1 NS1 gene in China,"The direct progenitors of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GS/GD) virus lineage and its reassortants have been geographically and ecologically established. To examine the variation and evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 viruses, whole genome viral sequences (n=164) were retrieved from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. Here we present phylogenetic evidence for reassortments within subtypes among H5N1 viruses isolated from China between 1996 and 2012. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we identified four main groups and further classified the reassortant viruses into three subgroups. Putative mosaic structures were mainly found in the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes and 91.0% (10/11) mosaics were preserved from terrestrial birds. Sequence variability and selection pressure analyzes showed that both surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) have a higher dN/dS ratio and variability than other internal proteins. In addition, we discovered 47 positively selected sites in genomic segments excluding the PB2 and M1 genes. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are considered highly variable due to host immune pressure, but what drives NS1 variability is unknown. Therefore, we performed a thorough analysis of the genetic variation and selection pressure of the NS1 protein (462 available NS1 sequences). We found that most of the positively selected sites and variable amino acids were located in the C-terminal effector domain (ED) of NS1. In addition, we focused on the NS1 RNA and NS1 protein interactions involved in viral replication mechanisms and the host immune response. Transcriptomic analysis of H5N1-infected monkey lungs showed that certain PI3K-related genes were upregulated.",,"Wei, K.;Chen, Y.;Lin, Y.;Pan, Y.",2014.0,,,0
2229,Global genetic variation and transmission dynamics of the H9N2 avian influenza virus,"The H9N2 influenza viruses circulate extensively in the poultry population, and mutation, recombination, and reassortment can generate variable genotypes that may be better adapted to infect a new host, resist drug treatment, or evade immune system pressure . The LPAI H9N2 viruses have the potential to evolve to high levels of virulence in humans. Some regional spread studies have been presented, but little is known about the global spread and drivers of the virus, particularly at the genomic level. Here we analyzed all eight gene segments from 168 randomly sampled H9N2 genomes to provide a panoramic framework for a better understanding of the genesis and genetic variation of the viruses, and used phylogeographic and spatial epidemiological approaches to uncover the implications of genetic variation, predictors, and Spread of H9N2 virus. We found that more frequent rearrangement events affect the PA, NP and NS segments and 21 isolates show possible mosaicism resulting from recombination events. Estimates of gene-specific global dN/dS ratios indicated that all genes underwent purifying selection. However, a total of 13 sites under positive selection were detected by at least two of three methods, located within the HA, NA, M2, NS1 and PA segments. Furthermore, we concluded that the NA segment has the highest nucleotide substitution rate and its tMRCA estimate is the most recent than the conclusion of the remaining segments. In terms of spatial history, human air transport was identified using GLM analysis as the dominant driver of global virus migration, and economic factors and geographic distance were the modest predictors. Higher migration rates were estimated between five pairs of regions (>0.01), indicating the frequent migration of the viruses between individual geographic locations. Furthermore, our Markov jump analysis showed that virus migration is more frequent between southern China and northern China, and that a high rate of gene flow was observed between the Americas and East Asia. Additionally, along with Southeast Asia, the Americas acted as the primary hub of global transmission, forming the trunk of the evolutionary tree. These results suggest a complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology and human behavior.",,"Wei, K.;Li, Y.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12733,0
2230,Reemergence of a virulent Newcastle disease genotype VIII virus isolated from Chinese wildfowl after 13 years,"The circulation of the dominant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genotypes VI and VII is causing significant economic losses to the poultry industry in China. However, reports of Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks caused by genotype VIII strains of NDV are rare. In this study, a virulent genotype VIII strain of NDV, designated GXGB2011, was isolated from a vaccinated wildfowl flock showing clinical signs of infection in Pinxiang County, Guangxi, China. The entire genome of the isolate was fully sequenced and comprised 15,192 nucleotides (nt) encoding the six structural proteins in the order 3-NP-PMF-HN-L-5. The pattern of cleavage site 112RRQKRâ†“F117 in the fusion protein (F) and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) value of 1.5 indicated that strain GXGB2011 was a velogen NDV. The results of the challenge experiment with the 5 week old SPF chickens showed that the strain was highly pathogenic with 100% morbidity and mortality of the challenged birds. Based on detection of virus in various organs of the infected birds, the highest viral load was observed in cecal tonsils and virus concentrations in immune organs were higher than in respiratory organs. Bayesian full genome reconstruction based on the sequences of 66 NDV reference strains showed that the strain belonged to genotype VIII of NDV. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that the strain was more closely related to foreign strains gamefowl/US(CA)/24225/98, 1ITTY94060 and IT-147/94 than to the first native strains of emergence genotype VIII in Qinghai, China in 1979â €“1985.

2231,Genetic and pathobiological characterization of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses from a naturally infected pig herd,"Since it was first identified in Mexico and the United States, concerns have been raised that the novel H1N1 influenza virus could cause a pandemic of comparable severity to the 1918 pandemic. In late April 2009, viruses phylogenetically related to the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were isolated in an outbreak on a Canadian pig farm. This outbreak also had epidemiological links to a suspected human case. Experimental infections performed in pigs with one of the pig isolates from this outbreak and the human isolate A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 showed differences in virus recovery from the lower respiratory tract. Virus was consistently isolated from the lungs of pigs infected with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009, while only one pig infected with A/swine/Alberta/OTH-33-8/2008 yielded live virus from the lungs, despite comparable amounts of RNA and virus antigen in both groups of pigs. The clinical illness was similar to other influenza virus infections in pigs, albeit with somewhat prolonged viral antigen detection and delayed viral RNA clearance from the lungs. There was also a notable amount of genotypic variability among the viruses isolated from the pigs on the farm. This, together with the somewhat erratic pathobiological features observed in experimentally infected animals, suggests that although the virus may be of porcine origin, significant viral evolution is still ongoing.

2234,Investigation of possible causes for the development of pig ear necrosis: Different study designs - comparable results? German,"In recent years, two studies to research the etiology of pig ear necrosis have been carried out at the pig clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna. In Study 1, parameters discussed in this context were collected from veterinarians by completing specially designed questionnaires in farms with symptoms of Pig Ear Necrosis Syndrome. In Study 2, piglet and feed samples were collected for laboratory analysis of key infectious agents and mycotoxins. The results of both projects were compared in this manuscript. Although the selection criteria of the two studies differed, the affected age group was comparable (5.5 to 10 weeks of age in study 1 and 6 to 10 weeks of life in study 2). The herd-specific prevalence of pig ear necrosis syndrome varied considerably with percentages between 2 or 10 and 100%. The evaluation of the questionnaires in study 1 showed that 51% of the farms had problems with cannibalism. Particles of plant material commonly seen on the histological sections of Study 2 could have entered the tissue through chewing of the housemates' ears or through cannibalism. While study 1 considered the negative influence of parameters such as high pig density, suboptimal climate, lack of enrichment material and poor feed and water quality, in study 2 all these factors were checked during sampling and excluded as precursors for cannibalism. In both studies, bacterial pathogens proved to be a crucial co-factor for the spread of necrosis into deeper tissue layers, while viral pathogens were classified as less important. In both projects, the direct influence of infectious agents and mycotoxins as a direct trigger of the necrosis and their involvement as co-factors or precursors in terms of immunosuppression or previous damage to blood vessels or tissue could not be assessed.",,"Weissenbacher-Lang, C.;Voglmayr, T.;Weissenbock, H.;Pyrek, R.;Waxenecker, F.;Hofstetter, U.;Hoelzle, K.;Hoelzle, L.

The viruses were isolated from Malaysia and various areas of Japan over a 30-year period. Based on the available published sequence data, oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR were designed and the sequences determined. Our results showed that although there were differences in the nucleotide sequences in the nsP1 region, there was 100% amino acid homology. On the other hand, the nucleotide differences in the capsid region caused a large difference in the amino acid sequence. Therefore, the difference in the capsid region is one of the useful markers in the genetic classification between Sagiyama virus and Getah virus strains and might be responsible for the serological difference in the complement fixation test. The genomic differences between the Getah virus strains are due to the time factor rather than geographic distribution.",,"Wekesa, S.

APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet, and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods, and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. Fowlpoxvirus (FWPV) virus type causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs also play an important role in the development of viral vaccine vectors for human and veterinary diseases. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no progeny virus production) and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the properties that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells may represent a major advantage for vaccine biosafety, the molecular mechanisms that restrict APVs to specific hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors. © 2011 Weli and Tryland; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Weli, S.

2238,Types and Strains: Their Essential Role in Understanding Protein Aggregation in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Protein misfolding and aggregation is a key event in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with neurodegeneration. Factors that induce protein misfolding and the role of protein aggregation in disease pathophysiology are major challenges for the neuroscientific community. Although accumulation of the same misfolded protein, e.g. Interestingly, since all idiopathic Parkinson's patients have idiopathic Parkinson's disease, such as a-synuclein, the spectrum of disease includes a variety of different clinical presentations and disease courses. In a more recent experiment, this clinical variance is explained by different conformations of protein aggregates in analogy to prion diseases. In prion diseases, a relationship between conformational properties of protein aggregates and the clinical course of the disease has been demonstrated by associating different prion types with dementia and atactic disease in Creutzfeldt-Jakob patients. This principle is currently being applied to AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation. However, differences in the conformation of protein aggregates are often addressed as disease strains. The term ""strain"" also comes from prion research and arose by adopting virus terminology at a time when it was assumed that transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE; later called prion diseases) were caused by a virus. The problem is that in viral taxonomy, the term ""type"" refers to characteristics of the pathogen itself, and the term ""strain"" refers to host-associated factors that can interact with the pathogen and moderately modify the clinical picture. Stress factors can only be discovered after transfer and passage of the agent in a host of another species. Incorrect use of terminology confuses pathogens and host factors and hampers understanding of the pathophysiology of protein aggregate-associated neurodegenerative diseases. This review article summarizes the discoveries that explain how the terms ""type"" and ""strain"" came about for unconventional pathogens. This may help avoid confusion in protein aggregation disease terminology and correctly reflect the influence of protein aggregate conformation as well as the contribution of host factor to different clinical variations of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",,"Wemheuer, W.

2239,Comments on the definition of the duck circovirus (DuCV) genotype,"standardized methodology was used to define genotypes based on pairwise sequence comparisons (PASC). PASC is a widely accepted method in virus taxonomy based on the histogram of pairwise differences between sequences. Recently, Zhang et al. (2013) concluded that the mean p-distance of duck circovirus (DuCV) between genotypes 1 and 2 was 0.170 and the subtype distance thresholds were 0.032 in DuCV-1 and 0.018 in DuCV-2, respectively. However, there might be some concerns about the application of the methodology to define the genotype of DuCV. With the above concerns in mind, our authors performed the PASC analyzes of the 54 capsid gene (ORF2) and genomic sequences, including all sequences from Zhang et al. (2013). Our results confirmed the existence of two DuCV genotypes (1 and 2) and we propose that the DuCV ORF2 and genotype thresholds for genomic distance were 0.061 and 0.038, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier BV",,"Wen, H.;Wu, Y.;Yang, C.;Zhang, X.;Lian, C.;Chen, H.;Han, L.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.gene.2014.01.004,0

Experiments were performed with pig and sheep sera raised against the strains. The results were analyzed by a computerized taxonomic method. The 16 viruses were divided into four different serological groups. All strains of swine cholera virus (HCV) were divided into one group; the other three groups consisted of strains that can infect pigs but have been identified as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) or border disease virus (BDV) or showed a closer relationship to BVDV and BDV than to HCV.,,"Wensvoort, G.;Terpstra, C.;de Kluyver, E.

2241,Detection of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) from pig livers in south-eastern Germany and high sequence homology to human HEV isolates,"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been identified as a new cause of infectious hepatitis in industrialized countries in recent years. In contrast to travel-associated hepatitis E, zoonotic sources of infection are suspected in autochthonous cases in Europe. Objective: Because pigs are known to be reservoirs of HEV, we tested pig livers sold as food in south-eastern Germany for the presence of hepatitis E virus RNA. Study design: We purchased 200 pig liver samples from 81 butcher and grocery stores in Regensburg, Germany. Nucleic acid preparations were tested for the presence of HEV RNA using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). HEV isolates from positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the ORF1 and ORF2 regions in the HEV genome and by phylogenetic analysis. Results: Samples from eight (4%) of 200 purchased pig livers had detectable levels of HEV RNA. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis enabled the classification of two new isolates as HEV genotype 3, subgenotype 3a (swR437) and 3c (swR269), respectively. Both novel porcine HEV isolates showed high sequence homology to isolates obtained from patients with acute HEV infection from the same geographic region. Conclusions: These results support the proposed role of undercooked pork products in food as a source of zoonotic HEV infection in humans. It remains to be clarified whether this transmission mechanism is responsible for the surprisingly high prevalence of anti-HEV IgG recently observed in some European countries and the USA. © 2011 Elsevier BV",,"Wenzel, J.

2242,Schmallenberg virus: A novel virus of veterinary importance,"At the end of 2011, non-specific clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and reduced milk yield were observed in dairy cattle in the Dutch-German border area. After exclusion of classic endemic and emerging viruses by targeted diagnostic systems, blood samples from acutely ill cows were subjected to metagenomic analysis. An insect-transmitted orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup was identified as the causative agent and named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). It was one of the first evidence of introduction of a novel virus of veterinary importance in Europe using new next-generation sequencing technology. The virus was subsequently isolated from identical samples used for metagenomic analysis in insect and mammalian cell lines, and disease symptoms were reproduced in calves experimentally infected with both this cultured virus and blood samples from diseased cattle. Since its emergence, SBV has spread very rapidly in the European ruminant population, causing mild non-specific disease in adult animals, but also premature birth or stillbirth and severe fetal malformations when naïve dams became infected during a critical gestation period. In the years that followed, SBV was regularly recirculated on a larger scale; in the 2014 and 2016 carrier seasons, the virus was again repeatedly detected in the blood of adult ruminants, and several malformed calves and lambs occurred in the subsequent winter and spring months. The genome of viruses present in viraemic adults showed very high sequence stability; in sequences generated between 2012 and 2016 only a few amino acid substitutions could be detected compared to the original SBV isolate. In contrast, high sequence variability has been identified in the amino-terminal part of the glycoprotein Gc coding region of viruses present in the brain of malformed newborns. This mutational hotspot is independent of the region or host species from which the samples are derived and may be involved in immune evasion mechanisms.",,"Wernike, K.;Beer, M.",2017.0,,10.1016/bs.aivir.2017.07.001,0

2244,Detection and typing of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by multiplex real-time RT-PCR,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) causes economic losses in the swine industry worldwide and PRRS viruses (PRRSV) are classified into two distinct genotypes, North American (NA, Type 2) and European (EU, Type 1). . . In 2006, a highly pathogenic NA strain of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV), characterized by high fever and high morbidity and mortality, emerged in pig farms in China. Therefore, a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay specific for HP-PRRSV was developed and combined with type 1 and type 2 specific RT-qPCR systems. In addition, an internal control based on a heterologous RNA was successfully introduced. This final multiplex PRRSV RT-qPCR for the detection and typing of PRRSV had an analytical sensitivity of less than 200 copies per microliter for the type 1 assay and 20 copies per microliter for the type 2 and HP assays and a high diagnostic sensitivity. A panel of reference strains and field isolates were reliably detected and samples from an animal study with a Chinese HP-PRRS strain were used for test validation. The new multiplex PRRSV RT-qPCR system enables the highly sensitive detection and rapid differentiation of PRRSV of both genotypes and the direct detection of HP-PRRSV for the first time. © 2012 Wernike et al.",,"Wernike, K.;Hoffmann, B.;Dauber, M.;Lange, E.;Schirrmeier, H.;Beer, M.",2012.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0038251,0

2246,Molecular evolution of viral fusion and matrix protein genes and phylogenetic relationships among the Paramyxoviridae,"Phylogenetic relationships among the Paramyxoviridae, a broad family of viruses whose members cause devastating diseases in wildlife, livestock, and humans, have been studied using both fusion (F) and matrix (M) protein-encoding sequences. Neighboring trees of F and M protein sequences showed that the Paramyxoviridae were divided into the two traditionally recognized subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. Within the Paramyxovirinae, the results also revealed groups corresponding to three currently recognized genera: Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, and Rubulavirus. The relationships between the three genera of Paramyxovirinae were resolved using M protein sequences and there was significant bootstrap support (100%) showing that members of the genus Respirovirus and genus Morbillivirus were more closely related than members of the genus Rubulavirus . Both F and M phylogeny showed that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was more closely related to the Rubulavirus genus than to the other two genera, but agreed with the proposal (BS Seal et al., 2000 , Virus Res. 66, 1-11) that NDV is to be classified as an independent genus within the Paramyxovirinae. Both F and M phylogeny were also consistent with the proposal (L. Wang et al., 2000, J. Virol 74, 9972-9979) that Hendra virus be classified as a new genus closely related is related and basal to the genus Morbillivirus.

2247,Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) exudative cloacitis possibly associated with Escherichia coli infection,"METHODS: Metagenomics using unbiased RNA or DNA sequencing was applied to fecal material from an 11-year-old female kakapo with exudative cloacitis and a pool of eight birds (male and female aged 1-20 years) with no current signs or history of the disease . Fecal material from the diseased bird was collected before and after treatment. For RNA sequencing, extracted RNA/DNA was subjected to DNase and the remaining RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and subjected to multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. RESULTS: No significant alignment with any known avian virus sequence was obtained from fecal samples. However, significant BLAST alignments to five bacteriophages known to infect enterobacteria were obtained. Strong evidence for the presence of the bacteriophage Escherichia phage TL-2011b, a bacteriophage known to be present in Escherichia coli and known to cause outbreaks of foodborne illness in humans, was found in the sample from the diseased bird but not in the non-diseased pool. Differences in E. coli community structure between the diseased bird and the non-diseased pool were also evident. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli infection of human origin is suggested as a possible cause of exudative cloacitis, although confirmatory work is needed to test this hypothesis. AIM: To investigate the underlying causes of cloacitis (inflammation of the cloaca) in kakapos (Strigops habroptilus).",,"White, D. J.;Hall, R. J.;Jakob-Hoff, R.;Wang, J.;Jackson, B.;Tompkins, D.

2249,Serological evidence of exposure to influenza D virus in persons with occupational contact with cattle,"Background: Influenza D virus (IDV), a novel influenza virus with proposed classification: Family Orthomyxoviridae, Genus Influenza virus D, Species Influenza D virus, has been associated with influenza-like illness in cattle and swine. More recently, anti-IDV antibodies have also been detected in small ruminants. A seroprevalence of approximately 1.3% has been estimated for the general human population. Objectives: To gain knowledge of the zoonotic potential of IDV for adult humans with occupational exposure to cattle in north-central Florida. Study: A cross-sectional serological study was performed on human serum samples from 35 bovine exposed and 11 non-bovine exposed adults to screen for IDV antibodies using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) tests. Results: Among those working with cattle in Florida, the seroprevalence was 91% by HI assay and 97% by MN assay. In subjects not exposed to cattle, the seropositivity determined (only) by the MN test was lower (18%). Conclusions: IDV poses a zoonotic risk for workers exposed to cattle based on evidence of high seroprevalence (94-97%).

This study describes the isolation and characterization of two novel orthobunyaviruses recovered from a jungle myna and a rice bird from Karnataka state, India. Using an NGS approach, these isolates were classified as cat que and balagodu viruses belonging to the Manzanilla clade of the Simbu serogroup. Closely related viruses of the manzanilla group have been isolated from mosquitoes, humans, birds and pigs over a large geographic region. Because orthobunyaviruses have a high regrouping frequency and can cause acute, self-limiting febrile illnesses, these data suggest that Oya/Cat Que/Manzanilla virus infections in humans and livestock may be more prevalent and/or underreported than expected. Therefore, it is imperative to identify new and unknown viruses in order to understand their role in human and animal pathogenesis. The current study is a step forward in this regard and would serve as a prototype method for the isolation, identification and detection of several other emerging viruses.",,"Whitmer, S. L.

2251,"Prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis E virus in apparently healthy humans and pigs in Bali, Indonesia: identification of a pig infected with genotype 4 hepatitis E virus","In Indonesia, where hepatitis E virus (HEV) is considered highly endemic, only three outbreaks of HEV transmission have been documented in restricted areas (West Kalimantan and East Java). A total of 1,115 serum samples collected in 1996 from apparently healthy individuals in Bali, Lombok and Surabaya in Indonesia, where no epidemic transmission of HEV has ever been reported, were tested for IgG-class antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV). In Bali, anti-HEV was detected in 20% (54/276) of the population tested, in striking contrast to 4% (17/446) in Lombok and 0.5% (2/393) in Surabaya. On the other hand, antibodies against hepatitis A virus were widespread in all three regions (95% in Bali, 90% in Lombok and 89% in Surabaya). Although the majority of the population in Indonesia is Muslim, the Balinese are predominantly Hindu and have a habit of consuming pork. Therefore, serum samples were taken from the 99 farm pigs in Bali and tested for anti-HEV and HEV RNA. Sera from 71 pigs (72%) were positive for anti-HEV and one 2 month old pig had detectable HEV RNA. The porcine HEV isolate obtained from the viremic pig was named SB66-Bali. The SB66 Bali isolate was most closely related to genotype 4 isolates from China, India, Japan and Taiwan, but shared only 82.6-90.0% identity in the common 241-412 nucleotides within open reading frame 2 (ORF2).

2252,Matrix gene of influenza A viruses isolated from wild waterfowl: ecology and origin of influenza A viruses,"Wild waterfowl are the main reservoir of influenza A virus, but little is known about the viral gene pool in wild birds. Therefore, we studied the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by performing phylogenetic analyzes of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada during a > 18- years of surveillance have been isolated. In our analysis we included 61 published M genes from isolates from different hosts. We have shown that the M genes of the Canadian duck viruses and those of the Delaware Bay shorebird and gull viruses share ancestry with the M genes of the North American avian viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian lineages are divided into sublineages, suggesting that multiple branches of virus evolution may be sustained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that the gull M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, interregional mixing of the two clades can occur. Reassortment of shorebird M and HA genes was evident, but there was no correlation between HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild aquatic birds contain distinct lineages of M genes.",,"Widjaja, L.;Krauss, S. L.;Webby, R. J.;Xie, T.;Webster, R.

2253,An emerging genotype subset within PCV-2b dominates PMWS in Switzerland,"Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) is one of the most important emerging swine diseases worldwide. The insidious nature of the disease initially made it difficult to localize the pathogen. The presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in all PMWS-stricken animals led to its acceptance as the causative agent of PMWS, possibly together with an unknown factor. Even the presence of PCV2 in healthy individuals did not facilitate understanding of the disease. The phylogenetic classification divides PCV2 viruses into at least two main groups. The viruses are identified as belonging to PCV-2a or PCV-2b with the aid of a signature motif, a short amino acid motif encoded in the capsid protein. Recently, this classification has received more attention as it appeared to define PCV-2b as more virulent. However, this simplification could not be confirmed experimentally. Therefore, we investigated whether the genetic shift of the virus was an initiator for PMWS in Switzerland. Piglet lymphoid tissues from 1973 to 2005 were examined histologically, immunohistochemically (IHC) and PCR. A sequence amplicon of 137 bp encompassing the signature motif was used for genotype classification. The onset of the Swiss PMWS plague showed a clear shift in PMWS-sick and subclinically infected piglets to PCV-2b and specifically to a subset of the genotype. Complementary to these observations, healthy piglets, also defined as negative by the IHC, are positive in the PCR reaction and free of any PCV-2b virus during the animal epidemic. Consequently, our data support plasticity of the PCV2 genome as a major factor in PMWS disease manifestation. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Wiederkehr, D.

To determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of swine PBV in northern Thailand, 380 fecal samples from piglets with and without diarrhea reared at 22 pig farms were tested for the presence of PBV. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using primer sets specific for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. PBV was detected in 86/265 (32.5%) piglets with diarrhea and 26/115 (22.6%) piglets without diarrhoea. All PBV strains detected in this study belonged to genogroup I, and a high proportion of PBV-positive piglets were co-infected with group A rotavirus (RVA) and bocavirus (BoV). The phylogenetic analysis of representative strains of genogroup I revealed a remarkably high similarity between the strains; these formed a monophyletic cluster with 97-100% sequence identity in the RdRP gene.

2256,Influenza A viruses in ducks in northwestern Minnesota: fine-scale spatial and temporal variation in prevalence and subtype diversity,"Northwest Minnesota waterfowl were tested for avian influenza virus (AIV) by cloacal swabs in July-October 2007 and 2008. AIV was detected in 222 (9.1%) of 2,441 ducks in 2007 and in 438 (17.9%) of 2,452 ducks in 2008. The prevalence of AIV peaked in late summer. We detected 27 AIV subtypes in 2007 and 31 in 2008. Ten hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were detected each year (ie, H1, 3-8, and 10-12 in 2007; H1-8, 10, and 11 in 2008). All neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were detected in each study year. The diversity of subtypes varied between years and increased with prevalence into September. The predominant subtypes in 2007 (covering ≥ 5% of the subtype diversity) included H1N1, H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H7N3, H10N7 and H11N9. The predominant subtypes in 2008 included H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H4N8, H6N1 and H10N7. In addition, within each HA subtype, the same predominant HA/NA subtype combinations were found each year, including H1N1, H3N8, H4N6, H5N2, H6N1, H7N3, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N9. The H2N3 and H12N5 viruses also dominated within the H2 and H12 subtypes, respectively, but were only detected in a single year (H2 and H12 viruses were not detected in 2007 and 2008, respectively). Mallards were the predominant species sampled (63.7% of the total) and 531 AIV were isolated from this species (80.5% of all isolates).

2258,Virus-virus interactions and host ecology are linked to RNA-viroma structure in wild birds,"Little is known about the factors shaping the ecology of RNA viruses in nature. Wild birds are an important example because, other than influenza A virus, samples from birds are rarely tested for virus, particularly in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics""), we have revealed the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of ecological factors that can determine vioma structure and abundance. Meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. Viruses identified included a previously described gamma-coronavirus and influenza A viruses. In addition, we identified new virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae. We found differences in virome structure that reflect underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from the arid interior of Australia possessed the greatest virus diversity and abundance, significantly more than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and dabbed ducks (Anas spp.), virus abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts positive for influenza A infection than in those negative for this virus, despite specimens on which were taken on the same day and from the same place. This study highlights the extent and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds and lays the groundwork for understanding the factors that determine vioma structure in wild populations.",,"Wille, M.;Eden, J.

2259,An aberrant hepatitis D-like pathogen in birds,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV), currently only found in humans, is a satellite virus that depends on hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins for assembly, release, and entry. Using metatranscriptomics, we identified the genome of a novel HDV-like pathogen in ducks. Sequence analysis revealed secondary structures shared with HDV, including self-complementarity and ribozyme features. The predicted viral protein shares 32% amino acid similarity with the HDV small delta antigen and encompasses a divergent phylogenetic lineage. The discovery of an avian HDV-like pathogen has important implications for understanding the origins of HDV and subviral pathogens.",,"Wille, M.;Netter, H. J.;Littlejohn, M.;Yuen, L.;Shi, M.;Eden, J.

2260,Viral diversity of house mice in New York City,"The microbiome of wild Mus musculus (house mouse), a global invasive pest that lives in close contact with humans in urban centers, remains largely unexplored. Here we report the analysis of fecal virome of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected from seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx over a one-year period. High-throughput unbiased sequencing of faeces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 new viruses and 3 new genera. A representative screening of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in the liver. We found an uneven distribution of diversity, with multiple viruses assigned to specific loci. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse after adjusting for location, sex, and length. We found no genetic traces of known human viral pathogens, nor antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. IMPORTANCE Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a public health concern. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for studying the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this study of mice trapped at multiple locations in New York City over a year, we found a diverse collection of viruses, including some not previously associated with house mice and others that were new to seem to be Although we have not found any known human pathogens, our results provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models useful for clinical microbiology.",,"Williams, S.

2261,Conference Report: 2013 PDA Virus & TSE Safety Forum,"The report provides a summary of the presentations and discussions at the Virus & TSE Safety Forum 2013 organized by the Parenteral Drug Association (PDA) and held June 4-6, 2013 in Berlin, Germany. The conference was accompanied by a workshop, ""Viral tip preparations and virus removal by filtration: Emerging trends and developments"". The workshop presentations and discussions are summarized in a separate report, which will also appear in this issue of the journal. As with previous conferences in this series, the PDA Virus & TSE Safety Forum 2013 again provided an excellent opportunity for industry, research institutes and regulatory authorities to exchange information and views. Updates on regulatory considerations related to the safety of biopharmaceuticals from viruses and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) have been provided by European Union (EU), United States (US) and Singapore authorities. The epidemiology and detection methods of newly emerging pathogens such as the hepatitis E virus and the parvovirus (PARV 4) were presented as examples, and in particular the risk of contamination of animal raw materials such as trypsin was considered. The utility of using new sequence-based virus detection methods was discussed. Past bioreactor contamination events drew attention to root cause analysis and preventative measures, illustrated by several examples. Virus clearance data for certain unit operations was provided; The discussion focused on the mechanism of virus clearance and on the strategic concept of virus clearance integration. As in previous years, the viral safety section was followed by a section on TSEs, which addressed current scientific evidence that may influence the risk assessment of blood and cell substrates. This included the finding that interspecies transmission of TSEs by blood components in sheep is greater than predicted by assays in transgenic mice. In addition, the pathogenesis and possibility of productive TSE infection from cell substrates were considered, and cell-based assays that might be suitable for use in TSE clearance studies were discussed.

2262,"Sexually Transmitted Infection (e-STI) Testing and Outcomes Service via the Internet: A Randomized, Single-Blinded, Controlled Trial","Background: Internet-based sexually transmitted infection tests (e-STI tests) are increasingly being offered as an alternative to tests in clinics. Typically, this testing modality allows users to order a test kit from a virtual service (via a website or app), collect their own samples, send test samples back to a laboratory, and be notified of their results via short message service (SMS) or phone. e-STI testing is thought to improve access to testing compared to face-to-face services, but the evidence is unclear. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an e-STI testing and outcomes service (chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and syphilis) on STI testing uptake and diagnosed STI cases. Methods and results: The study took place in the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Between November 24, 2014 and August 31, 2015, we recruited 2,072 participants, ages 16 to 30, residing in these counties, who had at least 1 sex partner in the past 12 months, who agreed to have an STI test make, and had access to the Internet. Those who could not give consent and could not read English were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned 1 SMS with the web link of an e-STI testing and results service (intervention group) or 1 SMS with the web link of a customized website listing the locations, contact details and websites of 7 local sexual health clinics health (control group). Participants were free to use other services or interventions during the study period. The primary endpoints were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks verified by medical record review and self-reported STI diagnoses at 6 weeks verified by medical record review. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of participants prescribed treatment for an STI, time from randomization to completion of STI testing, and time from randomization to treatment for an STI. Participants were sent £10 cash upon presentation of self-reported data. We completed all follow-up visits, including medical record reviews, by June 17, 2016. Utilization of STI testing was increased in the intervention group at 6 weeks (50.0% vs. 26.6%, relative risk [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.15, P<0.001). The proportion of participants diagnosed was 2.8% in the intervention group versus 1.4% in the control group (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.70, p=0.079). No evidence of heterogeneity was observed in any of the pre-specified subgroup analyses. The proportion of participants treated was 1.1% in the intervention group versus 0.7% in the control group (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, p=0.231). Time to test was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (28.8 days versus 36.5 days, P<0.001, test for difference in reduced median survival [RMST]), but no differences in time were found observed until treatment (83.2 days vs. 83.5 days, P=0.51, test for difference in RMST). We could not recruit the planned 3,000 participants and therefore had no power for the analysis of STI diagnoses and treated STI cases. Conclusions: The e-STI testing service increased STI testing utilization for all groups, including high-risk groups. The intervention required patients to attend a clinic for treatment and did not reduce time to treatment. Service innovations to improve treatment rates for people diagnosed online are needed and could include e-treatment and post-treatment services. e-STI testing services require long-term monitoring and evaluation.

The focus of this review is on diagnostic tools available to North American veterinary diagnosticians. Standard diagnostic tests are readily available for BT/EHD viruses and there are described tests published in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Manual. However, there are significant differences in the diagnostic approach to these viruses. Serological assays are well established and many laboratories have experience in performing these assays. Numerous nucleic acid amplification assays are also available for BT virus (BTV) and EHD virus (EHDV). Although there is extensive experience with BTV reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), there are no standards or comparisons of the protocols used by various state and federal veterinary diagnostic laboratories.",,"Wilson, W.

2265,Classification of Marek's disease viruses by pathotype: philosophy and methodology,"The concept of the pathotype in Marek's disease (MD) probably dates back to the recognition of a more virulent form of the disease in the late 1950's (Benton & Cover, 1957). The distinctions between MD virus strains were further expanded with the description of the vv patotype in the early 1980s and the vv+ patotype in the 1990s. Pathotype designations reflect important biological properties that correlate with breakthrough vaccine immunity in the field. However, the pathotyping methods used by different laboratories were not consistent, which prevented a critical comparison of the results. Better consistency in pathotyping procedures is desirable. The Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory (ADOL) method is based on the induction of lymphoproliferative lesions in vaccinated chickens. This method has been used to pathotype more than 45 isolates and is the basis for the current pathotype classification of MD virus strains. Its limitations include requirements for a specific type of chicken (15 x 7 ab+), large number of animals, and a statistical method to compare lesion responses to those of JM/102W and Md5 control strains. Because of these limitations, it has not been and probably will not be used in other laboratories. Comparability in pathotyping can be improved by comparing field isolates to standard prototype strains such as JM/102W, Md5 and 648A (American Type Culture Collection) or their equivalents. Data can be generated by various in vivo methods that measure tumor induction, neurological disease (both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions), or purely non-neoplastic criteria (such as lymphoid organ weights or viral replication). Methods based on neoplastic criteria, particularly when generated in MD-immunized chickens, will likely correlate most closely with the ADOL method and be most relevant to the development of MD virus in the field. Based on data from several experiments, a modification of the ADOL method is proposed that uses fewer chickens and can be performed with commercial specific pathogen-free strains. The modified procedure is based on ""best-fit"" comparisons with prototype strains and is expected to provide results that are generally comparable to the original procedure. A variety of other alternative criteria (see above) are also evaluated both for primary pathotyping and as an adjunct to other pathotyping methods. Advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods are presented. © 2005 Houghton Trust Ltd.",,"Witter, R. L.;Calnek, B. W.;Buscaglia, C.;Gimeno, I. M.;Schat, K.

The isolate was shown to be antigenically different from parvoviruses of bovine and canine origin by haemagglutination inhibition tests. 26 of 136 horse sera tested showed specific haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against the viral isolate. The isolated virus displayed properties compatible with those of an autonomous parvovirus, including size, morphology, stability to ether treatment and heating to 56°C, the presence of a 5300 base DNA genome, characteristic protein composition and density (1.405 g/ ml).

2267,Use of enteric viruses to track sources of faecal pollution in environmental waters,"Microbial Source Tracking (MST) tools are used to identify sources of fecal pollution to accurately assess public health risk and implement Best Management Practices (BMPs). This review focuses on the potential of enteric viruses for MST applications. After host infection, enteric viruses multiply and are shed in large numbers in the host's feces and urine. Because of the specificity in host infections, enteric viruses are considered one of the most accurate library-independent, culture-independent MST tools. When evaluating viral molecular assays based on the sensitivity, specificity, and density of the target virus in fecal-exposed samples, human adenovirus and human polyomavirus emerged as the most promising human-specific viral markers. However, due to cross-reactions observed between livestock species or the limited number of samples tested for specificity, further research is needed to identify promising viral markers for livestock. Other viral indicators of faecal origin, F+ RNA Coliphage and Pepper Mild Mottle Virus have also been suggested as potential targets for MST marker development. Improving the utility of enteric viruses for MST applications through next-generation sequencing (NGS) and virus concentration technology is discussed in the final part of this review. The massive sequence databases generated by shotgun and gene-directed metagenomics allow for more efficient and reliable design of MST assays. Finally, recent studies have shown that alternative virus concentration methods may be less expensive than standard technologies such as 1MDS; however, improvements in recovery efficiency and consistency are still needed. Overall, developments in metagenomic information combined with efficient concentration methods and high host specificity make enteric viruses a promising tool in MST applications. © 2012 .",,"Wong, K.;Fong, T.

2268,Cloning and sequencing of the full-length cDNA of the LPC strain of classical swine fever virus,"The cDNAs of classical swine fever virus (LPC vaccine strain) were cloned by transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences determined. In this work, we obtained the sequence information of 786 bases of 5-terminal region, 6049 bases of middle region and 1648 bases of 3-terminal region. Taking our previous results and the present data together, the entire genomic sequence of the LPC strain has been completed (12344 nucleotides long). The genome of LPC has a large open reading frame that can encode a polypeptide of 3897 amino acids and is flanked by untranslated regions (UTR), 373 bases at the 5' end and 278 bases at the 3' end. Phylogenetic analyzes based on genomic sequences of several viruses suggested that the LPC strain is closer in order to the Chinese, Riems, HCLV, Alfort/187, Brescia and Alfort strains. Upon further analysis, we found that a 13 nucleotide insertion, TTT(C/T)CTTTTTTTT, in the 3-UTR of LPC, Chinese, and HCLV strains.

2269,Neutralizing DNA aptamers against swine influenza H3N2 viruses,"Triple reassortant porcine influenza A viruses (IAVs), particularly the North American H3N2 subtype, circulate in swine herds and can reassort and lead to the emergence of new zoonotic strains. Current diagnostic tools rely on virus isolation followed by serotyping by hemagglutination or genome sequencing, both of which can be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, new subtype-specific ligands and methods for rapid testing and subtyping of IAVs in the field are needed. To meet this need, we selected DNA aptamers against the recombinant HA protein from porcine IAV H3 cluster IV using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Four candidate aptamers (HA68, HA7, HA2a and HA2b) were identified and characterized. The dissociation constants (Kd) of the aptamers HA68, HA7, HA2a and HA2b against the recombinant H3 protein were 7.1, 22.3, 16.0 and 3.7 nM, respectively. The binding site of HA68 to H3 was identified between nucleotide residues 8 and 40. All aptamers inhibited H3 hemagglutination. HA68 was highly specific for all four lineages within the North American H3N2 subtype. In addition, the other three aptamers specifically identified live viruses belonging to phylogenetic clusters I, II/III and IV, specifically the virus closely related to the youngest H3N2 variant (H3N2v). Aptamer HA68 was also able to bind and detect H3N2v isolated from recent human cases. In summary, we provide subtype-specific aptamers against porcine H3N2 IAVs that can now be used in rapid detection and typing protocols for field applications.

2270,The metagenomic analysis of viromas from dromedary camel feces samples shows a large number and high diversity of circoviruses and picobirnaviruses,"The recent discovery of Middle East respiratory coronavirus and another novel dromedary-camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 in dromedaries has increased interest in searching for novel viruses in dromedaries. In this study, fecal samples from 203 dromedaries in Dubai were pooled and deeply sequenced. Of the 7330 assembled viral contigs, 1970 were assigned to mammalian viruses. The largest groups of these contigs corresponded to the Picobirnaviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae and Hepeviridae. Many of these virus families were previously unknown to dromedaries. In addition to the high abundance of contigs from Circoviridae (n=598 with 14 complete genomes) and Picobirnaviridae (n=1236), a high diversity of contigs from these two families was found, with the 14 complete genomes of Circoviridae forming at least five clusters and contigs both genogroup I and genogroup II, potentially novel picobirnaviruses.

2271,High diversity of genogroup I picobirnaviruses in mammals,"In a molecular epidemiological study of 791 fecal samples collected from various terrestrial and marine mammals in Hong Kong, genogroup I picobirnaviruses (PBVs) were positive by RT-PCR targeting the partial RdRp gene in samples from five cattle, six monkeys, 17 horses and nine targeted pigs, one rabbit, one dog and 12 California sea lions, with 11, 9, 23, 17, 1, 1 and 15 sequence types in the positive samples from the corresponding animals, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PBV sequences of each animal species were widespread throughout the tree with high diversity and shared 47.4-89.0% nucleotide identities with other genogroup I PBV strains based on the partial RdRP gene. Nine complete segment 1 (viral loads 1.7 x 10(4) to 5.9 x 10(6)/mL) and 15 segment 2 (viral loads 4.1 x 10(3) to 1.3 x 10(6)/mL) ml) of Otarine PBVs from fecal samples serially collected from California sea lions were sequenced. In the two phylogenetic trees constructed using ORF2 and ORF3 of segment 1, the nine segment 1 sequences were clustered into four distinct clades (C1-C4). In the tree constructed using the segment 2 RdRp gene, the 15 segment 2 sequences were clustered into nine distinct clades (R1-R9). PBVs were detected in four sea lions in two different years, with the same segment 1 glade (C3) present in two consecutive years from one sea lion and different clades in different years from three sea lions. A large diversity of PBVs has been observed in a variety of land and marine mammals.

2272,Resolution of virus subtypes of bovine viral diarrhea virus from persistently infected US beef calves with complete genome sequence,"Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) is divided into two genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, each containing distinct subtypes with genetic and antigenic variations. To effectively control BVDV through vaccination, it is important to know which subtypes of the virus are circulating and how their prevalence is changing over time. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to estimate the current prevalence and diversity of BVDV subtypes from persistently infected (PI) beef calves in the central United States. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR (5'-untranslated region) for 119 virus strains revealed that the majority (82%) belonged to genotype 1b and the remaining strains were distributed between genotypes 1a (9%) and 2 (8%). was. ; However, BVDV-2 subtypes could not be reliably resolved. Therefore, to better define the variability of US BVDV isolates and to further investigate the subdivision of BVDV-2 isolates into subtypes, complete genome sequences were obtained for these isolates as well as for representatives of BVDV-1a and -1b. Phylogenetic analyzes of the full coding sequence provided a more conclusive genetic classification, showing that US BVDV-2 isolates belong to at least 3 different genetic groups, which are statistically supported by both full and individual coding gene analyses. These results indicate that a more complex set of BVDV-2 subtypes circulate in this region than previously thought.",,"Workman, A. M.;Heaton, M. P.;Harhay, G. P.;Smith, T. P.;Grotelueschen, D.

To assess the potential risk, we passaged the isolate A/Hamburg/04/2009 sequentially in A549 human lung epithelial cells. After passage 6 we observed a 100-fold increased replication rate. High-throughput sequencing of viral gene segments identified five dominant mutations whose contribution to increased growth was analyzed by reverse genetics. The increased replication rate was attributed to two mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment (HA1 D130E, HA2 I91L) near the receptor binding site and the stem domain. The adapted virus also replicated more efficiently in mice in vivo. Increased replication rate correlated with increased HA protein fusion pH and decreased receptor affinity.

2275,Does the complexity of the rumen microbial ecology preclude methane abatement?,"Ruminants are responsible for the production of some of the greenhouse gases, particularly methane (61 Tg/year), which are believed to contribute to global warming and climate change. Methane is an end product of the fermentation of plant matter by the microbial ecosystem in the rumen. Methanogenesis is performed by methanogenic archaea and is a mechanism by which H(2) is removed from fermentation to regenerate biochemical co-factors such as NAD+. The microbial ecosystem is very complex and includes thousands of species of bacteria (10(10)-10(11) cells/ml), archaea (10(7)-10(9) cells/ml), protozoa (10(4)-10 (6) cells/ml), fungi (10(3)-10(6) cells/ml) and viruses (10(9)-10(10) cells/ml) that interact with food, their hosts and each other . This ecosystem is relatively poorly understood, particularly the interactions between species and interactions with the host. Less than 15% of the microbial species in the gastrointestinal tract have been cultured and characterized. However, knowledge of this ecosystem is increasing, particularly with the advent of molecular biology and culture-independent technologies. New high-throughput sequencing methods such as pyrosequencing will greatly improve the rate of knowledge acquisition, and techniques such as stable isotope studies will improve our ability to understand relationships between species. While we can expect an increase in our knowledge of this complex ecosystem and an improved ability to predictably reduce CH(4) emissions, there are already examples of successful reductions, including the use of feed (e.g. cereal grains) and chemical additives (e.g. 2-bromoethanesulfonate, bromochloromethane). Achieving significant reductions in CH(4) emissions may be possible with advances in our knowledge of the intricacies of this complex ecosystem.

2276,Molecular Characterization of H1N1 Influenza A Viruses from Human Cases in North America,"Subtypes of H1N1 influenza virus can be found in humans in North America while also being associated with infection in swine. Characterizing the genotypes of viral strains in human populations is important to understanding the source and distribution of viral strains. Genome and protein sequences of 10 isolates of the 2009 North American influenza A (H1N1) virus outbreak were obtained from the GenBank database. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, phylogenetic trees of the PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, NS, and M genes were constructed by the Phylip3.67 program and N-linked glycosylation sites of HA, NA, PB2, NS1, and M2 constructed proteins were analyzed online by the program NetNGlyc1.0. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates are virtually identical but may be recombinant viruses since their genomic fragments are from different viruses. The isolates also contain a characteristic weakly pathogenic amino acid motif at their HA cleavage sites (IPSIQSRa dagger""GL) and an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein, showing its high affinity for humans. The homologous model of M proteins demonstrated this the viruses had acquired anti-amantadine ability due to the mutation at the drug-sensitive site, while sequence analysis of NA proteins showed that the viruses are still sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitor drug (i.e., oseltamivir and zanamivir) as none Mutations have occurred Our results strongly suggest that the viruses responsible for the 2009 outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1) virus have the ability to cross species barriers to infect humans and mammals based on molecular Analyzes: These results could further facilitate the therapy and prevention of possible transmission from North America in other countries.",,"Wu, B.;Wang, C.

Three hundred seventy-four (374) AIV strains were isolated from 3,328 samples. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes were performed. We identified a new H9N2 virus genotype that was reassorted with gene segments from Qa/HK/G1/97-like, Ck/BJ/1/94-like and Dk/HK/Y439/97-like viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes indicated that the H9N2 viruses had undergone regrouping with other AIV subtypes. The results also indicated that two different clades (2.3.2 and 2.3.4.6) of H5 viruses co-circulated in Zhejiang province. Since reassorted H5-AIVs have been detected in geese and ducks, it is possible that apparently healthy birds contribute to newly emerging H5-AIVs. Continuous monitoring is required for poultry in eastern China.",,"Wu, H.;Peng, X.;Peng, X.;Cheng, L.;Lu, X.;Jin, C.;Xie, T.;Yao, H.;Wu, N.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep17508,0
2278,Specific microRNA library of IFN-t on bovine endometrial epithelial cells,"IFN-t is specifically secreted by conception in ruminants during early gestation and plays a crucial role in the immunological function of gestation. However, the mechanism involving microRNA (miRNA) is not yet well understood. Deep sequencing was used to probe the IFN-t specific miRNA library on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs). The results showed that 574 known bovine miRNAs and 109 new miRNAs were identified. We found 74 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 30 commonly expressed miRNAs in the experiment. Then qPCR verification of six selected miRNAs showed that they matched the sequence data. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyzes revealed significant enrichment of predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs, including influenza A, herpes simplex infection, antigen processing and presentation, viral myocarditis, TNF pathway, Graft versus - host disease and allograft rejection. These results may make important contributions to the immune response during early pregnancy in ruminants, but further studies are needed to verify the proposed cellular/immunological effects and the role of specific miRNAs as biomarkers in vivo.",,"Wu, H.;Zhang, T.;Ma, X.;Jiang, K.;Zhao, G.;Qiu, C.;Deng, G.",2017.0,,10.18632/oncotarget.18470,0
2279,There are shared RNA replication signals in group 2 coronaviruses: evidence for in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules,"5” and 3” UTR sequences on the coronavirus genome are known to carry cis-acting elements for DI RNA replication and presumably also viral genome replication. It is also believed that 5â€²UTR-contiguous coding sequences harbor cis-acting elements. Here we determined the 5-inch UTR and adjacent 289-nt sequences, as well as the 3-inch UTR sequences for six group 2 coronaviruses and compared them to each other and to three previously reported group 2 members. Extensive regions of very similar UTR sequences were found, but also small regions of divergence, suggesting that group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into those similar to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus -OC43, human enteric coronavirus, porcine haemagglutinating). encephalomyelitis virus and equine coronavirus) and those similar to murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (A59, 2 and JHM strains of MHV, puffinosis virus and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus). The BCoV and MHV 3-inch UTRs have previously been shown to be interchangeable. Here it was shown that a reporter-containing BCoV-DI RNA is replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, showing that group 2 has in common 5″ and 3″ replication signaling elements. Furthermore, BCoV DI RNA acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 through leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules. These results indicate that common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite a two-cluster pattern within the group, and imply that there might be a high potential for recombination between group members. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

2280,"Impact of live poultry market interventions on influenza A(H7N9) virus, Guangdong, China","Since March 2013, three waves of human infection with the avian influenza virus A(H7N9) have been detected in China. To examine virus transmission within and between epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole genome analyzes of viruses collected in Guangdong between 2013 and 2015. We observed a geographical shift in human A(H7N9) infections from the second to the third wave. Interventions in the live poultry market have been carried out in epicentric cities; However, spatial phylogenetic analysis showed that the third wave outbreaks in central Guangdong were most likely due to local virus persistence rather than introduction from elsewhere. Although the number of human clinical cases decreased by 35% from the second to the third wave, the genetic diversity of the third wave virus increased in Guangdong. Our results underscore the epidemic risk for a region that reports comparatively few A(H7N9) cases. Furthermore, our results indicate that interventions in the live poultry market cannot completely stop the persistence and spread of the A(H7N9) virus.",,"Wu, J.;Lu, J.;Faria, N.

2281,"Molecular detection of hepatitis E virus in sheep from southern Xinjiang, China","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of infectious hepatitis in animals and humans in both developing and industrialized countries. Here we collected 500 sheep sera and 75 raw sheep liver samples from a slaughterhouse in southern part of Xinjiang region, China along with 26 sera from butchers from the same slaughterhouse. All serum samples were tested for anti-HEV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both serum and liver samples were assayed for the presence of HEV RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting partial nucleotide sequences of open reading frame 2 (ORF2). The results show that the seroprevalence in sheep was 35.20% (176/500) and that four of the 75 (5.3%) sheep livers had detectable levels of HEV RNA. The seroprevalence of the butchers was 57.7% (15/26). The four amplicons shared 97.8-100% nucleotide sequence identity and had pairwise sequence identities of 81.6-85.3%, 84.2-85.3%, 82.1-85.3%, and 84.7-97.9 % the corresponding regions of HEV genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on alignments of an amplified 186 bp ORF2 sequence and corresponding reference strains. Analysis showed that the four ovine strains detected in our study formed a lineage within a genotype 4 cluster containing hb-3, bjsw1, T1, swCH189 and swCH25, all belonging to genotype 4 subtype 4d. The results showed high levels of seroconversion in sheep and suggested that sheep liver could be a source of foodborne HEV infection in humans.",,"Wu, J.;Si, F.;Jiang, C.;Li, T.;Jin, M.",2015.0,,10.1007/s11262-015-1194-9,0
2282,High-throughput sequencing of the pituitary and hypothalamic microRNA transcriptome associated with high egg production rate,"Background: MicroRNAs are widespread in viruses, plants and animals. As endogenous small noncoding RNAs, miRNAs regulate a variety of biological processes. Tissue miRNA expression studies have uncovered numerous functions for miRNAs in different chicken tissues, but the regulation of miRNAs in chicken pituitary and hypothalamic development related to high and low egg-laying performance remained unclear. Results: In this study, using high-throughput sequencing technology, we sequenced two tissues (pituitary and hypothalamus) in 3 high and 3 low egg producing Luhua chickens at 300 days of age. By comparing low and high egg producing chickens, 46 known miRNAs and 27 novel miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed (P<0.05). Six differentially expressed known miRNAs, expressed in both tissues, were used in RT-qPCR validation and SNP detection. Among them, seven SNPs were found in two miRNA precursors (gga-miR1684a and gga-miR-1434) that could enhance or reduce the production of the mature miRNAs. Furthermore, 124 and 30 reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs were identified by RNA-seq in pituitary and hypothalamic tissues, respectively, and randomly selected candidate miRNA and miRNA-target pairs were validated by RT-qPCR in Jiuyuan black chickens. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation showed that a large number of oviposition-related signaling pathways were enriched in high egg producing chickens, including ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Conclusions: These differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted target genes, specifically identified reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs, promote the study of miRNA function and miRNA identification associated with egg production. Analysis of the miRNA-related SNPs and their effects provided insights into the effects of SNPs on miRNA biogenesis and function. The data generated in this study will advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms in the hen egg laying process.",,"Wu, N.;Zhu, Q.;Chen, B. L.;Gao, J.;Xu, Z. X.;Li, D. Y.",2017.0,Mar,,0
2283,Genetic diversity of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from native poultry species in eastern China between 2005 and 2008,"Seventy-nine Newcastle disease (NDV) viruses isolated between 2005 and 2008 from clinical specimens of various poultry species including chickens, pigeons (Columba livia), geese and ostriches in eastern China were characterized biologically and phylogenetically. The results demonstrated the genetic diversity of these viruses: three class I viruses and one genotype I and 12 class II genotype II viruses circulating in chickens were avirulent; four genotype VIb viruses isolated from pigeons were moderately virulent; and two genotype III viruses and 57 genotype VIId viruses were highly virulent. The three class I viruses were further classified as genotypes 2 and 3. The very high F protein sequence identity of one genotype I virus with the Queensland V4 strain and 12 genotype II viruses with the La Sota strain indicated that these viruses are descended from the two vaccine strains. Two genotype III viruses shared greater than 99% sequence identity with the moderately virulent vaccine strain Mukteswar, but showed significantly higher virulence, suggesting that they evolved from the vaccine virus and that the Mukteswar vaccine will be banned in China should. Fifty-seven of the 63 virulent NDVs in this study belonged to genotype VIId, indicating its prevalence in eastern China. Genotype VIId viruses could be further divided into two subgroups. Four of the five NDVs isolated from pigeons belonged to genotype VIb, indicating its host-specific preference. Both the VIb and VIId genotype NDVs showed low amino acid similarity to the vaccine strains currently used in China, implying the urgent need to develop better vaccines against the most prevalent NDVs in China.",,"Wu, S.;Wang, W.;Yao, C.;Wang, X.;Hu, S.;Cao, J.;Wu, Y.;Liu, W.;Liu, X.",2011.0,,10.1007/s00705-010-0851-5,0
2284,Molecular and antigenic properties of domestic duck Newcastle disease virus isolates in China,"Newcastle Disease (ND) is one of the most devastating diseases for the poultry industry. The causative agents of ND are virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which are members of the Avulavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. Waterfowl such as ducks and geese are generally considered potential reservoirs of NDV and may show little or no clinical signs when infected with viruses that are evidently virulent in chickens. However, over the past decade, frequent outbreaks of ND in native waterfowl have been reported in many countries. In this study, 18 NDV strains isolated from domestic ducks in southern and eastern China between 2005 and 2013 were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. The complete genomes of these strains have been sequenced and they revealed genome sizes of 15,186 nucleotides (nt), 15,192. nt and 15,198. nt that follow the ""rule of six"" required for replication of NDV strains. Based on the F protein cleavage site and pathogenicity tests in chickens, 17 of our NDV isolates were categorized as lentogenic viruses and one was characterized as a velogenic virus. Phylogenetic analyzes based on the partial and full genome sequences of the F gene revealed that at least four genotypes of NDV are circulating in domestic ducks; GD1, AH224, and AH209 belong to genotypes VIId, Ib, and II of class II NDVs, respectively, and the remaining 15 isolates belong to genotype 1b of class I NDVs. Cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition assays demonstrated that the antigenic relatedness between NDV strains associated with their genotypes rather than their hosts. These results indicate that while these NDV isolates are from ducks, they do not form a phylogenetic group because they are from the same species; However, they can play an important role in promoting the development of NDVs.",,"Wu, W.;Liu, H.;Zhang, T.;Han, Z.;Jiang, Y.;Xu, Q.;Shao, Y.;Li, H.;Kong, X.;Chen, H.;Liu, S.",2015.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.02.016,0
2285,DEF cells infected with virulent duck enteritis virus produce a unique pattern of viral microRNAs and a novel set of host microRNAs,"Background: Duck enteritis virus (DEV) belongs to the family Herpesviridae and is a major epinogenic agent causing economic losses in the waterfowl industry. The Chinese virulent (CHv) and attenuated vaccine (VAC) are two different pathogenic DEV strains. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in viral infections. However, little information is available on virulent duck enteritis virus (DEV)-encoded miRNAs. Results: Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 39 mature viral miRNAs from CHv-infected duck embryo fibroblast cells. Compared to the reported 33 VAC-encoded miRNAs, only 13 miRNA sequences and 22 miRNA ""seed sequences"" were identical, and 8 new viral miRNAs were detected and confirmed by stem-loop RT-qPCR in this study. Using RNAhybrid and PITA software, it was predicted that 38 CHv-encoded miRNAs target 41 viral genes and form a complex regulatory network. Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) confirmed that viral dev-miR-D8-3p can directly target the 3'-UTR of the CHv US1 gene (p<0.05). Gene ontological analyzes of host target genes of viral miRNAs have been mainly involved in biological regulation, cellular and metabolic processes. In addition, 598 new duck-encoded miRNAs were discovered in this study. Thirty-eight host miRNAs showed significant differential expression after CHv infection: 13 miRNAs were upregulated and 25 miRNAs were downregulated, which may affect viral replication in the host cell. Conclusions: These data suggest that CHv encodes a different set of microRNAs compared to VAC and forms a unique regulatory network. This is the first report of the expression profile of DEF miRNAs and an analysis of the regulatory mechanisms of these miRNAs during DEV infection. These data provide a basis for further exploration of the regulatory role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of DEV infection and contribute to the understanding of CHv-host interaction at the miRNA level.",,"Wu, X.;Jia, R.;Zhou, J.;Wang, M.;Chen, S.;Liu, M.;Zhu, D.;Zhao, X.;Sun, K.;Yang, Q.;Wu, Y.;Yin, Z.;Chen, X.;Wang, J.;Cheng, A.",2018.0,,10.1186/s12917-018-1468-2,0

Nine pairs of specific primers and one set of universal primers were designed; multiplex PCR was established. The specificity and cross-reactivity of this assay were examined and the limit of detection was determined using serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids containing the target sequences. The assay was further tested using 144 clinical specimens. We found that the nine specific peaks of amplification were observed and the assay had a high degree of specificity with no non-specific amplification. The simultaneous detection limit for the nine viruses reached 10,000 copies ΔL-1 when all premixed viral targets were present. Seventy-seven of the clinical specimens tested positive for at least one of the viruses; The main viral infections in the clinical specimens were porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.

2288,The molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (H9N2) derived from air samples at live poultry markets,"Aim: To study the molecular properties of H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from air samples collected at live poultry markets (LPMs) and explore their sequence identities with AIVs that caused infection in humans. Methods: From 2015 to 2016, weekly monitoring of airborne H9N2 subtype AIVs from LPMs was conducted. H9 positive samples were isolated from chick embryos. Whole genome sequences of the isolated AIVs were obtained by high-throughput sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis and the major loci variations of the sequences were further analyzed. Results: A total of 327 aerosol samples of LPMs were collected. Nine samples were positive for H9 subtype AIVs based on real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR). According to whole genome sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis, in 2015, except strain A/Environment/Zhongshan/ZS201505/2015 (ZS201505), 8 gene segments of 8 aerosol H9N2 isolates and 2 H9N2 human isolates were in the same clade. Among the major loci variations, except for the ZS201505 strain, H9N2 subtype AIVs had no mutations in eight receptor-binding sites of hemagglutinin (HA), and stalks of neuraminidase (NA) proteins had a three-base deletion site. The PA gene of ZS201503 and ZS201602 had an L336M mutation. The N30D and T215A mutations in the M1 gene and the amino acid residues L89V in PB2, P42S in NS1 and S31N in M2 were retained in these 9 strains of H9N2 isolates, which could enhance the virulence of the virus. Conclusion: Live H9N2-AIVs survived in the aerosol from LPMs in Zhongshan city. The aerosol viruses had a close evolutionary relationship with human epidemic strains, suggesting that there may be a risk of AIV transmission to humans from polluted aerosols in LPMs. Mutations in H9N2 subtype AIVs isolated from air samples from LPMs indicated that their pathogenicity to infect humans was enhanced.",,"Wu, Y.;Lin, J.;Yang, S.;Xie, Y.;Wang, M.;Chen, X.;Zhu, Y.;Luo, L.;Shi, W.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.01.009,0
2289,A porcine epithelial cell line infected with pseudorabies virus produces a diverse set of host microRNAs and a specific cluster of viral microRNAs,"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) belongs to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, which causes enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Recently, many herpesviruses have been shown to encode microRNAs (miRNAs), which play critical roles in the viral life cycle. However, knowledge of PRV-encoded miRNAs is still limited. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of both viral and host miRNA expression profiles in PRV-infected porcine epithelial cell lines (PK-15). Deep sequencing data showed that the ~4.6 kb intron of the large latency transcript (LLT) acts as the primary microRNA precursor (pri-miRNA) that forms a cluster of 11 different miRNAs in the PRV genome as well as 209 known and 39 novel porcine miRNAs were identified. Viral miRNAs were further confirmed by stem loop RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Interestingly, all of these viral miRNAs displayed terminal heterogeneity at both the 5' and 3' ends. Seven miRNA genes produced mature miRNAs from both arms and two of the viral miRNA genes showed partial overlap in their precursor regions. Unexpectedly, a high abundance end-loop derived small RNA and a specific miRNA offset RNA (moRNA) were processed from the same viral miRNA precursor. The polymorphisms of viral miRNAs shed light on the complexity of the host miRNA processing machinery and the viral miRNA regulation mechanism. The porcine and PRV genes were pooled for target prediction of the viral miRNAs, revealing a complex network composed of both host and viral genes. GO enrichment analysis of host target genes suggests that PRV miRNAs are involved in complex cellular signaling pathways, including cell death, immune system processes, and metabolic pathways, indicating that these miRNAs play an important role in the virus-cell interaction of PRV and its play innkeepers. Taken together, these data suggest that a PRV-infected epithelial cell line produces a diverse set of host miRNAs and a specific cluster of viral miRNAs that might facilitate PRV replication in cells.",,"Wu, Y.

2290,Discovery of different rodent and bat pestiviruses with different genomic and phylogenetic features in several Chinese provinces,"Bats and rodents are widespread worldwide and may be native or intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a group of virus species in the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae that can infect a variety of Artiodactylus hosts, including swine and ruminants. Two classic types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild to severe disease in cattle and swine, respectively, causing enormous economic losses in these industries. Recent reports indicated that bats and rodents may also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses, and an atypical porcine pestivirus that causes disease in piglets showed a close genetic relationship to a specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different localities by analyzing the available bat and rodent viroma data from across China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species distinct from other known viruses have been identified and sequenced. These viruses have been identified in two bat species and four rodent species in different Chinese provinces. Two distinct lineages distinct from the Artiodactylus pestivirus were present in these viruses. These results advance our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest that a diverse group of pestiviruses are present in non-artiodactyl hosts. This study may provide new insights for the prevention of future outbreaks of viral diseases caused by bats and rodents.",,"Wu, Z.;Liu, B.;Du, J.;Zhang, J.;Lu, L.;Zhu, G.;Han, Y.;Su, H.;Yang, L.;Zhang, S.;Liu, Q.;Jin, Q.",2018.0,,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02562,0
2291,Decoding the bat virom catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases,"Studies have shown that approximately 60% to 80% of human emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) originate from wild animals. Bats are natural reservoirs of a wide variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause serious disease in humans and domestic animals. However, understanding of the virus population and the ecological diversity present in bat populations is unclear, making it difficult to determine the origin of specific EIDs. Using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was performed based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples from 4440 bat individuals from 40 large bat species across China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ecological and biological diversity of viruses found in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses, and to assess the public health impact of these viruses. The data obtained in this study provided an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses have been reported for the first time, and several bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens have been identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolutionary pattern of certain viruses, such as B. Corona viruses and noroviruses.

This study aimed to describe the range of bat vioma including mammalian, insect, fungal, plant and phage viruses in 11 insectivorous bat species (216 bats in total) distributed in six provinces of China. To analyze viromes, we used sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina). The viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons with known viruses. The mammalian viruses included those of Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Retroviridae, Circoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Astroviridae, Flaviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae and Parvovirinae; Insect viruses included those of the Baculoviridae, Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tetraviridae and Densovirinae; Fungal viruses included those of Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae and Totiviridae; and phage included those of Caudovirales, Inoviridae and Microviridae and unclassified phage. In addition to the viruses and phages associated with the insect, plant, and bacterial flora associated with feeding and colonization in bats, we identified the full or partial genome sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses. These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamyvirus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these novel viruses shared little genetic similarity to previously reported viruses. This study also showed high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces.

To identify viruses associated with bovine nonsuppurative encephalitis, we applied a viral metagenomics approach to a sample of 16 neurologically diseased cows. We have identified six virus candidates: parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5), bovine astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1), bovine polyomavirus 2 (BPyV-2 SF), ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), bovine herpesvirus 6 ( BHV-6) and a new bovine beta retrovirus designated BoRV-CH15. In a case-control study using PCR, BoAstV-CH13 (p=0.046), BoPV-2 SF (p=0.005), and BoHV-6 (p=4.3E-05) were statistically associated with the disease.

The disease resembles the common cold caused by rhinoviruses in humans; however, the presence of viremia during ERV-1 infection, the occurrence of persistent infections, and physical characteristics are all more reminiscent of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. cDNA cloning and sequencing of the ERV-1 and ERV-2 genomes between the poly(C) and poly(A) stretches showed that the serotypes are heterogeneous. Nevertheless, the genomic architecture of both serotypes is most similar to that of FMDV. Indeed, a comparison of the deduced protein sequences of ERV-1 shows that its identity is strongest to FMDV. In contrast, most ERV-2 proteins are more closely related to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) proteins than to FMDV or ERV-1. These results place ERV-1 along with FMDV in the aphthovirus genus of the picornavirus family and indicate that this virus can serve as a model system for studying the biology of FMDV.",,"Wutz, G.;Auer, H.;Nowotny, N.;Grosse, B.;Skern, T.;Kuechler, E.",1996.0,,,0

With a view to identifying host factors underlying EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, porcine, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing approach (RNA-seq). Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection by robust induction of extracellular growth factors. In addition, significant upregulation of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members FOS and JUN was observed in permissive cell lines. Functional studies focused on human cells showed that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of JUN and to a lesser extent FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity in human cells at 48 and 72 h post-infection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown decreases expression of EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study underscores the role of AP1 in promoting the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.<b>IMPORTANT</b> Many questions remain about the molecular events underlying filovirus pathophysiology. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as B. post-exposure therapeutics, is greatly enhanced by a thorough understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV may be possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically distinct cell lines (derived from human, pig and bat). We first identified the reaction pathways using an RNA-seq based transcriptomics approach. Further functional and computational analysis focused on human cells highlighted an important role of the AP1 transcription factor in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our study sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and promote the transcriptional landscape after viral infection.",,"Wynne, J.

2300,Molecular phylogenetic analysis of bovine viral diarrhea virus: A Bayesian approach,"Genetic typing of Bovine Virus Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is important for accurate classification of viruses. Traditionally, the derivation of BVDV phylogeny has been performed by a distance-based method, i.e., neighbor joining for single genes. In this study, a Bayesian approach was used to analyze five genetic regions of the BVDV genome (5'' UTR, Npro, E2a, E2b, and NS3) for 68 taxa retrieved from GenBank. The results showed that all taxa in the E2a consensus tree were correctly assigned to the appropriate groups, i.e. Type-2 BVDV and BVDV-1a, -1b, -1c, -1e and -1g, supported by a high posterior probability. In contrast, subgroup 1a formed polytomies in the consensus trees of 5″ UTR and NS3. Polytomies also appeared in subgroup 1b in the Npro and E2b consensus trees. Analysis of a combined dataset revealed a clear, well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis. The topologies found for each genetic region separately and combined were different, but the differences were mainly weakly supported by the data. Combining the data allowed the identification of well-supported strains of strains that correspond to some of the previously defined subgroups. Only a combined approach will allow the reliable placement of new strains in the current classification of viruses into genotype and subgenotype. © 2007 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Xia, H.;Liu, L.;Wahlberg, N.;Baule, C.;BelÃ¡k, S.",2007.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2007.05.017,0
2301,"Sequence analysis of Peste des petits ruminants virus from ibex in Xinjiang, China","Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an infectious disease caused by the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). While PPR primarily affects domestic goats and sheep, it also affects wild ungulates such as ibex, blue sheep, and gazelle, although there have been few reports of PPRV infection in wild animals. Between January 2015 and February 2015, wild ibex were first noted to be dying from PPRV infection in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China, where a total of 38 ibex (including young and adult ibex) were found to be abnormal with PPR-related issues. First, we tested for the presence of the F gene of PPRV by RT-PCR. We then compared the sequence of the isolated F gene from the ibex strain designated PPRV Xinjiang/Ibex/2015 to those previously identified from small domestic ruminants from local areas near where the reported isolate was found, as well as to those from other regions . The current sequence was classified phylogenetically as a lineage IV virus and shared a high degree of sequence identity (99.7%) with a previously described PPRV isolate from Xinjiang.",,"Xia, J.;Zheng, X.

2302,Transmission of Newcastle disease virus from poultry to wild birds in southern China's Guangdong province,"Despite intensive vaccination programs in many countries, including China, Newcastle disease has been reported sporadically and still poses a significant threat to the poultry industry in China. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is contagious to at least 250 species of birds, but the role of wild birds in virus epidemiology is still largely unknown. Fourteen NDV isolates were recovered from 2040 samples collected from wild birds or the environment in Guangdong Province, southern China, from 2013 to 2015. The isolation rate was highest during the period of overwintering and lowest during the periods of spring migration, nesting, and post-nesting. A phylogenetic analysis of maximum clade credibility found that at least four genotypes circulate in southern China: three class II genotypes (II, VI, and IX) and one class I (1b). We also showed that most isolates from wild birds were very similar to isolates from poultry and two isolates were associated with viruses from wild birds in northern China. These data suggested that wild birds could spread NDV and that poultry-borne viruses could spread to wild birds. Accordingly, vaccine development and poultry management strategies should be considered to prevent future NDV outbreaks, especially given the strength of the poultry industry in developing countries like China.",,"Xiang, B.;Han, L.;Gao, P.;You, R.;Wang, F.;Xiao, J.;Liao, M.;Kang, Y.;Ren, T.",2017.0,,10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.020,0

To investigate the presence and prevalence of PPV2 in the US, a novel TaqMan® real-time PCR method was developed and used for PPV2 screening using 483 lung samples, 185 fecal samples, and 122 sera collected from pigs collected from 295 farms in 18 US states. The overall prevalence of PPV2 was 20.7% (100/483) in lung samples and 7.6% (14/185) in faecal samples from pigs of different ages and 1.6% (2/122) in sera or thoracic fluids from newborn pigs . Further comparison of the genomic sequences showed that the 2011 US PPV2 sequences share 95.4-97.7% nucleotide identities with the 2006-2007 strains discovered in China, while the nucleotide identity with the 2001 strain discovered in Myanmar 94.7%, indicating continued evolution of the virus.

2305,Molecular evolutionary genetic analysis of emerging parvoviruses identified in pigs,"Parvoviruses infect a wide variety of vertebrates and arthropods and are associated with diverse clinical manifestations. Recently, due to the advent of new sequence-independent PCR methods and high-throughput sequencing, several new members of parvoviruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae have been described. Some of these viruses do not fit the current classification and others now have confusing or conflicting nomenclature, as two or more names have been used for similar or identical groups of parvoviruses, or identical names for different virus groups. In this study, recently described vertebrate parvoviruses were identified with a focus on those identified in pigs by phylogenetic analyzes based on the sequences of their complete or nearly complete genome, open reading frame (ORF) 1 (nonstructural protein, NS1), ORF2 (capsid protein, VP1), and ORF3 (nuclear phosphoprotein, NP1) genes using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Neighbor Joining (NJ) methods. Among all available vertebrate parvovirus sequences, eight different clades have been identified, corresponding to five well-established genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Denpendovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus. In addition, three new clades were identified and tentatively named PARV4-like virus, new clade 1 and new clade 2. Parvoviruses in pigs have been found to be distributed across four distinct clades including parvovirus, bocavirus, PARV4-like virus and the new clade 2. All porcine parvoviruses identified to date have been organized based on the current analysis. The present analysis will help to clarify the nomenclature of porcine parvoviruses and facilitate future uniform naming of new parvoviruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae. © 2013 Elsevier BV",,"Xiao, C.

2306,Identification and classification of endogenous bovine retroviruses,"The aim of this study was to identify the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences in a bovine genome. We subjected bovine genomic DNA to PCR with degenerate or ovine ERV (OERV) family-specific primers designed to amplify the retroviral Pro/Pol region. Sequence analysis of 113 clones obtained by PCR revealed that 69 were of retroviral origin. Based on the OERV classification system, these degenerate PCR clones could be classified into the β3, β4, and β9 families. PCR with family-specific OERV primers revealed an additional ERV that has been classified into the bovine endogenous retrovirus (BERV)-β7 family. Finally, we report here the results of a genome-wide study of BERV. Our study shows that the expansion of the ERV family in cattle may be somewhat limited, while more diverse family members of ERVs have been reported from other artiodactyls such as pigs and sheep.

2307,Understanding PRRSV infection in pig lungs based on the genome-wide transcriptome response identified by deep sequencing,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically significant diseases affecting the swine industry worldwide, causing large economic losses every year. PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates primarily in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia, and immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection are still poorly understood. Here we report the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to infection with classic North American PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a using the Solexa/Illumina digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based high-level transcriptome sequencing method throughput, and to systematically analyze the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV appears to employ multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including undermining the host's innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state, and developing ADE. Upregulated expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation likely led to the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression could be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused immune cells to become depleted and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they failed to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will help to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, develop novel antiviral therapies and identify genetic components for porcine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS. © 2010 Xiao et al.",,"Xiao, S.;Jia, J.;Mo, D.;Wang, Q.;Qin, L.;He, Z.;Zhao, X.;Huang, Y.;Li, A.;Yu, J.;Niu, Y.;Liu, X.;Chen, Y.",2010.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0011377,0
2308,Abnormal host immune response induced by highly virulent PRRSV identified by digital gene expression tag profiling,"Background: In 2006 and 2007, a large-scale outbreak of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) occurred in China and Vietnam, resulting in unusually high morbidity and mortality in pigs of all ages. The mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV) are still unknown. Therefore, the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after H-PRRSV infection and infection pathology was analyzed in this study using high-throughput deep sequencing and histopathology. Results: H-PRRSV infection resulted in severe pulmonary pathology. The results indicate that aberrant host innate immune responses to H-PRRSV and induction of an antiapoptotic state may be responsible for the aggressive replication and spread of H-PRRSV. Productive rapid replication of H-PRRSV may have elicited abnormal sustained expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in a highly robust inflammatory response amplified by significant cell death and increased oxidative damage. The end result was severe tissue damage and high pathogenicity. Conclusions: The systems analysis used in this study provides a comprehensive basis for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of H-PRRSV. In addition, it allows for the identification of the genetic components involved in H-PRRSV resistance/susceptibility in swine populations. © 2010 Xiao et al.; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Xiao, S.;Mo, D.;Wang, Q.;Jia, J.;Qin, L.;Yu, X.;Niu, Y.;Zhao, X.;Liu, X.;Chen, Y.",2010.0,,10.1186/1471-2164-11-544,0
2309,"Generation of an effective, stable, live attenuated Newcastle disease virus vaccine by reverse genetics based on a currently circulating, highly virulent Indonesian strain","Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can cause serious illness in chickens. Although NDV vaccines exist, reports of outbreaks in vaccinated chickens are common. In 2009-2010, despite intensive vaccination, NDV caused major outbreaks in commercial poultry farms in Indonesia. These outbreaks have raised concerns about the protective immunity of current vaccines against circulating virulent strains in Indonesia. In this study, we investigated whether a recombinant attenuated Indonesian NDV strain could provide better protection against prevalent Indonesian viruses. A reverse genetics system for the highly virulent NDV strain Banjarmasin/010/10 (Ban/010) isolated in Indonesia in 2010 was constructed. The Ban/010 virus is classified in genotype VII class II NDV, which is genetically distinct from the commercial vaccine strains B1 and LaSota, which belong to genotype II, and share only 89 and 87% amino acid identity for the protective antigens F and HN and A mutant virus called Ban/AF was engineered in which the virulent F protein cleavage site motif ""RRQKRâ†""F"" was modified by three amino acid substitutions (underlined) into an avirulent motif ""GRQGRâ†""L"". The Ban/AF vaccine virus did not produce syncytia or plaques in cell culture, even in the presence of added protease. Pathogenicity tests showed that Ban/AF was completely avirulent. Ban/AF replicated efficiently during 10 consecutive passages in chickens and remained genetically stable. Serological analysis showed that Ban/AF induced higher neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against the predominant viruses than commercial vaccines B1 or LaSota. Both Ban/AF and commercial vaccines provided protection against clinical morbidity and mortality following challenge with the virulent NDV strain Ban/010 (genotype VII) or GB Texas (genotype II). However, Ban/AF significantly reduced the shedding of challenge virus from the vaccinated birds compared to the B1 vaccine. These results suggest that Ban/AF may provide better protection than commercial vaccines and is a promising vaccine candidate against NDV strains circulating in Indonesia.",,"Xiao, S.;Nayak, B.;Samuel, A.;Paldurai, A.;Kanabagattebasavarajappa, M.;Prajitno, T.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-borne virus that causes huge economic losses in livestock industries worldwide. Aedes albopictus cell lines have become powerful and convenient tools for studying BTV-vector interactions. However, the role of miRNAs in A. albopictus cells during BTV infection is not well understood. In this study, we performed deep sequence analysis of small RNA libraries from BTV-infected and mock-infected A. albopictus cells and a total of 11,206,854 and 12,125,274 clean reads were identified, respectively. Differential expression analysis showed that 140 miRNAs, including 15 known and 125 novel miRNAs, were significantly dysregulated after infection and a total of 414 and 2307 target genes were annotated, respectively. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validated the expression patterns of 11 selected miRNAs and their mRNA targets. The functional annotation of the target genes suggested that these target genes were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, endocytosis, RNA transport, as well as FoxO, Hippo, Jak-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways. This is the first systematic study of the effect of BTV infection on miRNA expression in A. albopictus cells.

So far, seven PPV genotypes (PPV1 to PPV7) have been identified. PPV7, the most recently discovered PPV genotype, was first reported in US swine in 2016. To investigate PPV7 status in Chinese pig populations, a total of 64 serum samples collected from two commercial farms in Guangdong province in 2014 were analyzed. PPV7 DNA was detected in 32.8% (21/64) of the samples tested. On the porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) positive farm, the prevalence rate of PPV7 was 65.5% (19/29), which was significantly higher than that on the PCV2 negative farm (2/35, 5.7%) , suggesting a possible link between these PCV2 and PPV7 infections. The sequences of three PPV7 strains were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the identified PPV7 strains circulating in China share 98.7% to 99.7% nucleotide homology with the US strain. Further sequence comparison analysis showed that GD-2014-2 and GD-2014-3 possess a consecutive 9 nt deletion in the VP gene.

The result showed that the genotype of PERV distribution was subtype A, 100%; subtype B, 100%; and subtype C, 100%. The env sequences of PERV-A and -B revealed 11 clones detected by KpnI and MboI digestion, indicating that multiple variants of PERV-A and -B existed in the Ningxiang pig. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results showed that PERV had transcriptional activity in these individuals. In addition, PERV A/C was recombinantly detected in most individuals of Ningxiang pigs.

2315,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine bocaviruses transmitted by murine rodents and house shrews in China,"Bocaparvovirus infections of humans and both wild and domestic animals have been widely reported worldwide. In this study, we detected and genetically characterized porcine bocavirus (PBoV) transmitted by murine rodents (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, and Rattus loosea) and domestic shrews (Suncus murinus) in China. Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 murine rodents and 23 house shrews were caught in four Chinese provinces. The nested polymerase chain reaction was used to study the prevalence of PBoV in throat swab, stool and serum samples. A total of 7.5% (39/519) throat swab specimens, 60.5% (309/511) stool specimens, and 22.9% (52/227) serum specimens were PBoV positive. The prevalence in R. norvegicus and R. tanezumi was higher than in R. losea and house shrews. PBoV-positive samples were found in all four provinces. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial viral capsid protein 1/2 (VP1/VP2) showed that the sequences obtained in this study formed a new group (PBoV G4). In addition, five nearly full-length (4,715-4,798 nt) PBoV genomes were acquired. These genomes encoded two nonstructural proteins, NS1 (1,908 nt in four genomes and 1,923 nt in the remaining genome) and NP1 (600 nt), and the structural proteins VP1/VP2 (1,851 nt). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBoV G4 is distinct from rodent, human, and other bocaviruses. In conclusion, the prevalence of PBoV G4 in two common murine rodents in China was high and the pathogenicity of PBoV G4 needs to be further clarified.",,"Xiong, Y. Q.;You, F. F.;Chen, X. J.;Chen, Y.

2316,Metagenomic analysis of the faecal microbiome of Rhinopithecus bieti reveals a wide variety of bacterial and glycoside hydrolase profiles associated with lignocellulose degradation,"BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal tract of animals contains a complex community of microbes whose composition ultimately reflects the coevolution of microorganisms with their animal host and the diet adopted by the host. Although the importance of the human gut microbiota has been well established, there is a lack of research on non-human primates (NHPs), particularly herbivorous NHPs. RESULTS: In this study, an analysis of 97,942 pyrosequencing reads generated from Rhinopithecus bieti fecal DNA extracts was performed to provide a better understanding of the microbial diversity and functional capacity of the Rhinopithecus bieti gut microbiome. Taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic reads revealed that the faecal microbiomes of R. bieti were dominated by strains Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The comparative analysis of the taxonomic classification revealed that the metagenome of R. bieti was characterized by an overrepresentation of bacteria of the phyla Fibrobacteres and Spirochaetes compared to other animals. Primary functional categories have been mainly associated with protein, carbohydrate, amino acids, DNA and RNA metabolism, cofactors, cell wall and capsule and membrane transport. Comparing the glycoside hydrolase profiles of R. bieti with those of other animals revealed that the R. bieti microbiome was most closely related to the cow rumen. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic and functional analyzes revealed that R. bieti possesses a broad bacterial diversity and numerous glycoside hydrolases responsible for lignocellulosic biomass degradation, which may reflect the adaptations associated with a high-fiber diet. These results would add to the limited number of NHPs metagenome studies and provide a unique genetic resource of plant cell wall degrading microbial enzymes. However, future studies of R. bieti metagenome sequencing regarding the effects of age, genetics, diet, and environment on metagenome composition and activity are needed.",,"Xu, B.;Xu, W.;Li, J.;Dai, L.;Xiong, C.;Tang, X.;Yang, Y.;Mu, Y.;Zhou, J.;Ding, J.;Wu, Q.;Huang, Z.",2015.0,,10.1186/s12864-015-1378-7,0
2317,Hybrid DNA virus in Chinese patients with seronegative hepatitis detected by deep sequencing,"Seronegative hepatitis—non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis—is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. Between 1999 and 2007, we collected 92 serum samples from patients with non-AE hepatitis in Chongqing, China. Ten serum pools were screened using Solexa deep sequencing. We detected a 3,780 bp contig present in all 10 pools, yielding BLASTx E scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the 3,780 bp contig assembled in silico was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions across most of the genome, and the virus was tentatively named NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two main ORFs. For protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the bat circovirus replication-associated protein and the porcine parvovirus capsid protein, respectively. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that NIH-CQV is localized at the interface of Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. The prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70%) were positive, but all of 45 healthy controls were negative. The mean viral titer in patient samples was 1.05 e4 copies/microliter. Using an immunoblot, specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were searched for. 84% of patients were positive for IgG and 31% were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78% of the healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiological role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-AE hepatitis.",,"Xu, B.;Zhi, N.;Hu, G.;Wan, Z.;Zheng, X.;Liu, X.;Wong, S.;Kajigaya, S.;Zhao, K.;Mao, Q.;Young, N.

2319,Transcriptome analysis of HepG2 cells expressing orf3 from porcine hepatitis e virus to determine the effects of ORF3 on host cells,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV)-mediated hepatitis has become a global public health problem. A key HEV regulatory protein, ORF3, affects multiple signaling pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the function of ORF3 from porcine HEV (SHEV), a high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screen was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated with quantitative real-time PCR and differentially expressed genes were assigned to functional categories using gene ontology. The results showed that in the established ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB and FREM1 were upregulated, while mRNA levels of SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2 , and PTGR1 were downregulated. Deregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 could contribute to changes in integral membrane protein and basement membrane protein expression, expression changes for NLRP1 could affect apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3, and DKK1 could affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In summary, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane proteins and basement membrane proteins and altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells.

In addition, phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that five gene segments (NS, NP, PB2, PB1, PA) of the isolate were closely related to the new reassortant H1N2 viruses isolated in China in 2006, while the other three (HA, NA, M) were closely related to avian H1N1 viruses in China.

The VP2 gene sequences of nine newly isolated IBDVs obtained using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were determined and compared to worldwide reference isolates that were previously well characterized. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nine broiler IBDV isolates are closely related to very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of VP2 from the nine vvIBDVs isolated from the broilers revealed that they share 99.2 to 100% sequence similarity. In addition, amino acids A222, I242, I256, I294 and S299 of VP2, which are conserved among previously characterized vvIBDV strains, are also encoded by the nine isolates.

A total of 11 commercial and 1 non-commercial (backyard) farms were infected before the outbreak ended. Control measures included movement restrictions imposed on a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were within a 3km radius of infected premises (IP). A full epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of this HPAI H5N2 virus for 4 of the commercial IPs and the single non-commercial IP likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three IPs were associated with movement of birds or service providers and the remaining 4 IPs were suspected to have local/environmental spread as a source of infection. Viral phylogenies determined by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods were used to validate the epidemiologically derived transmission network.

Two H9N2 viruses were isolated from a mink farm in 2014. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the internal genes of the H9N2 viruses are closely related to those of the H7N9 viruses. Interestingly, two H9N2 were separated in pedigrees, indicating that they were introduced to this mink farm in two independent events. And further studies in mice showed that one H9N2 caused apparent weight loss and 20% mortality in infected mice, while another virus caused no clinical signs in mice infected with the same dose. Genetic analyzes showed that the virulent H9N2 contains a natural mutation at 701N in the PB2 protein that has been reported to contribute to mammalian adaptation. However, such a substitution is absent in H9N2, which is avirulent to mice. Circulating H9N2 in mink can trigger the virus to adapt to mammals; continuous surveillance of influenza virus in mink was warranted.",,"Xue, R.;Tian, Y.;Hou, T.;Bao, D.;Chen, H.;Teng, Q.;Yang, J.;Li, X.;Wang, G.;Li, Z.;Liu, Q.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12805,0

The present study was an attempt to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of H9N2-AIVs in two geographically distinct regions of China where vaccination is routinely practiced. A total of 18 new H9N2 isolates were identified and genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes confirmed that the isolates belonged to the Y280 lineage. Based on the HA genes, the isolates were divided into two subgroups. The viruses from Zhejiang Province were grouped into Group I, while the isolates from Guangdong Province were grouped into Group II. The antigenic characterization showed that the tested viruses differed antigenically compared to the currently used vaccine strain. It was notable that 14 out of a total of 18 isolates had an amino acid substitution (Q?L) at position 216 (226 by H3 numbering) in the receptor binding site, suggesting that the virus had potential affinity for binding to human-like receptors. These results suggest that the emerging viruses pose a potential risk to public health than previously thought.

Phylogenetic analysis of the RT-PCR fragments amplified from the isolates revealed the presence of viruses belonging to BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV1c, unclassified BVDV1 genotypes and BVDV2. From cattle of Australian origin, 16 out of 17 isolates were classified as BVDV1c. This result was consistent with a report showing that BVDV1c was a predominant subgenotype in Australia. Both BVDV1 and BVDV2 species have been found in cattle of North American origin. BVDV2 from North American cattle was identified as the same cluster as strain BVDV 890, which is the prototype of BVDV2. These results suggest that the BVDVs isolated from exported cattle at AQS reflect the predominant genotypes of BVDVs found in the exporting countries. The unclassified BVDV1 genotype of Chinese origin was in the same cluster as the ZM-95 strain isolated from pigs in China.

However, the characteristics of domestic hepatitis E infections in Japan are not yet fully understood. We analyzed serum samples from 34 patients examined between January 1997 and December 2002 at a municipal hospital in Sendai, Japan, who were diagnosed with sporadic acute hepatitis of non-A, non-B, non-C etiology . Of these 34 patients, 3 (9%; all males; aged 54, 59 and 61 years) were positive for both IgG and IgM anti-HEV antibodies and for HEV RNA. The HEV isolates obtained from case 1 and case 3 (HE-JAS1 and HE-JAS3) segregated in genotype III; they had the highest nucleotide sequence identity of 99.5% and 99.0% with HE-JA7 and HE-JA8, respectively, both of which were isolated in Iwate, a neighboring prefecture of Sendai. In contrast, the remaining HEV isolate (HE-JAS2) obtained from case 2 segregated in genotype IV; it had the highest nucleotide sequence identity of 99.8% and 99.3% with JKK-Sap and HE-JA3, respectively, both of which had been isolated in Hokkaido, Japan, although Case 2 had never been to Hokkaido. Our three patients with hepatitis E had not traveled abroad in the previous year, had no contact with pigs and had no history of blood transfusions. These results indicate that HEV should be considered as an etiological agent of acute hepatitis with non-A, non-B, non-C etiology in Japan.

From the second week after cohabitation, severe atrophy of Fabricius' bursa was observed in non-immunized sentinel chickens. However, atrophy was observed in immunized sentinel chickens and broilers from the third week after cohabitation. The IBD virus (IBDV) isolated from the Fabricius bursa of immunized sentinel chickens, designated strain IBDV TY2, showed severe bursal atrophy in infected SPF chickens. Antiserum against IBDV TY2 strain showed higher neutralizing activity against heterologous IBDV strains than antiserum against K strain vaccine virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequences encoding the hypervariable region of viral protein 2 of the IBDV TY2 strain did not aggregate with the classic, variant, or very virulent IBDV groups. Based on these results, we propose that the IBDV TY2 strain may represent a new variant type of IBDV.",,"Yamazaki, K.;Ohta, H.;Kawai, T.;Yamaguchi, T.;Obi, T.;Takase, K.",2017.0,,10.1292/jvms.16-0301,0

The pathogenic properties of seven IBV strains were evaluated. Each of the seven strains was infectious to the test chickens and could elicit an immune response. The results of the cross-neutralization tests with chick embryos showed that these strains differed antigenically from the classic IBV strains of H120, M41, Conn and Gray. Compared to the H120 vaccine strain, point mutations, short insertions and deletion occurred at many positions in the S1 protein of the seven strains. Five of the seven strains had the motif (HRRRR) identical to that of the epidemic IBV strains in China. Two new motifs (HRLRR and RRIRR) emerged in the isolated strains. The homology of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the S1 gene between the seven isolates was 81.7%-99.7% and 79.0%-99.4%, respectively. These seven strains were also genetically distinct from the vaccine and non-Chinese IBV strains, but were closely related to a large number of Chinese strains. The seven isolates and 36 IBV reference strains were divided into six different groups (IVI). The seven strains were grouped into Groups I, II and III, forming a large phylogenetic branch closely related to Chinese IBV, while the vaccine strains belonging to Group VI are genetically distant from Groups I, II and III.

2333,Failed detection of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus 2 subgenotype a (BVDV-2a) by direct fluorescent antibody test on tissue specimens due to reduced reactivity of field isolates to crude anti-BVDV antibody,"Bovine virus diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is associated with mild or subclinical infections, while BVDV-2 is commonly associated with outbreaks of severe thrombocytopenia and acute fatal illness. In the present study, the carcass of a beef breed cow and tissue samples from a beef calf were obtained for laboratory diagnostics. Both animals presented severe clinical signs consistent with thrombocytopenia or hemorrhagic syndrome. In both cases, the direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) could not detect any BVDV antigen in the tissue samples. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed the presence of BVDV antigen in the oral and esophageal mucosa and Peyer's patches of the pedigree cattle. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detected BVDV-2 in selected tissues of both animals. Subsequently, BVDV was isolated from both cases and subjected to genetic and serological characterizations. Mutations in the primer and probe binding sites of the 5'-untranslated genomic region (5'-UTR) and in the E2 gene were associated with reduced efficiency of an established real-time RT-PCR assay and amino acid changes in the E2 glycoprotein, respectively. Both virus isolates were classified as BVDV-2 subgenotype a using real-time RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis. In contrast to the BVDV reference strains Singer and 125c, the isolates cross-reacted with anti-BVDV-1 and anti-BVDV-2 reference sera, indicating antigenic variation in field isolates. The isolates also showed reduced reactivity to swine anti-BVDV antiserum (the crude serum used to make BVDV-DFA conjugate). In summary, the data from the present study suggest that genetic and antigenic variations impair the performance of detection assays, particularly DFAT, underscoring the need for regular evaluation and modification of BVDV tests.",,"Yan, L.;Pace, L.

2334,Genome-wide identification of copy number variations between two chicken lines differing in genetic resistance to Marek's disease,"BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV) is a major source of genomic polymorphism that directly contributes to phenotypic variations such as infectious disease resistance. Lines 63 and 72 are two highly inbred experimental chicken lines that differ greatly in susceptibility to Marek's disease (MD) and have been used extensively to identify the genetic and molecular basis for genetic resistance to MD. Using next-generation sequencing, we present a genome-wide assessment of CNVs potentially associated with genetic resistance to MD. METHODS: Three chickens selected at random from each line were sequenced to an average depth of 20x. Two popular software, CNVnator and Pindel, were used to name genomic CNVs separately. The results were combined to obtain a pooled set of genomic CNVs in the two chicken lines. RESULTS: After merging the two datasets, a total of 5,680 CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified, of which 1,546 and 1,866 were specific to the MD-resistant and -susceptible lineage, respectively. More than half of the line-specific CNVRs were shared by 2 or more chickens, reflecting reduced diversity in both inbred lines. The CNVRs fixed in the susceptible lines were significantly enriched in genes involved in MAPK signaling. We also found 67 CNVRs that overlap with 62 genes previously shown to be strong candidates for the underlying genes responsible for susceptibility to MD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insights into the genetic architecture of the two chicken lines and additional evidence that MAPK signaling may play an important role in the host response to MD virus infection. The rich source of lineage-specific CNVs is valuable for future disease-related association studies in the two chicken lines.",,"Yan, Y.;Yang, N.;Cheng, H.

The identity of the M segment in these viruses is remarkably low, although previous investigators reported that the small RNA segments are highly conserved. Since the M segment encodes the viral surface glycoproteins G1 and G2, the variability of the M segment can affect the antigenicity of these viruses.

The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 had multiple amino acid sequences (-PEIPKGRG-) at the junction peptide between HA1 and HA2, which is considered to be a molecular characteristic of low pathogenicity. The key host marker sites among the genes (M, NP, NS, PA and PB2) of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 were similar to those of H5N1 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genes (M, NS and PB2) of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 were closely clustered with those of Gs/Guangdong/1996/H5N1 (Gs/GD/96), implying that three ancient genes of Gs/GD/96-like viruses were circulating in central China in the 1980s. When challenged experimentally, Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 was weakly pathogenic to chickens and mice, consistent with the molecular characteristics of the HA gene.",,"Yang, J. L.;Xia, H.;Zhao, J. R.;He, X.

High-throughput nucleotide sequencing was performed to study bacterial communities in leachate from pig carcass decomposition. We acquired 51,230 reads from six different specimens (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 14 week old carcasses) and found that sequences representing phylum Firmicutes predominated. Diversity of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences in leachate was highest at 6 weeks, in contrast to those at 2 and 14 weeks. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was reduced while the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria increased from 3-6 weeks. Strains were restored after 14 weeks. However, the community structures between the 1-2 and 14 week samples differed at the bacterial classification level. The pH trend was similar to changes observed in bacterial communities, suggesting that leachate pH may be related to the shift in the microbial community. The results indicate that the composition of bacterial communities in the leachate from decomposing pig carcasses changes continuously during the study period and is possibly influenced by the burial site.",,"Yang, S.

2349,Next-generation sequencing enables the discovery of more diverse positive clones from a phage-displayed antibody library,"Phage display technology provides a powerful tool to search a library for a binding molecule via an enrichment process. It has been adopted as a crucial technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major disadvantage of phage display technology is that it often results in a limited number of clones as the level of enrichment cannot be controlled during the bio-panning process. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether NGS can identify a larger number of clones than traditional methods. Three chicken variable single chain fragment (scFv) libraries were bio-panned for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS and the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were set. The entire scFv gene was then obtained by two-stage linker PCR and cloning and analyzed for its reactivity towards PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening procedure was performed for comparison. The scFv clones recovered from the NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method plus many additional clones. Enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the biopanning process was a positive predictor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",,"Yang, W.;Yoon, A.;Lee, S.;Kim, S.;Han, J.;Chung, J.",2017.0,03 24,,0

2352,MicroRNA transcriptome analysis in chick kidneys in response to various virulent infectious bronchitis virus infections,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can cause a highly contagious and acute respiratory disease in poultry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of critical regulators of gene expression and are involved in the regulation of viral defense and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed to compare the small RNA libraries from the kidneys of SCK2, SCDY2, and LDT3-A infected chickens. By comparing this data to healthy chickens, a total of 58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. The DE miRNAs were further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up or down regulation compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, it was shown that the DE miRNAs are mainly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activities, gene expression, binding activities, and immune responses. Seven highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538 and gga-miR-2954 ) were selected for joint miRNA-mRNA analysis. Furthermore, the miRNAs inversely correlated with the corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs have been hypothesized to play important roles in IBV-host interactions and differential virulence of IBV strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent IBVs induces differential expression of miRNAs in chick kidneys; this expression also appears to be related to the virulence of IBV. These results are important for studying miRNA-mediated immune responses to infection with various virulent IBVs, as well as the interaction between the chicken host and IBV.",,"Yang, X.;Gao, W.;Liu, H.;Li, J.;Chen, D.;Yuan, F.;Zhang, Z.;Wang, H.",2017.0,,10.1007/s00705-017-3502-2,0

This virus poses a significant potential threat to humans and poultry due to its global distribution and infectivity. We used three overlapping polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to map the entire AGV2 genome. We then modeled the evolutionary history of this novel sequence data in the context of related sequences from GenBank. We analyzed the viral protein properties of the different phylogenetic groups and examined differences in evolutionary trends between Chinese strains and strains from other countries. We obtained 17 avian-derived AGV2 whole genomes from different regions of China from 2015 to 2016. Phylogenetic analyzes of these Chinese AGV2 sequences and related sequences revealed four distinct groups (AD) with significant bootstrap values. We have also constructed phylogenies using predicted viral protein sequences. We found a potential hypervariable region in VP1 at positions 288-314 and we identified the amino acid changes responsible for the different VP2 and VP3 groups. Three new motifs in the AGV2 5'-UTR Direct Repeat (DR) region were discovered and grouped.

2354,Isolation of a new serotype strain of the infectious bronchitis virus ZZ2004 from ducks in China,"In chickens, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) often causes respiratory distress, a decrease in egg production, poor egg quality, and occasionally nephritis. However, ZZ2004, a Chinese IBV isolate, was obtained from ducks with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms raised with hens in central China. Virus isolation, virus neutralization assays, and RT-PCR were used to identify the causative pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variation of the S1 subunit and the M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV due to the appearance of a dwarf phenotype and death of the embryos between 48 and 144 h after vaccination. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results of the virus neutralization test showed that the strains of JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with the ZZ2004 isolate, and hardly any cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 was observed with the strains of M41, H120, Grau, Holte or Aust-T. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were major differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains in the S1 subunit. Meanwhile, the homologies in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of M gene of IBV ZZ2004 were 86.9-92.0% and 91.1-93.9%, respectively, compared to 35 other IBV reference strains originating from different regions. This result showed that there were striking variations between the selected strains. In addition, the results showed that the predominant IBV strains in ducks had no antigen homology with the vaccine strains widely used in China other than the LDT3 strain, urging the research and development of new IBV vaccines.",,"Yao, S.;Ou, C.;Liu, X.;Wang, X.;Yao, Z.;Liu, J.",2016.0,,10.1007/s11262-016-1352-8,0
2355,Isolation and characterization of a native avirulent strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2: a perspective for vaccine development,"Streptococcus suis, an emerging infectious agent, is the cause of two large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in China and has attracted much attention from the scientific community. The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains enigmatic and no effective preventive measures have been established. To better understand the virulence differentiation of S. suis and to develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent S. suis strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from attack by virulent strains. Comparative genomic analyzes revealed the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K pathogenicity island. Lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in porcine whole blood. Further investigation revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68 that was hypothesized to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of S. suis and led to biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent S. suis strains.",,"Yao, X.;Li, M.;Wang, J.;Wang, C.;Hu, D.;Zheng, F.;Pan, X.;Tan, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Hu, L.;Tang, J.;Hu, F.",2015.0,,10.1038/srep09835,0

Unlike most Mardivirus-encoded miRNAs, DEV-encoded miRNAs map primarily to the unique long region of the genome. The progenitors of DEV miR-D18 and miR-D19 overlapped, suggesting similarities to miRNA offset RNAs, although only DEV-miR-D18-3p was functional in reporter assays.

2357,Relationship of SARS-CoV to other pathogenic RNA viruses examined by tetranucleotide usage profiling,"BACKGROUND: The exact origin of the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still an open question. The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses from different families was examined using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches started with vectorial profiling of the tetranucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In the first approach, a distance measure of a vector V based on a correlation coefficient was developed to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor joining algorithm. In approach two, multivariate factor analysis was performed to infer embedded tetranucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were then used to classify the selected viruses. RESULTS: Both approaches yielded relationship results consistent with known virus classification. They also showed that the genomes of RNA viruses of the same family conform to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of overall tetranucleotide usage patterns, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGV) and feline corona virus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly, the RNA viruses that do not progress through a DNA stage showed remarkable discrimination against the CpG and UpA dinucleotide (z = -77.31 and -52.48, respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65, 79 and 49.99 respectively). . Possible factors influencing these biases are discussed. CONCLUSION: Studying genomic word usage is a powerful tool for classifying RNA viruses. The agreement of the relationship results with the known classification indicates that there are phylogenetic signals in the tetranucleotide usage patterns that are most evident in the open reading frames of the replicates.",,"Yap, Y.

2358,Frequency of D222G and Q223R hemagglutinin mutants of the 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus in Japan between 2009 and 2010,"Background: In April 2009, a novel swine-derived influenza A virus (H1N1pdm) emerged and spread rapidly around the world, including Japan. It has been suggested that the virus can bind to both 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors in infected mammals, in contrast to contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses which have a preference for 2,6-linked sialic acid. Methods/Results: To elucidate the existence and transmissibility of α2,3-sialic acid-specific viruses in H1N1pdm, amino acid substitutions within viral hemagglutinin molecules, specifically D187E, D222G, and Q223R, that are associated with a shift from human to avian receptor specificity were investigated. Samples from people infected during the first and second waves of the outbreak in Japan were examined using a high-throughput sequencing approach. In May 2009, three samples from mild cases showed D222G and/or Q223R substitutions in a small subpopulation of viruses infecting these individuals. However, in samples from five mild cases in December 2010, the substitutions almost completely disappeared. The D187E substitution was not prevalent in the samples, even as of May 2009. Conclusions: These results suggest that α2,3-sialic acid-specific viruses, including G222 and R223, are more prevalent in humans than a smaller population in the early phase of the pandemic existed, and that D222 and Q223 became more dominant through human-to-human transmission during the first and second waves of the epidemic.

Molecular biological and phylogenetic analyzes were carried out with a view to determining a possible geographic origin of the strains, the phylogenetic similarity of viruses and the assessment of their pathogenicity, risk of disease in humans and possible resistance to antiviral drugs. It was found that the virus was one of the highly pathogenic variants that arose in China as a result of the rearrangement of genotype Z and V viruses circulating in poultry and wild birds. A number of molecular markers characterizing the high pathogenicity of the virus for gallinaceous birds and mammals were uncovered, but the specific mutations in the hemagglutinin gene, which promote the high virus replication rate in the human organism, and the adaptation mutations to it were not found.

Species transferability and pathogenicity. H9N2 viruses containing such internal genes are widespread in poultry but are rarely reported in migratory birds. In this study, two strains of the H9N2 virus were isolated from faecal samples from migratory birds in 2014: one from Lake Caizi in Anhui Province and one from Lake Chen in Hubei Province in China. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed high homology of all six internal genes of these two strains with the internal genes of human H10N8 virus in Jiangxi Province as well as human H7N9 virus. Phylogenetic analyzes indicated a possible origin of these two strains of fowl in southern China. Both of the two viruses tested could be replicated in the respiratory organs of infective mice without adaptation by either strain of wild bird H9N2 AIVs, indicating their potential ability to directly infect mammals. Our results indicate the existence of H9N2 viruses that contain internal genes that are highly homologous to human H10N8 or H7N9 viruses. Wild birds can contribute to the spread of the H9N2 virus, which contains the ""harmful"" internal gene complex, resulting in gene rearrangement with other influenza viruses and the creation of new pathogenic viruses. Therefore, increased AIV surveillance in wild birds can advance the understanding of virus presence and prevalence and provide scientific evidence for the prevention and control of AIVs and human-infecting AIVs.",,"Ye, G.;Liang, C.

The aim of this study was to detect the presence of new signatures that can serve as early warning indicators for the conversion of LPAI viruses into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI). This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 virus isolated from live poultry imported to Singapore under the national Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) surveillance program. Based on the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) molecular criterion, sequence analysis using the translated amino acid (aa) sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed the absence of multibasic aa at the HA cleavage site, thereby identifying all four virus isolates as LPAI. Detailed phylogenetic tree analysis using the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes grouped these isolates in the Eurasian H5 lineage but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes. This analysis further revealed that the internal genes were concentrated in different avian and swine subtypes, suggesting that the four isolates may share ancestry with these different influenza subtypes. Our results indicate that the four LPAI isolates in this study contained mostly avian signatures, and the phylogenetic tree for the internal genes further suggests the potential for regrouping with other distinct circulating avian subtypes.

According to preliminary reports in 2015 from German and African cattle, a wide spread of bovine hepacivirus (BovHepV, Hepacivirus N) has been suggested. We investigated the possible presence of BovHepV in bovine serum samples from different locations in Turkey.

BovHepV infection was detected at 6 out of 10 sites included in the study. There were positive samples from both the east and west of the country, indicating a possible widespread distribution in the Turkish cattle population. Phylogenetic analysis of 9 selected positive samples clearly assigned 8 sequences to a separate cluster based on the NS3 gene region, while one of the sequences obtained from an imported animal from northern Italy was grouped with sequences obtained from cattle in Germany became. The latter finding could indicate a possible occurrence of this genetic group of BovHepV not only in Germany but also in other European countries. The results of the present study indicate the presence of BovHepV infections in Turkey and the Middle East.",,"Yesilbag, K.;Baechlein, C.;Kadiroglu, B.;Toker, E.

2365,Detection and genetic characterization of feline bocavirus in Northeast China,"Background: Bocaviruses have been reported to cause respiratory infections and gastroenteritis in most animal species. Different genotype bocaviruses have been identified in cats in the US, Japan, Hong Kong and Portugal. However, the clear association between clinical symptoms and FBoV infection is unknown, and the prevalence of FBoV and the distribution of FBoV genotypes in China are still unclear. Results: In this study, 197 fecal samples from cats with diarrhea (n = 105) and healthy cats (n = 92) were collected in different regions between January 2016 and November 2017 and analyzed for different FBoV genotypes using PCR. The screening results showed that 51 out of 197 specimens (25.9%) were positive for FBoV, and a higher positive rate was observed in cats with diarrhea (33.3%, 35/105) than in healthy cats (17, 4%, 16/92). Of these FBoV-positive specimens, 35 were identified as FBoV-1, 12 as FBoV-2, and 4 as co-infection of FBoV-1 and FBoV-2. A phylogenetic analysis based on a partial NS1 gene showed that 24 sequences from randomly selected FBoV-positive samples were classified into 2 different FBoV groups: FBoV-1 and FBoV-2. In addition, 6 strains were randomly selected and the complete genome was sequenced and analyzed. These strains showed the typical Bocavirus genome organization and were closely related to FBoV. Two FBoV-2 identified strains shared high homologies with FBoV-2 reference strains based on full genome and entire encoding gene, but lower identities were found in the NP1 and VP1 regions for the other 4 FBoV-1 identified strains Reference strains shown in comparison to FBoV-1. Conclusion: These results indicate that genetically distinct FBoV-1 and FBoV-2 are widespread in cats in Northeast China and that FBoV-1 is more common. The high prevalence of FBoV in cats with symptoms of diarrhea suggests that FBoV infection may be associated with diarrhea in cats.",,"Yi, S. S.;Niu, J. T.;Wang, H. L.;Dong, G. Y.;Zhao, Y.

2366,Novel highly divergent sapoviruses discovered by metagenomic analysis in straw-colored fruit bats in Cameroon,"Sapoviruses (SaVs) belong to the genus Sapovirus in the family Caliciviridae. They have been linked to gastroenteritis in humans and pigs, but not in other animals. In addition, some strains of pigs, chimpanzees, and rodents show close sequence identity with human SaVs, suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission. Bats are known to be a major reservoir of zoonotic viruses, however very little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats. To examine the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, fecal samples from Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were treated according to the NetoVIR protocol and sequenced using Illumina technology. Near-complete genomic sequences of six highly divergent SaVs and one partial SaV (only VP1 region) have been identified in Eidolon helvum and based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis they may represent two new genogroups only distantly related to known SaVs. In addition, comparison of these sequences with currently used screening primers and probes indicated that the new SaVs would not be detected in routine human epidemiological screening studies should transmission between species occur. Therefore, we designed and validated new primers that can recognize both human and bat SaVs. In this study, we identified several novel bat SaVs, however, further human epidemiological studies are needed to uncover their potential role in gastroenteritis.",,"Yinda, C.

2367,"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor diverse viruses including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses that use an alternative genetic code","Most infectious diseases affecting humans originate from wild animals, and bats are an important reservoir of viruses, some of which are highly pathogenic to humans. In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between humans and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomic screened eighty-seven fecal samples from Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results revealed a wealth of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyzes of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome revealed clearly distinct clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, indicating no recent interspecies transmission. In addition, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a new group of recently described viruses related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirmed their recombinant nature, and provided further evidence of additional recombination events between bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analysis suggested that they may have a lifestyle similar to that of mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to live they infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although the identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses form putative new genera in their respective families. Finally, the results of the phage community analyzes of these bats indicate a highly diverse, geographically distinct bat phage population, likely reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems.",,"Yinda, C.

2368,Phylogenetic evidence for intertypic recombination in the emergence of human enterovirus 71 subgenotypes,"Background: Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, the virus has caused multiple outbreaks with many fatalities and severe neurological complications. Several new EV-71 subgenotypes were identified in these outbreaks. The mechanisms that contributed to the emergence of these subgenotypes are unknown. Results: Six EV-71 isolates from a 1997 outbreak in Malaysia were fully sequenced. These isolates have been identified as EV-71 subgenotypes B3, B4 and C2. Using these complete genome sequences and all other available EV-71 and human enterovirus A (HEV-A) complete genome sequences, a pedigree was constructed that correlated well with the present enterovirus classification scheme. However, using the 5-inch UTR, P2, and P3 genomic regions, isolates of EV-71 subgenotypes B3 and C4 separated from other EV-71 subgenotypes in a cluster along with coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16/ G10) and EV-71 subgenotype C2 clustered with CV-A8. The results of the similarity plot analyzes supported the clustering of these isolates with other HEV-A. In contrast, a CV-A16 isolate, Tainan5079, was clustered with EV-71 in the same genomic regions. This suggests that only the structural genes were conserved among EV-71 and CV-A16. The 3-inch end of the viral genome varied and consisted of sequences very similar to those of various HEV-A viruses. Numerous recombination crossover breakpoints have been identified within the nonstructural genes of some of these newer EV-71 subgenotypes. Conclusion: Phylogenetic evidence from full genome sequence analyzes supports the possible occurrence of intertypic recombination involving EV-71 and various HEV-A, including CV-A16, the most common causative agent of HFMD. It is hypothesized that these recombination events played an important role in the emergence of the different EV-71 subgenotypes. © 2006 Yoke-Fun and AbuBakar; Licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Yoke-Fun, C.;AbuBakar, S.",2006.0,,10.1186/1471-2180-6-74,0
2369,Tracing the genetic history of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses derived from the complete ORF 5-7 sequences: A Bayesian coalescing approach,"To trace the genetic history of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), we determined the complete sequences of ORFs 5 to 7 from four PRRSV isolates. These sequences were analyzed along with published sequences from 146 isolates from different parts of the world using a Bayesian coalescence approach, Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. All European-type (EU-type) viruses were classified into one of two groups or unclassified (4 isolates), while all North American-type (NA-type) viruses belonged to one of three main groups or were unclassified (5 isolates) . No apparent periodic and/or geographic influence on the development of PRRSVs was observed within each genotype. The evolution rate of PRRSV isolates was estimated at 1.55 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year and the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was 491.2 years ago. Here the TMRCA for the EU and NA type viruses was 58.7 and 62.6 years ago, respectively. A Bayesian skyline plot showed that the viruses evolved at a nearly constant population size until the late 1970s, when they experienced a population expansion that lasted until the late 1980s. The population size then remained constant again until the early 2000s, when there was a rapid, sharp decline in the effective number of infections. © 2012 Springer Verlag.",,"Yoon, S.

2370,Phylogenomics and molecular evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus,"This report describes the use of Bayesian methods to analyze polyprotein coding region sequences (n=217) obtained from GenBank to define the genome-wide phylogeny of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD). The results strongly supported the monophyly of five FMDV serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C and SAT 3, while the sequences for the two remaining FMDV serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2, did not segregate into completely distinct clades. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister group relationships, serotype O + Asia 1, A + C and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SA 1, 2 , 3)}. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species impact on global foot-and-mouth disease virus evolution. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these sequences provided evidence for the influence of purification selection on the evolution of FMD. Using a Bayesian coalescence approach, the evolution rate of FMD isolates circulating in the years 1932-2007 has been estimated at 1.46 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year, and the virus's most recent common ancestor existed about 481 years ago years . The Bayesian skyline diagram showed an increase in population in the early 20th century followed by a rapid decline in population size from the late 20th century to the present. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms affecting the evolution of this important livestock pathogen. © 2011 KSMCB.",,"Yoon, S. H.;Park, W.;King, D.

2371,Polymerase chain reaction-based genetic typing of Japanese viruses of swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSVs) are divided into 2 different genotypes: the North American type and the European type. The Japanese PRRSVs were genotyped by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the reported primer pairs reactive for either both types, specific for the North American type, or specific for the European type. All PRRSV genomes from 66 tissue homogenates or sera and 55 infectious viruses were North American-type, whereas no European-type viral genome was detected. Two North American type specific PCR primers showed different detection efficiencies. Half of the tissue samples and 15% of the infectious virus were not detected with one primer pair, although all were detected with the other primer pair. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the forward and reverse primer binding sites of the non-reactive viruses showed that all of these viruses had nucleotide mismatches within the 4 bases corresponding to the 3 inch end of the reverse primer. These mismatches appeared to account for the non-reactivity of the earlier primers towards these viruses.",,"Yoshii, M.;Kaku, Y.;Murakami, Y.;Shimizu, M.;Kato, K.;Ikeda, H.",2004.0,,,0
2372,Molecular and serological epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) on a remote island in western Japan: An impact of JEV migration across the East China Sea,"Background: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). About 1-10 cases with severe central nervous system symptoms have been reported in Japan every year. To clarify the mechanism of maintenance of JEV, the present study examined pigs for serological evidence of JEV infection and isolated JEV strains from pigs and mosquitoes in Isahaya City (Isahaya) and Goto City (Goto) in the Goto Islands in the Nagasaki Prefecture from 2008 to 2014. Results: Serological examination of pigs showed the increase of IgM seropositivity against JEV in July or August and was maintained every year until October or November in both Isahaya and Goto. From 2001 to 2014, 47 JEV strains were isolated in Nagasaki, including the isolates in this study, and they belonged to genotype 1. 34 of the isolated strains were from pigs in Isahaya and were classified into six subclusters (1-A-1, 1- A-2, 1-A-3, 1-A-4, 1-A-5 and 1-A-9). Thirteen strains were isolated from pigs and mosquitoes in Goto and classified into three subclusters (1-A-5 (2008); 1-A-1 (2009); and 1-A-2). In subcluster 1-A-2, three distinct monophyletic subgroups, 1-A-2-2 (2010), 1-A-2-3 (2011), and 1-A-2-1 (2013, 2014), appeared in Goto . Conclusions: These data strongly suggest that the occurrence of JEV in Goto appears to depend on the frequent introduction of JEV from outside the island, and this pattern differs from what has been observed on subtropical islands in the East China Sea such as Okinawa and Taiwan the same populations of JEV (1-A-7 (1998-2008) in Okinawa; genotype 3 (until 2012) in Taiwan) have been maintained over a long period of time.",,"Yoshikawa, A.;Nabeshima, T.;Inoue, S.;Agoh, M.;Morita, K.",2016.0,,10.1186/s41182-016-0010-0,0
2373,"Molecular epidemiology of coxsackievirus A6 derived from hand, foot and mouth disease in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017","Coxsackievirus (CV)-A6 has been the leading cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Japan since 2011. In Fukuoka, CV-A6-associated HFMD caused epidemics in 2013, 2015, and 2017. This article reports the genetic characteristics of total viral CV-A6 protein 1 (VP1) derived from patients with HFMD in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. CV-A6 was detected in 105 out of 280 clinical specimens, and the entire VP1 sequences could be analyzed for 90 out of the 105 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CV-A6 strains were classified in clade A and divided into subclade A3 or subclade A4. Each subclass strain carried amino acid substitutions in the putative DE and GH loops of VP1, and no amino acid substitutions were identified as deleterious to protein function. No significant difference was found in clinical symptoms between the genetic subclasses in statistical analyses. In summary, this study clarified the genetic diversity of CV-A6 in Fukuoka from 2013 to 2017. The emergence of the CV-A6 strains was deduced into new subclades based on the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene, which can cause CV-A6-associated divided HFMD epidemics about every 2 years.",,"Yoshitomi, H.;Ashizuka, Y.;Ichihara, S.;Nakamura, T.;Nakamura, A.;Kobayashi, T.;Kajiwara, J.",2018.0,,10.1002/jmv.25250,0

2375,Isolation and genetic characterization of avian H1N1 and novel resortant H1N2 porcine influenza viruses in China,"Because pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses, they have been suggested as intermediate hosts or mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses by reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. In this study, we reported avian H1N1 and novel resistant H1N2 porcine influenza viruses in China. Homology and phylogenetic analyzes showed that H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) closely resembled avian H1N1 viruses and appeared to be descended from European swine H1N1 viruses, first reported in China; and the two H1N2 viruses (A/swine/Shanghai/1/07 and A/swine/Guangxi/13/06) were novel resortant H1N2 influenza viruses containing genes from classical swine (HA, NP, M and NS), des Human (NA and PB1) and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages suggesting that reassortment between human, avian and swine influenza viruses had occurred in pigs in China and led to the generation of new viruses. The isolation of the avian-like H1N1 influenza virus, derived from the European swine H1N1 viruses, particularly the emergence of two new resortant H1N2 influenza viruses, provides further evidence that pigs serve as intermediate hosts or ""mixing vessels"" and monitor the swine flu virus in China should be given high priority. © 2009.",,"Yu, H.;Zhang, P.

2376,Genetic Diversity of H9N2 Swine Influenza Viruses in China: A Potential Threat to Human Health?,"Pandemic strains of influenza A virus can arise through genetic rearrangement between viruses from different hosts. Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and have been proposed as intermediate hosts or mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses by reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. In this study, we summarize and report for the first time the coexistence of 10 (AJ) genotypes in pigs in China by analyzing the eight genes of 28 porcine H9N2 viruses isolated in China between 1998 and 2007. Porcine H9N2 viruses in genotypes A and B were fully derived from Y280-like and Shanghai/F/98-like viruses, respectively, suggesting that there was interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses from bird to swine in China. The other eight genotype (CJ) viruses could be doubly reassorted viruses, in which six genotype (EJ) viruses 1-4 possessed H5-like gene segments, indicating that they were reassortants of H9 and H5 viruses. In conclusion, the genetic diversity of H9N2 swine influenza viruses in China provides further evidence that transmission of H9N2 viruses between birds and swine has occurred and to the generation of new reassortant viruses through genetic reassortment with swine H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Therefore, these H9N2 swine influenza viruses could pose a potential threat to human health, and further surveillance of swine flu virus in China is of great importance. © 2010 Elsevier BV",,"Yu, H.;Zhou, Y.

2377,Further evidence of infection of pigs with H1N1 human-like influenza virus in China,"Classical swine and avian-like H1N1 influenza viruses have been commonly reported in swine populations worldwide, but human-like H1N1 swine viruses have occasionally been reported. In 2006, a human-like H1N1 swine virus (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) was isolated from pigs in Guangdong province, which was first reported in China. To obtain further evidence for infection of swine with H1N1 humanlike influenza viruses, we analyzed eight gene segments from three porcine H1N1 humanlike viruses (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06, A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A /swine/Henan/01/06) isolated in China. All eight genes of the three viruses are highly homologous to recent (circa 2000) or early (1980s) human H1N1 influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that A/Swine/Guangdong/96/06 was directly derived from about 2000 human H1N1 influenza viruses, while A/Swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/Swine/Henan/01/06 to be human descendants appeared H1N1 viruses circulating in the 1980s. The seroprevalence of our isolate (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) confirmed the presence of H1N1 human-like virus in pigs in China. The presence of these influenza viruses, particularly older viruses (A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06), indicates that human-like H1N1 influenza viruses can remain invariant in swine for long periods of time, and offers this is evidence that pigs serve as a reservoir of older influenza viruses for human pandemics. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.",,"Yu, H.;Zhou, Y.

To better understand the spectrum of viruses present in pigs, we used the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX high-throughput sequencing platform to sequence stool samples from healthy pigs. Results. Total nucleic acid was extracted from stool samples from healthy piglets and randomly amplified. The amplified materials were pooled and processed using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The raw sequences were unwrapped from the barcode and then processed through a standardized bioinformatics pipeline. The unique reads (348, 70, and 13) had limited resemblance to known astroviruses, bocaviruses, and parechoviruses. Specific primers were synthesized to determine the prevalence of the viruses in healthy piglets. Our results indicate extremely high positivity rates. Conclusions: Several new astroviruses, bocaviruses and ljungan-like viruses were identified in stool samples from healthy pigs. Isolation rates for the new viruses were high.

The complete genome of the virus is 6832 bp and encodes a predicted polyprotein of 2132 amino acids most similar to Ljungan virus (32% identity). A similar virus belonging to a new genus of Picornaviridae called swine Pasivirus 1 (SPaV-1) was reported at the time of writing this article. Sequence analysis revealed that PLV-CHN and SPAV1 shared 82% nucleotide identity and 89% amino acid identity. Further genomic and phylogenetic analysis indicated that both SPAV1 and PLV-CHN share similar genomic features and belong to the same new genus Picornaviridae. A total of 36 (20.0%) stool specimens from 180 healthy piglets were positive for PLV-CHN by RT-PCR, while no stool specimens from 100 healthy children and 100 children with diarrhea, and no CSF specimens from 196 children suspected of having viral encephalitis, were positive for the virus. However, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using recombinant PLV-CHN-VP1 polypeptide as antigen showed a high seroprevalence of 63.5% in the healthy population. Antibody positivity rates grouped by age showed that the majority of children under the age of 12 were infected with the virus. It has been suggested that PLV-CHN, SPAV1, or an as yet uncharacterized virus can infect humans early in life. Therefore, investigating the role of this novel virus is crucial. © 2013 Yu et al.",,"Yu, J. M.;Li, X. Y.;Ao, Y. Y.;Li, L. L.;Liu, N.;Li, J. S.;Duan, Z. J.",2013.0,,10.1371/journal.pone.0070137,0

The full-length cloned segment A contains 3259 nucleotides comprising two partially overlapping open-reading fragments (ORFs) ORF1 and ORF2 flanked by 5' and 3' non-coding regions. These strains shared high sequence identity with each other, either at the nucleotide or deduced amino acid level. Strains HZ2 and JD1 were closely related to two attenuated strains, CEF94 and P2, while ZJ2000 was closely related to two other virulent strains, Cu-1 and Harbin. Four amino acid substitutions at positions 253, 279, 284 and 330 were also observed in these three strains, a feature common to attenuated and most virulent strains. Two major hydrophilic peaks were conserved in the three strains; however, there are two amino acid substitutions at positions 280 (N to S) and 290 (M to L) in the second small hydrophilic peak for all three strains that could have a critical impact on antigenicity. In the virulent strain JZ2000, two amino acid substitutions near the VP2-VP4 site were identified that may be involved in increasing the virulence of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these three Chinese strains are most closely related to some European virulent strains but distinct from highly virulent infectious bursal virus and variant strains.",,"Yu, L.;Li, J.

We isolated a novel pseudorabies virus (PRV) named HNX strain from the brain of aborted fetuses to diagnose the disease. To reveal the genomic organization and to characterize the HNX strain, the complete genomes of the HNX and the Fa strain, an isolate in the 1960s, were sequenced and analyzed. The genomic size of the HNX and Fa strains was 142,294 and 141,930 nt, respectively, with corresponding G+C contents of 73.56 and 73.70%. The two strains had 70 open reading frames throughout. In addition, a comparative genomic analysis between HNX and Bartha strains was performed to understand the possible cause of the immune failure. The major virulence-associated genes of the HNX strain had minor alterations, while the glycoprotein B and glycoprotein C genes of the HNX strain had 73 mutations; the homology at the entire genomic level between HNX and Bartha strains was 90.6%. A genome-wide comparison between HNX and Fa strains showed that the strains shared approximately 96.4% homology and were grouped in a separate Chinese isolate group; The two strains are also removed from the isolates from other countries. Similarity diagrams and boats-scanning analysis of whole genome sequences of nine PRV strains, including HNX and Fa, four new Chinese strains and three traditional reference strains, showed that non-recombinant events occurred in the HNX strain.

2382,Influenza H7N9 and H9N2 viruses: coexistence in poultry associated with human H7N9 infection and genomic features,"Recently, avian influenza virus A of the new H7N9 reassortant subtype was found to cause severe respiratory infections in humans in China. Live poultry markets have been suggested as the sites of human H7N9 infection sources based on the exposure history of the cases and sequence similarities between virus isolates. To investigate the role of live poultry markets in the emergence of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental samples from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, next using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput -Generational Sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified samples positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental samples from markets contained highly mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2, and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (n=31) were all negative for H9N2 virus by real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses.

2383,Emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N9,"The novel avian influenza virus H7N9 (AIV) has been shown to cause serious respiratory infections in humans in China. Here we examined poultry samples from live bird markets associated with human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2 and N9). Subsequently, the AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9 and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analyzes showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Muscovy Duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1) belonging to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus is derived from the human infectious A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to those of other H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 virus strains. The virus contained the PQRERRRKR/GL motif at the HA cleavage site, which is characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs. Receptor binding experiments showed that the virus binds α-2,3-sialic acid but not α-2,6-sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus derived from the H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes.

2386,"Hepatitis E virus: food, aquatic and zoonotic transmission","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, primarily via aquatic, foodborne, and zoonotic transmission routes. HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae and comprises four known genotypes (1-4), at least two new putative genotypes of mammalian HEV, and a pending genus of avian HEV. HEVs of genotypes 1 and 2 affect only humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and are responsible for sporadic and autochthonous infections in humans as well as in several other animal species worldwide. HEV has an ever-expanding host range and has been identified in numerous animal species. Pigs serve as a reservoir species for HEV transmission to humans; However, it is likely that other animal species also act as reservoirs. HEV poses an important public health concern, as cases of disease are definitely associated with handling infected pigs, consumption of raw and undercooked animal meat, and contamination of drinking or irrigation water with animal manure. Infectious HEV has been identified in numerous sources of concern, including animal feces, wastewater, inadequately treated water, contaminated shellfish and produce, and animal meat. Many aspects of HEV pathogenesis, replication and immunological responses remain unknown as HEV is an extremely understudied but important human pathogen. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of HEV transmission pathways with a focus on dietary and environmental sources and the prevalence of HEV in animal species with zoonotic potential in humans. © 2013 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,"Yugo, D.

Rumen virophage (RVP) genomes encode a typical virophage major capsid protein, ATPase and protease combined with a protein-primed Polinton-type family B DNA polymerase. The RVP genomes appear to be linear molecules with terminal inverted repeats. Thus, the RVP appear to represent virophage-Polinton hybrids likely capable of producing infectious virions.

The specificity of this cross-reactivity was demonstrated by absorbance using purified viral proteins, viral lysates and infected cell extracts. The data strongly suggest that the cross-reacting epitope(s) designated CE differ from those responsible for cross-reactions between the major gag proteins of HTLV-I, HTLV-II and STLV- I and between those of BLV and HTLV are responsible - I have previously reported. The prevalence of antibodies to CE was low, even in infected hosts with high titers to other epitopes present in the major gag proteins of the homologous viruses. CE was not detected in any of the other C- or D-type retroviruses or lentiviruses examined.

APMV-1 is the causative agent of Newcastle disease and the virus is associated with disease in a wide range of bird species. Isolates of pigeon Newcastle disease virus (NDV) have also been classified as pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1). Matrix protein gene sequences for PPMV-1 isolates phylogenetically clustered together as a group relative to isolates from other species. However, there were also isolates from pigeons or pigeons that grouped with APMV-1 isolates from other species. This indicates that PPMV-1 may circulate among Columbidae members as a distinct lineage, but that these bird species may harbor other NDV strains as well. Of particular interest was a pigeon isolate from Europe that had an aberrant fusion protein cleavage site and was phylogenetically a distant member between the two major groups of APMV-1 isolates.",,"Zanetti, F.;RodrÃ­guez, M.;King, D.

2395,Phylogeography and phylodynamics of European genotype 3 hepatitis E virus,"Hepatitis E virus is divided into four genotypes that have distinct geographic and host distributions. The main cause of sporadic autochthonous acute type E hepatitis in developed countries is genotype 3, which is distributed worldwide and widely affects pigs. The aim of this study was to hypothesize the origin and global routes of spread of this genotype by reconstructing the spatial and temporal dynamics of 208 HEV genotype 3 ORF-2 sequences (from public databases) localized in different geographic areas have been isolated. The evolutionary rates, time of most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs), epidemic growth, and phylogeography of HEV-3 were jointly estimated using a MCMC-Bayes method for only European subtypes (HEV-3e and 3f) and clade B derived from the European subtype 3c and all Asian subtypes (3a, 3b and 3d) that share a common ancestor that most likely existed in Asia in the 1920s. All North American isolates belonged to the Asian subtype 3a. Based on our time-scaled phylogeographic reconstruction, we hypothesize that HEV, after originating in the early 1800s in Europe, reached Asia in the first decades of the 1900 and then migrated to the Americas, probably in the 1970s to 1980s.

2396,New Ecological Aspects of Hantavirus Infection: A Paradigm Shift and a Prevention Challenge - A Review,"In the last few decades, despite intensive research and extraordinary efforts of modern medicine to contain and eradicate infectious diseases, a considerable number of previously unknown or underestimated pathogens have become fundamental health threats to the human population. Almost all incidents caused by such emerging pathogens could be attributed to pathogens that are zoonotic or have expanded their host range and crossed species boundaries. Many different factors influence a pathogen's status, going unnoticed or evolving into a global threat. The adaptability of an infectious agent to changing environmental conditions and variations in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, social and health status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between pathogen and host. Hantaviruses are among the emerging pathogens that have attracted increasing attention in recent decades. These viruses are members of the Bunyaviridae family and are classified in a separate genus known as Hantavirus. Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus serotypes predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by renal failure, bleeding, and shock. In the recent past, many hantavirus isolates have been identified and classified in previously unaffected geographic regions in the New World (North, Central, and South America) with characteristics affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing acute pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of America at the beginning of the 10th decade of the last century have fundamentally changed our knowledge of the occurrence of the hantavirus-specific clinical picture, mortality, origin and transmission route in humans. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first identified in the Four Corners region of the United States in 1993 and had a mortality rate of more than 50%. Although the causative virus was first named in connection with the geographic name of its region of outbreak, analysis of the individual viruses suggests that the causative virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and was consequently named Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are thought to share a long period of co-evolution with certain rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes is usually consistent with the relatedness between their respective hosts. There are no known diseases associated with hantavirus infection in rodents, underscoring the friendly virus-host relationship that has evolved through mutual interaction over hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the main reservoir, antibodies to hantavirus are also present in domestic and wild animals such as cats, dogs, pigs, cattle and deer. Domestic animals and rodents live together in a similar habitat. Therefore, transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to domestic animals appears to be possible if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of cohabiting domestic animals have sufficient viral receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely accidental infection of species other than rodents, such as humans, turns hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogens, drawing attention to this virus group, its ecology, and evolution to save the human population from a serious health risk. Much more studies on the impact of non-natural hosts on hantavirus ecology are needed to understand the direction hantavirus evolution might take. At a minimum, pets that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans, especially in areas known to be highly endemic hantavirus regions, need to be screened extensively. Any transmission of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other, often accidental, hosts is accompanied by a change in ecology, a change in environment, a modulation of numerous factors likely to affect the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment puts altered evolutionary pressures on the virus, forcing it to adapt and likely adopt a form that is much more dangerous to other host species than the original one. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Zeier, M.;Handermann, M.;Bahr, U.;Rensch, B.;MÃ¼ller, S.;Kehm, R.;Muranyi, W.;Darai, G.",2005.0,,10.1007/s11262-004-5625-2,0

The comparison of the sequences of six American and eleven German BEV isolates with published BEV sequences revealed the need to revise the taxonomy of these viruses. Molecular data show that the bovine enteroviruses consist of two clusters (designated BEV-A and -B) with two and three geno/serotypes, respectively. While the low amino acid identity of the capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for distinguishing genotypes/serotypes, the BEV clusters putatively representing species differ in the sequence identity of all viral proteins. In addition, characteristic lengths of (i) the capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D, (ii) the 2C protein and (iii) the 3'' untranslated region are observed. The BEVs can be distinguished from the other enteroviruses by sequence identity and unique features of the 5'' untranslated region, ie a conserved second leaf clover and characteristic RNA structures of the internal ribosome entry site. Phylogenetically, the porcine enteroviruses are the closest relatives of the bovine enteroviruses.

2399,Application of genome sequence information to classify bovine enteroviruses: the importance of 5' and 3' untranslated regions,"The comparative genomics of viruses in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies is well established. Previous nucleic acid sequence analyzes have shown that enteroviruses and rhinoviruses of the family Picornaviridae share a similar 5'-nontranslated region (NTR) structure that differs significantly from the 5'-NTR of cardiovirus, aphthovirus, hepatovirus, and echovirus 22 (tentatively parechovirus) 1 ). Available nucleotide sequence information of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses, bovine enteroviruses and rhinoviruses was compared and correlated with previous knowledge obtained after analysis of the coding and noncoding regions of the genome. As a result, the 5' and 3' NTRs of all three virus groups are characterized by group-specific nucleotide sequences. With a focus on bovine enterovirus (BEV) serotypes, unique features were observed in all secondary structures of the NTRs. These features clearly distinguish BEVs from human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Concerning the 5'-NTR, the most notable feature is an insertion of approximately 110 nucleotides between the putative trefoil structure at the very 5' end of the viral genome and the IRES element. This insertion was made for BEV I and :! demonstrated. and has a predicted folding pattern very similar to the 5' trefoil structure. A stem loop of this second trefoil is nearly identical to the 3CD(pro) binding domain of rhinoviral 5' clovers. It has also been shown that the IRES elements and the 3'-NTRs of both enteroviruses and rhinoviruses have group-specific features that differ significantly from the corresponding genomic regions of BEV. These results indicate that bovine enteroviruses occupy an exceptional taxonomic position alongside the established genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. Within the enterovirus and rhinovirus genera, the existence of virus clusters representing subgenera has previously been suggested. While the 5' NTRs of the four human enterovirus clusters fall into two groups, all four clusters have distinctive secondary structures at the 3' NTR, supporting the concept of enterovirus clusters. The existence of two virus clusters has been confirmed for rhinoviruses.",,"Zell, R.;Stelzner, A.",1997.0,,10.1016/s0168-1702(97)00096-8,0

Therefore, we performed high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome analysis to identify functional miRNAs to elucidate the possible mechanism of REV-CEF interaction. A total of 50 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified. Then target genes were predicted from DEmiRNAs and identified from transcriptome profile results. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment was performed to analyze the identified target genes of miRNAs, which showed that metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis were the most closely related pathways involved in the infection of REV. We analyzed cell cycle-related genes, which suggested that the cyclinD1-CDK6 complex played an important role in regulating the transition of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase during REV infection. Fluorescence microscopic identification showed that REV inhibited CEF apoptosis, consistent with transcriptome results. A new miRNA named Novel-72 was found, KEGG analysis was performed to predict the biological function of its target genes, which showed that these target genes were significantly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway and promoted cell cycle and cell growth during REV infection .

An average of 5.5 different viruses were shed in piglets suffering from diarrhea, and one piglet was actually co-infected with 11 different viruses. On the other hand, healthy piglets excrete an average of 3.2 different viruses. Compared to samples from healthy piglets, co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhea samples, suggesting a correlation with incidence of diarrhea in piglets.

2404,Identification and characterization of a novel rodent bocavirus from different rodent species in China,"Members of the genus Bocaparvovirus are closely related to human health and have a broad host range. The different hosts increase the possibility of crossing species barriers, which is a feature of emerging viruses. Among mammalian hosts, rodents are generally recognized as important reservoirs of emerging viruses. Here, rodent samples from six provinces and autonomous regions of China (Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan) were used to study the prevalence and spread of bocaparvovirus. Using next-generation sequencing, a partial nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene belonging to a putative novel bocaparvovirus was first discovered. A PCR-based screening of the NS1 gene was then performed in 485 rodent samples, finding 106 positive results in seven rodent species (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Apodemus agrarius, Cricetulus barabensis, Rattus flavipectus, Rattus rattus and Rhombomys opimus). Eventually, six nearly full-length genomes and three complete CDS were obtained, and the newly identified bocaparvovirus was tentatively named rodent bocavirus (RoBoV). RoBoV has three ORFs: NS1, NP1 and VP that are characteristic of bocaparvoviruses. Phylogenetic analyzes revealed that the virus most closely related to RoBoV was the porcine bocavirus isolate PBoV-KU14, a member of ungulate bocaparvovirus 4, with 92.1-92.9% amino acid identity in the NS1 protein. Alignments of RoBoV-related sequences showed that RoBoV isolates could be classified into two clades, demonstrating genetic diversity between hosts.

In this article, we choose the frequencies of adjacent words as genomic traits, using VC++ programming to analyze the evolution of the 8 segments of the H1N1 virus. As a result, we found that PB2 genes and PA genes of these three isolated viruses were derived from North American avian influenza virus, PB1 genes were from human seasonal influenza virus, and HA genes, NS genes and NP genes were from North American classical swine influenza A virus. The NA segments and M segments were from European swine influenza virus.",,"Zhang, F.;Guo, X.;Cheng, W.;Wang, Y.;Zhang, S.",2010.0,,,0

We compared the sequence to those of other coxsackie B viruses, coxsackievirus A9, poliovirus and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV). The genes encoding the three major capsid proteins are most closely related to those of SVDV, but the 5' and 3' non-coding regions and the P3 gene are more similar than the corresponding regions in the other coxsackie B viruses by SVDV. These observations are considered in light of the antigenic and biochemical relationships between SVDV and CB5.",,"Zhang, G.;Wilsden, L. G.;Knowles, L. N. J.;McCauley, J. W.",1993.0,,,0
2407,Characterization of an Enterovirus species E isolated from naturally infected cattle in China,"Bovine enteroviruses, which belong to the Picornaviridae family, can cause clinical symptoms in cattle and are excreted in the faeces. In this study, a cytolytic virus was isolated from Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells from fecal samples from cattle with severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic intestinal mucosa and initially diagnosed with bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus Ag Point -of-care test (IDEXX, American). Random priming PCR was used to amplify underlying viral sequences and identify the isolated virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolated virus closely matched the EV-E2 species, distinct from other previously isolated Chinese strains. The newly identified virus was named HLJ-3531/2013. We infected the pouting mice with the isolated virus. Reverse transcription PCR, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, serum neutralization (SN) assay and virus isolation from various tissues showed that HLJ-3531/2013 can infect the intestine, liver and lungs of lactating mice. The present work is the first to report the reproduction of clinical symptoms by an isolated virus in an experimental animal infection model and provides a solid basis for the development of the pathogenesis of bovine enteroviruses.",,"Zhang, H.;Liu, H.;Bao, J.;Guo, Y.;Peng, T.;Zhou, P.;Zhang, W.;Ma, B.;Wang, J.;Gao, M.",2014.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.032,0
2408,Genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes and modulation of PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells,"PEDV remains one of the most important swine diseases affecting pigs of all ages. It causes devastating viral enteric diseases in piglets with a high mortality rate, resulting in significant threats and huge economic losses to the pork industry. In this study, a transcriptomic shotgun sequencing method (RNA-Seq) was used to examine gene responses against PEDV infection. A genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed in Vero E6 cells after PEDV infection. The mTOR pathway activator MHY1485 and the inhibitor PP242 were used to study antiviral function. The results showed that IRF3 was significantly upregulated after PEDV infection. Although most of the IFN-regulatory and related genes evaluated in this study were either down-regulated or remained unchanged, IL11 behaved significantly up-regulated, peaking at 16 hpi. Almost 90% of PEDV infections were suppressed in the PP242-pretreated cells, while the opposite effect was observed in the MYH1485-pretreated cells. The results showed that the mTOR signaling pathway played an important role in the antiviral regulation of PEDV in the Vero E6 cells. Future studies will help to better understand the cellular antiviral mechanism against PEDV.",,"Zhang, H.;Liu, Q.;Su, W.;Wang, J.;Sun, Y.;Zhang, J.;Shang, K.;Chen, Z.;Cheng, S.;Wu, H.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.micpath.2018.02.004,0
2409,Porcine bocaviruses: genetic analysis and prevalence in the Chinese swine population,"Among members of the Bocavirus genus, which contain three open reading frames (ORFs) of the Parvovirinae subfamily, porcine bocaviruses (PoBoVs) exhibit the greatest genetic diversity. Based on the classification of the ORF2-encoded viral protein (VP1), the six reported porcine bocaviruses have been classified into four types: PoBoV1 (porcine Boca-like virus or PBoLV), PoBoV2 (porcine parvovirus 4 or PPV4), PoBoV3 (PBoV1/PBoV2) and PoBoV4 (6V/7V), where PoBoV3 and PoBoV4 each have two genotype viruses. All four PoBoV species were detected in the 166 samples collected from pig herds in ten provinces of China in 2010. The recognition rates for PoBoV1-4 were 28 x 9%, 6 x 6%, 19 x 3% and 39 x 7%, respectively. The co-infection combinations with these six porcine bocaviruses in the collected samples were very complex.

2411,"Molecular characterization and seroprevalence in swine of SC0806, a cat que virus isolated from mosquitoes in Sichuan Province, China","The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a very diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Cat que virus (CQV), a virus of the Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae), was first isolated from mosquitoes in 2004 during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric encephalitis in northern Vietnam. We report here the complete genome sequence of SC0806 isolated from mosquitoes (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) in Sichuan Province, China. Consistent with the genomic organization of Simbu serogroup viruses, the SC0806 genome comprises three RNA segments - a large (L) segment (6928 nucleotides) encoding the 2261 amino acid long RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a medium (M ) segment (4481 nucleotides) encoding the 1433 amino acid polyprotein and a small (S) segment (984 nucleotides) encoding a 234 amino acid nucleocapsid protein and a 95 amino acid nonstructural protein. The respective lengths of the 5″ untranslated region (UTR) and 3″ UTR of L, M and S are 56 and 86, 43 and 136 and 44 and 238 nucleotides. Sequence comparisons (nucleotides and deduced amino acids) and phylogenetic analysis revealed that SC0806 was closely related to the reported Vietnam isolate CQV. This is the first time CQV has been isolated in Sichuan Province, China. Anti-SC0806 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies were found in pigs reared locally, suggesting that CQV has cycled naturally in the region.

We have developed and applied a method for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) from cell culture-derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixes each containing 2 different PRRSV isolates and 51 clinical samples (19 sera, 16 lungs and 16 buccal fluids) with different PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation ( 24-plexed) and sequencing. Complete genomic sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissue with Ct ≤ 21 and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. When mixed with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them and preserve their respective genomic sequences. In mixtures containing 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), sequence reads with nucleotide ambiguity were observed at numerous sites, indicating mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences could only be separated if 1 isolate identity and sequence were known in the mixture. The NGS approach described here offers the prospect of high-throughput sequencing and could be adapted to routine workflows in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, although further improvement in sequencing results from clinical samples with higher Ct values remains to be explored.",,"Zhang, J.;Zheng, Y.;Xia, X.

2413,Insights into the response of male hepatocellular Leghorn cells to avian adenovirus serotype 4 infection by transcriptome analysis,"Avian adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), a member of the Aviadenovirus genus of the Adenoviridae family, causes hepatitis hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in chickens. It causes up to 80% mortality in 3-6 week old broilers and poses a significant threat to the poultry industry. However, the specific host responses to the virus are not well understood. To better understand the interactions between the host and FAdV-4 and to study the pathogenesis of this virus, high-throughput RNA-seq technology was performed on Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells at 12, 24, and 48 h after FAdV-4 infection . We identified a total of 7000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were enriched in a variety of biological processes and signaling pathways using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Following FAdV-4 infection, several immune-related signaling pathways were activated, including toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. The transcription data were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. The expression profiles of 10 genes involved in FAdV-4 infected chicken liver, including TLR2A, TLR3, TLR5, MyD88, IL12B, IL15, IL18, CCL20, TNFRSF21 and CD30, were consistent with RNA-seq profiles. By transfecting small interfering RNA into LMH cells, our results confirmed that MyD88 mediated FAdV-4-induced inflammation. To our knowledge, this was the first study to use transcriptome analysis to examine host responses to FAdV-4 infection. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of FAdV-4 pathogenesis and host-FAdV-4 interaction.",,"Zhang, J.;Zou, Z.;Huang, K.;Lin, X.;Chen, H.;Jin, M.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.12.007,0

Many molecular and serological studies have reported the prevalence and genotypic characteristics of HEV in humans and animals worldwide. However, the genotypic characterization of this virus in Tibetan pigs is very limited. Therefore, we wanted to study the genotype of HEV prevalent in Tibetan pigs in China. For this purpose, 253 bile samples from Tibetan pigs (free range animals) were collected from different slaughterhouses in the period 2017-2018 and then tested for HEV RNA by RT-nPCR. A total of 11 of 253 (4.35%) specimens tested were positive for HEV RNA.

2417,Identification and characterization of microRNA in lung tissue from pigs with variable susceptibility to PCV2 infection,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the leading cause of postweaning multisystem wasting syndrome (PMWS) and other PCV-associated diseases. According to our previous RNA sequencing analysis, differences in susceptibility to PCV2 infection depended on genetic differences between Laiwu (LW) and Yorkshire × Landrace (YL) pigs, but on cellular microRNA (miRNA), which is differentially expressed between the LW and YL pigs before and after PCV2 infection have yet to be determined. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the abundance and differential expression of miRNA in lung tissues of PCV2-infected and PCV2-uninfected LW and YL pigs. A total of 295 known and 95 novel miRNAs were identified, and 23 known and 25 novel miRNAs became significantly different in the PCV2-infected vs. PCV2-uninfected LW pigs and/or the PCV2-infected vs. PCV2-uninfected YL pigs expressed. The expression levels of ssc-miR-122, ssc-miR-192, ssc-miR-451, ssc-miR-486 and ssc-miR-504 were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Analysis of the potential targets of the four upregulated miRNAs (ie, ssc-miR-122, ssc-miR-192, ssc-miR-451, and ssc-miR-486) identified pathways and genes that may be important in disease resistance. Among the upregulated miRNAs, ssc-miR-122 can repress protein expression and viral DNA replication of PCV2, and downregulate expression of activated T cell nuclear factor 5 (NFAT5) and aminopeptidase puromycin sensitive (NPEPPS) binding to their 3″ untranslated region (3rd ″UTR) in PK15 cells. Therefore, ssc-miR-122 can indirectly suppress PCV2 infection by targeting genes related to the host's immune system, such as NFAT5 and NPEPPS.",,"Zhang, P.;Wang, L.;Li, Y.;Jiang, P.;Wang, Y.;Wang, P.;Kang, L.;Wang, Y.;Sun, Y.;Jiang, Y.",2018.0,,10.1186/s13567-018-0512-3,0
2418,"Characterization and full genome sequence analysis of a novel virulent Siphoviridae phage against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis in Xinjiang, China","Bovine mastitis is one of the most costly diseases in dairy cows worldwide. It can be caused by over 150 different microorganisms, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most commonly isolated and a major pathogen responsible for severe economic losses in the dairy industry. Although antibiotic therapy is the most common, alternative treatments are required due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Using phages to control pathogens is a promising tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Primarily using high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and our proposed phage termini identification method, we isolated and characterized a novel virulent phage, designated vB_SauS_IMEP5, from manure used by dairy farms in Shihezi, Xinjiang, China for use as a biological pest control agent Staphylococcus aureus infections. Its latency was about 30 minutes and its burst size was about 272 PFU/cell. The phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 survives in a wide pH range between 3 and 12. A 20-minute treatment at 70 °C can inactivate the phage. Morphological analysis of vB_SauS_IMEP5 revealed that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 is morphologically similar to phages in the Siphoviridae family. Among our tested multiplicities of infection (MOIs), the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of this phage was determined to be 0.001, suggesting that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 has high bacteriolytic potential and good efficiency in reducing bacterial growth. The complete genome of IME-P5 is a 44,677 bp linear double-stranded DNA with a G+C content of 34.26% containing 69 putative ORFs. The termini of the genome were determined with next-generation sequencing data using our previously proposed termini identification method, suggesting that this phage has non-redundant termini with 9nt 3″ protruding cohesive ends. The genomic and proteomic properties of IMEP5 indicate that this phage does not belong to any of the previously recognized Siphoviridae Staphylococcus phage groups, suggesting the creation of a new lineage and thus expanding the knowledge of Staphylococcus phage diversity. An N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase gene and several conserved genes have been predicted, while no virulence or antibiotic resistance genes have been identified. This study isolated and characterized a new S. aureus phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 and our results suggest that this phage may potentially be used as a therapeutic or prophylactic candidate against S. aureus infection.",,"Zhang, Q.;Xing, S.;Sun, Q.;Pei, G.;Cheng, S.;Liu, Y.;An, X.;Zhang, X.;Qu, Y.;Tong, Y.",2017.0,,10.1007/s11262-017-1445-z,0

2421,Transcript profiling identifies early response genes against FMD infection in PK-15 cells,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that causes enormous economic losses worldwide. Although the protection that vaccination offers is limited during early infection, it is recognized as the best way to prevent FMD outbreaks. In addition, the mechanism of early host responses to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) infection remains unclear. In our study, a pig kidney cell line (PK-15) was used as a cell model to elucidate the mechanism of pigs' early responses to FMD infection. Four untreated control cells and four FMDV-treated PK-15 cells were sequenced using RNA-seq technology and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyzed. The results showed that 1212 DEGs were in the FMDV-infected PK-15 cells, including 914 up-regulated and 298 down-regulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways were significantly enriched with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, NF-kappaB and the chemokine signaling pathways. To verify the results of the DEGs, 30 immune-related DEGs (19 upregulated and 11 downregulated) were selected for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) verification. The results showed that RT-qPCR measured genes showed a similar pattern as the RNA-seq analyses. Based on a bioinformatic analysis, we found during early infection with FMD that a number of cytokines such as interleukins (IL6), chemokines (CXCL2, CCL20 and CCL4) and transcription factors (ZFP36, FOS, NFKBIA, ZBTB3, ZNF503, ZNF283, dymeclin (DYM) and orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)) were involved in the fight between FMD and the host. Combined with their features and functions, we propose inflammation as the key early mechanism by which the host responds to FMD infection. These data provide an additional panel of candidate genes for deciphering the mechanisms of a host's early response to FMD infection.",,"Zhang, T.;Chen, H.;Qi, L.;Zhang, J.;Wu, R.;Zhang, Y.;Sun, Y.",2018.0,07 11,,0
2422,Effects of PrPC on the biological processes of DF-1 cells and RNA-seq based analysis of differential genes,"Revealing the effects of PrPC on cell biological processes and on gene expression. We established stable DF-1 (PrPC-knockdown (KD)) cells and combined with DF-1 (wt) and DF-1 (PrPC-overexpression (OE)) cells that we had previously established, we examined the Effect of chicken PrPC (PrPC) on the processes of DF-1 cells. Then, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology and bioinformatics, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these cells. The results show that DF-1 (PrPC-KD) are significantly reduced compared to DF-1 (wt) and DF-1 (PrPC-Scramble) in terms of adhesion, proliferation, colony formation rate and cell number of colonies, scratch wounds Healing rate, cell number of invasion and migration, S-phase cell populations, but apoptosis rate and G1-phase cell populations are significantly increased. Conversely, all of these features are opposite in DF-1 (PrPC-OE). In addition, compared to DF-1 (wt), we found that a total of 1055 DE genes are present between DF-1 (PrPC-KD) and DF-1 (PrPC-OE) cells. After Go and Pathway accumulation analysis, we know that these DEGs are significantly enriched in cells, cell parts, cellular processes and metabolic pathways. In short, we found that PrPC can promote processes of DF-1 cells except apoptosis. In addition, PrPC is involved in focal adhesion, cancer, ribosomes, metabolic pathways, etc., and PrPC overexpression can promote amebiasis pathway, but its down-regulation can promote serotonergic synapse pathway. However, the details remain unknown and that would be our next research.",,"Zhang, T. L.;Wan, X. R.;Wu, R.;Wang, C.",2018.0,Oct,,0
2423,Evolution and variation of the influenza A virus H3 gene and interaction between hosts,"Objective: Continuous mutations in the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene create new antigenic strains that cause annual epidemics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolutionary trend of the H3 gene over a long period of time. Methods: 1842 H3 HA1 nucleotide strains from different hosts were pooled for analysis. A two-step clustering procedure was used to classify tribes into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the clustering results. The rate of evolution in lineages has been estimated in the future. Results: The tree structure revealed three lineages: horse/canine, human/porcine, and avian. As a single tribe, the human-pig lineage consisted mostly of human tribes, and other large branches appeared in recent years. The tree topology showed no evidence that pigs influenced the main evolutionary bias of human H3 strains. The rate of evolution of H3 strains varied between lineages. We observed that the rate in the human line decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. Conclusion: We concluded that human H3 gene variation was associated with pig strains but independent of others, including avian strains. The rate of evolution of human H3 strains seems to have been declining in recent years, while the reasons for the rate change need to be further explored. Copyright © 2007 S.

Antibodies against HEV and HEV RNA have been detected in some Chinese populations and groups of pigs, but only a few other domestic animals. In this study, to investigate HEV prevalence, we tested sera from 788 pigs, 100 cows, 50 goats, 49 horses, 101 domestic dogs, 105 chickens, 47 ducks, and 45 pigeons in eastern China for anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG). . We also tested 50% of pig sera, all sera from other domestic animals and 13 human sera from Shanghai positive for anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) on HEV RNA using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that 82.5% (222/269) of sows, 53.9% (104/193) of 4-6 month old pigs, 63.4% (168/265) of 1-3 month old pigs Pigs, 55.7% (34/61) of slaughter pigs, 24% (12/50) of goats, 16.3% (8/49) of horses, 17.8% (21/101) of pet dogs, 6% (6/100) of cows, 12.8% (6/47) of ducks, 4.4% (2/45) of pigeons and 1.9% (2/105) of chickens were positive for anti-HEV IgG The inhibition test confirmed infection with HEV or HEV-like viruses in these domestic animals except pigeons and chickens. From the sera we isolated 18 porcine HEV strains, one horse HEV strain and two human HEV strains. Sequence analysis showed that the horse HEV isolate and one porcine isolate belonged to genotype 3. The other isolates belonged to genotype 4. The two human isolates were phylogenetically closely related to eight of the pig isolates. In short, the presence of anti-HEV antibodies has been confirmed in several species of domestic animals in east China, and HEV RNA has been identified in pigs, humans and horses.

2428,Virome comparisons in wildly diseased and healthy captive giant pandas,"Background: The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an endangered herbivore living wild in central China. Viral infections have become a potential health threat to these vulnerable animals, however there is limited information on these infections. Methods: Using a viral metagenomic approach, we examined viruses in feces, nasopharyngeal secretions, blood, and various tissues of a wild giant panda that died of an unknown disease, a healthy wild giant panda, and 46 healthy captive animals. Results: The previously uncharacterized complete or nearly complete genomes of four viruses from three genera in the family Papillomaviridae, six viruses from a proposed new genus in the Picornaviridae (Aimelvirus), two unclassified viruses related to posaviruses in the order Picornaviridae, 19 anelloviruses in four different clades of the Anelloviridae family, four putative circoviruses and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described Genomoviridae family were sequenced. Numerous insect viral sequences related to the families Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iridoviridae, Baculoviridae, Polydnaviridae, and the subfamily Densovirinae, and sequences of plant viruses related to the families Tombusviridae, Partitiviridae, Secoviridae, Geminiviridae, Luteoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae reflect the diet of giant pandas reflected ; Genus Umbravirus, Alphaflexiviridae and Phycodnaviridae were also detected in stool samples. A small number of insect virus sequences have also been detected in the nasopharyngeal secretions of healthy giant pandas and lung tissue of dead wild giant pandas. Although the virus families present in the sick giant panda were also detected in the healthy panda, a higher proportion of papillomaviruses, picornaviruses and anelloviruses were detected in the diseased panda. Conclusion: This viral survey advances our understanding of eukaryotic viruses in giant pandas and provides a basis for comparison to viruses detected in future infectious disease outbreaks. The similar virus families detected in diseased and healthy giant pandas indicate that these viruses cause commensal infections in most immunocompetent animals.",,"Zhang, W.;Yang, S. X.;Shan, T.

2429,The hemagglutinin/esterase gene of human coronavirus strain OC43: phylogenetic relationships with bovine and mouse coronaviruses and influenza C virus,"The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strain G95 were determined from single-stranded cDNA fragments generated and amplified by reverse transcription of virus-specific mRNAs Polymerase chain reaction. An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as a putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV OC43, while nine of these were present in BRCV G95. 14 cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and at the C-terminus can serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchor domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and influenza C virus share a common origin and that bovine coronaviruses and HCV-OC43 are closely related.",,"Zhang, X.;Kousoulas, K.

The results showed that 104 known miRNAs and 9 novel miRNA candidates were differentially expressed in ST cells after JEV infection. We identified 396 differentially expressed mRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis identified 435 known miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs and 94 new miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs involving miRNAs that inversely correlated with the expression of their predicted target mRNAs. The known miRNAs, which are inversely correlated with their target genes, have been implicated in the biological processes of immunity, cytokine production, inflammation and apoptosis. Selected miRNA-mRNA interactions were validated by a luciferase reporter assay.

2434,"Isolation and characterization of avian influenza A virus H7N9 from people with respiratory diseases in Zhejiang, China","In 2013, novel reassortant influenza A virus (H7N9) of avian origin was reported in China. Through increased surveillance, human infection with the H7N9 virus has been detected for the first time in Zhejiang province. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm infection. Embryonated chicken eggs were used for virus isolation from throat swabs of infected human patients. The H7N9 isolates were first identified by hemagglutination assay and electron microscopy and then used for whole genome sequencing. Bioinformatics software was used to construct the phylogenetic tree and to calculate the mean evolutionary rate of the HA gene in H7Nx and NA in HxN9. Two new H7N9 avian influenza A viruses (A/Zhejiang/1/2013 and A/Zhejiang/2/2013) were isolated from the positive infection cases. Substitutions were found in both Zhejiang isolates and identified as human viruses. All phylogenetic results indicated that the new reassortant in H7N9 originated from viruses that infected birds. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed a mean evolution rate of the HA gene in H7NX of 5.74E-3 (95% highest posterior density: 3.8218E-3 to 7.7873E-3), while the NA gene was 2.243 showed E-3 (4,378E-4 to 3.79E-3) substitutions per nucleotide site per year.

Most patients were infants under 5 years of age and there was an apparent peak at onset of the disease. From 28 hospitalized patients, 23 stool specimens and 6 throat swab specimens were collected for enterovirus isolation, and 15 enteroviruses were isolated, 9 were identified as human enterovirus 71 (HEV71, the isolation rate is 31.03%), and 1 was identified as coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). After the comprehensive analysis of the clinical manifestation, epidemiological data and laboratory results, this outbreak was probably mainly caused by HEV71. The variability at the nucleotide acid and amino acid levels among 9 HEV71 was relatively low and the homology was more than 99.4% and 99.0%, respectively, showing that this outbreak was caused by only one viral transmission chain. Phylogenetic analysis of 9 HEV71 strains isolated during this outbreak revealed that they all belonged to the C4 subgenotype, which has been continuously circulating in mainland China since its first reported occurrence in the city of Shenzhen in 1998.

2436,The potential of the human immune system to evolve broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies: implications for vaccine development,"OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: The development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing human HIV-1 antibodies (bnAbs) remains a challenging goal. Extensive studies of HIV-1 have revealed various strategies that the virus employs to evade host immune surveillance. Here we examined the human antibody gene repertoire of uninfected and HIV-1 infected individuals at the genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA level by deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequency of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs). METHODS: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1 infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deeply sequenced and the sequences analyzed using the IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action). The frequency of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries was determined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in terms of heavy and light chain V gene lineage than the cDNA libraries, suggesting that the human gDNA antibody gene pertoires have greater potential than the cDNA repertoires for development of HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of kappa and lambda heavy and light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in the human antibody gene repertoire. However, we found relatively high frequencies of heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions that used the same V genes and had the same CDR3 lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs, regardless of the use of the (D)J -gens. B cells bearing B cell receptors of such kappa and lambda heavy and light chain variable regions can be stimulated to induce HIV-1 bnAbs.

2438,[Research on construction of ovine lung adenoma virus pEGFP-C1/exJSRV-env and induction of malignant transformation in NIH3T3],"This study aims to construct a eukaryotic expression system for the envelope gene of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, monitor its localization in 293T cells, and investigate the potential to induce malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells. The complete cDNA of the envelope gene of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (exJSRV-env) was amplified by RT-PCR from the extract of a naturally infected sheep lung. The clone of the target gene was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression system pEGFP-C1 and validated by PCR, restriction endonuclease and sequencing. A bioinformatic analysis regarding biological function and cellular localization of exJSRV-env was also performed. The recombinant clone of exJSRV-env was transfected into 293T cells and NIH3T3 cells by Lipofectamine LTX. Expression and cell localization in 293T cells were validated by confocal microscopy. The soft agar colony formation assay was used to test anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3. DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion with Kpn I and Hind III showed the correct construction of the recombinant plasmid, which was named pEGFP-C1/exJSRV-env. Amino acid sequence alignment of exJSRV-env with reference sequences revealed 85%-100% homogeneity. A YRNM motif unique to exogenous viruses was discovered on the cytoplasmic tail of the envelope gene. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that our clone of exJSRV-env was closely clustered with pathogenic exogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses. Fluorescence microscopy showed a typical membrane localization of the exJSRV env protein. NIH3T3 cells transfected with exJSRV-env lost contact inhibition and acquired the ability to form colonies in soft agar. This study demonstrated that the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus coat protein can induce malignant transformation of the mouse fibroblast cell NIH3T3.

In FPDM, the methyl-sensitive HpaII and methyl-insensitive MspI restriction enzymes were employed to achieve DNA cleavage, followed by incorporation of fluorescent dCMP into the enzyme cleavage products by polymerase chain elongation, yielding an FP ratio between HpaII and MspI - restricted preparations as a measure of methylation. FPDM provided stable estimates of the methylation level of submicrograms of lambda or human DNA and a 255 bp DNA segment containing a unique HpaII/MspI restriction site, consistent with and more accurate than determination by gel electrophoresis.

2441,The unfolded protein response induced by Tembusu virus infection,"BACKGROUND: Tembusu virus (TMUV), belonging to the genus Flavivirus, causes reduced egg production and neurological problems in poultry. Flavivirus replication depends on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress, which leads to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an important signaling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved in viral pathogenesis and innate immunity involved. However, the mechanism of TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically examined the three UPR signaling pathways in TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that the expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 was upregulated during TMUV infection. We then showed that TMUV activates the PERK pathway early in infection, leading to upregulation of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP, with CHOP induction resulting in caspase-3 activation. We also found that the IRE1 pathway is activated, leading to splicing of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and increased expression of p58IPK. Finally, we observed increased expression of ATF6 and activity of ER stress-response elements, suggesting stimulation of ATF6 signaling. Furthermore, activation of the ATF6 signaling pathway correlated with induction of the downstream chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57 and PDI. UPR activity was also observed by the marked increase in GRP78 and sXBP1 levels in TMUV-infected DF-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that TMUV infection-induced ER stress activates three branches of the UPR, and these results lay the foundation for elucidating the pathogenesis of TMUV and understanding the inherent mechanism of TMUV infection as well as the host response.",,"Zhao, D.;Yang, J.;Han, K.;Liu, Q.;Wang, H.;Liu, Y.;Huang, X.;Zhang, L.;Li, Y.",2019.0,,10.1186/s12917-019-1781-4,0
2442,Transcriptomic analysis of porcine PBMCs in response to FMD infection,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a major zoonotic infectious disease. It has an important economic impact around the world. It is also a significant threat to food security. The molecular mechanism of FMD infection is still largely unclear. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against infectious diseases. The systematic analysis of the host immune response to an infection plays an important role in understanding the pathogenesis of an infection. However, there are few reports on the effect of immune regulation on viral replication in the virus-host cell interaction. High-throughput RNA-seq technology as a powerful and efficient means of transcript analysis offers new insights into the FMDV study. In this study, RNA was extracted from O-subtype FMDV infected porcine PBMCs at 4 dpi. A total of 29942658 and 31452917 Illumina read pairs were obtained from the uninfected (NI) group and the infected (I) group, respectively. The clean bases for all samples are 3.61 G (NI group) and 3.79 G (I group), respectively. The NI and I group clean reads mapped to pig genome data were 47195073 (81.82%) and 46556714 (76.85%), respectively. Most clean reads were distributed in the exon region, followed by the intron region and the intergenic region. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using edgeR software. 451 genes were differentially expressed between infected and uninfected groups. According to the comparative analysis, more genes were downregulated in the uninfected samples than in those infected with FMD. 66 out of 451 genes were downregulated, 385 out of 451 genes were upregulated after FMD infection. For functional classification and signaling pathway analysis, among 17741 composite unigens, there are 349 genes that are different genes of GO notes. In addition, 49 genes were downregulated, 300 genes were upregulated associated with the GO term. 1621 have been successfully annotated by GO assignments belonging to one or more of three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. According to KEGG analysis, the main pathway has been presented, including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, cell cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Some important DE genes related to immune processes and signaling pathways were analyzed and quantified by RT-PCR. This is the first systematic transcriptome analysis of FMD-infected porcine PBMCs.

Results: Epidemiology revealed that H6N2 viruses were the most frequently detected influenza subtypes in live bird markets in eastern China from 2002 to 2008, but from 2009 they were replaced by new H6N6 viruses. We phylogenetically and antigenically analyzed 42 H6 viruses isolated mainly from domestic ducks in eastern China between 2002 and 2010. Surprisingly, none of these isolates were grouped with the previously described H6N2 viruses belonging to a single H6N2 virus lineage with a single gene constellation in domestic ducks in southern China from 2000-2005. Two distinct hemagglutinin lineages were identified and all were frequently reassorted with multiple virus subtypes from the natural gene pool, but few reassortants were persistent or widespread. Conclusions: Five subtypes of H6 influenza viruses (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, and H6N8) co-circulated in eastern China, constituting a significant portion of the natural influenza virus reservoir in domestic ducks, and significant viral rearrangement is still occurring in this species.

2446,Characterization of the VP1 sequence of coxsackievirus A16 isolates by the Bayesian evolution method,"Background: Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), one of the most important etiopathological causes of pediatric hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide, is believed to have caused several deaths. Uncovering the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of CV-A16 across time and space is central to understanding its outbreak potential. Methods: In this study, we isolated six CV-A16 strains in Jilin Province, China, and constructed a Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree for the CV-A16 VP1 gene according to the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using 708 strains from the GenBank with epidemiological information. The evolutionary characteristics of the CV-A16 VP1 gene were also dynamically analyzed by Bayesian skyline diagram. Results: All identified CV-A16 strains could be divided into five main genogroups, denoted GI-GV. GIV and GV have been circulating together in China since 2007, and the epidemic strain CV-A16 isolated in Jilin Province, China can be classified as GIV-3. The CV-A16 genogroups recently circulating in China have shared the same ancestor since 2007. The genetic diversity of the CV-A16 VP1 gene shows a continuous increase since the mid-1990s, with genetic diversity increasing sharply in 1997 and 2007, peaking in 2007. Post 2010, there was very little genetic diversity. The evolution rate of the CV-A16 VP1 gene was 6,656E-3 substitutions per site per year.

2447,Metagenomic analysis of Jinding duck faecal virome,"Ducks play an important role in the transmission and maintenance of mammalian viruses in nature and are a reservoir host for many animal viruses. We analyzed the faecal virome of four isolated strains of ducks (A, B, C, and D) using metagenomic analysis. The faeces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal virus families. The percentages of RNA virus reads compared to total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01% (C), and 67.49% (D) and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA virus readings were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae and other low frequency virus families.

2448,Sequence analyzes of the representative strain of avian nephritis virus predominant in China in healthy chicken flocks,"Avian nephritis virus (ANV), a member of the Astroviridae family, has been associated with acute nephritis in chickens. Cases of ARF infection have been recorded in Japan and in several European countries. However, such studies have never been conducted in China. Therefore, this study isolated ARF in Chinese chicken flocks. ANV RNA was detected in 2009 by reverse transcription PCR in stool samples from healthy laying hens in Sichuan Province, China. Of the 192 stool samples collected, 32.3% (62/192) were positive for ARF infection. The entire genome of ANV Sichuan54, the first representative Chinese strain, was 6941 nucleotides in length, including the 5-inch untranslated region, three open reading frames (ORFs), a 3-inch UTR, and a poly(A) tail . Comparative and phylogenetic analyzes based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (ORF1b) showed that the majority of ARF studies were more closely related to the US ARF strain (DQ324827-324836) than to G-4260 (AB033998). © 2011 American Association of Avian Pathologists.",,"Zhao, W.;Hua, X.

Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) was detected by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-nPCR) and sequenced within the 5″ untranslated region of the genome. Approximately 43% (202 samples) were BVDV positive. Of the positive samples, 24 were selected for further sequencing, sequence comparison, and phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogenetic reconstructions showed that these isolates clustered into either BVDV1b (18 samples) or BVDV1c (six samples) subgenotypes. None of the sequenced isolates showed a cytopathic effect in culture. In contrast to previously published studies in Chinese cattle, no BVDV2 genotypes were detected. These results show that the predominant subgenotypes in Xinjiang are BVDV1b and BVDV1c.

However, the role of exosomal miRNAs in the molecular mechanism of the synergistic infection of the two viruses remains unknown. RESULTS: In this study, exosomal RNAs from CEF cells infected with ALV-J, REV, or both at the optimal synergistic time of infection were analyzed using Illumina RNA deep sequencing. A total of 54 (23 upregulated and 31 downregulated) and 16 (7 upregulated and 9 downregulated) miRNAs were identified by comparing co-infection with two viruses, single-infected ALV-J and REV, respectively. In addition, five key miRNAs including miR-184-3p, miR-146a-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-3538, and miR-155 were validated by qRT-PCR in both exosomes and CEF cells. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis of miRNA target genes revealed that the five differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in virus-vector interaction, oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, and cell growth.

Here we report the discovery of the first sicinivirus isolate (designated strain JSY) of picornaviruses from commercial laying hens in mainland China using a viral metagenomics technique. This sicinivirus isolate, which contains a total genome of 9,797 nucleotides (nt) not including the poly(A) tail, possesses one of the largest picornavirus genomes reported to date, but has only 88.83% and 82.78% amino acid sequence identity with that of ChPV1 100C (KF979332) or sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001 (NC-023861). The full 939 nt 50UTR of the isolate strain contains at least twelve stem loop domains (AL), representing the highest group of loops reported within the sicinivirus genus. The conserved ""dumbbell-like"" structure was also present in the 272 nt 30 UTR of the isolate as that in the 30 UTR of sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001. The 8,586 nt open reading frame encodes a 2,862 amino acid precursor polyprotein. In addition, sicinivirus infection could be widespread in commercial chicken farms in Yancheng region of Jiangsu province, as evidenced by all stool samples tested from three different farms, which were positive (17/17) for sicinivirus detection.

2458,Features of codon usage bias in two regions downstream of foot-and-mouth disease virus initiation codons,"The mechanism of the use of alternative two AUGs in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) is still unknown to date. In this study, the codon usage bias (CUB) characteristics of the region between the two AUGs (the region-La) and the equally sized region behind the second AUG (the region-Lb) were found in 94 different FMDV RNA sequences below Analyzed using Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values. The results showed that many negative CUB codons were preferentially used in the -La region. There were two conserved residues (Thr and Cys) at the 4th and 6th residue positions of the La region. The conserved residues had a general tendency to choose synonymous codons with negative CUB. Although most positions in the -La region did not contain conserved residues, many positions tended to use negative CUB codons in this region. Among these codons, the majority belonged to the amino acids containing synonymous codons with clearly positive and negative CUB, including Asp, Val, Ile, Leu, Thr, Ala, Ser, Asn, and Arg. The presence of many negative CUB codons in the region -La might affect the efficiency of the first AUG selection. The phylogenetic incongruence of the region-La and the region-Lb implied that intertypic recombination played an important role in the evolution of FMD. Furthermore, due to the existence of more positions with positive CUB and a more widespread phylogenetic incongruity in region-Lb than in region-La, a probable relationship between CUB grade and evolution of the two target regions was revealed. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",,"Zhou, J.

2459,Global pairwise RNA interaction landscapes reveal core features of protein recognition,"RNA-protein interactions pervade biology. Transcription, translation, and splicing all depend on the recognition of structured RNA elements by RNA-binding proteins. Models of RNA-protein interactions are generally limited to short linear motifs and structures, as extensive sequence sampling is required to access longer elements. Here we develop an integrated approach that calculates global pairwise interaction scores from in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing. We study four RNA-binding proteins from phages, viruses and humans. Our approach uncovers regulatory motifs, distinguishes between regulated and unregulated RNAs within their native genomic context, and correctly predicts the impact of mutational events on binding activity. We design binding elements that enhance binding activity in cells and derive mutational pathways revealing permissive versus disruptive evolutionary pathways between regulated motifs. These coupling landscapes are broadly applicable for the discovery and characterization of protein-RNA recognition at single nucleotide resolution.",,"Zhou, Q.;Kunder, N.;De la Paz, J. A.;Lasley, A.

To combat the disease and protect pigs, various vaccines have been developed, including the early generation of the lapinized Rovac strain and the later development of the ""Chinese"" (C-strain) strain. However, details on the development of these vaccines are lost in history. To examine the phylogenetic relationship between Rovac and other lapinized vaccines, this study determined the genome sequence of Rovac, which comprised 12,304 nucleotides, specifically with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) containing a 13 nucleotide insertion. The near-complete genome of the Russian vaccine strain LK-VNIVViM was determined by next-generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Whole genome phylogenetic analysis revealed a closer relationship of the Rovac strain to the Russian LK-VNIVViM, CS strain and its derivative RUCSFPLUM (genotype 1.2) and not to the C strain (genotype 1.1). Furthermore, it showed a lineage role of the LK-VNIVViM in relation to the CS strain and RUCSFPLUM.

Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test stool samples and compare prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus type, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Pigs with diarrhea had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the rearing and finisher groups. Rotavirus was mainly detected in diarrheal pigs, while PCV2 was more frequently detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheal pigs, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical.

2462,MicroRNA expression profiling in alveolar macrophages of native Chinese Tongcheng pigs infected with PRRSV in vivo,"Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS), caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), is one of the most serious infectious diseases in the swine industry worldwide. Indigenous Chinese Tongcheng (TC) pigs have reportedly exhibited strong resistance to PRRSV infection. The miRNA expression profiles of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from control TC pigs and those infected with PRRSV in vivo were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to examine infection-induced changes. A total of 182 known miRNAs, including 101 miRNA-5p and 81 miRNA-3p, were identified with 23 up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 25 down-regulated DEmiRNAs. Analysis of gene ontology showed that predicted target genes for the DEmiRNAs were enriched for immune response, transcriptional regulation, and cell death. Integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed that down-regulated methylation-related genes (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were targeted by five up-regulated DEmiRNAs. In addition, 35 miRNA pairs (70 miRNAs) were co-expressed after PRRSV infection, and six pairs were differentially co-expressed.

In recent years, the number of new viruses within the family has exploded, demonstrating high genetic diversity and a broad host range. In this report, we describe two additional circoviruses identified in bats in Yunnan and Heilongjiang provinces in China. Full genome sequencing has revealed that these bat-associated circoviruses (bat ACV) should be classified as a new species within the genus Circovirus based on the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) demarcation criteria. The most notable result is the novel finding of a 21–28 nt polythymidine (poly-T) tract in the 3″ terminal intergenic region of bat ACV isolates from Heilongjiang Province. To understand its role in viral replication, a wild-type bat ACV and a mutant version deleted for the entire poly-T were rescued by constructing infectious clones. The in vitro replication comparison showed that the poly-T is not essential for viral replication. The identification of additional ACV isolates from bats and the study of their biological properties will be the main task in the future to understand the potential role of bats in the transmission of circoviruses to terrestrial mammals and humans.",,"Zhu, A.;Jiang, T.;Hu, T.;Mi, S.;Zhao, Z.;Zhang, F.;Feng, J.;Fan, Q.;He, B.;Tu, C.",2018.0,,10.1016/j.virusres.2018.04.012,0
2465,Comparative genomic analysis identifies structural features of CRISPR-Cas systems in Riemerella anatipestifer,"Background: Infection with Riemerella anatipestifer is a contagious disease that has caused significant economic losses in the duck industry worldwide. This study attempted to characterize CRISPR-Cas systems in the pathogen Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer). The CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes, and CRISPR-cas loci are abundant in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. However, the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems remain to be elucidated due to the limited availability of genomic data. Results: To identify the structure and components associated with CRISPR-Cas systems in R. anatipestifer, we performed comparative genomic analyzes of CRISPR-Cas systems in 25 R. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that most of the analyzed R. anatipestifer strains (20/25) have two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). CRISPR1 has been shown to be flanked on one side by cas genes, while CRISPR2 has been orphaned. The other strains analyzed contained only one locus, either CRISPR1 or CRISPR2. The length and content of the consensus direct repeat sequences as well as the length of the spacer sequences associated with the two loci differed from each other. Only three cas genes (cas1, cas2 and cas9) were located upstream of CRISPR1. It was also shown that CRISPR1 is flanked by a 107 bp putative leader sequence and a 16 nt anti-repeat sequence. In combination with the analysis of the similarity in spacer organization and phylogenetic tree of R. anatipestifer strains, CRISPR arrays can be divided into different subgroups. Diversity in spacer organization was observed in the same subgroup. In general, spacer organization was more different in CRISPR1 than in CRISPR2. In addition, only 8% of the spacers (13/153) were homologous to phage or plasmid sequences. The Cas operon flanking CRISPR1 was observed to be relatively conserved based on multiple sequence alignments of Cas amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic analysis associated with Cas9 showed that the Cas9 sequence of R. anatipestifer was closely related to that of Bacteroides fragilis and formed part of the subtype II-C subcluster. Conclusions: Our data revealed for the first time the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems. Elucidating structural features of the CRISPR-Cas system may aid in studying the specific mechanism related to CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in R. anatipestifer.",,"Zhu, D.

Results: From 493 pigs, 266 cattle, 93 sheep, 798 deer, 369 chickens and 197 horse sera, 427 (86.61%), 122 (45.86%), 7 (7.53%), 348 (43.61 %), 18 (4.88%). ) and 31 (15.74%) were positive for anti-HEV antibodies, and 5 of the 493 pig sera were positive for HEV RNA. The homology of the 5 HEV RNA positive clones was 91.2%-99.1%, and that of 348 PS in the ORF2 domain to HEV genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 was 77.8%-82, 3%, 77.2%-78.1%, 77.2%-99.1%, and 85.2%-95.2%, respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence of HEV was observed in different animals in the Changchun area. The prevalence in pigs was much higher than in other animals. The porcine predominant HEV gene sequence showed high homology to that of HEV-4 isolated from sporadic human HE cases.

2467,Origins and evolutionary dynamics of the H3N2 canine influenza virus,"UNTAGGED: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are mainly maintained in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections from avian IAVs to mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in canine populations in China and South Korea, and possibly Thailand. The emergence of CIV offers new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 full-length IAV genomes along with all publicly available CIV genomes since their first isolation up to 2013. We show that CIV may have arisen as early as 1999 as a result of segment reorganization between Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that may have played a role in the emergence of CIV, some of which have not previously been identified in other species changes. CIV evolves more slowly than H3N2 human influenza viruses, and viral phylogenies exhibit a geographic structure compatible with high levels of local transmission. We discovered several intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reassortment events, including acquisition of the NS segment of an H5N1 avian influenza virus that had previously been overlooked. Taken together, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required for avian viruses to become established in mammals, and also underscore the potential role of dogs as intermediate hosts from which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential might originate, particularly with an estimated one Dog population of ~700 million. IMPORTANT: Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as past pandemics have been caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to leaps between species, and therefore understanding the evolutionary processes that shape the genomes of the influenza A virus is key to elucidating the mechanisms underlying virus emergence. A canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We have reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated in both Eurasian and North American bird lineages. We also identified the mutations that may have been responsible for the interspecies jump. Finally, we provide evidence for multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is of concern as there is a large global canine population to which humans are highly exposed.",,"Zhu, H.;Hughes, J.;Murcia, P. R.",2015.0,May,,0

Analysis of putative HA cleavage sites showed that all four isolates possessed the molecular characteristics (QTRGL for H3N2 virus, PEKASR for H4N6 virus) of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI). Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genomes showed that all four virus isolates belonged to the Eurasian group of influenza viruses. The M gene of the viruses had the highest homology to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses. In addition, co-infection of H3N2 and H4N6 on the same farm was observed. And interestingly, we isolated two subtypes of viruses (H3N2 and H4N6) and their progeny viruses (H3N2) with evidence of genome reassortment from the same farm in which the PB1 and PB2 gene segments of H4N6 replaced those of the H3N2 strain. The results of animal infection experiments showed that all four isolated viruses were weakly pathogenic to chickens and non-pathogenic to mice, consistent with the results of genetic analysis.",,"Zhu, N.;Zhao, J.

2470,Phylogenetic and pathogenetic analysis of Newcastle disease virus isolated from house sparrow (Passer domesticus) living near a poultry farm in southern China,"The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is one of the most widespread wild birds in China. Five strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) have been isolated from house sparrows living near poultry farms in southern China. These isolates were characterized by pathogen assays and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that all NDV isolates except one were velogen and virulent for chickens. These four strains, which are virulent for chickens, have the amino acid sequence 112R/KRQK/RR-F117 in the F0 cleavage site typical of velogenes NDV. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that these isolates belong to genotype VII and are closely related to the strains isolated from NDV outbreaks in chickens since 2000 /LaSota/46). The result of this study proved that house sparrows can transmit the virulent NDV strains and the same genotype of viruses circulating in poultry is present in house sparrows living near poultry farms in southern China. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",,"Zhu, W.;Dong, J.;Xie, Z.;Liu, Q.;Khan, M.

2472,First detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus O/ME-SA/Ind2001 in China,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic to China and is mainly due to the lineage of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) serotype O Mya-98. In recent years, the FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001 lineage has spread from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, which may pose a potential threat to future transregional cattle movements. In this study, we identified the occurrence of FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001 in China; the first time this virus line was found there. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences revealed that this newly identified strain belongs to the O/ME-SA/Ind2001 sublineage d and is closely related to strains causing recent FMD outbreaks in Nepal, Myanmar, Russia and South Korea to have. The results indicate extensive movements of the current O/ME-SA/Ind2001 sublineage d-viruses and provide essential information for an effective national FMD control program in China.",,"Zhu, Z.;Yang, F.;He, J.;Li, J.;Cao, W.;Li, J.;Xia, Y.;Guo, J.;Jin, Y.;Zhang, K.;Zheng, H.;Liu, X.",2018.0,,10.1111/tbed.12895,0
2473,Selected microRNA-192 mutant indicates association with multiple functional genes in bovine cells,"MicroRNAs are involved in many cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development, tumorigenesis and immune regulation. In this study, miR192 was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) when MDBK cells were challenged with Escherichia coli. bta-miR-192 dysfunctional cells were established using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Finally, bta-miR-192 mutant cells were screened for differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The results showed that miR192 decreased significantly in cells exposed to E. coli F18ac and E. coli K88ac. The RNA-seq results showed that 1673 differentially expressed transcripts were identified; 890 genes were upregulated and 775 genes were downregulated. Using the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, 431 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into 937 Gene Ontology terms. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that 535 genes were involved in 254 pathway terms. Interestingly, most of these DEGs were associated with cancer or infectious disease signaling pathways. When the selected DEGs (n=162) in these signaling pathways containing 120 differential transcripts were cut, 11 DEGs were identified. Subsequently, several genes associated with regulation, cancer or viral infections, such as LEF1, AXIN2, MX1 and FCGR2B, were identified among the DEGs by functional analysis. Furthermore, associations between bta-miR-192 and DEGs were demonstrated by cutting the target genes of bta-miR-192 with the DEGs, indicating that three genes including CBL, DICER1 and TRERF1 were involved in this relationship. These results provided useful guidance for studying the role played by bta-miR-192 in cellular functionality in bovine cells.",,"Zi, C.;Zeng, D.;Zhou, J.;Dai, J.;Jiang, L.;Xue, F.;Jiang, Y.;Li, B.",2018.0,,10.1007/s13258-017-0635-3,0
2474,Evidence of an independent third Usutu virus introduction to Germany,"Usutu virus (USUV) is an arbovirus of the genus Flavivirus that was first introduced into southern Europe about twenty years ago and has caused disease in wild and captive birds. In Germany, USUV was first detected in wild birds, mainly blackbirds (Turdus merula), in the Upper Rhine Valley in the southwest of the country in 2011 and has not spread very far north since then. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the still ongoing USUV epidemic is caused by two different USUV strains, USUV-Germany belonging to USUV Europe 3 lineage and USUV-Bonn belonging to USUV Africa 3 lineage. The two strains were introduced independently. In August 2015, a new USUV strain named USUV-Berlin was isolated in Vero cells from two carcasses of young great gray owls (Strix nebulosa) kept at the Berlin Zoological Garden that had suffered from a hyperacute fatal systemic infection. Both owls carried high USUV genome loads. Full-length USUV genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyzes showed a close relationship to a 2006 sequence derived from the Spanish mosquito. Immunohistochemical antigen detection in organ samples from the owls revealed the typical USUV infection pattern. According to the phylogenetic analysis, USUV-Berlin belongs to the Africa 2 lineage and can thus be distinguished from the other strains circulating in Germany. Repeated finds of various USUV strains indicate more frequent introductions to Central Europe and a higher mobility of this virus than previously assumed.",,"Ziegler, U.;Fast, C.;Eiden, M.;Bock, S.;Schulze, C.;Hoeper, D.;Ochs, A.;Schlieben, P.;Keller, M.;Zielke, D.

2475,Phylogenetic analysis of the rabies virus N-coding region in Lithuanian rabies isolates,"Rabies infections in wild and domestic animals are a well-known problem in Lithuania, but only one canine rabies virus isolate sequence (1992) from Lithuania was used in the phylogenetic analysis of European rabies virus. The aim of this work was to determine nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences and to genetically characterize the rabies virus isolates to learn which virus group (biotype) is circulating in reservoir species in Lithuania. Nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences from classical rabies virus isolates from different parts of Lithuania were found to be closely related, showing 97.7 to 100% nucleotide identity and could be lineaged with 100% bootstrap support. All 12 sequences of raccoon dog, red fox, canine and sable rabies viruses showed 97.7-99.0% identity to previously published sequences from eastern parts of Poland, Estonia, Finland and northeastern part of Russia. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Lithuanian strains belong to the Northeast European (NEE) group of rabies virus.",,"Zienius, D.;Sajute, K.;Zilinskas, H.;Stankevicius, A.",2009.0,Jun,,0
2476,"Genetic analysis revealed that LX4 genotype strains of infectious avian bronchitis virus have become predominant in Sichuan region, China in recent years","Between 2008 and 2010, 19 strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in Sichuan Province, China. The S1 genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the 19 isolates and 37 IBV reference strains can be divided into eight genotypes. Although Taiwan I type, Massachusetts type and proventriculitis type IBV were isolated, most of the isolates were of the LX4 genotype. The homology analysis of the sequences of the S1 genes of the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains revealed that the identity of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the S1 genes between the 15 LX4-type isolates and other IBV strains 71.9-99, 3% and 72.1 was -99.1%, while those of the analyzed LX4-type IBV were 96.0-99.9% and 94.3-99.8%, respectively. The results of this study and other published results in the GenBank database showed that the isolates circulating in Sichuan Province in recent years were mainly of the LX4 genotype, which is the predominant genotype circulating in China in recent years was circulated. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Zou, N.

2477,Molecular characterization and receptor binding specificity of H9N2 avian influenza viruses based on avian environmental surveillance in China between 2013 and 2016,"H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become panzootic and have caused sporadic human cases since 1998. Based on the poultry-related environmental monitoring data in mainland China from 2013 to 2016, a total of 68 representative environmental isolates were selected and systematically further examined. Phylogenetic analyzes showed that Y280-like H9N2 viruses were prevalent between 2013 and 2016 and have acquired several specific amino acid substitutions that may favor avian-mammalian virus transmission. In addition, the viruses have undergone dramatic evolution and rearrangements, resulting in increased genetic diversity or acting as gene contributors to new avian viruses. Receptor binding assays showed that most H9N2 isolates bound to human-type receptors, allowing them to easily cross the species barrier and infect humans efficiently. Our results suggest that H9N2-AIVs prevalent in poultry may pose a serious public health threat.",,"Zou, S.;Zhang, Y.;Li, X.;Bo, H.;Wei, H.;Dong, L.;Yang, L.;Dong, J.;Liu, J.;Shu, Y.;Wang, D.",2019.0,,10.1016/j.virol.2019.01.002,0
2478,Insights into the increasing virulence of swine pandemic influenza virus H1N1/2009,"Pandemic H1N1/2009 viruses have been stabilized in swine herds and some strains show higher pathogenicity than isolates of human origin. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is applied to examine the systemic transcriptome responses of mouse lungs infected with porcine (Jia6/10) and human (LN/09) H1N1/2009 viruses. The transcriptome data indicate that Jia6/10 activates stronger virus sensing signals that play an important role in inducing innate immunity. Most cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes show a higher level of expression in Jia/06-infected groups. Meanwhile, the Jia6/10 virus activates more reactive oxygen species production, which could further promote a higher mutation rate of the virus genome. Overall, our data indicate that the porcine pandemic H1N1/2009 virus elicits a stronger innate immune response and prooxidative stimulation, which may be closely related to the increased pathogenicity.",,"Zou, W.;Chen, D.;Xiong, M.;Zhu, J.;Lin, X.;Wang, L.;Zhang, J.;Chen, L.;Zhang, H.;Chen, H.;Chen, M.;Jin, M.",2013.0,,,0
2479,Genetic analysis of ancient Hungarian avian influenza viruses,"Phylogenetic analysis has been performed on specific genes from 13 avian influenza viruses (AIV) isolated in the 1970s. The viruses originated from the eastern part of Hungary from ducks and guinea fowl with relatively severe respiratory symptoms. In addition to the hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H4, H5, H6, H7 and H10) serologically identified at the time, genetically analyzed neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were identified (Table). Based on the amino acid pattern at the proteolytic cleavage site of HA, it was determined that all H5 and H7 strains belonged to the low pathogenicity (LP) category. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA and NS genes allowed the following epidemiological conclusions. (1) All Hungarian tribes belonged to the Eurasian AIV lineage. (2) H5 strains were members of an ancient European group (Figure 1). The H4 strains (Figure 2) came from three different sources (two from the Far East and one from Europe). (3) The fact that most viruses of the H4 and H5 subtypes were reassortants (some even multiple; Figure 3) suggested that their reservoirs were probably not wild waterfowl but rather domestic ducks. Further studies of ancient viruses would be required to gain more detailed knowledge of the role of these ""artificial"" reservoirs in the maintenance and epidemiology of AIV.",,"Zsofia, S.;Sandor, K.;Istvan, K.;Bela, L.",2008.0,Mar,,0
2480,Molecular epidemiology of rabies: focus on domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) from northern South Africa,Phylogenetic relationships of rabies viruses recovered from black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in northern South Africa were examined to determine whether the black-backed jackal is an emerging conservation host species for rabies in this region. A panel of 123 rabies viruses obtained from the two host species between 1980 and 2006 was characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein gene and the non-coding GL intergenic region. Phylogenetic analysis has delineated a virus cluster specific to black-backed jackals in the western Limpopo spanning a 5-year period. Virus strains associated with domestic dogs are prevalent in densely populated communal areas of northeast Limpopo and south and east Mpumalanga. The data presented in this study demonstrated the likelihood of black-backed jackals being able to suffer cycles of rabies independent of domestic dogs. It is proposed to consider wild rabies control strategies in synergy with domestic animal vaccination for effective rabies control in South Africa. © 2008 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.,,"Zulu, G.

2481,Novel picornavirus associated with avian keratin dysfunction in Alaskan birds,"UNLABELING: Avian keratin disease (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the bird's beak, was first documented in black-capped tit (Poecile atricapillus) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities have appeared in numerous species on all continents. Despite the widespread prevalence of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is not known whether suspected cases of AKD in affected species are causally linked, and the impact of this pathology at the population and community levels is difficult to assess. We applied unbiased next-generation metagenomic sequencing to screen for candidate pathogens in birds affected by AKD. We identified and sequenced the entire coding region of a novel picornavirus, which we call poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected titmouse and 9 controls for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) of the AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9 (22%) of the controls infected with the virus were poecivirus. Two Northwestern crows (Corvus caurinus) and two Red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) with AKD-consistent pathology also tested positive for Poecivirus. We propose that poecivirus is a possible etiological agent of AKD. IMPORTANT: Avian keratin disease (AKD) is an increasingly common disease in wild birds. Characterized by excessive beak growth, this disease was first described in the late 1990s and has spread rapidly both geographically and in terms of affected host species. AKD decreases the host's fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive and its effects on host populations are poorly understood. We found a novel and variant picornavirus in 19/19 AKD-affected chickadees we studied, but only in 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals from 2 other sparrow species showing symptoms consistent with AKD. Our data suggest that this novel picornavirus warrants further investigation as a causative agent of AKD.",,"Zylberberg, M.;Van Hemert, C.;Dumbacher, J. P.;Handel, C. M.;Tihan, T.;DeRisi, J.
